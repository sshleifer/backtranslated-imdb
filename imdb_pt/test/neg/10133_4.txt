Describing this movie is a difficult task. For one thing, it is an over-the-top spookfest vampire, complete with cobwebs, strange music, a hypnotic medallion and of course a casket with a squeaking lid. On the other hand, this is one of the dumbest scripts on this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us "The Bloody Vampire", "Invasion of the Vampires", and "The Vampire" is a sequel to "The Vampire," which I did not see, but it does not matter. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is confused when well-meaning but ill-advised Dr. Marion brings back the impaled body of his vampire foe, the Count Karol de Lavud (I suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires should be some kind of counting.) Dr. Marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some kind of theft to advance their studies doctors, and he hopes to use the vampire's corpse to study phenomena such as the lack of a normal vampire reflex. At which point he holds a mirror to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire's skeleton. ???). Enrique is not satisfied, and seems determined to let go of the events of the vampire. first film as mere fantasy and superstition. "This man was not a vampire ... I admit he liked to drink some blood, but that's all!" he claims. Also confused is the frail Martha, part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!), Who is the object of Henry's affection. Martha narrowly escaped the claws of Lavud in the first film, and apparently Enrique spent a good deal of time "healing his mind" and making her think that everything she experienced was not real. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you were the screenwriter of this movie, you would need a way to make someone stupid enough to take the vampire's stake, right? Well, how about the greedy swindler who helped Marion steal the coffin? After glimpsing Lavud's body, he turns to the expensive-looking brooch the earl is wearing and conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors are not looking. But damn ... he can not remove the brooch because of the stake, so ... you guessed it. De Lavud is on the loose again, this time with grim commotion as his human henchman. <br /> <br /> OK, so of course the vampire is after Martha again, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. At the beginning, they are determined to prove that there is no real vampire, and by the end of the movie they are trying to get the police to put up a bulletin of all points of view "by a man who is dead but still alive" . You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but filmmakers do some nice twists. One of the sets for the movie is a scary wax museum (is there any other type in this type of movie?), Complete with a fully equipped torture chamber ... with torture equipment and REAL execution. The film has a great sense of style, and not just the cobwebs. A truly daunting sequence has De Lavud chasing a victim through a seemingly endless series of streets and alleys, following his progress alongside empty doorless buildings while lighting the scene like a German expressionist nightmare ("Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" seems to be an influence). <br /> <br /> But the rest of the film is juvenile, particularly at the climax of the film. The special effects are pretty coarse even for the year that this was done, and the climactic fight with Lavud in the form of a bat is laughable enough ... but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha would faint and to collapse directly over a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect place to be cut by the blade, which is in danger of falling because the restrictive rope suddenly began to wear out CERTAINLY IN THIS MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts off the frayed rope to scenes of Enrique trying to dodge the rubber stick, basically standing and swinging his arms. It's definitely a time for Ed Wood if there ever was one, especially when Martha seems to relive on her own and gets up screaming as soon as the blade hits. Ufa! What a relief! In terms of kookiness, "The Vampire's Coffin" does not have the madness factor of "The Bloody Vampire" or "Invasion of the Vampires," but fans of such horror movies will appreciate atmospheric photography and the fact that director squeeze some real shivers of this stuff have to "count" for something (haw haw).
