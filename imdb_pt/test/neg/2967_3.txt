There were very few good moments in this movie. Only a few characters were revealed and not very well. There were batch holes large enough to drive a truck. The rhythm crawled like an old man. There were many times when the film never came back to like Coco peeling. What happened to her? How about Garci's sister? Is she better now? What about Leroy? We learned absolutely nothing about it. And the guy on the electronic piano? How about the rich girl who had an abortion? What happened to her? That was an interesting subplot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a good movie and I recommend another musical that was in this movie. LET'S MAKE WARP TIME AGAIN !!!!!!!
