Unfortunately I think this is one of those movies that if you or I were to take to the studio and say, 'Can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have kicked you to death on the spot. However, if a lot of massive Hollywood names say, "look, I imagine a trip to Italy with my companions, what's up?" the studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We started with Ocean's 11 casino boss tracking the thieves who ran away with their money, and then Brad Pitt is fucking Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there are some monstrous ones. in Amsterdam and in Italy and such and such and then everything ends in some way. <br /> <br /> The film, however, includes the most shameful moment in the careers of Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, which is a motion picture. egg yolk. I almost threw up on my lap and I ripped out eyes when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis is clearly wondering when he can leave, and how much will the check. Ah, well, to be fair, I would have done for the money, so I guess I can. 'I really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a no-go, not a Hollywood legend. I think what really bothers me about this movie is not that it's boring and meaningless and it has a terrible story but I think the actors probably had fun doing it! I think all the actor's job is to project emotion out ... I feel like I paid to go to the party, but I had to stay out there in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> See if you like Como, or if you like CZJ or something, but otherwise, take a walk.
