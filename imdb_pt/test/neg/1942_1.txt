This is by far the worst and most stupid show I've ever seen on TV. It is almost physically painful to watch an adult (in his 20s) doing nothing but torturing and mocking his parents who seem to have no idea what kind of acrobatics they are forced to endure by their idiot son and his equally stupid . friends. Of course I know their parents are involved, but I really hate how they always act as if they were caught completely by surprise. It seems totally false. And I really hate the introduction of the show, in which one more voice asks "Bam Margera, what will he think of next?!?!" (I think that's the way it is) and Bam himself replies: "Whatever the f ^ * k I want!" - WOW! Bam is a really great creator - living at home with Mom and Dad! of course the word "f ^ * k" is replaced by a tasteful beep, but we get the message. Bam is the true rebel - at least in his own eyes. Of course Bam and his bunch of idiots target the teen audience, and of course it's an MTV show, but please raise the level a little bit. It is painfully predictable and stupid and therefore nothing but annoying.
