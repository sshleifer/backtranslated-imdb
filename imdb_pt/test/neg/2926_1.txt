I just went to the movies in downtown Prague watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster, I found Holywood's very old-fashioned heroic style. Not because of high-profile stardom that reminds me that most of these starred movies are generally pathetic. But only <br /> <br /> because there are not so many films in my mother tongue in French in a city like Prague. And because I love the Cyrano of Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau. So I decided to write this short review because I think I really do not agree with the mainstream comment on this movie in imdb. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The movie looks like the poster. The characters are as stupid as they look. For a while I thought Adjani would be like a caricature - just a funny character that you can laugh at. No, she is not! For example, when she decides to tell Depardieu that she is the person who murdered the fat man she killed at the beginning of the movie, then come the violins in a pathetic big fat. <br /> <br /> Music that should make you cry and realize that Adajani's character is a deeper person the way she looks. Maybe it was humor on 10th grade, but I'm sorry that my sense of humor is not so loud! If I want to see a funny French movie in World War II I watch La Grande again <br /> <br /> Vadrouille! It's definitely more fun! I also read on imdb that Lemoine is doing a great performance in this movie. I have to say that I've never seen such bad acting! (Well, I've never seen any Ed movie <br /> Wood). However, the film is well filmed with very good <br /> <br /> (very expensive) scenes like that of the Pantheon in the morning <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees settle on a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker, but he does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. He did not have to write the dialogues! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
