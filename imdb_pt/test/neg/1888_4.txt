It is proof that the filmmakers and their financiers treating their audience with contempt is not a new phenomenon, as was done already in 1940 and HOUSE OF Dracula is a great example. You would think about making a movie with Dracula, the werewolf and the Frankenstein monster that the producer would tell the writer to have all three of them appear in one scene. They had a chance with CASA DE FRANKENSTEIN so when they had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with CASA DE Dracula. Losing a chance is a disgrace, losing two cynical money smells doing <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the producers are beyond care. Larry Talbot appears again, despite having died in the previous film, which sums up the cynicism of the franchise. It also shows what a poor script is and we are mistreated by some horrible twists, like Talbot's condition being cured by a special kind of plant that will soften his skull. I'm thinking that screenwriter Edward T Lowe could have his skull softened if that was the kind of thing he invented. Director Erie C Kenton can not improve the script and puts some keys to himself. For example, Talbot is surprised to see Dr. Edelmann take a ride in a stroller, but he does not notice Edelmann climbing a wall and jumping into the castle courtyard. One can not help but think that Talbot's reaction plans were misplaced in the editing phase. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror films, but does not have much career out of them. Maybe it's the fact that he's not a good actor and here he commits the worst kind of acting - being very good. It's not entirely his fault, because all the characters make a horrible dialogue and they're all made of wood, in part because of Kenton's misdirection. <br /> <br /> DRACULA HOUSE feels a million miles from the 1931 James Whale movie and its sequel. of 1935 and would have been a very sad note to finish. But ironically, Universal decided to make yet another film to end its franchise with a horror comedy starring Abbot and Costello.
