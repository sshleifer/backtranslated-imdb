This was done in 2004 for the love of God, what happened to our next generation special effects? What happened to our rude on the edges, but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly horrible, there were one or two that were not bad, but the rest, fine. I could not bear to hear the badly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell wrote this script? Please, never write again! Special effects? Do not even tell me about special effects. CERTAINLY, they might have appeared with green balls of light in the eye sockets. It looks so old and downright ...! Even the easiest thing to do seems real ... the teeth looked so fake and stupid that I almost wiped a tear from my eye in annoyance. Come onnnn I can not believe this was shown to the public!
