A unit of the Delta Force Army, assigned to find a batch of missing Green Berets that are not known to disappear completely, will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was resurrected when archaeologists disturbed his tomb. The Skeleton Man rides a horse and has the ability to push forward and backward using a type of dimensional portal, and appears not to be affected by bullet fire and explosives. The Skeleton-Man's horse leaves no footprints and he can walk behind and around his prey quietly. The view of the film through the Skeleton-Man's eyes looks at its prey with a different color. In other words, he is not apparently human, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, as gray and intense as ever) and his gang of potential commanders stop this threat? For some reason, the Man Skeleton kills employees of a nearby chemical factory. What are the reasons for Skeleton Man to slaughter endless humans? And, why a blind Indian living in the forest do our commands live spared if the Skeleton Man, as a human, killed his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> As completely stupid as it seems. Just unbelievable horrible. This is the kind of film that can cushion the brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets the second billing on Rooker's credits, but is overloaded with a ridiculously underwritten character who leaves the movie early. Rooker deserves better than that. If I were an actor, I would not want that movie on my resume. The Skeleton Man is a rejected Templer Knight from an Ossorio movie. He has a spear that can simply knock down certain people while a woman's head explodes on impact. An arrow shot from the Skeleton-Man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane. For almost 99% of the film, the bullets are fired at the Skeleton-Man and he can enter and exit the portal, and at the end he suddenly becomes vulnerable to attack. Oh, and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man moves freely through the forest from that portal. The movie is written and edited by clowns. Attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced, make really bad decisions throughout this movie. The mind is amazed by this movie. Good for a few laughs, and some bloody scenes make that piece of shit pure as a junk movie.
