If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you'll see that this movie is full of poetic license. Not that it makes much difference, because Errol Flynn was quite generous with the poetic license in the autobiography anyway. No need to worry about spoilers, since there is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> For me, it seems wiser to use the story about a fictional Hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play him, and you would not have to worry about the audience saying things like, "But he did not have a mustache on Captain Blood." Another flaw in this movie is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. This film focuses only on its image of the funster. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the cast struggles with their scripts. Hal Linden is quite like Warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a believable Damita, though Lili Damita does not think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this movie is to forget it and let it drop smoothly. far to oblivion. So what I'm writing this, I can not imagine.
