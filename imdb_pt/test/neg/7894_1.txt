With horrible movies like this being considered, let alone being done, it's pretty easy to see why Hollywood is in serious trouble with bad plots and worst remakes all the time. <br /> <br /> I think the viewer is supposed to. be laughing with your butts on the "black" inner jokes, the "pimped up" look and the "Bling". It's so incredible 'over the top' and so bad that it even surpasses the 'So bad it's funny again' brand and plunged straight to 'totally embarrassing for anyone involved'. <br /> <br /> I'm very, very sorry for every minute I've lost in this. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save the agony, DO NOT watch this. The only reason I give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 was not an option.
