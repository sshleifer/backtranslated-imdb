Now, I watched this when I was hung over on a Sunday and my aunt and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We got stuck on the TV and the passport to Paris had just started. My cousins ​​said they watched Two Of A Kind sometimes and I said they could watch the movie if they wanted to. Since I was not able to get up, I stayed in the living room with them and I ended up watching the movie! I have to say, as a person who has no interest in these types of TV shows or movies, I really enjoyed it ... must have been alcohol lol but I'll admit it would probably only appeal more to girls aged 6 to 13 , but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or a show that you think you will not like, but to laugh, you like it.
