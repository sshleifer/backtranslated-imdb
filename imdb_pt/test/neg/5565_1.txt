After a few mistakes, we are still waiting for the French horror film that critics will certainly defame, but it will launch a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline can not be accused of not being knowledgeable of the genre (he is the editor of a high-class fantasy brand, worked for the legendary Starfix magazine.) But why a scenario that uses EVERY clich√© in the book (except maybe Odious Comic relief)? Why is this so predictable? Even the nods to Argento fail. It's not even a Euro-teen movie like the German "Anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that hardly seem to have any relation to each other and feature MANY orifices. The whole "Celtic" aspect is barely touched. And after a painfully predictable "revitalization", the script offers us a boring and endless pursuit in an underground necropolis that looks bigger than the Parisian catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Same. But even a mother does not. Oh, and the writer Valerio Evangelisti should have a special participation, but I searched in vain for him.
