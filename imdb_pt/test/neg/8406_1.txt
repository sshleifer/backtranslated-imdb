I kept watching because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere. When I arrived ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I'll tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe I will not. Maybe I just mean something is going to happen. The writers had no imagination. This is not even a "B" movie - it's a movie made for TV "B".
