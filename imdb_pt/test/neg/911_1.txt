Rob Lowe must have eaten the whole budget, but I can not blame him for running the money. Even he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Filming, editing, directing, dialogue, sets, makeup, writing, casting (especially the young child psychiatrist and impostor), and the story was only the worst. I've never seen such a horrible movie. Pass this option to any other rental selection, or see yourself shouting bad TV comments. Dead Silent must be silenced all the time.
