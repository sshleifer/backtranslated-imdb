When I saw this movie three years ago, I found it very much exemplified the features found in Singapore's art films: slow motion, with a minimum of plot and dialogue depending on the composition of the film to make it work. At the time, among local filmmakers, the inability to appreciate "Be With Me" is equivalent to "Citizen Kane" or any of Ozu's films. I have no idea how "Be With Me" achieved such wit in Singapore's cinematic consciousness, but I have always felt that Khoo's "12 Storeys" are a better movie, although the last film does not have a director of photography as good as Adrian Tan . , Khoo's DP for "Be With Me." "12 Storeys" has a story that relates best to most Singaporeans and has bite too, something that the gloomy gloom of "Be With Me" lacks. "Be With Me" is basically a trio of little intertwined narratives intertwined in a movie by Khoo and his screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. It is a security guard who falls in love with a girl he sees only from a distance; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of the deaf and blind Teresa Chan. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is beautifully filmed by Tan, using a Varicam camera. The compositions of the film are masterful. The film, almost totally silent, has almost no dialogue. The characters move, not realistically, but almost as if they were models under the guidance of a director, almost always looking at the screen and emulating: or loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately the characters do not act against each other. This type of film has been seen many times: in the films of Tsai Ming-liang, "4:30" by Khoo, protégé Royston Tan, and elsewhere. Unfortunately, its ultra-slowness (essentially less plot) and use of a slow piano soundtrack simply does not appeal to me. Criticizing "Be With Me" seems almost to deny the inspiring story behind it, that of Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf and lives a satisfying life despite all of this, but I fear that this film will not Do a lot for me. I am willing to applaud Chan's steady and courageous gait in life and Tan's impressive cinematography, but for a better approach on the same subject with more flesh (without the two other tedious and disturbing subplots), try "Land of Silence" Werner Herzog and Darkness "(1971).
