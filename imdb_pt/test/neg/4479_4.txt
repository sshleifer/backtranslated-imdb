The only romantic thing about this movie is the pain and the anguish of the novel. If you're hoping that this film adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel follows the infallible formula of earlier films such as "Message in a Bottle," "Nights on Rodanthe," and "A Walk to Remember," think again. No one dies of an accident trying to save another person and the romance here does not transform these characters. If so, this makes them even more unhappy than they were. A soft-spoken Special Forces Army sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum of "GI Joe"), has a memorable two-week adventure on military leave with an impressionable college student, Savannah Curtis ( radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia"), who is spending spring break in South Carolina. Savannah does not drink, she smokes, but she tells John that her head is full of swearing. Inevitably, John and Savannah fall madly in love with each other and launch an interminable exchange of love letters that are sleep inducing by any standard. Tyree is out of the world serving the military in some corner of the world forgotten by God while she is away in college reading her letters in the classroom. As they are getting hot and heavy between them, suicide bombers shoot down planes at the World Trade Center. John reenlists along with his friends on a wave of patriotism, without discussing the option with Savannah. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another disheveled but friendly friend of the Tim family (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial") Whoever has an autistic child without a mother named Alan becomes the object of feeling of Savannah. She is the kind of girl who helps build homes for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. She delays what it seems forever before finally contacting Tyree with the letter of the same name. In fact, she expels him for a man with an illness! Later, she confesses to John that she knew the sound of his voice would have broken her decision to marry Tim, so she did not make that fateful call. Predictably, John is agonizing over Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes two terrorist bullets in the back and ends up in Germany. While all this is happening, Tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin collecting father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger Syndrome. It seems that your father is on his last legs after John leaves the hospital. The female protagonist does not have a bit of respect and her betrayal of Tyree is very low. Tyree, his father and Tyree commander, Keith Robinson, are the only friendly characters in this long-distance epistolary novel. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives new meaning to lethargic love stories. Disgusting!
