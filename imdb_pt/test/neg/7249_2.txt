I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 because it looked interesting (a bit like Ranma, with the idea of ​​someone dragging a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back, and because there was a restricted viewing adhesive. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least honestly maturing story with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> Having watched, I have to ask myself how restricted the adhesive was, since there is almost no foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I do not usually go around waiting for it's when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even anti-religious humor is meek (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all, it's not funny at all - it would be best to just listen to Ray Stevens. "Would Jesus Wear Rolex on His Program of television). This would hardly qualify as PG-13 (not rated), but Blockbuster refuses to allow anyone under 17 to rent it - as if it were pornographic. Any kid can go there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> Yeah, but not like that. <br /> In a way, this worries me - the only thing that could offend people is the idea of ​​suicide in the beginning. If anyone needs to see honestly portrayed suicide films (not this, but better than the Virgin Suicides), they are teenagers. If both films were rated R purely because of the suicidal aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I wrote into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three causes of teenage death (I think it's number 2), so it's likely that most teens have been or will be affected by it. <br /> <br /> Say no to the movie. , Although. 2/10
