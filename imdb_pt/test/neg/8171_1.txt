Two days ago I had a chance to watch this movie on Cable (TV-Asia). I have been very upset since then. The film "Baghban" was very successful in portraying only one side of real life. It is highly partial to parents. Have you ever thought about the other side (children)? There are few parents in this world who only give birth to their children, but do not give correct parental care. I'm a victim of this. Why do you (parents) want to have five children in your life if you are only making Rs 2000 a month? I was made to work in the streets with my brothers. I have no idea how I got the IIT from there. It's been a long time since, but I still can not believe it. Now I'm a research scientist here in the USA. I have provided every need to my parents, along with care for my two brothers who stay with them. They could not provide basic things for us when we were kids. I find this movie very resentful. It is very partial. It hurt my feelings deeply. I strongly urge the producer / director of this film to look at Indian society from another point of view as well and make another film.
