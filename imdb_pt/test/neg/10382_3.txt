This movie did not seem to make sense. The plot developed so many twists in such a short time that it seemed to lose any resemblance to the true plot. There were a lot of wasted conversations and it seemed the writing was hurried and a little too wandering. The exorcism scenes and the possession story began to take second place to the character's stories (which were a little weak to begin with). <br /> <br /> In all, I would say ignore it unless you have rented the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you have never seen before. You're much better off just watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
