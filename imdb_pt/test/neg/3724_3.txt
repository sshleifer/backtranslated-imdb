I do not remember much of this film, except that there was a clear destruction of the lamps. Almost all the fighting scenes included the unnecessary and arbitrary destruction of useful luminaries, even if they were equipped with 70's cylindrical masks, to maintain the definition of time in history. On one occasion, the shrill destruction of the lamp occurs in a domestic fight scene between siblings, both in the living and dining rooms of their mother's home, with fixtures in both rooms being removed. However, the most malicious destruction occurs moments later in a bookmaker and includes but is not limited to the overthrow of an accessory with a ceramic horse head base which is consequently disintegrated and the severe kneading of a cylindrical shadow as one the guy falls again during another punching match. Later, the lamp is also knocked over when the face is struck, causing more damage to the plastic-coated shade. <br /> <br /> Although this film encourages a particularly wasteful attitude towards lamps, it should be borne in mind that lamps, regardless of their cheap construction or heavy appearance, are still valuable for the lighting they provide. However, if you have ever felt the need to indirectly crush a light bulb, I highly recommend this movie.
