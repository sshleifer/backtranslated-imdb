I do not know, but the movie was very much like other movies I've seen. The Ring, the Eye, the Black Water, are all the same to me. Do not get me wrong, it's beautifully done, beautiful camera work, great graphics, but this story is also very common. In the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: the screams, snoring. The characters in the movie also do not react very naturally, moving too slowly, surprised by anything they see. I know some people who love this kind of movie, and if you do, being a well-made movie, I think it does not hurt to watch it. But if you saw the movie that I mentioned above and did not like them then I suggest you do not bother.
