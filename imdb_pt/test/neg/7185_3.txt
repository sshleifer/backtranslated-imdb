I would not give much of the movie to say that there are many, many, many scenes of Lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! Yes. And you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is useless, meaningless and practically ignored by the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with bland people who do bland things. , and the boring person of them all is the young Lucas, who is going blind and needs an operation. You see, he has illusions, terrible delusions! He thinks a murderer is attacking blind women! He walks a lot and acts like an unbearable idiot! <br /> <br /> Patience does not make up for this movie. In the end, the plot and the events are so confusing and lethargic, and it is very difficult to care one way or the other for what any of the nightmare images meant. Nothing is clear, the film moves in the rhythm of a snail, and left me with the same effects of a hangover. Judging by the "Afraid of the Dark", the British do not make thriller movies like the Americans do; they make boring people.
