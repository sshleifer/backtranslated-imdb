I think they reward idiocy today because who invented the concept for this movie was not shot in sight. <br /> <br /> This is an idiotic pleasure. The worst stereotypes of all the ghetto and high school films are dragged and made even more unbearable. Each character in this movie has a sad story, beyond sympathy. Let's pray for a remake in which the entire school is bombed. <br /> <br /> Spoiler *** How does such a rundown school have the internet in the first place?
