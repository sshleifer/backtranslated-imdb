I'm a fan of some holiday movies, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's off the air. Made for National TV Lampoon movies do not do well on TV. This movie is another reason. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of us were excited when it was released, but we also had to face reality ... it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is good as cousin Eddie, but is better in a supporting role than lead. Dana Barron defines the story as the first actor to reprise his role as one of Griswold's children. She is so beautiful, but it does not help at all. <br /> <br /> Why was this movie made? It was probably because NBC recently picked up a few more years of Christmas holiday presentations. There is nothing wrong with acting. It's all in the script. It's not so funny. People need to think before writing things like that. It's a Christmas movie that I do not recommend.
