Wow. I watched One Night at McCool yesterday, and all I can say is, "Wow." <br /> <br /> Here I go. MAJOR SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and meaningless this movie is? I would never tell anyone to watch, unless I was out to inflict pain on them. Anyway, here's a glimpse (or a big chunk) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCool's. He meets a woman named Jewel who convinces him, surprisingly, to have sex with him. Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to steal them and is killed. Randy and his cousin and the detective at the crime scene, everyone falls in love with Jewel. She, being the mascot of stupidity, uses each of these guys to get what she wants, involving a DVD player. Randy hires a murderer to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by his ex-boyfriend's psychopath brother and the killer and Jewel take off. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's it. I left almost nothing out except for a few more sex scenes and an almost pornographic Liv Tyler scene like Jewel wearing a hose to show off her sexuality. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this film? To be honest, I think it was for the producers and directors to show their male impulses. Which I think is absolutely unnecessary and just stupid. When I watch a movie, I want a plot. I want characters. I do not care about the sexy woman exhibiting anything she might have. Something must happen in a movie, for God's sake. This is as bad as the Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It gets even worse. John Goodman is the detective dedicated to being superior. I even wondered why Goodman would play something so outrageously pitiful as this, but then I remembered that he was in The Brother, Where Are You? also. His reputation has dropped a little. Liv Tyler was an incredible actress in The Lord of the Rings series. In this film she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing more than her way. His reputation fell seven or eight steps to me. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed, just SURPRISED that people work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is absolutely bad (having the "YMCA" playing while John Goodman's character is being killed does not fit), the characters are totally unpleasant, the plot is one of the stupidest ever conceived by man, and on top of that, fits in no gender. The closest that comes is pornographic comedy. If it was meant to be funny. What was not. <br /> <br /> I think I'm breathtaking now. But let me just assure you that no one in their right mind would ever want to see this movie. Unless they want Liv Tyler as much as the characters, that is.
