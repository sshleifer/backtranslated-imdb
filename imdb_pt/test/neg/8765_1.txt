This movie was terrible. The acting was horrible. The script was horrible. What was even worse were the outlets and the sound of the camera. Half the time the voices did not match the lips of the actors, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different shades. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to be 50 stories high and probably 30 feet wide. However, when the actor was on top of another shot, they "recreated" the top of the building. The width of the building was reduced to about two and a half meters wide. How could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide? I know the movie was low budget, but it's inexcusable. The film itself just pushed ideas about a "rapture", actually having a plot or point. This reduced the script to mere junk, the characters seemed to be selling ideas on their lines rather than transmitting emotions and moving the movie in one direction. It was a complete waste of time to watch. The film gives Christians a bad name if it's one of the best Christian movies out there.
