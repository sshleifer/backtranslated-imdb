Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They know Robert Redford and he is REALLY rich. He likes Demi, and because he is a gambler, he makes the couple an "indecent proposal": a million dollars for a night with the little woman. <br /> <br /> At this point, you no longer need to watch. of the movie because you can put the details together in your sleep. Of course Demi will accept the offer. If she does not, there is no first half of the movie. Of course this will affect Demi and Woody's marriage. If that does not happen, there is no second half of the movie. And of course everything will be fine by the time the credits are released. If that does not happen, there is no happy ending because of box office. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can say about the INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in a black dress. As for the rest ... The script is incompetent, the amateur direction, the insignificant performances. I suspect that Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject every time the movie is mentioned. Make them - and more importantly yourself - a favor. Unless someone offers you a million ... Miss! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
