Police officer Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") is busy while investigating a serial killer who is leaving parts of the bodies of the people he is murdering at the home of a recently widowed, Tracy (Joanna Pacula). Mike has to find a way to keep bodies from accumulating while he may find love in the process. <br /> <br /> A sense of the 'giallo' films of yesteryear permeates this movie, even knowing who the killer is from the beginning, and the movie contains some good set-pieces (a scene later on set filming at a school for the blind being particularly memorable), but it does not make much sense when everything is said and done as well. All in all, not as good as Bava's previous "Macabre", nor his first two "Demons" movies, but quite nice if you can forgive the movie's twists at the end of the movie. Too bad the Image Entertainment DVD did not have extras of any kind, as I would have been interested in some. <br /> <br /> My Note: C-
