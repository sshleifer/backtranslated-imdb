** SPOILERS MAJOR ** Watchable only for action sequences not the story or acting on it "Nature Unleashed: Fire" has one of the longest and excruciating endings in the history of modern cinema. We have the fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, taking this trio of hysterical motorcyclists to the safety of all the steps of an explosive smokehouse stranding my well! This during a wild forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of the outdoors, did not realize that a mine that is leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around are on fire! <br /> *** SPOILERS OF THIS POINT IN *** All this started some time ago when Jake Ranger in an effort to save the not that Tiny ball miner, Chris Harz aka "The Sherd" , let him slip through his fingers and fall to death in the bottom of the mine pit, or him! Even if we were kept in suspense for anyone setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie, it was no surprise at all that Tiny was to blame! As you'd expect in movies like these, Tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel, as nothing that happened to him, firing blasts and impaling could stop the madman from going crazy. Before the re-appearance of Tiny, or resurrection, Ranger Jake was involved in rescuing the motorcyclists Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in the forest with fires that the reached. Having the habit of knowing everything - Marcus - among motorcyclists things do not go as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus not only eggs in the fancy Chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike along a stack of 10 feet of logs, but have the guy break his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to get Chris out of the air before the fires burn out, just like his fellow motorcyclists! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film Ranger Jake, who has put himself in charge, makes horny after horny in his attempt to save himself and the prisoners and lost in the motorcyclists of the woods! All of this ends up with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mine with the rescue team within a few yards of rescuing them, if they were only in open places where the rescue team could find them! <br /> <br /> Even though it was supposed to be the life of the party, or the movie, Tiny, for all his efforts at being another indestructible super villain, appeared as a man who spent a lot of time in the sun. The makeup work on Tiny was so scandalous that it looked like he threw a pot of spaghetti sauce on his head instead of burning. Ranger Jake seemed a bit naïve or retarded for being so taken over by the dangerous Tiny, always trying to save the furious psychopath who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the part of the Forest Ranger rules. In fact, Ranger Jake actually encouraged Tiny to do both he and the motorcyclists, showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so smart, but because Tiny, despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!
