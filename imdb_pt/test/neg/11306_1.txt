I liked Mr. Magoo's cartoons that I watched as he grew up. And I like the comedic abilities of Leslie Nielson. So, I thought, this marriage should produce a funny child. <br /> <br /> I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. I do not remember a single funny moment. This is one of two or three times (in hundreds of movies over the years) that I wanted my money back. You will leave this film shot down because you will never have that time back to use in a better way. In a comedy, the plot must attract the viewer and serve as a framework for gags. This plot does not make any. Just sort of standing there, panting like a stranded fish.
