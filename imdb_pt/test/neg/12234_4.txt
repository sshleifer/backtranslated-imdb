1st movie review ever! I'll start by saying, "Come on, it was not that bad ... was it?" ... No, it was not so bad. I laughed and laughed enough times through the film so I can not say with my hand in my heart that it was crap. <br /> <br /> It's completely different, this and Epic Movie (epic movie was a bad drug .. doh!). "As well?" people would ask. I'll tell you how. This movie is not so useless, not to mention that stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but being stupid makes it funny) things that happen around and with the characters is really nice in this movie. Not the best around, but hey ... what would you expect - see the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I think when writing a comment, someone should be more objective (my own opinion), but of course it was stupid, it's a movie about "stupid"! Look, I'm not telling you to go watch the movie now or else you missed the century event. What I'm saying is that if you happen to see the movie somewhere, please do not keep an eye on the opening credits. See what it's all about - who knows, you might like it a little. <br /> <br /> I give 4/10 for not being so bad and make me laugh and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
