One of those movies where there are no big twists and you can pretty much predict what's going to happen. Matt dillon was amazing once again but the rest did not play a bigger role as they should have. <br /> <br /> It was exciting at first, but rather slow and predictable at the end. Flicks on that good guy wins, no matter what happens. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you may experience it personally not worth watching. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have reduced the size of a B movie by creating a happy ending.
