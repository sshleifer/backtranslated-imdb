Although it was not a complete waste of time, "Eighteen" was not really all sweet as he pretended to be. Not the ages of the actors are portraying? 18, my ass. McKellen might have appeared in the movie saying he was 30 years old and asking us to believe. Even Michael J. Fox was more believable as a teenager in 'Back to the Future' Parts II and III (okay, maybe not, they're probably equal to credibility.) If you can get past the obvious age gap, you'll either have complete void of acting or simply exaggerating (Paul Anthony's anguish, the moments of Clarence Sponagle's life, and even though I'm in favor of Brendan Fletcher, it's best to just watch him, and more, in "Freddy vs. Jason ") incomprehensible scenes (faster than Britney Spears' wedding, incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate but still have a free hand? I'm guessing this was the writer's fantasy), a (Anthony may be playing someone who is 18 but acts like he was 12 and some weird "john" played so that Anthony Pip's character could save the day ??? there was really a sex scene in front of a baby? all characters questioning sexuality by strange actions / scenes. On the positive side, I liked the voice of Ian McKellen, seeing a (rarely well portrayed) heterosexual / gay friendship, doggie love (from someone collecting stuffed puppies, that is,) good punctuation, some decent dialogue (love separation ) of gays and pedophilia? I wish most people would realize this) and acting from the feminine leads (as well as Cumming.) I really can not recommend it as it's really trying to be many things? gay tolerance, gay hustling, homelessness, epic of World War II, priesthood, first love, failed judges, etc, etc, etc? on a tight budget.
