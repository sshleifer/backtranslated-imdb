Comparing the Oceans Twelve to the 2001 Oceans Eleven, did anyone else notice all the things that remained the same? <br /> <br /> All the stars returned to the Twelve and Zeta-Jones was added; Twelve had the same director; - Twelve had the same producers; Twelve had the same production designer; Twelve had the same musical director; Twelve had the same movie editor. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that things have changed since the "Oceans" franchise was created? <br /> <br /> - The budget of the Twelve was $ 25 million (30%) higher; <br /> <br /> - Eleven got great reviews, but twelve were heavily criticized; <br /> <br /> - Eleven earned $ 450 million, but Twelve dropped to $ 362 million; <br /> <br /> - Twelve's domestic box office fell 32%; <br /> <br /> - Soderbergh joined a different screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Movies are half a director's, of course. I almost forgot.
