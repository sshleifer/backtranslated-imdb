I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only comment that gave this movie a high rate of 9/10 suspiciously. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review, but more like an advertising statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his comrades, has written this "criticism"? Naughty, naughty. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV, hoping it was really awful. The special effects used were honest very, very good for a low-budget movie, and some of the acting was not so bad, but most of the acting was really awful, but well done to try, as I had hoped the majority were friends of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmaker did very well in trying to reach his weight. I found the movie funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just was not. <br /> <br /> If you do not take this movie very seriously and watch it while drunk with some friends you may well have a good time, but probably not in the way it was planned. This movie is not a 9/10, but it's worth watching for a laugh, given that it was done on a very low budget and with just cause credit to those involved in its production.
