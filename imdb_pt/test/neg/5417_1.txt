Wow. I thought, Eskimo Limon was the world's first horrible and embarrassing movie. But I had forgotten that Germany always tries to compete. In this case, the well-known German film producer Bernd Eichinger was successful in producing even worse garbage. Harte Jungs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and most of all: not funny. It is almost a tragedy that so many children have come to see this in Germany (and, unfortunately, also in Austria). <br /> <br /> Tobias Schenke, 19, looks too good not to have a girlfriend and too mature to be 15, and his character is too dumb to be true. Schenke tries hard to make us believe he does not know anything about sex, but that does not help. Harte Jungs seems to have been made by someone who watched Al Bundy and took him very seriously. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the film are Sissi Perlinger and Stefan Jürgens, who play Schenke's semi-liberal parents. Perlinger and Jürgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented at the movies. Still, his performances are the best and funniest comparisons. A complete failure.
