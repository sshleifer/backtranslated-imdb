The Adventures of Hercules has to be one of the most ridiculous excuses for a movie I've ever known. You would have to look far to find anything approaching the level of ineptitude displayed in this movie. Acting? Bad. Edition ?? Bad. Bad Direction. Special Effects ?? Bad and laughable. Plot ?? Bad. Lighting ?? Bad. Cinematography? Bad. Costume? Bad and silly. Everything else ?? Watching The Adventures of Hercules is as enjoyable as a root canal. Even for a fan of bad movies, it's a real stamina test. This is one for the masochists or Lou Ferrigno finalists (if any). <br /> <br /> Eight things I learned from watching The Adventures of Hercules: <br /> <br /> 1. If you do not have the actual special effects budget, do a rotoscope with a scene from the previous movie. It'll be great - trust me. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are looking to recover the rays of Zeus, take time off for frequent stops to lubricate your body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon mates. <br /> <br /> 3. Any sword fight, use of magic, and virtually every other day-to-day activity in ancient Greece has created a sound very similar to that of Pac Man or Asteroids. <br /> <br /> 4. Some of the ancient Greek gods dressed up as Star Wars extras. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to fill the runtime of your low quality movie, extend the title sequence by adding Star Trek credits and play overly great music. It also helps if you have a previous movie to extract scenes. <br /> <br /> 6. The fight scenes move much more easily if the thugs attack Hercules one at a time. <br /> <br /> 7. William Berger did anything for money. <br /> <br /> 8. I did not think it was possible, but The Adventures of Hercules makes the first film, Hercules (1983), look like an Oscar winner.
