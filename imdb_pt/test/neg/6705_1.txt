Nevertheless, "The House of Adam" pretends to be a traditional gay film; that Anthony (John Shaw), who is gay curious and a great cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell), who is openly gay, and a close second in appearance; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, compelling, and naked love (sorry, not frontal) between Anthony and Adam, 41 minutes after the movie (that alone may be enough for many of us) - despite all this joinha), "The House of Adam" is a horrible movie made by most other movies. Thumbs down. <br /> <br /> Shaw and Cadwell's acting skills are either inexperienced or otherwise suffer from poor writing, direction and editing, or rather lack of it. His love scene, however, is convincing, and may have more to do with being really with each other, considering the rest of his screenings and performances. <br /> <br /> The praise of director-director Jorge Amer (Bonus Feature). as for his talent for making movies, is out of the question. <br /> <br /> So the script and the lack of it are at a disadvantage. Overall, the performance is negative, with the smallest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker as Nina may have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. By far the absolute worst, and unbearable, was interpreted by Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Anthony's father not even having a performance in elementary school. It really represents a colossal failure in casting. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the new cabin owners deserve really bad performance cues. <br /> <br /> If only production, editing and post-production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been something else. The trailer features well-placed clips of scenes that have attracted me to rent the movie in the first place. That, and the hope that this gay-centered film was supposed to be prominently played at gay film festivals. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is a big mistake. <br /> <br /> Is it worth buying / renting and watching? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really like watching bad movies.
