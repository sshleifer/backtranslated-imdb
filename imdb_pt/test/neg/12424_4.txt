I completely forgot that I had seen this in a few days, which is quite revealing in itself. The umpteenth version of the mystery of Gaston's 'Phantom of the Opera' by Leroux, I heard it was an engaging and witty update. Thus, the sympathetic sequence of the title appeared and some touches in the opening scene, but the film quickly stopped and became vaguely tedious and totally unsatisfactory. As a mystery, the biggest problem is that it is fundamentally insoluble by the audience: like the worst Agatha Christie, it depends on a character who appears in the final act with a wealth of background information that we did not know about. As a movie, whether it be comedy or suspense, the crucial problem is that characterization is almost non-existent. With the exception of the killer, all are a face value version of the typical suspects typical of the murder story - reporter, heiress in danger of extinction, suspect fiance, father scientist outburst (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. depth and little interest, and often super-mature or poorly evaluated performances do not help. You frankly do not care about anyone, so there's no risk or suspense. Only Claude Rich and in the last roll, Pierre Arditi can work with anything, and only in the last roll the film comes close to a sense of resonance that is very fleeting to be really effective. For the rest we have endless exposure and a couple of inefficient comics (a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a pendulum clock is too ill-thought to pay) with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving. Explain to the last third of the image. I do not really like country-country movies or whodunits like Agatha Christie, so those who are can cite you a lot looser, but I found it a bad show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed, "it's all a bit disappointing."
