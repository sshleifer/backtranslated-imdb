<br /> <br /> I was fascinated to read the variety of opinions on 'Circus' from 'awesome, breathtaking, brilliant' and most things from the 'Golden Turkey candidate'. I'm in the last camp. The producers obviously thought that if they mixed too much violence with four-letter word barrages, they would have another 'Lock, Stock and two'. Smoking barrels in his hands. Too bad they forgot to include wit, style, charm and talent. And it was certainly a mistake to pay a visit to Lady Wells's classic, "The Lady from Shanghai," thus serving to remind us of how much better the movie can be. <br /> <br /> John Hannah takes off his shirt at all times, a huge American drives into a Mini Minor as "Circus" pathetically strives for cult status and even the beautiful Amanda Donohoe can not add any class to these procedures. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Brit movie try the sublime 'Wonderland'
