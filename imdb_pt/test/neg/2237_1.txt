I went to see the movie because my boyfriend was talking about how much he wanted to see, and how his friends had already been and loved. So I came in with a neutral attitude, not really expecting the worst. Unfortunately, this is what I have. I could write a 15 page article on why this is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. But for your benefit, I will point out the pros and the infinite supply of cons. For starters, the performance was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also some lines that deserved a laugh and some suspense scenes. Unfortunately, good acting, a bit of humor and suspense is where the good points end. The whole initial story could have been great. The family of a Jewish girl is massacred, she hides, then finds the man responsible for her pain and then creates a grand plan of revenge. Sounds great. But the film would not be so "satisfying" to Americans and Jews who crave Nazi blood. I have no problem with World War II movies or killing Nazis; I saw Defiance and I really enjoyed it. However, it is the way and the attitude with which our possible heroes kill. I'll give you a good example of the kind of hypocrisy that this movie overflows. Our bandit gang ambushes a German unit and kills / scalp them all except a sergeant and two other soldiers (no problems so far). They ask the sergeant to release information about another German unit. When he "respectfully refuses" to betray the lives of his fellow soldiers, they bump their heads into a baseball bat, cheering and cursing as if they were at a football game. They took the Nazi's head out of there! Now let's look at hypocrisy in this scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers are ambushed and captured by the enemy. The same scenario follows and the American commanding officer prefers to die to betray his soldier-mate. The enemy beats the head with much celebration. This would infuriate an audience if that scene were in a movie. That American soldier was a hero for putting his men above himself, and those barbarians murdered him brutally! Well, what about the Nazi sergeant? Well, he's a Nazi and deserves to die the cruelest death possible, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same about the Jews. See hypocrisy? In celebrating the butcher of the Nazis, we are putting ourselves on the same sadistic level. <br /> <br /> Increased Hypocrisy # 2: The Nazis make a propaganda film about a German gunman who kills about 300 American soldiers. Near the end of the film, the film is revealed. Hitler and his companions laugh with pleasure as they watch an American soldier being thrown out the window and falling into a fountain. The Nazis celebrate when soldier after soldier falls on sniper skill. That should infuriate American viewers of this scene. These evil Nazis are laughing at the deaths of our brave men! Well, the irony is that this is not what we were doing (or should be doing) the whole time we're watching Inglorious Basterds? Laughing over others' pain simply because they were "the bad guys." How would we feel if Native Americans somehow made a blockbuster movie in which they inflicted bloody revenge on American settlers? Or if the blacks made a movie glorifying Nat Turner's rebellion? Okay enough about the hypocritical flaws. <br /> <br /> I will summarize other reasons for the 1 star rating. 1) There were admirable characters throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by sticking her finger into the shooting wound because she suspects she's brought it. Is he the cool guy? 2) The scenes dragged on longer than necessary. 3) Brad Pitt's Southern accent, supposedly from Tennessee, is HORRIBLE and completely annoying throughout the movement. I'm going to give up now, since I have 700 words. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it seems that the general population does not think anymore, they just want blood. And that's why this movie received such a high rating. I recommend this movie to the ignorant or if you are Jewish and simply want to see a good "fantasy justice". Personally, when I finally left the theater, I felt I had been scalped (or wish I had, so I would not have suffered more than 2 hours of mental violation).
