Looking and sounding like cheap porn without sex, this is the first of an impressive series of stinking producers (or, in this case, director) Geoffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And it's a crazy thing. Risible on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Some government agents (I think) are "professionally murdered" in Amsterdam and an agent of Interpol considerably less than charismatic, wooden block (which I assure you is not called Louis Salinger) is sent to investigate walking a lot to ensure that funders divert the money to the plane tickets to film on the spot. <br /> <br /> The aspiring to be strong attitudes towards drugs and prostitution should have seemed ridiculously out of date before the celluloid dried up, but the script is at least very gentle, as it explains exactly what which is happening regularly in horribly artificial directives ("You were followed? Oh sure not. No one outside of Washington knows you're here!"), yet the plot somehow remains unclear. The moment a sinister Vladimir Putin resembling Priest (no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love) arrives at his pulpit to make a sermon that his brain will have turned off, which is a shame because you will miss our ground hero for a fight - struggling to reach a wooden plank only to later realize that he is actually sitting in a loaded pistol, and he shouting "You justaaard!" in the murdered corpse of his friend, and the go-go boys, mustached and leather-bound, the dance of the dead, and the hilarious sequence of torture-all this gives a lot of laughter. Only the pursuit of the climax boat impresses. It's an exciting and well-directed sequence that really has no place in this movie. Such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with that sequence! Luckily, it all goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous twisting and filing dispute in the warehouse. Unless such a miserable thing as a Geoffrey Reeve completist exists-and you are one of them-I would not mind this instantly forgotten absurdity.
