This movie is a waste of time. Although it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the film is unsatisfactory and has a clich√© point. "You never know what's going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." This phrase prevents you from spending hours of your life in this movie. People who like this movie are the same people who would like to sit around for two hours before discovering that the whole movie was a dream sequence. If the most important part of the movie is not going to happen, at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivate. There is a reason this project has not been released in theaters, and although independent films can be very good, it does not even come close.
