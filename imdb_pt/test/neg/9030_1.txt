OK, I've seen more than 100 Troma movies, and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach U.S.A." It was horrible, and "I was a teen TV terrorist" was unwatchable, but this is the worst movie in the library TROMA! <br /> <br /> A group of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape. <br /> <br /> That's really terrible. Even with film exploits. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for a cult movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
