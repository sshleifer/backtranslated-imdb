Stay away from that. The worst is the terrifying story. There seems to be an intention to convey some subtle message of spiritual love / friendship, but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance that you can not but shrink. Also, most screen time is a story far below the standard of thieves, criminals and our heroes dealing with some alien artifacts from time travel. I know you're asking for trouble in dealing with time, but the story is more full of holes than usual. In addition, you have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst musical arrangements in the history of moving, overwhelming, cheap, abrupt and disconnected image. All I can say is "Man alive! This movie is bad!"
