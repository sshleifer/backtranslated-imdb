I'm a big fan of Kevin Spacey's work, but this is a non-standard film. If you think it looks interesting, or you've seen it and liked it, go and check out "The General" by John Boorman. It's basically about the same guy, but it's far superior in every way (and does not suffer from Hollywood glories).
