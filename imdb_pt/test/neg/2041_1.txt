WOW! What horrible and horrible loss of time this atrocity of celluloid ended up being. I remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun, but now ... it's just silly. Not to mention the fact that it is a blatant steal from "The Exorcist" to the point where it was reissued at one point under the title "The Sex-orcist." The only real difference is that the producers have the audacity to discredit even more by hitting the claim that the events of the movie are REAL! Who in their right mind would really believe such a bold lie? To make things worse, there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by playing a couple of lips on the cover! How low could anyone sink? Do not be fooled by false statements, blatant lies or stealing of titles, because you will be EVENLY DISAPPOINTED if you do!
