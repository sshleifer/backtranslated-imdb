I could not believe how terrible and annoying this Hollywood remake was. It's so terrible. He easily reaches a place in my top 10 worst worst films of 1998. About the only thing that had to happen was Bruce Willis, who was supposed to stick with action movies, as a completely emotionless killer who would kill his own mother for the right price . But I'd rather hear Robbie Coltraine speak American for a week than hear Richard Gere's sickly Irish accent again. But this movie is also implausible, unconvincing, unequal, uninteresting, unimpressive and leaves Sidney Poiter in a stupid role to make a possible career return. One for filmroll-footie purposes completely.
