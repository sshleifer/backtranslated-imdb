Unfortunately, Koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very closely, apparently until the producer ran out of money. All sets in the first half of the movie have been meticulously recreated from the book - something that has been missing in many other Koontz films. In spite of his other (numerous) falls, I continued to watch in advance some really great landscapes. Wrong. By the time detectives show up at the crack boss's apartment (in the book), the film is bottomless, and one of the most suspenseful scenes in the book is ruined. Where the book offered a horrific discovery, a search and a chase through the boys 'apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the guys' car. <br /> <br /> Let's be frank - Koontz writes without a budget in mind, because the imagination is free. If a Koontz novel is turned into a decent movie, no one will see it because it has been disappointed many, many, many times before. That's why Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is now just Frankenstien - if you had seen your work slaughtered many times, you would leave early if it seemed to happen again!
