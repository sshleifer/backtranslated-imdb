I'm a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the beginning. The most seductive thing about them was the love, the innocence and the camaraderie shown. Caco was a model of deep thought and problem solving. A spiritual character, but sweet and credible. All the other characters were a bit eccentric, but they showed how different types of beings can coexist together, respecting each other's differences. <br /> <br /> The following films kept the same vibe. However, this "It's a Very Happy Muppet Christmas Movie" would have Jim Henson spinning in his grave. These characters have been completely rewritten to be full of horny, unpleasant, selfish, and cheeky. <br /> <br /> The cast continues to portray God as an indifferent corporate leader with a mediocre vein. Angels as corporate staff without pimples and without spirits, and the film was so bad that I had to stop watching. I bought it for my great-nephew, but fortunately I preview anything I give a child. <br /> <br /> This movie was trashed and has no socially redeeming content or charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame on people who rewrote the characters and left from Jim Henson's original, heart-centered and socially conscious version. It is a terrible disservice to a man of great heart who is no longer around to defend his creations.
