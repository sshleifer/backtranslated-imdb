Killing the screaming queen may sound like a good horror movie, but it's terribly annoying and very idiotic. <br /> <br /> Kill the screaming queen is about a crazy filmmaker who auditions girls to be in her snuff film. He rapes and tortures them. This is trash that is not fun, full of suspense or fun. The killer has no motives, okay, maybe he's just sick ... and very annoying. Maybe they could tell the victim a story. Anything could be an improvement. Needed more. <br /> <br /> They could put a little more into it. I love horror movies / slasher, but this is ridiculously bad.
