This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next to an empty apartment (but a phone that plays constantly) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. But the stupid script ruins any promise of the episode. First of all, the woman readily admits seeing things that send most of us running in the opposite direction (eg, "It's funny that the door has been hit." It even closed that there is no wind; "" This door has serious damage to her that was not here a minute ago; "" The door opened alone, without my touching it, "etc.) Given these supernatural phenomena, in addition to the fact that a woman committed suicide in the living room, she would not take any precautions before entering it? Maybe she could investigate during the day Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with another person Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS !!! Also, haunted, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and discusses who has the power to turn off the phone, and then they begin to discuss the details of the suicide. in Shut it down. <br /> <br /> Finally, showing the cell phone running across the floor as if it were alive was only comical. If the director wanted the woman strangled by the phone card, he could have done it in a way that did not seem caricatured. Little brave toaster anyone?
