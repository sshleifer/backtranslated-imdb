In 1967, I saw an excellent musical at the Wintergarden in New York, where Angela Lansbury was on stage as Mame. But did Hollywood give you the lead? No big Lucille Ball as Lucy was given the role. She killed the movie. What a mistake There was no chemistry as there was on stage Bea Arthur and Angela what a couple when they sang .. It's too bad that a producer did not put those two together even today
