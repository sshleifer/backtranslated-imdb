Although my exposure to the world's cultures is limited, I try. This was a movie that I tried and hated. Worst of all, after hearing so many people denigrate the shallowness of typical Hollywood food and its stereotypical cartoons, I have seen outrageous characters for the Eastenders to appear realistic. <br /> <br /> Clint wants to get out of the drug life and for this he aspires to be a waiter. High goal, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a fax photo of him, or possibly a curly wig on a stick, was hard to say, offers to hire Clint if he gets a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wandering all over England trying to get some shoes for him. Eventually, they end up in a suburban home. Whose is not clear? Mom helps a girl to throw herself. Oh, now there's some realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha unravel and find a vein. Good God! Daddy comes home and sings some songs from Elvis and then chases the kids. <br /> <br /> Why did not Clint borrow money and buy shoes at a second-hand store? Why did not he go to a church and gently ask the nun for some help? Why did not he go out in front of a shoe and panhandle shop? I just do not know! None of these things seemed to be beneath him. Benevolent groups like Goodwill and the Salvation Army have shops to help people. I know people who work there! If someone without money showed up and needed shoes, the team would give them some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot cover. Few of these groups distribute cell phones to the less fortunate, but shoes are usually no problem. What a dumb concept. The world, or at least the western part, is simply not so cruel. In England, maybe it's "The Royal Charity of the Queen" instead of Goodwill, but people who need shoes get them. <br /> <br /> In addition to the pursuit of shoes, there was no discernible plot to disrupt the way. of the action. Not that it made the movie faster or more bearable, remember. Despite checking the tape jacket several times, I was not watching the extended version of 20 hours, it just looked like that. <br /> Did Clint get his shoes? Did the cardboard from Brad Dourif hire you at the restaurant? Have I ever watched anything foreign again? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes, and yes. <br /> <br /> As for the fate of this particular movie, I decided to end it all. I grabbed my S & W 45 and made a half-inch hole in the cassette. Blammo! (I made sure to rewind it first.) I put it back in the sleeve of the tape, returned it to the rental store, and surprisingly NOBODY CALLED TO ASK ABOUT IT !!! Which means, of course, that no one else has rented him for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. Others knew something I did not know. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you rent something you've never seen before and someone actually put a bullet in it, interpret it as a sign. And if you work in Kroger's video department, I'm just joking. <br /> <br /> Footnote: This classic still has not seen the light of day on DVD, by which we must be eternally grateful to the digital gods. .
