I came across a rare copy of this Almodovar movie with great expectations - Almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, I liked his 1988 film "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," and I read one or two very positive reviews of the film . movie. Well, I must have completely lost the humor that reviewers have seen in this movie. I just found it incoherent, tasteless and annoying. Yes, there are many innuendoes, people in distress and crude sexual situations, and yes, those elements may have shocked the public in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almodovar's intention), but much of the value of the shock was probably corroded over the years. years, leaving a flabby plot. Also, the whole movie looked very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even if obscure - I just did not find this movie funny. I suppose there may be a very select audience for a movie like that, but I'm not part of that audience, and I'm not sure I want to be.
