this film is crap because, for many reasons, it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also crap. Let me just say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get in the limelight - and others who fix this kind of garbage belong to the chain. for the film itself, relying on the book, was also horrible. The only reason this homicide case became a big book and movie was because the guy is related through the marriage of aunts to the Kennedy family and it's ridiculous that people still believe that this family has the ability to do and cover up murders - they are just a family and middle America needs to overcome obsession. this poor boy and his family were persecuted by the police for years, they could not get the tommy, so they went after Micheal. It is incredible that he went to jail with all the evidence supporting that he did not do this, in addition to the fact that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have prevented this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of God, do not watch this trash
