I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The plot was very thin and the editing team did their best to stretch it while they did. <br /> <br /> Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was such a nasty character that I found it difficult to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good, but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie. Andie MacDowell did a great job with her interpretation of Linda, Gary's romantic interest. I can not say anything bad about Andie, I always like to act. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so unlikely and unbelievable. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film was almost as disappointing as the film itself. A nod from the pope and all is forgiven, come on. The event that allows this film to end happily and writers expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change and only with the death of a dear friend his situation gets better. <br /> <br /> There are thousands of great movies that should be seen before this one. Do not waste time. <br /> <br />
