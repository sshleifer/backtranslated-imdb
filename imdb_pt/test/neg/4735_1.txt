If you are a fan of any of the two home franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or did not like the AVP movie at 06) you will hate this movie. The innumerable holes in the plot, unbelievable and flamboyant human characters, terrible special effects and even worse direction and fighting scenes make this one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** Hundreds of huge holes included the Pred / Alien hybrid going from the chestbuster chest to the big-grown in seconds (he takes off in a marathon aboard the Predator-ship and erases a Preds ship even before the ship breaks Earth orbit.) AS SE. At the first AvP, we saw a Pred Brothers hunting ship leave three young hunters hunting for a party "winning their stripes," and then, in the end, they took the "honored body" of the young man left over. at the end of the movie. Are we expected to believe that the single-box hybrid killed all these Hunter Brethren even before the ship broke its orbit? In addition, (and this was EXTREMELY low production value in the director / producer's pieces) pitchers and pots and jars of face shoes appeared magically aboard the Pred vessel, although the entire temple complex and Queen Alien were destroyed in the film AvP. These front guys end up playing an intrinsic part in the movie ... of course. How about all these guys become aliens in one day? What a joke. Although there were many more holes in the plot, I do not think the IMDb would like me to fill their servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> In the flakey and unbelievable characters, well, where should I go boys and girls? Where to begin ... almost all of these nonsense are people cliches of other movies or TV shows. The bad-boy city that came out to avoid the prison, but only appears on the day everything happens to save the day ??? Where did I see that? Oh yeah, last season at JERICHO !!! Then there's the 20-something city sheriff (a former trouble maker) who was the best friend at a time with the bad boy. Where did we see that? Oh yeah, JERICHO and walking high! Then there is the generic soldier (NO RANK) coming home from some generic war front that is not known as a loved one and a hero long lost at the airport or bus station, but on his FIRST door by his daughter and husband. And who is this soldier? What did she do in the Army / Air Force / Navy / Navy / Coast Guard? We do not know why the movie NEVER tells us. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... she was a kind of soldier / aviator / marine / sailor / coastal who knows how to drive a Stryker Infantry vehicle and ... magically ... A HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a generic copy of every person who "comes home" from the service ... except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles for her daughter that cost several hundred dollars. These are the things soldiers have to sign and not just "take it home." UGH! <br /> <br /> Special effects and fight scenes are what scares me the most. These are the things I most enjoyed in the first movie ... watching Preds and Aliens! The way it was filmed, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close that you did not know what was happening. You could not see who was doing what and what was happening while they were fighting. All in all, these hundreds of items will kill this franchise and the fanchise. No-one will care about seeing your favorite science fiction movie monsters anymore, and you can only imagine that the series will fall from here, as producers will not want to spend millions more dollars on a sequel.
