Jon Good's Wife (simply one of the worst titles in a movie of all time), or The Red Right Hand (another absolutely horrible title that means nothing and has no relevance to the film) under which I saw it, is set in 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978' (incidentally the year I was born was possibly the best thing that happened during those 365 days) where five old college friends get together for a school reunion, Roger Mather (John Kuntz, Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) more John Good (Marc Ardito, why the spelling of 'John' is different in the title?) and his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the word go there is an uncomfortable tension in the air and when someone mentions their 'missing' friend Calef (Jason Winther) many nasty memories come flooding back. Then come the phone calls, the mysterious nosebleeds, hallucinations and guilt as the true horror of events all those years ago, finally comes to light ... <br /> <br /> Produced, executive produced and directed by Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the thing & Kurt St. Thomas who also gets credit for art direction & if that was not enough they both also act in the movie! Personally, I thought Jon Good's wife was horrible, I mean she can not cook or anything! Ha ha ha, just joking! Seriously though I have not thought much about the movie in general to begin with, it's pretty slow and the first 30 minutes are solid material of the meeting, consisting of lots of conversation with each other and a bland character construction exhibition. The movie is never explained, what about those strange bleeding noses, for the love of God, the mysterious phone calls, the almost inconsequential death of one of the members of the group that may or may not be natural and what the hell was Sara? She appears as a meddlesome, crazed by sex, speaking badly, unashamedly, bitterly blackmailing the prostitute who apparently sleeps with almost every man she meets! Some of the dialogues she releases would not be out of place in a porn movie and this looks totally different from the rest of the movie, which looks more like a drama than the terror / suspense it was supposed to be. So there's the ending, if there's a worse way to end a movie than just literally leave everything in the air with no closure I have yet to see. The whole thing was very predictable too, I mean, is anyone watching this will not know that when everyone mentions that your friend Calef was "lost," would not it be more than that? Directors Gioscia & Thomas makes an infuriating movie, beyond predictability and irritating climax there is a retrospective narrative from Alan that I just do not understand as he has no more or less importance than anyone else & in that point in time is he narrating? The reasons behind this narration are never clarified or elaborated. There is no tension, because things are so common. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is good, but nothing special and some of the places and clothes do not seem particularly authentic to me, it never convinced me. was happening in the late 70's. Was the acting good and the name of the actor John Kuntz? I suppose if his wife was beside him, we could describe them as a pair of Kuntz, right ?! <br /> <br /> I really did not think much about Jon Good's wife (an exploding doll would have been better! Ha ha ha) and I'm not sure who would appeal. Forget anything horrible, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere, or excitement, actually forget everything that would have made this watchable film because it is not here. Not recommended.
