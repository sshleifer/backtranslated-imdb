SPOILER - This movie shows plot points and discusses the ending. I hated this movie - mainly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this movie glorified war and military technology - making things really good. We are brought to applaud as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow up the Ruskies. And no American soldier puts their lives at risk - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there is not a touch of real human emotion in the film, just smug and privileged people being sarcastic, feeling superior and doing whatever they want, regardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences, the film does only a few small hits that the Afghans' weaponry actually took. I had read an earlier draft of this script and ended on September 11 - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone terribly wrong. But that would not leave the public feeling good. This is a good movie about killing Ruskies. And that made me sick.
