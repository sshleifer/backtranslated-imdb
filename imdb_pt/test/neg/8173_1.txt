I used to love the bill forever because of its great script and characters, but lately I feel like I've turned into an emotional kind of soap. If you look at promotional pictures / account posters now you will see two of the officers hugging / kissing or something to do with friendships while promotional photos of the bill would have long ago shown something to do with the crime. This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely incredible police drama to an ordinary type of television soap. When I watch, I feel like I'm seeing a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say that I still like the account as I'm interested in Police work and that kind of thing but I really miss the greatness that the account used to have. I want to rate it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit it was totally ruined by the people who accepted the account. <br /> <br /> As for the script and characters, both were down, most of the great characters are gone now (although some still remain, I think) and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or whatever thing because they definitely are not, it's just that they do not have the tough looks, personalities and script lines that all the old characters used to have, because most new ones are currently involved with foolish relationships and family problems. Overall, being one of the only police shows on television today, The Bill will always be a very interesting thing to see, but, as I say, it's lost a lot of its uniqueness (if it's the correct spelling ) and now would be classified as a terrible and unreal soap for television. <br /> <br /> Recommended to watch a good laugh about the stupidity of the police involved - 2/10
