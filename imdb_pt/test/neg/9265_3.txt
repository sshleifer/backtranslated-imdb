I got this movie a few years ago and when I tried to find some information about it, I discovered that even the mighty IMDb did not list it. That should have been all I needed to know. With Friends Like These is an anthology that plays like a collection of second-rate Twilight Zone / Outer Limits episodes, all intertwined by a bus ride that never seems to tie with the rest of the movie. Of the three stories, the only one I took any entertainment worth was the second episode in which a man (the type) grows out of the bacteria in an expensive refrigerator. This episode earns points for a few points of humor and is a bizarre premise. In addition, there is an episode with a talking car (bland and unguided) and an episode in which a girl visits a very original dating agency (my dog ​​guessed the end of it). <br /> <br /> As has been mentioned in other comments, the classification of 18 is totally unjustified. There's nothing to offend here. If you are looking for a horror anthology, check out the movie Asylum or Creepshow.
