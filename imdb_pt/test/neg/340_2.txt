Even with its low budget, this movie could be worth watching if there was a story to tell here. It started very well, and quite engaging and believable. The actors and characters were interesting, although there was not much character development. My favorite scene was when everyone was eating their rations. Some seemed to hate him, and some seemed to think it was not so bad. The story begins very tightly. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then plunged into a little horror that is usually a death sentence for most scientists. Suddenly, no scientific basis for any of the events. No real and believable final game for the villain? No real explanation of what is happening. Generally, if a movie has to use the F word for all other words, it usually also goes down from there. I'm still offended, believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to do bad science fiction? Is not there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? People do not feel like they're wasting their time and everyone's when they put things like that. Why are we so mediocre like this? Not female actors / characters as well? None at all? This had the result of being another "Predator", but unfortunately fell far short. <br /> <br /> My final comment - bad editing and finally a very low budget to build a real campfire? What gives? My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. Make sure you have a good story before you begin and edit the bad special effects - it is best to see nothing of anything that seems false or ridiculously confusing.
