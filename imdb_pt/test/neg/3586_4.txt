A brief marital infidelity returns to haunt the loving wife Grace Needham (played by the always sexy Nastassja Kinski). She had left the city and her depressing husband to embark on a trip to sunny Miami where she was pursued and finally seduced by Julian Grant, a generously evil and manipulative business executive who is portrayed very well by William Baldwin (why do all the Baldwin brothers interpret bad people so well?) The seduction of Grace occurred when they both drank champagne on a deserted beach that they privately reached by sailboat. Grace admitted that she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage. Julian gained his confidence, claiming that he would never allow these kinds of problems to occur if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described a "lost-in-the-sea" fantasy involving the now uninhibited Grace, who sat nearby, listening to each word of her and becoming more and more involved with her romantic dream. <br /> <br /> His manipulation paid off. <br /> <br /> When subtle touches led to Grace's soft kisses, they momentarily paused for her to step away as if suddenly thinking to herself: What am I doing? I'm a wife. I'm a mother. I have a real life. Real Responsibilities. Of course, we both talk about being together, lost at sea, but this is just a fantasy. See what we're doing here. The consequences are real. We are really alone on a secluded beach. Am I going to let this fantasy really happen? '<br /> <br /> She succumbs to the dream as her kisses become more passionate. The once-protected Grace, who used to respond to men's proposals by saying "I'm married," liked to watch as Julian unbuttoned her blouse, leading to more kisses, caresses in her body and climbing Julian's lap! She smiles, kisses, groans, laughs and often looks at the sun during which, unfortunately, it was a brief lovemaking scene in which everyone seemed to have most of her clothes. <br /> <br /> Look of illicit passion on Grace's face as the once dedicated wife was being completely satisfied by having sex with a man who clearly likes to manipulate others, I'll say that in general, the scene did not deserve the "R" rating of the movie. Julian has returned home to find her husband rejuvenated for having secured a well-paid job, and she is excited to be able to return to a normal life where she can once again become a loving wife and loving mother. But the evil Julian Grant reenters the picture and is not willing to give up so easily from Grace. Grace has a plan to free her life from Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Obviously, I do not want to ruin the rest of the story for you. However, I will say that I always enjoy movies involving sexual pretense on the part of a wife (especially when she exhibits uninhibited attraction and behavior that is usually reserved for her husband), but is actually seeking revenge against the antagonist. This movie would have been much, much better if the film had included more than the story line. My feelings are if the movie brings, then the movie should end. And that movie definitely brought that to the surface. Unfortunately, certain restrictions in the story line prevented this from being significantly pursued. There are many other films available that are successful at this point, and I will include your titles in the "recommendations" part of this section. I'm also open to receiving e-mail suggestions from other films that contain a good story involving sexual simulation by a seemingly dedicated wife. <br /> <br /> Overall, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The movie is not.
