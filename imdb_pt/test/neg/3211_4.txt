Take the 60s / 60s Bond mania, mix some concepts from Sax Rohmer's female femme fatale, and initiate an absurd and distorted revisionism of director Franco - you have the man who harms Sumuru, or "The 7 Secrets of ... "- better known as" The Girl From Rio "in the US, remembering" That Man From Rio ", which has nothing to do with it. Yes, this happens in Brazil, we must give it. Sumuru, or Sumitra as she is also referred to, is like an evil version of "Modesty Blaise," played here by actress Eaton with that familiar shy smile that most of us first became familiar with in "Goldfinger." There are numerous close-ups of her camera, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is duplicated in her key lesbian scene). She controls an entire army of warrior women, dressed in color and rules a town called Femina or something (outside of Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which appeared previously in "Sumuru's Million Eyes," sound wonderful but, despite some intriguing designs and visuals, they follow the same exaggerated atmosphere of, for example, the very old-fashioned "Some Girls Do" at the same time and which also had a female army. At first glance, the sight of all these armed women, usually lined up in a row, catches the eye, but after 15 minutes, you realize that there is nothing more than just setting the look. <br /> <br /> The plot follows what appears to be a secret agent, a male, arriving in Brazil with 10 million dollars. He catches the attention of the local crime lord (Sanders, like an old Bond-type villain), who sends thugs in dark suits in felt hats to approach him. This sets everything up for a three-way conflict between the agent, the lord of crime and the mysterious Sumuru (the lord of crime wants the secrets of Sumuru). Sumuru also holds several prisoners in glass cages - maybe that's one of the secrets. This sounds exciting, but there are problems that go beyond a slow pace; there are many shots that could have used too much grip: a shot from an arriving plane, for example, gets in the boat when it approaches a stop, as if that had never been captured in the film before. There is a similar approach to a typical sunset, as if there was something unusual about it. The fight scenes are very precarious, as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes. To add some production value, there is a scene of Rio's true carnival midway. I'm assuming that there were several budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where false sound effects and smoke cover up many false actions, such as the lack of real-looking weapons - this reminds us of times when children use plastic weapons and the fake bullets are being fired, falling without conviction. There are touches of sadism, such as torturing a character for answers, and female nudity, an early depiction of such after some restrictions have been lifted. But mostly you will be rolling your eyes. Heroes: 3 Villains: 5 Femme Fatales: 5 Henchmen: 4 Fights: 3 Doubles / Detectives: 3 Gadgets: 4 Cars: 4 Places: 6 Pace: 3 in total: 4
