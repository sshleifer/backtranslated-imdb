Seeing this movie in previews I thought it would be witty and in a good mood. Unfortunately it was a standard case of "funny parts were in the preview", not to say it was all bad. But "the good bits were in the preview". <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a teenage movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie.
