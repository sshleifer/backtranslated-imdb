This movie was painfully awful. Most of the film consisted of people running in the woods, walking through the forest or dancing in the woods. More than half, at least. Then two children who discover two horribly mutilated bodies in the forest, return to the forest the following night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no continuity of time. your day, your night, your day, your really night, your twilight, your black tone, your day. All the scenes of the woods continue like this until you think you will lose your head. too bad. The sheriff discovers a five-foot claw imprinted on the forest land and theorizes that a super large alligator may have learned to walk on foot. Really a silly movie with no real motivation written for the characters. It can be fun for small children as an alternative to really graphic things.
