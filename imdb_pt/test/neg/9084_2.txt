Again, director J. Lee Thompson joins actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action film. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal movie (one made quite for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality does not make a good movie by itself, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you took away his brutality, the film would have very little interest. <br /> <br /> The story is about a retired assassin (Bronson) who lives a nice life on a Caribbean island. He is persuaded to come out of retirement to locate and eliminate a doctor of sadistic torture who has administered his vile trade around various South American infernal holes. Throughout the film, especially in the beginning, we are treated with some graphic torture scenes to show us the nasty work it is. <br /> <br /> These themes are really serious. Torture continues in the suppressive dictatorships of Latin America, and ordinary people are led to suffer some despicable painful experiences simply by expressing an unpopular point of view. But the evil that men do - despite all their dignified postures - is not really concerned about the plight of these poor people. It is bothered purely by giving Charles Bronson an excuse to blow up some unpleasant garbage bags. It's just an exploitative action that puts your coat on genuine issues. The torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick voyeur in the head, like someone who likes to watch "snuff" movies. The script is full of hideous dialogues, including over-descriptions of acts of torture. The evil that men can not exploit their disturbing ideas ... serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry, but this is wrong.
