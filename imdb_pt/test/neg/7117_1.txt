Not very well done, the whole movie was just the rancor out there and killing random people out of nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with the story are dead, like the 3 girls at school, for example. <br /> <br /> The family at the beginning also has nothing to do with the story, I believe they are random. family that never entered the house, and never had anything to do with Grudge's murders. <br /> <br /> It did not impress me at all, I was not scared, I jumped nowhere, and the whole movie was just random crap to get more money. It makes Gridge 1 look crap too, which was actually a great movie. <br /> <br /> I believe The Grudge 2 is like a movie for The Grudge 3, if they make one. They should not even have called it Grudge 2, they should call it the prologue to Grudge 2, and you'll see if it's watched because I will not ruin anything. Not that it mattered anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, it's not scary, it's a bad story and it's completely random.
