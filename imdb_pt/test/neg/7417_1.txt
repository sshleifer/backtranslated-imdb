This seems decidedly like "amateur" time. How this piece of junk was released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc ... everything is wrong. Why Lance Henriksen has accepted that this will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema. Maybe he was in dire need of money or maybe under the influence of some illegal drug. <br /> <br /> It is useless to try to explain what this movie is about. It deals with the great legend of the foot, but done in the worst possible way. In fact, this stinker smells like a direct pitch to the video. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! 0 * of 10 *
