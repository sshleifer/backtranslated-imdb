Outside of Sweden you are not expected to have seen this movie. Happy you. The cast includes several actors who are an important part of the modern history of Swedish cinema. And yet ... <br /> <br /> It seems that Peter Dalle only had an idea that lasted about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this movie, trying to copy a young GÃ¶sta Ekman. Ekman, by the way, is the only actor who meets expectations. <br /> <br /> Credit that can be given is for the photo, splendid idea using black and white. The music is good. <br /> <br /> But above all, it is a waste of God's actors and the time of the public.
