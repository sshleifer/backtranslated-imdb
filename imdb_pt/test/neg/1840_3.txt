Doll Master is an example of a horrible horror film, fallen somewhere in space with its two not-so-well-established genres, a horror film and an emotional drama film. It seems that the Doll Master goes to great lengths to be a very scary horror movie, but fails. The noise of the dolls as it moves is like that of Kayako's croak in Ju-On, and the tracks are like sadako esquire. Killing dolls will remember you a cute version of "Chucky". But compared to Child's Play, this movie is more wonderful. But the story does not look anything, the camera's brilliant photos and the brilliance of the acting were taken because of the plot. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this if you're expecting big shocks.
