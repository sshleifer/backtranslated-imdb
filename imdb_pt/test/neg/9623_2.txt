Having appreciated the writing of Neil Gaiman (especially his collaboration with Yoshitaka Amano in "The Dream Hunters") in the past, I imagined Mirrormask to be a sure thing and I was very disappointed. The beginning, live action section of the movie was intriguing enough. The relationships between the characters were convincing and easy to empathize with, and I loved the scenery, the costumes, and the art of Helen. Subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. The dialogue was strange and pretentious, the interaction between live actors and the horrifying CGI. Events occurred for more insignificant reasons, and most events seemed superfluous for any portion that might have existed. I only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie so I'm not exactly an authority, but I strongly recommend that you do not watch any of this and stick with Gaiman's strong written work.
