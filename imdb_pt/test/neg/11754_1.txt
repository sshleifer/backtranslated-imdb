No matter what other people said you can not review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it existed by itself, it would be a 2 to 3 movie in 5 but it is a remake of 4 to 5 5 movie and it has standards to live by and we need to see if it meets those standards. If the movie was a rework or, as in Planet of the Apes, a new image of the original, you would be able to look at the movie by itself, referring only to the original. Imagine that, if someone took the model in the Mona Lisa, put it differently and paint it, you could only compare the framing, the concept, and so on. to the original, but if someone just repented it in the position of the original you would have to fully compare it. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie does not stop being as good as the original, it failed spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best films ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten , the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock, but ended up really degrading him and his master work. The demeaning aspects of this image were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche It has nothing to do with whether they acted better or not, is that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really very innocent, Norman really did not he understood sex, he almost had no contact with the outside world and when he met the beautiful Marion and watched her change you feel he's partially doing it out of fascination, as he does not really understand sex and his attraction to her, it makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you're on his side because he does not totally understand the world and is constantly struggling with himself and his "mother." In the remake that all the dynamics are gone, I must admit for Janet Leigh not to be my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman find 'her' attractive Marion is unbelievable if you add this for Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating while looking at her and you get a Norman who's just waiting for a chance to masturbate with any naked woman, no matter how she looks, to whom you do not feel any sympathy, you still destroy plus Norman's innocent nature. putting porn magazines in his bedroom. It destroys a character that we like and we feel very much, it's like redoing "It's a wonderful life" and having the main character as a pimp, totally demeaning. <br /> <br /> The only other character I had was trouble with Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's co-worker. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says that the phrase "he must have noticed my wedding ring," this causes a laughing reaction when she is playing, when Rita says it seems plausible, since there is no other reason why man would flirt with Anne Heche for her. I admit that I am very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite movie of all time, if the movie had been reworked, with a different angle, then you could have turned those characters into your own. heads and would have been perfectly acceptable. <br /> <br /> Hitch knew that the film would be very bloody in color and made in black and white to diminish it. It has also made the movie more atmospheric and scary in its own way and has given it a beauty that could never be captured in color and it is a sad statement about how the films are desensitizing the public that people have said as the shower scene was over scary in color. (nb before people think 'he can not spell' remember I'm from England and we spell the color) <br /> <br /> A remake should be just this, it's done, this is a fake, a complete and very bad copy of it. I could go on comparing, but it does not make sense, almost everything is superior in the original. The only thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat on the original (Hitch called him 'The Stiff' on the back) and Mortensen gives a more believable and less enjoyable performance. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors who hold the originals. <br /> <br /> Overall, a movie that should be labeled as 'Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment'. Just see if comparing with original or original is unknown to you. The film would have a 3 out of 5 if it was original or a rework, but as it is 0.5 out of 5 (for Macy, Moore and Mortensen)
