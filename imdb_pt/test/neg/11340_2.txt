As much as I hated the movie this series follows, I can at least say that Zangief was fun. The animated series is possibly one of the worst things ever produced. The animation is often inconsistent, although it remains consistently poor. The shape of a character's face is able to change drastically in the same scene. The screenplay and dubbing are also lacking, as most of the cast looks as talented as the cast of a third-grade play. Characters such as Cammy and DJ are so forced to stereotypes of their nationalities that the episodes that contain them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series is not pained regularly. The episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of lame at every turn and are so full of plots that it surprises me that they had time to display commercials. In fact, I'm surprised someone paid to advertise during the show. In addition to being a bad series, it's an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many of the characters maintain the film's unsuccessful adaptations. Examples include Ken and Ryu being idiots (although Ken is rich), Blanka being friends with Guiles, Charlie, and reporter Chun Li. It takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse.
