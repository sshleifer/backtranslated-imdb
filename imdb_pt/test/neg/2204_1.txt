This movie sucks. First, let me tell you about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Now the rest of the story is really bad. We said that computer programmer Angela Bennett (whose online profile is ANGEL - COMO WITTY !!! I bet the directors applauded this for an hour) that basically checks other company software for errors / failures etc. So we start with the pizza she asks for. on the Internet, and then putting a fireplace on your monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown so far). This occurs after it encounters a virus in a Macintosh program that locks the entire system after pressing the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do this could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file. <br /> <br /> Any event, we move on. She gets that call from some other guy (who works in the same company) and this idiot says to click on the symbol that apparently opens some secret Internet portal for a bunch of unprotected 'super secret' data! Angela keeps this crap on a record and now the people who have created this rift are trying to get it. This, of course, is only after she meets up with one of the bad guys before he tries to kill her before she jumps into the ocean of the boat BEFORE ending up in a random hospital. <br /> <br /> Problem # 1: You can not create a gap in the Internet to gain access to a lot of FBI secret data. Where the hell did that come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem # 2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic released her. She could not just pack her things and walk away. <br /> <br /> So, these 'hackers' or whatever, change Angela's identity so that she can not get help from anyone and, conveniently, her entire identity is gone. Then she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Apparently all the police and FBI staff are stupid and do not believe in it. So she has to use a lot of tactics to get into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling her work is) and go back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random guy and finds out who's behind everything via an IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe. <br /> <br /> Then she runs to some center to send all the messages. this information to the FBI. She apparently has to use a mainframe to send emails to the FBI. But then the same fool who tried to kill her before throwing her in the water caught her and easily invaded the FBI again (wtf?). But remember this legal virus? Well, somehow she fortunately understands this and even though the virus only worked on software, now it also works on the whole system. It knocks down the whole mainframe that has all the fake information because the mainframe was just in the middle of some convention ... WHAT HELL IS THAT CRAP! Anyway, the virus now uber works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and then kills the evil guy with a fire extinguisher. He, of course, has a gun, runs up to her, so he's 2 feet away and then decides to look. CLASSIC Hollywood. <br /> <br /> After all, this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who does not know much about computers will be incredibly mistaken to think that this crap is possible, but nothing is accurate about computers or the network. And I honestly doubt I'd see a cross-platform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (* LMAO cough *).
