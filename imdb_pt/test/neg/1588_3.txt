The name of the DEA agent, Anslinger, is a good inner joke - that's the name of the former drug czar who almost made marijuana illegal. <br /> <br /> Despite this little knowledge of the book, the writers keep talking. have farmers harvest and sell new dried leaves instead of cured shoots. <br /> <br /> Besides, I always find it funny that filmmakers can never find real marijuana plants to film. You would think that there would be a business that would look fake for the movies or maybe you could shoot some scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I suppose it's asking too much for the budget. Probably the most interesting thing about the film is the attempt to cover the notion of exactly what is right and what is wrong in society and how the law says that line and still tries to do justice, despite this. <br /> <br />
