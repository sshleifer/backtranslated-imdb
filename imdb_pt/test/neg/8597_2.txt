The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I showed to many people and they absolutely loved it, but for some strange reason he did not like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that it showed to many people and they loved it, instead I hated this movie. I do not think I hated a movie so much in some time, as this movie has a rating of up to 6.6 is beyond me. I could not keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a man of fire, random sibling rivalry, random love story, who's being an arsonist, the investigator, the fire that has a personality of is own. I only have one problem that this movie can not keep up with all these stories, they have not balanced themselves enough to make the movie interesting. I would have preferred this movie to be about being a firefighter or investigator and how he came to be one or what exactly he does and why. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of Chicago Firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the older brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Brian, the younger brother, dropped out of the fire fighting school several years earlier, then embarked on several other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is despised by his older brother, who hopes that he will fail in his newly chosen career as a firefighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is a criminal fire investigator dedicated to his profession. It is called because several fires occurred with similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is an alderman in the City Hall. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but had to make a series of budget cuts on the fire department. Many of the firefighters believe the cuts he has made are putting the lives of firefighters at risk. However, Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffective after the firefighters are being repeatedly killed in flames. <br /> <br /> I just could not get into this movie, I do not know how else anyone could, it was unbelievably unrealistic and portrayed the firemen all wrong. I loved how they had every action clich√© in the book to match this action movie. I also felt as if there were great talents squandered in such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the next talent at the time. I know Ron was going to a great quality, but I think he casting such big actors in small roles was a mistake for this movie. I even had to play while watching this movie commenting how the doctor deep down was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unreal and the movie was so out there, I did not like it and honestly would not recommend it to people, I'll stick with the recommendations of my relationship from this point on. <br /> 2/10
