Every movie I got PPV'd because Leonard Maltin praised it for the skies exploded pieces! Each one! When will I learn? <br /> <br /> Evie is a raving old purse that does not think she's dying of breast cancer to get what she wants! Laura is an unbearable jellyfish, filled with the Holy Spirit (and protected from her husband)! Among these harpies is the dumb kid of Medusa who was pushed into bondage by The Old Bag! <br /> <br /> Like I said, when will I learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily out of my misery when The Old Bag stuck my head in the sink, but alas, it did not die. I was temporarily out of my malaise again when Medusa was mowed, but unfortunately she did not die. It must be a capital offense to torture audiences like that! <br /> <br /> Without Harry Potter to kick it, Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that pretty much come out of their orbits. The set design of Julie Walters (especially the scene in which she "plays" with God) is even more shameless than her character. <br /> <br /> At least this Harold fucks with a bimbo instead of Maude. So I am truly grateful. And if you're reading this Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
