The Child's Play made a new horror genre, THE KILLER DOLLS, some of these movies do not have much money to do, but I think the only film that makes Shadow for Chucky is that.Ok is a direct product direct to video or direct to TV, but Pinocchio is not real and the killer is the little girl. The children's imagination is very big and this movie plays with it. The roles are good and Candance Mckenzie is great. <br /> <br />
