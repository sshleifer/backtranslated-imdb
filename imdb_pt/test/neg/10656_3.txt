The plot of a man's love for an innocent baby that he meets with a malformed face and on the opposite side of the world a superficial and egocentric "valley girl" who shares a date of birth with her and ends up making a big difference in both there lives. What a great and dignified story line. But by saying the screen, writing and / or directing and / or editing is so bad that it takes away most of the joy of the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mother to wicked witch and back faster than a bullet at high speed, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, in the fall of a hat. Katie (The California Girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mother and everyone, including the poor lady at the airport check-in desk, Lin's adoptive father, who is the gentlest and most considerate man in the world, and his wife and biological child. constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a touching story, but the only thing that made me smile was when all the hatred and struggle ended. There have been many unexplained or illogical events, many of which do not contribute to history. My wife and I were looking at each other and wondering how such a good cast and what should be a great story could be so bad.
