Wow - Thank God I was on a plane and could look out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly represented (who the hell was that horrible woman who represented the wife?), Mellow, terribly written. This movie was apparently made to appeal to the kind of person who is willing to kneel on the altar of any firefighter specifically, "Heroes" or gods in general, I suppose. I do not have bad things enough to say about this movie. Nor could it be cheap, with all the stars that were in it, plus all those special effects and fire scenes. It had to have cost a fortune, but it was still worse than any movie I still remember seeing. Funeral scene? Surprisingly bad. The dating between firefighter and awful woman mentioned above? Corny, artificial, whimsy. Firefighter games? Not all of us wish that we could be both male and rude at the same time.
