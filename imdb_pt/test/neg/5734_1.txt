In the mid-1970s, my NYC apt. The building was finally connected to cable TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel that showed recent movies, I signed up for it. Being a writer and night-owl by nature, I soon discovered that the channel was showing late-night movies until the early hours of the morning that I had never heard of - most of them independent American films and foreign films that I had never heard of. was given a theatrical US release. Many of them had recognizable castles and respectable directors and, thanks to Showtime, I discovered many first-class movies that I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have had the opportunity to see. Most of these cinematic mutts were indeed "dogs," but often so bad that they were, unintentionally, hilarious. One night, Showtime unveiled a little Italian gem called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972, with a limited European release in 1973). Although the film was never released in the US, the MPAA rating was listed as "R". As the director was a Sylvio Narizzano (the director who made his name with the glorious "Georgy Girl"), and the three protagonists were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try. And I found myself nailed to my TV screen, unbelieving, for 89 minutes. As I recall, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, the first a furious maniac who, in a scene of rolling his stomach, casually sent a German family to death pushing his trailer off a cliff, plunging into the depths below. So far, so bad. So, out of nowhere, Testi (as the "good" psychopath) and Lester (all 14 when the movie was made) are seen, both naked, in the men's bathroom, Testi furtively lurks the boy's body while shaving, and poor Confused Lester pinned on close-ups of Testi's bare butt. As a member of the film industry still not tired, and a card-carrying liberal (I was as anti-censorship as today), the whole movie made me sick (and being the early 70's when I thought ... I already I saw everything in the movie "What's Happening" in this liberated era - including the uncut version of Altman's "Cold Day in the Park," a true dropper until cut to an "R" note and would have written The End of Altman's career if he had not created something called "M * A * S * H"), I still wonder if anyone but me has ever seen "Redneck" and was shocked as I was. Destroying the actors and the audience that goes to the movies is the joy that misfit filmmakers have been allowing since the beginning of time. But maliciously exploiting a highly respected and talented child actor (Lester) at a time when he was beginning to make the difficult transaction from child to adult actor (and I'm sure his cinematographic offerings had thus lessened to such nonsense as "Redneck" ") ... Narcissus, you should have been ashamed of your head." (Incidentally, I was about to make friends with actors who appeared in the future, Narizzano's indistinct efforts.
