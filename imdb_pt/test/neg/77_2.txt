OK, my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of them and this is absurdly praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I caught this on TV (uncut, like the TV here shows all the movies, this is for you Americans who can say which I did not like because I saw a TV version cut off - fortunately, that's just a US thing), and I had no idea what it was. I called, got the last minutes of a show and the movie started. Within a minute, I was begging it was a comedy, given the ridiculous clich√© beginning (yes, it's a bad movie inside the movie, I know, but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! I do not even know why I did not change the channel) . And, yes, in fact, the film turned out to be a comedy, albeit unintentional. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is pretty enough, but damn, what a horrible performance! Although choosing a foreigner for the role is smart enough (she does not talk so badly for now), still, sorry, Marina, playing dumb does not mean imitating Harpo Marx. Her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments, just look at her when she draws an X in the air while being chased by the killer. He wants to kill you, it's not the time to play Zorro. We have a lot of things "running upstairs" going through tension, like in the worst slashers, and things like pulling a carpet and a badly thrown guy in the other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? However, the best / worst pearl is to have an electrocuted guy in a bathtub and ... Well, I've never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub, but I'm sure you can not see the cartoon blue rays on the real life, you? And how about immediately trusting an evil guy because he says he's a police officer and does not ask him to show you his credentials? Okay, so he ends up being a real cop. But still, not asking for the badge does not make sense (in terms of plot, we can always think that the credentials may be fake or he may be a dishonest cop.). What about the big turnaround? Do not tell me you have not seen this coming from 200 miles away ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless filming cameo. Now I think about it, what's the point in giving him a "Mystery Guest Star" credit ... on the END titles? The movie is over, there is no more mystery, and everyone and their brother have identified Guinness (even those who are not moviegoers will recognize "the old one from 'Star Wars'"). Even better so that we can pretend that he is not the great actor. <br /> <br /> People keep comparing this to Hitchcock, to all people. I suppose it must be John Hitchcock the milkman, as the late Sir Alfred would feel ashamed to watch this, much less do it. And this gets a 6.8 / 10 ???? It's 100 bottom material! But then, we're talking about a rating system that allows "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" to appear as the third best movie ever made (see Top 100), so ... <br /> / 2 / 10
