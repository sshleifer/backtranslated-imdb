***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I suppose you should not expect too much from a movie for TV, but this was especially bad, the plot was a good idea but poorly done , the performance was not particularly good. And the end of the movie was just terrible. The main character was perfectly normal throughout the movie, and suddenly, when we discovered she was the killer, she turns out to be a mentally challenged psychopath. It's completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> Is there just one reason to actually watch this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, even though we have not seen her in a swimsuit before? Do not worry, even seeing this loss of time, if you want a movie about the beauty contest world, then watch "Gorgeous Dead Drop" instead, it's just an infinite number of times better.
