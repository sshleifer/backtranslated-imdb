"Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen "Because of Winn-Dixie" instead. I must say it's partly my fault, because I agreed to go see him with him. Being a fan of the first movie "Mask" (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I hoped it was not as bad as all the critics said. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes after the movie I knew it. was going to disaster. Disgusting and useless attempts at being funny made seven-and-eight-year-olds giggle, but the rest of us stared at the screen in disbelief. <br /> <br /> Finding the movie as repulsive and bland as me It was surprising even to me, as I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman," two movies that many people I know find it crude and offensive. But the thing is, "Son of the Mask" is not funny unless you are less than ten years old. <br /> <br /> The movie features many CGI, but it can not save that piece of crap. Whoever allowed this movie to reach the big screen was probably thinking that it had potential considering the success of its original. Unfortunately, it lacks none of the laughter, fun or excitement of the first, creating a derision of the original film. I recommend renting the original "Mask" for anyone who is thinking of seeing this. 1 star of 10 is generous to this terrible mess.
