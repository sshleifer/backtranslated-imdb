'A comedy of biblical proportions!' Those masters of hyperbole, the writers of the movie line, did it again; the sequel to Bruce Almighty's 2003, almost no laughing. The only thing that sparks my interest in this film above total indifference is its dogmatic Christian dogmas. Sorry, do it. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrel, ignoring Jim Carrey's good sense of refusing reprisal, plays Evan Baxter, the famous Bruce Almighty host, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving to a house the size of the Acropolis, the pressure of any change affects his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), evidently from Stepford, and three children (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), who do a job of looking sad with a piano accompaniment, pray for the family to approach and almost by fault, so does Evan. <br /> <br /> In what must be the greatest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) really does appear, but the whole thing 'working in a mysterious way' is unpleasant. the place, telling Evan to build an ark of Noah-esquire in preparation for a great flood instead of just giving him a pool table or and X-box or something. And in the true mischievous deity style, he also forces Evan to grow a beard, long hair and wear tattered, tattered clothes. Now, back in the day, I'm sure shaving blades were hard to find, so the beard was a bit unavoidable for Noah, but I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with spirituality. The same with the robes; a massive building job is surely hampered by such impractical garments. Could not God have invented a pair of steel boots and a hard hat for the poor boy? Apparently no. To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I think the idea that God is messing with us is a bit unsettling, and so is Evan, who fights him every step of the way. And who would not? God essentially causes him to be fired, drives away his loved ones, makes him a mockery, and at one point really threatens him. Of course God is right, and the rational, hardworking man who was doing well alone is forced to eat a large slice of bittersweet and humble pie. It's almost like being left alone by God, Evan had to put up with it and humor him. What kind of message is this? <br /> <br /> The Evan Almighty has a highly commendable environmental approach, with the underlying theme being that the Federal Government is blind to the damage done to the world around us. It is also the first film to offset its carbon emissions and this should certainly be considered a landmark achievement by a Hollywood studio. If it were not for the banal, patronizing flag of American Christianity flying high, Evan Almighty could have been a harmless family film with an environmental record worthy of praise. But with his confused religious dogma and his relentless message of "blind faith", he is considered one of the most disgusting movies of all time.
