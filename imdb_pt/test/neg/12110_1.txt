The director of this film is a famous French TV presenter, Patrick Sebastien. He likes music and humor for the rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. It is the story of a retarded young woman, called "Zep" (sic). One night, he sees the sexual relationship of his sister's SM and decides to do the same thing: he rapes the girl he loves! Zep is placed in an asylum and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. A man will find them. A man will gather them. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an angel from hell. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! With too much use of clich√©s, we will see how Absolute Love can break all misunderstandings, and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with his rapist. We'll also learn how to use sandwiches to seduce a girl. Not only does Patrick Sebastien think he can do better than a century of psychiatry, but he also imposes on us an idiotic left-wing ideology; with the character of his father's girlfriend, a boss, who wants to get the weak from his girl. Distressing. But it's very nice to laugh at the Zep (mentally retarded people are not funny except in this movie).
