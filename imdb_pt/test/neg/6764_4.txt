Some unnamed aliens on a ship far from a distant planet have sent the giant robot Kronos to steal the world from their energy. They have a prototype of clanking by Mexico to open and if it is successful, more will be sent. It would certainly take a long time for this Kronos to accomplish this task. <br /> <br /> For reasons I can not explain, the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist John Emery who telepathically directs Kronos to his mission. first targets. Since Emery is killed later and the monster seems to work fine without Emery as controller, why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> In any case, scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon, who work with Emery, make no mistake about their nature. And of course they create a plan to deal with the furious metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect movie for the fifties, bandits are never seen out there, trying to undermine humanity. . It's a perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> Players seem to be having a great time speaking so many clich√©d lines that writers could put in the script. I get the impression that Kronos is the kind of movie that Ed Wood could have done with a bigger budget with a little more care.
