WEBS is a very strange movie, although slightly watchable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who is sucked into a parallel Earth invaded by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was made on a modest budget, which explains the limited locations, and the somewhat boring script that manages to do very little with a rather interesting premise. Basically, a 90-minute episode of the TV show "Sliders," and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other movies of the genre)
