I'll say one thing to Herman, USA: It will probably always work well for the Minnesota public. I can not imagine there's anywhere else in the world where a reference to Bemidji's quick life or a line like "I knew there was something wrong with the Iowa guys" would topple the house. I really enjoyed the first hour, more or less. Basically, a bunch of lonely boys takes a dating ad and finds their city surrounded by female suitors (are suitors a specific word of the genre?). It's not progressive, of course, but it's kind of charming in itself. Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to create a planned subplot about a deceitful conspirator and her violent husband. Overall, it's a lot of fun for your own good, but you have to give some props to a movie with the courage to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin a naked love scene. I will always applaud the depiction of people who do not meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual and caring human beings, but that is not enough to rescue Herman, USA. To paraphrase Jello Biafra, it is nostalgia for an age that never existed.
