Made and released at a time when the internet was becoming huge, this is a plot that Hitchcock would have loved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not around to do that, and we end up with an occasional thriller, but mostly foolish, which is kept (badly) together by Bullock's intelligence. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995, but is already dated, and the amount of errors and inaccuracies regarding computers should be seen to be believed. , and you do not even need to be a dot.com person to identify them!
