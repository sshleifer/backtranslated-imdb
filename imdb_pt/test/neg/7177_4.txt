Two-page boys working on a radio network range from trying to solve murders until they appear in a black face between shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller star in this 1945 movie. With lots of quick talk, everyone yells at everyone, and the two boys call the "Marty" police detective (played by Ralph Sanford). It is a true "shortie" at 59 minutes, and has the feel of being adapted from a play, as it occurs mostly in a radio station studio. We really do not care about any of the characters, which is probably why it's almost never shown. Nothing more. This was Phil Karlson's second film as director. We got no clue as to who might be knocking people down, so we just followed the police detective and the guys on the page while everyone tries to solve the mystery first. I will not say no more to give no spoilers.
