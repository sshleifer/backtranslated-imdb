I usually do not consider turning off a movie unless it's really bad. Homegrown is a movie that I wish I had not called. The plot is interesting, but the performance and the writing are very low. I did not care about the characters. Any movie that has drug use and free nudity as a highlight is not to be commended. The characters spent their time getting stoned and believe me, that's the only way to watch this movie.
