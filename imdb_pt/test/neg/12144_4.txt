This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It's quite brave and realistic, not exploring the characters, but it's not that interesting either, and Billy Dee's character, though mistreated by white authority figures, does not seem to be nice. It is also hampered by the extremely low budget. Still, it is interesting to see what a good description of the social issues of the 1970s is.
