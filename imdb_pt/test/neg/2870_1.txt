I kind of like Bam Margera, so I was curious. <br /> <br /> But watching a home-made production with someone else's friends and family, with a decent camera and a cool guy, is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Writing, directing, acting and editing sucks at best. But I sat down for half of it. It's because? <br /> <br /> This film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it is the dream of a film student to avoid at all stages of the process. Cram-it into film school curricula all over the set! <br /> <br /> So thanx Bam! Now I know that Jackass is real - because you do not want to win an Oscar, dude :)
