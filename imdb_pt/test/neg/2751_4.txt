I've read a lot of comments on IMDb (well, all five of those that were written at the time I'm writing this) and I'm amazed at the amount of compliments heaped on the Bridal Groom, which is undoubtedly one of the smaller comedies performed by the Stooges. I prefer the older ones, where it was Larry, Curly and Moe, though Shemp got credit for most of the funny scenes from Singing a Song of the Six Pants, another short Stooges that is only moderately entertaining, but far superior to the Brideless Groom. In fact, there is a slightly entertaining scene in the movie, the "no-hit-a-lady" scene, which is a little fun and is 15 minutes from the movie. Not very promising in a 17-minute comedy. Shemp is a voice coach whose uncle passed away and left a $ 500,000 inheritance, as long as he gets married in 48 hours, which is a short enough warning. is, but by the time Shemp learns, he has only 7 hours remaining. This is a premise that has been made and redone before, but it was not, in my opinion, a huge clich√© at the time this movie was made, as it is now. There are a number of jokes throughout the film, none of which is close to the level of comedy for which the Three Stooges are so well known. Does the Stooges seem to have encountered the same problems that plagued so many Shirley Temple films? there is very little trust in the content and a lot of confidence just in the fact that they are there. The standard features of the Stooges are here, Moe is the mean, whose meanness is certainly not used sparingly in this film, and the comedic sound effects (though with more exceptions than normal) are quite fun, but they're plugged into their standard slots in this movie. The line "Hold hands, you lovebirds" is immortal. The rest of the movie is not. There's a lot of talk about the other people who have reviewed this film for this site about being one of the best Stooges shorts, you will not find a weak moment, about how this is the best of them since the first 30 years. Is not true. I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for classics and the giants of early comedy that the Three Stooges certainly are, but that respect is undermined when poorer films are praised more than they should. The Brideless Groom deserves some respect because it's a Stooges movie, but for exactly the same reason, it should have been better. The Three Stooges were just better than that.
