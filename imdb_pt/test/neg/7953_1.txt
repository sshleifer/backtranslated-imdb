Maybe you have to be an ex-hippie to fully appreciate this, because in addition to some fashions, music and dated dialogues, this has nothing to do today. <br /> <br /> Four college students who love fun art students enjoy carefree days of painting nude models and riding a motorcycle. They take acid in a scene and go to a zoo. A sign flashes on the screen that says "Do not feed the animals," and suddenly they are in a cage laughing and hanging on a chain tire swing (?!) An evil artist (Larry Swanson) counts (in flashback) as his The artistic career was almost ruined by an incapacitating illness. He sends black-clad zombie henchmen to kidnap people, then injects them with a serum that distorts their faces. It's trying to create a new form of abstract act (I'm guessing here, the data details are a bit confusing, to say the least). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) leaves to save the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) is killed and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate) is abducted. I thought the zombie makeup at ZOMBIE LAKE was awful, but wait until you see it here! It is Douglas Hobart, the star of DEATH CURSE OF TARTU. A small role is played by Brad Grinter, the director of Z-classic BLOOD FREAK, which is much, much nicer than this mortal turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Useless note: 1984 The Regal video release shows the wrong cast (for THE BRIDE WORE BLOOD) printed directly on the video label! <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
