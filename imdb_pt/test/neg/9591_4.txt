A potentially good idea is completely discouraged by a weak script that throws all credibility out the window, leaving the actors very little to work on. Roth covers it the best way possible, being all by mouth; Hurt has as much threat as a cute rabbit and Stamp can not decide whether he's playing a former London thug or a little off the playing fields in Eton. As for poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is no more than the stereotypical Latin-stereotype of the North American woman, who is all sulky and hot-tempered. If you are a fan of any of the leading actors, do not be disappointed or fooled (as I suspect many of the other reviewers have done here). Watch by all means, but remain critical; You know these guys can do better.
