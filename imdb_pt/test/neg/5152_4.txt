The story of the bride's fair is fun and engaging, and it is to the credit of the filmmaker that he sets out to portray the inhabitants of Minnesota with the same respect usually reserved for the inhabitants of the Coast. It is strange, however, to find an independent, single-person film that is as ambitious and clich√© as a Hollywood potentate made by a committee. The picture of the rural people is intended. be gentle, I think, but these characters do not seem true to me - I had some meals in small restaurants, but I have never heard a debate about the merits of different English novelists of the nineteenth century. It may be suggested that the writer / director Semans has no more experience with rural culture than the Coen brothers, and is considerably less satirical.
