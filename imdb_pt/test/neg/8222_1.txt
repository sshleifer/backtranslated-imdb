Wave after wave of nausea without direction - this film wants and at first promises to be peculiar and original, but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and bogged down in dialog based on clich√©s, which turns into a shiver of horror and cheese in the end. Throughout the film we have supposedly found characters off the wall who are actually very annoying and simply do not work much and agitate through the horrible script like men in vest dresses, driving jeeps through mansions and spouting prepotent existential truism accompanied by whinings of Coldplay. The film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a puppy playing with its genitals, which happened twice (a slapstick index, rudimentary humor of the movie in general), but in the end, the movie falls into a 'infinite abyss'' of complete debris and the egocentric ramblings of the director who made me want to pluck my eyes. Watch this movie at your own risk.
