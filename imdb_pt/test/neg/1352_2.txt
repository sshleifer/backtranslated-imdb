To say I was disappointed is a euphemism. An amateur movie made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater on two or three occasions (something I never did). I was stopped by Cloris Leachman, actually. She sounds true, the only one I should say. These new women are less modern than the 1930s George Cukor women. These are "acting" for us trying to be with it, but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it always was in the movies anyway. The fun of the original was based on a clear, vitriolic and very funny script. A magisterial direction and an unrepeatable cast. All the elements that are missing here. TV actresses mingling with role models and Oscar nominees / winners. There was nothing organic about it. The whole thing seemed like a throw, improvised at the moment with no clear purpose. 2/10
