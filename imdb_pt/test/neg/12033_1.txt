First, let me start by saying that this SOUNDED movie is very interesting: A serial killer copying the works of Edgar Allan Poe (who is one of my all time writers). Sounds cool, right? Yes, definitely not. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. And that is not an exaggeration. I've seen a lot of really bad movies. This one takes the cake. And I was even prepared for a bad movie before entering it. <br /> <br /> Maybe the writer should have studied some legal procedure: If you have the name of the killer, the whole story of your life, a criminal record, and your address, where is the first place you should look ? Hmm. . possibly. . . your home? What?! NOT! That's an absurd idea, Anthony! How could you suggest something so obvious and sensible instead of going to a bowling alley? * spoilers end * Honestly, sometimes I can forgive a movie if the writing is good, but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this just all went wrong with what you could find. <br /> <br /> I think my biggest implication was how the police / FBI acted. <br /> <br /> For example: Black FBI Agent: "Ok, female in danger, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot as I walk in and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer It should look good for you? " Moronic FBI agent: "Yes, it looks fine to me. Go ahead. I'll make sure not to focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter." FBI Agent Black: "Excellent, that's what I would do!" Honestly, if you want to be in the police, rent this movie to learn how not to act. . . or if you are a human and want to learn the same. <br /> <br /> 0.5 / 10: A half point just to get a movie produced and in stores. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
