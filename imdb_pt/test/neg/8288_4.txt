I have to say that I'm not a big fan of Troma movies. Granted, I've only seen three of them (or four, including this one), but two (Blood Sucking Freaks and Mother's Day) are widely reputed to be the best, which leads me to believe that all others are not worth seeing. This certainly seems to be the case for Graduation Day, which is a version of Troma on the super-popular slider of the eighties. While the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it is never particularly good; and in the end, all I could think about was 'why did I bother to watch it?' Anyway, the plot sees a girl dying on a race track and soon after; more people are dying. Of course, there are some possible suspects; but it's hard to really care about anything that happens. Of course, in slasher terms; is the blood that is most important, and given the history of the Troma with regard to the red material, I expected buckets of it. There are some decent death scenes, and some of them are bloody; but it's never really shocking, which really makes that other slasher somber based on a commemorative event on the American calendar. It is worth noting that there is a small role in this film for Queen Sleaze Linnea Quigley, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. The direction, plot and execution are all very mundane; and I will say that unless you are a big fan of Troma or someone who wants to track down all the criminals already made; do not bother with this movie.
