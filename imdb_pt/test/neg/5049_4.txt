Ridiculous Thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent their action against them. Interesting premise could yield a good movie, but this is just lame and improbable. Annoyed with an embarrassing ending, just to say the least. Mrs. Mirren tries to dignify this flaw, but even she - a good actress, no doubt - could save that garbage. I give this to 4 (four).
