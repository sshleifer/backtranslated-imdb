Is not it strange how bad movies always tend to be a bit better when you start seeing them with an attitude like, "Boy, this is going to suck more than a few things have sucked before"? Is it practically impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high ?? or even remotely positive - expectations such as "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally regarded as one of the absolute worst gender disasters to be released. The bad reputation of the original ended up being a great advantage for the director Michael Hurst, since it was really easy to surpass the level of quality of his predecessor. And just how embarrassing this must be for Uwe Boll, eh? Having to recognize that a direct video sequence without star power or promotional campaigns is MUCH better than your own interpretation of video games? If someone still doubts: "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not a good horror movie, it's definitely better than the first and it's worth renting if you're looking for something less demanding. Splatter movie with a lot of bloody massacres, sleaze and stupid humor. There is no real connection to the events of the first film (another advantage) and this two part opens up as a rancid sexual comedy that goes on a college campus. The male fraternity club plans to attack a fraternity house, inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with huge breasts, but the party is interrupted when an insane teacher (Sid Haig!) Drives his car for a girl and takes her back to the laboratory to turn her in a zombie. This is the beginning of a rapid and deadly epidemic, but it does not worry because the government is prepared and sends its best scientists and soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and bring back blood samples for an antidote. Hunting zombies seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squad, they even called them Hyper Sapiens, but their steadily increasing amount endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers. Director Hurst has happily found his inspiration in the most eminent classics of the genre, such as "Aliens" by James Cameron and ?? of course - the dead trilogy of George A. Romero, particularly "Day of the Dead." He also did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who inserted video game footage in his film (why?!?) And * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as cut-off female corpses and detailed amputations, but this never becomes nauseating or shocking. Of course, there is not the slightest suspense to be enjoyed and all the terrible clich√©s of horror are also here. The film is a lot of fun as long as storyteller Mark Altman does not try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemic. They are walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls, so we really do not need to know what caused their deaths. Especially when the explanations are given by a whore of the blonde brotherhood who clearly has no idea what all the medical terms mean. Just avoid being bitten, dear.
