Dennis Hopper must be really hungry to make this movie. Special atrocious effects, very poor writing, extravagant dialogues, stupid bio-robots killers. No matter the brazen contempt of science. The strange scene with the two young men takes off their clothes. The best part of this movie was the cyber penis puller on the pirate pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because I'm in a good mood.
