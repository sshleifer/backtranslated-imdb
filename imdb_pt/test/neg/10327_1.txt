This movie is so bad that I wasted so much time already talking about it. Soo bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not even that critical ... I'm almost ashamed to admit that I've seen ... Sandra's few minutes show how far she really did this ... I mean that anything next to it really is a decent Oscar for her ... I suppose the only way she looks at it is that there's no way, but after that ... I suppose she had to start somewhere ... but really ... so bad ... ... really horrible ... bad is a very good word for that s ** t .... but I do not want to be bad now ... but really like you can not after wasting 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of my life I will never go back ... 90 minutes I could have spent doing something better ... like sitting on my butt and staring to space ... that would have been a better time spent ... (goes away shaking his head)
