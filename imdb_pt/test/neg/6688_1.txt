undoubtedly one of the most racially prejudiced films I've ever seen, with prejudice against Hayden Panettiere, since she has to move to a city school. She is constantly called the "white girl" and other insults based on her color. In the first place, would this be permissible if a black girl were to be the target of all abuses? and, secondly, the stereotyping of ethnic children in the urban school is also a shame. The writers apparent desire to show that they were "hip" also extended to miss the point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition, not through talent, but by intimidating their white opponents !! these implications for the film moved the expected direction of a lightweight and harmless comedy suitable for the family audience in a vehicle that does not credit any of the participants. Hayden Panettiere has a star quality, but I would be surprised if anyone from the rest of the class gets too far. All in all a flawless movie that was a waste of time.
