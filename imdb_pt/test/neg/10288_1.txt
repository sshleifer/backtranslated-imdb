After a very scary and crude opening that gives you that creepy "chainsaw massacre", everything collapses. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT: As soon as the two FBI officers start nudging you, you know they're real killers. Anyone who has seen enough of these "cheated" can figure it out. <br /> <br /> This movie is mader with one thing in mind: describe brutal murders. Why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered? Will this be next for us, moviegoers? Torture and child abuse? What is wrong with you? Lynch really has a disgusting and ugly mind.
