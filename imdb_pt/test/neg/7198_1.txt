This is one of the movies that killed the western "spaghetti". Not only does it miss something in translation, but it's also a chaotic total editing mess. Both fragments were edited and / or reissued for an English version. In any case, it makes little or no sense, period. This makes Eastwood's "Trinity" and "Man With No Name" movies look like John Ford / John Wayne in comparison. Nothing in this movie is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a middle and (finally) an end. Except for the end, not everything is exactly in that order. Robert Wood looks very presentable. The rest of the cast, especially the women, should have made better career choices.
