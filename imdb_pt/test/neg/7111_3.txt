I was sick one day and was skimming channels and I came across this terribly rank movie. The plot and even the subplots (if you can find one) were made for extinction. BUT, as bad as the story was, I reserve a special comment for Liza Minelli. His character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters I've ever had the misfortune to see in the movie. Her only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "The Pest" and Julia Stiles in anything she has done (or half done). Maybe she's introduced herself exactly as the script suggested or maybe (moan!) That's the limit she has for her acting range. Anyway, they should have a rewrite and killed her in the first 30 seconds of the movie (for example, as the girl who fell off the porch in Lethal Weapon (I) (but at least she had beautiful breasts)) <br /> < Most humbly submitted ...
