Sometimes I think somewhere in the "Lifetime" office complex there's a room where the writer meets, with a big wheel on the wall - something like the big six in casinos. The latter has many points where you earn even money, and less for larger sums, until perhaps there is a couple that pays more money. <br /> <br /> But I imagine that the wheel of the channel has six different genres in its wheel, with two of them, appears more, labeled "The Psycho Neighbor", or "The Wife with a Dry Past or Secret or Both ". Lifetime movies have some repetitive story lines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> The category "Spouse ..." may have a long-time wife, but some people appear or an event occurs, stating that the good wife was once a prostitute, one of the couple was involved in some or something else on one of the backgrounds is different from presumed - etc., etc., or, as in this movie, one of them entered into the marriage with the most nefarious of the goals. <br /> <br /> A constant, in all its genres, is that the husband or other males are usually ignorant, empty, and slow to get any idea of ​​what the heck is going to climax, or at best , too late in the process (unless the male is the villain). That is not the case here. If the referenced grudge can be the "next," or as in this offering, "the wife," it is always fascinating how easily, successfully and effortlessly, they carry on with their cowardice. acts. They manipulate many of the others, beat them as needed, take on various poses, and juggle more deceptions than you can count - with infallible success until just before the end. <br /> <br /> The main actor here, like many in this channel's movies, is an old hand. I noticed that another movie he starred in was titled "The Perfect Neighbor". <br /> <br /> Finally, the vengeful "perfect wife" in this movie dispatches those on his way with more experience and ease than the more experienced. and competent "button man" in the family of Don Corleone could muster. And I could not help thinking that Jack Nocholson's character, Melvin Udall, "As Good As It Gets," with his massive TOC affliction, could provide advice to the anti-heroine to help deal with the obsession, which was basis. opus.
