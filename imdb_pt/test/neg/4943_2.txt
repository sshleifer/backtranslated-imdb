I'm very disappointed. First of all, the German synchronization is bad. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles) would have been better, but the whole movie looks like the director saw Luna Papa and Black Cat White Cat and tried to produce something in that style as well. But it failed in all respects. It is an incongruous mix of an unbelievable strange story and very childish jokes. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sexual humor. I voted 2, because 1 is the worst, and the other point for 'Sybilla', she is very cute. Sorry - I like 'oriental' movies, but this one is really superfluous.
