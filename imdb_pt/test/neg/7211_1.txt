"Direct-to-video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless it is a direct video sequence to something that went straight to the video in the first place. Despite this, studios have insisted on releasing countless direct video sequences over the years for cult hits. I do not think I need to mention that these sequences are among the worst titles of all time, including THE HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It is fitting that ROAD HOUSE 2 was directed by Scott Ziehl as he was also the man in charge of ruining the series Cruel Intentions. Like its entrance in the trilogy Cruel Intentions, Ziehl takes elements that made of the first ROAD HOUSE a great film, and repeated them without success. This is not a sequel, it's a remake all the way. Several lines of the original are repeated, plotted points are cut and pasted, and scenes are played almost instantly from the first. The only thing that could not be duplicated was the incredible fight scenes, which made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here we have awkwardly directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned and filmed in an hour. Compare this with your predecessor's fight scenes that look like it took months and months to prepare. Ziehl is able to direct action as he did well with the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. The SPIDER, but none of the talents shown there comes in this mess. It's not entirely his fault, because the script is very, very poorly written and awkward. I do not care if something goes straight to the video, a good script is still needed. One should keep this mind while continually producing these movies direct to low budget DVDs. Ignore everything. 1/10
