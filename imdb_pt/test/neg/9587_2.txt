... why watch a TV drama (advertised as a comedy) in which none of the characters are friendly or even interesting? I can kind of see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: the bad interpretations and surprises that he put in "A foot in the grave," etc. I admit the script did a little more effort than most. on British TV at the moment. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold. <br /> <br /> Another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits to watch a video of her and her deceased ex-boyfriend having sex. That was the moment I turned off this program, never to return. <br /> <br /> Q. It is interesting to note that the posters that did not like this series are all British, while those who praise it are mainly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC broadcasted this series, it was ignored by viewers and sank like a rock. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! There will be a second series in the fall of 2007 - though without the male lead. It seems that the BBC has decided to turn it into a more conventional 30-minute sitcom.
