This movie is certainly strange to say the least. The basic plot is for 3 old business partners to invite 2 strangers into their home to return a lost wallet with 10 dollars in it. The two that appear fall in love. The 3 older businessmen die and come back like ghosts to try to help the two young people out. Okay, so that may make sense, but then we have 3 old guys who apparently have some bread living together ... a little weird here ... Harry Carey plays his part of the base, you can not tell if he's a guy cool or really itchy. I mean, really, I've made up my mind, I can handle it. Then there's Richard Carlson playing James Houston from Texas .... hmmmmm, he sounds more like a gentleman from southern Kentucky than a person from Texas. This one is not even close .. So we got the 3 ghosts who would have a better chance of helping the New Orleans Saints win an offside game than really help ... In fact, they really do not help at all and because they are even in the movie is beyond any scope of knowledge .. Silly movie in which a cast of characters act totally out of character .. You can avoid this ..
