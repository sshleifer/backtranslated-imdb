As a cartoon, the movie Spytroops was very bad. It is only 44 minutes long, but several battles occur culminating in the destruction of COBRA headquarters. A downer was the beginning of the movie. An animated battle that was better than the rest of the movie turns out to have been some kind of battle simulation. This was a major turnaround and made the rest of the film lack credibility. Then there was the Wreck issue tied up with his parrot and thrown into some room where no one had checked for several days. What happened to the surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base had only a handful of characters, and the rest were BAT robots. In addition to many aisles, the COBRA base did not seem to have guns, tanks, trucks or any other equipment. Then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created overnight. The plot was silly, even if it was intended for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls, and even Barney The Dinosaur pay more attention to their plots. <br /> <br /> The characters were not bad, except that I could never understand anything that Destro was saying, and the Snake Commander was silly and not much of a villain. In fact, except for Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comical and hardly impressive. The GI Joe characters were very good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and Beach Head were the worst. Shipwreck is written as a goof-ball and Beach Head sounded like a 1990s surfer guy. I think the writer, Larry Hama was trying to make a character that attracted teenagers, but he was a decade off the mark. Just listening to the surf talk from Beach Head in Spicoli (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) I was wondering if the new GI Joes would smoke a dube before the big mission. The CGI was very good, except that Cobra Commander had a spastic walk and the vehicles did not look very realistic. The flying tank and the explosions were not very impressive. Old style animation would have been much better than that. As Hasbro supposedly likes to do cheap things, they got what they paid for. I had trouble watching the whole thing, it was just annoying and lacking soul or spirit GI Joe. Even the old GI Joe commercials would have been better. In fact, the DVD included extras like four or five commercials for the GI Joe Spy Troops, and those commercials were a lot more fun than the movie. The commercials had more fun and children-oriented spirit. The commercials were animated while the film was monotonous.
