It is a fact that this is the first Saudi feature to be screened in theaters, but not in Saudi Arabia, for a simple reason that we do not have cinemas in our great kingdom. Not just a movie theater! The government has banned the opening of movie theaters after Islamic extremists OR religious police (or both) called for closure in the late 1970s and early 1980s, accusing the 7th art of encouraging wrong sex and the like. I do not see a powerful reason why we do not open cinemas !! .. we have many video stores across the kingdom, we watch movies on TV from some satellite channels, we can install the channels "Showtime" and after all the movies in general seems harmless in many ways .. I know many people like going to neighboring countries just to watch some movies. I personally went to Bahrain several times just to watch movies in theaters, because watching it is so much fun, as opposed to watching a movie at home. The Saudis pay for the most expensive movie ticket in the world, we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world has cinemas in every city. That's one of the problems we're having !! The film is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment, which is a large company owned by Saudi prince-magnate Alwaleed Bin Talal (the eighth richest man in the world). <br /> The title of the movie is a word literally means "how are you?" but it's also a slang means "what's happening!" sometimes used as a slang to say "evil" about something and is sometimes used as a slang to tell someone politely to take care of their business and not interfere in subjects of another person. Anyway, I think they wanted to say (how are you) and (what's happening!) At the same time, I may be wrong. <br /> <br /> Male actors are from Saudi Arabia as Hisham Abdulrahman, who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st Prize at Arabian Realty Show more like "American Idol", he works on some programs of TV as the Arabic version of "Cash Taxi" .. the other famous actor is Khaled Sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor. Other actors like Mishal Al-Mutairi, Turki Al-Yusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and work on some TV shows. Female actresses are non-Saudi and did a great job speaking the Saudi accent. The Jordanian actress More Hamdan in the lead role & the actress Emerita Fatima Al-Hawsani ... not that we do not have Saudi actresses, but they are few and not so good. A Saudi critic "Rja Al-Mutairi" who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper (the most popular newspaper in the kingdom) wrote about him saying "we can not expect too much from the first Saudi feature. we can not judge him under the usual standards like any other film. It is a fact that the film had a great financial success in its opening days only in the Kingdom of Bahrain. controversial issues within Saudi society such as: women driving cars, thoughts of low depth about the arts, tutelage of society by a certain group and the differences between being conservative and being one The ideas are good but you feel you are Lost in the middle of the movie One of the advantages of the film is the beautiful score of Rajeh Dawood, which was good, but sometimes does not match or express what is in the picture. Commitment was the best next to Mais Hamdan. The biggest loser is the lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman, who was behind the supporting actors Mishal Al-Mutairi, Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami. good work within the limits of their roles. <br /> <br /> after all, "Keif al-hal?" even with all its disadvantages still an OK movie and it is a very good 1st step of Rotana .. and the film has become the people's and streets' speech that it is a golden goal to make a strong debate within Saudi society about films in General until they become aware of the importance of seventh art and other arts. PS: There is another Saudi filmmaker "Abdullah Almohaisen" who claims to have directed the first Saudi film entitled "Shadows of Silence". <br /> I have not seen the movie yet .. I hope I have been helpful.
