This film had a very intricate plot and a very artificial scenario, which I frankly could not follow, which is surprising considering that the acting and the dialogue could have been only the product of writing in a kindergarten. If you like Kathy Ireland then you might want to see this. The film was probably made as a vehicle to try to get her to Hollywood, but if that was her goal, I would have to say that I hope she has not invested much money in her production.
