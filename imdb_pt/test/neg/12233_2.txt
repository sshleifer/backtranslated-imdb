One would think that since this movie has a bad rep I would be exaggerating when I say I hated this movie. But I am seriously this movie was so stupid and so bland, and a waste of time. I mean after the first 30 , I had a big headache and the smile I had on my face (which was preparing to laugh) was ending. When the movie ended I was so happy and because I had good expectations that it would be funny I was extremely disappointed.The acting is not great, the comedy moments are lame and bland.Hardly everything is good about this because I laughed as maybe 2 parts. In general, this is so annoying and I can not tell you how terrible this is, I think this could be used as a suicide technique. I mean I do not think for some it's even assistible. So my Final words about this are, avoid at all costs.
