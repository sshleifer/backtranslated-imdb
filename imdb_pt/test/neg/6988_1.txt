I've been watching this movie since it started playing, about an hour ago, and I have to say, this is an hour of my life I've wasted and I will not go back, The acting sucks and the scripts need a look seriously, and whoever writes them needs to be slapped, maybe the TV will explode and get me out of my misery ... The only good thing about this movie is that for boys and girls it has a good visual effect, most of which I would like to disappear, with regard to film, special effects like sh * t, Dante? Whoever thinks a guy dressed in tight leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most women in this movie, Dante's voice is pathetic, no one finds it threatening or scary. please TV I beg you to explode !!!!!!!!!!
