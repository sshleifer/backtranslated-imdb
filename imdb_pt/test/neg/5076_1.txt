The film "Chaos" bears the name of Gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. What does the book or anything related to the contents of the book have to do with the plot of the movie "Chaos"? Anything. The filmmakers seem to have leafed through the book (obviously without understanding anything about it) looking for a "theme" to unite the series of mundane action sequences that cover the fragile series of events that act instead of a plot in the film. In this regard, the film "Choas" resembles the Canadian effort "Cube", in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridicule of the plot is not noticed: in "Cube" a lot of prime numbers are pitched so that viewers attribute their lack of understanding to the lack of knowledge about cousins: the same approach is taken in "Chaos": disconnected extracts from Gleick's books are pitched to make the villain's actions in the film look devilishly intelligent. This, of course, is an outrageously condescending treatment of the public, and any literate Chaos viewer who can stand all through the movie will be perplexed. How could such a bad movie be made? Rewritten as a novel, the story of "Chaos" probably would not even cross the desk of a literary agent's desk. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away at what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone, except for those who took money from the movie? As for what's in the movie, every performance is called. Save for technical flaws, it would be surprising if more than one outlet were used for any scene. The story is uniformly insane: the last time I saw a disconnected story was the production of an eight-year-old. Among other massive deficiencies are the following: The bad guy leaves clues for the police to follow. He has no reason to leave such tips. The police do not carry or use radios. Duplices of the villain have no reason to act in conjunction with the villain. Let me strongly recommend that no one watch this movie. If there are any other movies that you enjoy (or just do not hate), watch this.
