The filmmakers were clearly drugged. That's the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this caricature of Jane Austen's adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a gothic novel. But this movie was made as if it were a gothic novel. The bizarre music and dream sequences for me suggest drug-induced hallucinations instead of an innocent naive girl with an overactive imagination, as Catherine's novel is ... <br /> <br /> The actress who played Catherine is around Eyes wide-eyed all the time. Peter Firth seems at least 10 years older to play Henry and he really seemed a bit on the gay side to me. I do not see the attraction between him and Catherine. The portrait of John Thorpe was rather strange, but Isabella really was not that bad. But nothing could save this movie PIECE OF CRAP! One more thing - This film invents a character who is not in the book, a French friend of General Tilney, "The Marchioness". Why they exactly added it is beyond me. It must have been the drugs. She is scary, beyond belief, with white base, red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face (dimples?). <br /> <br /> You'd think that would be at least fun in a "so bad." is good "quality but unfortunately, it is not. It's just bad.
