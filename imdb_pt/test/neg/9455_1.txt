Bought for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Wood acting, lame effects and a terrible plot, everything turns into a movie that you have no reason to want to see. PV is one of those movies that does not even have the grace to be bad in a fun way, instead, this bile seems to try to become offensively dull, stupid and bullshit as humanly as possible. <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a serum that he sells to elders as a facilitator of life, and those who take it are under his control. A former lab trainee joins a nurse to try to stop him. Someone should have stopped the manufacturers of this garbage. <br /> <br /> Nobody has any reason to see this movie, and I'm really shocked at the human race, claiming that at the time of writing, 2 people gave this atrocity 10 out of 10.
