With David Arquette starring you would immediately think this would be a stupid movie. Well, it's a stupid movie with a horrible script. But the F / X, that is, the eight-legged aberrations, makes this movie a hoot to watch. A tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creatures of the 1950s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) ask for help in fighting the toxic waste-induced giants that wreak havoc on their small town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.
