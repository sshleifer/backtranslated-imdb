For a horror movie, this is incredibly annoying. Some memorable and horrible bits can not compensate for a very bad script. Very little coherence is achieved, and the film relentlessly exaggerates its basic idea (a killer cat) until it becomes repetitive - and things get even worse with the constant use of shots from the cat's point of view.
