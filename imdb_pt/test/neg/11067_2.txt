I had not laughed that much in a long time - or saw a movie so inept! Talking about it was so bad it made me laugh! <br /> <br /> First, I estimate that in about 40% of the length of the movie, I did not know what was going on, or even what I was seeing. I can only describe the work of the camera as frantic encounters the LSD. There are entire segments, long minutes, where all you can see are blurred flashes and wall fragments of caves, people and various other unidentifiable things. I spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was going on, but they could not keep up with anything better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are the "black" moments, when in an effort to scare us (woooooooo) everyone's lights go out and the screen goes black - and I do not mean just for a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I think the blank film is a way to keep costs down ... <br /> <br /> I suspect the "director" recently read a book about all the "must-do" to make a film of terror, and decided to throw them all in - about 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this movie: 1 / It's short at 90 minutes (although still an hour and a half is too long!) 2 / All characters die (after all, it's impossible to worry about any one of them). 3 / There was a genuinely good scene - when the group is looking at the well, they descend, after discovering that their rope fell to the bottom (saw THAT), a large stone is pushed through the opening, sealing them. I hope so, and it was really creepy. <br /> <br /> And what happens to the first scenes of the fire with the shot, after the shot, after the shot passing behind the lights of the camp. I swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure that after the first death, the same EXACT blood footage on the cave floor is used twice 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, a piece of crap movie. I watch almost anything, but that's close to where I drew the line.
