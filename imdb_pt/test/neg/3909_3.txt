If you're one of those people who does not really like science fiction because of their sometimes unlikely ideas and surreal world outlooks, you better stay as far away as you can from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! It's an absurd space adventure, full of eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous twists. In all honesty I would probably never have cared about this movie, were it not for Gordon's name in the credits. This guy comes very close to being a genius of the horror genre, with undeniable landmarks like From Beyond and Re-Animator on his resume. Apparently, Stuart Gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible! He was once completely on top of the comedy once (with Re-Animator), but with the slight difference that bizarre humor was effective there. Something that is not really the case with Space Truckers - most of the jokes go nowhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. In the end, all that remains is an occasionally fun but completely unnecessary mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a semi-dance of Charles) are always a joy to see and the still stunning Barbara Crampton has a small role near the end of the film. Crampton was the regular heroine of Stuart Gordon in earlier horror films. The story of Space Truckers is as silly as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the lonely self-made who is fed up with his job. Who would not be when you haul pigs across the galaxy to a company called Interpork? He sees his change to flee as he brings his muse to earth. They float on space pirates and discover that their cargo serves to destroy half of the universe! Stuart Gordon wisely went back to horror again after this short break. Since Space Truckers, he has already made the sublime 'King of Ants' and the absolutely brilliant 'Dagon'
