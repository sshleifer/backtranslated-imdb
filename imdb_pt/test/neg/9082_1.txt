It's hard to believe that there are some people in the world who really think this is a vehicle worthy of Charles Bronson. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than give a gun and bring down bad guys. He was moving discreetly in the TV movie "Yes Virginia, There's a Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in Sean Penn's "The Indian Runner." In "The Evil" That Men Do, "however, Bronson again plays a character who sees injustice and adjusts it with fists, knives and, of course, weapons. you have not seen the last five "Death Wish" movies. <br /> <br /> Wait, I accept that.This has to be the most sadistic and violent repulsive movie Bronson ever had the dis-service of being in. Not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture, but in the fact that these scenes were put in a movie just to sell tickets And Jos√© Ferrer What in blue flames was he doing here ?! I mean, he won an Oscar, for crying loud !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, sorry for that blast.Let me just say that "The evil that men do" has to be one of the worst movies I've ever done I saw that it was based on a book.Yes, that's right.I wonder if it was written with Bronson in mind? <br /> <br /> No star.Watch "Death Wish" in your place. At least, TI was topical.
