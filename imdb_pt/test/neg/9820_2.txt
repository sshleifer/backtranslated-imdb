I'm assuming the compliments on this page were from people who have never read the book - Unfortunately for those of us who love the text, Hollywood has excelled in destroying this one. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where the woman of love came from, except that she replaced the cat, or why our Rogue Male got a helping family in Blighty - Actually, the vast majority of the book was cut out and replaced by his normal and rude love. story. The ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was completely removed and our Rogue was given a name (none of them appeared until the second book). <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. Joan Bennett overcomes Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins for miles and this goes a small way to save him. <br /> <br /> Oh, well - the English should probably avoid this. Trust me :)
