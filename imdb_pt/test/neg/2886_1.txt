A man is building a hotel with a partner. He finds out that the hotel is super safe. Things just get worse. This movie has a lot of scenes. They must have been put together in someone's sleep. It jumps from one place to another. Do not focus on anything for long. The end begins on Christmas morning with a fire in the hotel. It then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to the time of day. The DVD soundtrack is horrible. It takes a fair plot and becomes the worst movie I've had on the scene for a long time.
