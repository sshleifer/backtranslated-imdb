Although there is much to recommend about Maetel Legend, both in concept and finished product, the film is ultimately a bad movie. In short, it is a rereading of Maetel's early life, which is usually not clear; at the same time, writers seize the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire. And as Leiji Matsumoto has difficulty not including his other work, we have a starting point for Emeraldas, his sister, His mother: the Queen of La Metalle and a bit of the Galaxy Express 999 to give body to the film. In short, Maetel is a princess of the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, which means that its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and its artificial sun is dying The Planet grows colder and colder throughout history, thus increasing the sense of destruction. In order to protect her subjects and family, the queen decides that mechanization is the only way to ensure the survival of the La Metalle personnel. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg that provides the means to work. Through the film, the characters are left to question mechanization, will they still be human? Can Hardgear be trusted? Do souls and hearts remain? So for a fan of Matsumoto's work, there's a lot to like, questions to be answered, continued themes, except that it's obvious that the film should be an introduction as well as a curiosity of the fans. The negatives, above all the animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a TV series more than 20 years ago has sloppy mouth animation and sometimes sketchy character design, Maetel Legend has all the worst features of modern animation and therefore , gets an air of respectability for Galaxy Express 999. The design is well detailed, but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well-designed characters that 'slide', as the backgrounds move or the camera zooms, a quick way to animate. However, the few animated yes scenes are repeatedly reused in dream sequences, replay and extra scenes. Anyone who looks like the movie will wonder how often Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> After the story, while in the concept everything looks great, the finished product is actually a series of conversations of The plot that repeats itself repeatedly and with little effect, the number of times the characters meet the same problems and learn the same things is practically an insult to the public and the characters, who are apparently much more articulate in previous incarnations. Add to all this some terrible character design, which seems lifeless, more exaggerated, and the audience gets such a flawed movie that it could well have been rewritten as a different movie, at least the newcomers would not be confused. /> <br /> And yet, really have their moments, the end, at least, is amazing. The suffering of the citizens of La Metalle was quite disturbing and with disturbing reason; I think I find all this man-machine theme distressing. It is difficult to know who to recommend the Maetel Legend, since it is not well animated, written or executed, and confusing when the mandatory cross reference of Leiji Matsumoto is presented. However, I can not help but rejoice when the magnificent entrance of Three-Nine takes place, now it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 of 5 stars, 2 if you are a fan.
