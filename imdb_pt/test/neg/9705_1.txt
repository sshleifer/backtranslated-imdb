Sorry to say, but I was disappointed in the movie. It was very hasty, because I suppose you can understand a film version of Pride & Prejudice and I felt that many of the main scenes were covered up just to go through the story. As the film is so rushed, unfortunately you can not really know and feel much about each of the characters. <br /> <br /> Not only that, this movie is boring. I say that with a capital letter B. 1/3 of the way I started to yawn and could not wait for the movie to end. As I read the book and watched the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to pass before I could finally leave the theater. Mr. Darcy, whoever you are in this movie, you definitely can not act. He also seems too young to play Mr. Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed as if he needs to get through the script or something. Where's the buildup? At first, he seems confused with everything. He's just bizarre! Everything seems put. <br /> <br /> I was trying not to compare to Colin Firth's version, but if you love this version, you'll probably be disappointed anyway. <br /> <br /> The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as a kind of ladylike fashion, and was not raised in a squaller. Her dresses indicate she may be the poorest peasant in all of England. <br /> <br /> I did not agree with some scenes from the movie, which I do not think would be considered appropriate. in this society for men to do these things, honestly, Mr. Bingley, who has wealth, should know better. There are some things that say that sound very modern for the period in which this film goes, and not like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly donee, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. And that laugh of his !!! I Wickham hardly has a presence and Mr. and Mrs. Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. Keira did okay, but it's not the same.
