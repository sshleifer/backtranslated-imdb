I watched this out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and watched many of the other TV shows and movies the main characters worked on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and the script is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero research on the bad science that is propagated throughout the movie, or in martial arts (that several cast members get involved throughout the film, although clearly have no training in martial arts) do)) training makes the plot already implausible even less credible. The same gun (loaded by Michael Shanks), when thrown to the side of a mountain, causes extreme damage, but when thrown indoors on the wall made of wicker, creates a small effect of fireworks without damaging the wicker structure - OK , I suppose Michael Shanks fans will be sued for seeing that in Stargate SG1, where a personal weapon creates a burn on the surface of a main character, or explodes a hole in a section of the castle wall as needed), but still so ... god 'eats one of the faithful the way a dog would eat - the snakes simply do not behave like that. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of an Amazon warrior cult on a distant planet is foolish at best. Matriarchal societies have always been based on the lack of understanding that men are necessary in the process of propagation of the species-for example, the Picts, who did not discover the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century-when the balance of power has shifted from women to men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science - particularly medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist at this level of scientific knowledge is purely based on the original author's wet dream. Of course, the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author did not know anything about it either (except for a few keywords he may have heard in other movies). Still, it could have been done better - as "She" in 1965, for example, which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence, much more convincing, and even after 45 years seems more recent than this fetid exercise of stupidity. Marching some women around in 'armor', pouting aggressively, and spitting their lines like a child looking for a fight in a nightclub ('Come on then! I'll do you!' Style), seems to be oversimplifying the complexities of a culture matriarchal. <br /> <br /> Cultural references are so simple - 'everyone greets the snake mother' sums it all up. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variation. <br /> <br /> There's nothing clever, thought-provoking, interesting, visually exciting or remotely entertaining about this movie. The soundtrack is of similar quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the few positive reviews that this movie has received are from Michael Shanks, who is going to give a little bit of all he is involved with. Do not be fooled. Low budgets are not a reason a movie fails - cheap B movies can be brilliant. This is not one of them, and there is no reason to inflict this movie on yourself.
