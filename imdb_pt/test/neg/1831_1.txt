Anatomie is not very original in the horror genre, it's actually not at all scary. It reminds me of his American cousins, horror slashers. It's just a copy of any other horror slasher and, like a German movie, it's too American with nothing to add. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anatomie is predictable and boring, its plot is not intact and consistent. There are idiot scenes that do not even fit into a horror movie genre. Fun sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why do they need to have it all in just one movie? They should have made a cheap German adult film instead. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone because it's too boring.
