I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this terrific Showtime horror anthology series, but this was easily the worst of the group. Is very bad. Part of this may be due to the poor selection, if strange, of the source materials. Why Joe did not just write an original, I have no idea. Instead, we have this episode where the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the scenario, everything, and in the end I was wondering if it could get even worse, and I will not ruin everything ... but it ended up getting worse. How stinky for such a talented creative team. Skip this one and buy John Carpenter instead. He manages to balance all elements: horror, humor, character, vision and it's fun. Coming home is as much fun as having a bear kicking you when you sleep.
