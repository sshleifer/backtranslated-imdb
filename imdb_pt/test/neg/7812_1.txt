To be fair, I could not bear to watch this movie until the end, so I have no idea if it suddenly gets better in the middle of the movie. But the first 30 minutes or so are among the worst I've seen in a while. Children under the age of twelve can have fun with bad humor, poorly written, directed and directed, but adults with full control of all their faculties should avoid that stench.
