Like most other people, I saw this movie in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it has received some well-deserved barbs, it is one of the best films to be shown in this program. <br /> <br /> The premise is better than even the blockbuster Hollywood success these days; poses some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes intrusive, it also provides some lovely moments when Richard is walking down the river. Watching the movie, you can see where many plot developments probably looked very good on paper. Richard's discomfort in modern society is an interesting problem to ponder, and the ending would probably have been a good example of the 1970s if the earlier issues had not been so funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is visibly cheap, making the glitches even more obvious. The "clone farm" is obviously a college campus, and a beer can serves as the main plot point. Lena and Richard do not have chemistry - we think this is a meeting of like minds, but there does not seem to be a brain cell between them. The schtick "old and cranky couple" also gets very old, very fast. There are also some mistakes that can be attributed to bad driving choices such as the decision to keep a climax conversation out of the reach of any audio equipment. <br /> <br /> In general, a noble effort, but still better visualized in MST3K.
