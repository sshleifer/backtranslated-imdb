It's a rare sensation to find such an embarrassing movie that you feel like moving away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked and copulating couples, that is exactly what you will want to do. Add to that Peter O'Toole as Emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell with syphilis sticking a finger in the anus of a male victim, and you begin to realize that Caligula is only of interest to sick / outrageous movie addicts. The film depicts the life of the famous Roman emperor Caligula (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, beheadings, betrayals, murders, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Although Caligula was totally crazy in real life and probably succumbed to his basic instincts often, the film is still inexcusable filth. Sex in the film is not used as an aspect in a multi-layer story - sex is history. After a while, all nudity, hip thrust, and nipple suctioning become tedious due to sheer repetition. The performances are totally undisciplined, especially McDowell, who plays caution in the wind and gives a performance that is all the wide-eyed posture. O'Toole seems to be treating the script with the scorn it deserves (surely it's in it just for the money?!). Rumors abound that additional pornographic scenes were added without the director's consent during post-production, but in fact there is not a single minute in Caligula that is dignified or well done. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will be played again in a porn movie, so in that sense, Caligula is a unique experience ... on the other hand, it is so monumentally horrible that perhaps the fact of being " -an-type "be a blessing in disguise.
