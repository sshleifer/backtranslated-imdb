Sometimes intentionally extravagant, at other times unintentionally silly (as in the opening scene where a woman is "informed" that she was raped and her family was slaughtered, just for the sake of exposure), this movie is not funny enough nor competent enough (as a simple adventure story) to be really enjoyable. I'll let you decide what might be the highlight, but the low point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with her fresh face and firm, lightly muscled body (and I think her dark red hair fits perfectly), but Schwarzenegger does one of her few colorless presentations like Calidor.
