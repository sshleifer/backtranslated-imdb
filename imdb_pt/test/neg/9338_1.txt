In short this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> I understand it's a Disney movie, which are usually shallow films with mediocre scenarios and poor acting. However, I must say that this is the worst of all Disney movies, with poor acting, MANY IRRITATION OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS (my god), and an extremely unreal plot. Even at the age of 12, there is no way I liked this movie. The only way this movie could have been worse is if they tried to put it in theaters or tried to sell it at a local video store. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and change the channel before you watch, no matter how bored you are on a Sunday afternoon.
