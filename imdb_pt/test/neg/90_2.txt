The only reason this movie does not get a (horrible) vote is that the performance of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb. Ida Lupino, who is adorable as usual, becomes increasingly disturbed while trying various means to get rid of a madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as the ominous stranger whose character, driven only by his troubled mind, changes from minute to minute. Apparently simple and docile, he suddenly becomes intelligent and menacing. Lupine's character was in greater danger of the house he lived in and of his own stupidity than of anyone who appeared. She could not leave her house: the windows did not open, the front and back doors were locked and unlocked inside with a key. You could not have designed a worse fire trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution of even having an extra key. She also could not figure out how to get help from her neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked out of her captor's field of vision. I do not know in which war her husband was killed, but if it was World War II, the furniture in her house, the styles of the clothes, especially the children and the coach of the telephone company, are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find.
