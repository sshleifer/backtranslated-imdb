I read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux mysteries. When I read 'In The Electric Mist with the Confederate Dead' was being filmed and Tommy Lee Jones was playing the lead, I was thrilled. After watching him last night, I ended up hanging him off with about twenty minutes, not wanting to see more people being killed or beaten. Do not get me wrong, I do not care about blood and blood - I love 'The Untouchables' and 'The Godfather Trilogy'. Maybe it was just that I had already seen 'Birth' and 'What Just Happened' before watching this. I know that Burke's books are violent, lyrical and especially in the case of 'In The Electric Mist', they may be like the Cajun marshes he writes, full of things that are never fully explained. In a book, that's fine. In a movie, this is confusing. Many of the previous reviewers are also fervent admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. Either they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt it was a waste of talent in general - they gave good performances in a film that did not hold together. Now, I say this, having seen only the US DVD and hoping that Tavernier's cut would make a huge difference. On the plus side: the soundtrack was marvelous. The scenes at Robicheaux's place were perfect-as I imagined the bait shop. Mary Steenburgen was excellent as Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux as Batista. If you read the books, you know why Robicheaux is a balanced person at the beginning of the movie, and then starts hitting people with various instruments. Overall, I wish they had filmed more of the 'Electric Mist and the Dead Confederates' and left out large portions of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his bond with Dave, as well as Dave's to the General. So I would not be feeling today like I did last night when I hung up, "What happened?"
