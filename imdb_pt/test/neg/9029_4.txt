Supposedly the "true story" of Juana de Castilla, the eldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes, the same one who financed the Columbus expedition), the film records the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, Archduke Philip of Austria. , known as "The Handsome" (and played in a rather uninteresting way by the Italian Daniele Liotti, at its buttery and muscular point here). This is a familiar story that sounds like a moan in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. intrigue, betrayal, and robbery. He drips the destructive lust from beginning to end. But while La Reine Margot manages to make cruel sensuality and unscrupulous intrigue fun to watch, Juana La Loca simply can not. He ends up feeling like a big-budget, under-performing, lazy or overly interested novel. Liotti looks positively bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title role? although to be fair she can mature into a suitable talent? seems to be struggling, changing from room to room, and second, with a two-dimensional look of tough teenage hysteria all along. Some of the supporting cast are OK, with the exception of Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pinup-up, voluptuous and handsome, but really no "actress" to speak of. In fact, I could not feel any concern for any character, nor did I feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains. What a waste of a substantial movie budget! This, unfortunately, is so rhetorical and deja-vu, waving to other films of the genre and not to its source of material - history - as inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical era deserved a far superior filmmaker to evoke it.
