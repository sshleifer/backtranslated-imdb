and nothing else. <br /> <br /> One of my friends bought the Problem Child Tantrum Package (it contains the first two "Problem Child" on a disc), and we decided to watch the sequel because it was "funnier". There were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all I need to say), Nippy, the dog, after eating CHOW DOWN and many others. The movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it's hilarious. In addition to the funny moments, this movie has little to offer. <br /> <br /> John Ritter annoys me because it looks like he's reading a book. Man can not act in this, sorry. <br /> <br /> Although I can not tell if I would find the movie funny right now ... (we were stunned when we watched), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day ... but nothing more. Do not expect Oscar material about it, folks.
