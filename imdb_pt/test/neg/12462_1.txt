As a rule, I try to find as many movies as I can to enjoy them. I did not make exceptions with "Tart", doing my best to enjoy it for what it was. But no effort, however great, could salvage that sorry regret for a movie. <br /> <br /> Failed for several reasons. In the first place, cinematography was without direction and ineffective. Secondly, the script has reached depths of 'poor' who have taken it well and truly beyond the category 'so bad it's good'. Thirdly, the acting left the mind boggling to be desired - it was terrible, really it was. Anyone who has seen Mischa Barton (seen here as the extraordinarily terrible Grace, a character so poorly invented and realized that Ja Ja Binks does not look so bad) as Devon in John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs" will wonder what went wrong between then and now . Perhaps, if she had received a character that was worth being bothered with, and a bit of direction, she could at least have given this film a redeeming feature. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Finally, the film seemed to have no meaning, not expressing anything, not achieving anything. Actually, I wonder why Christina Wayne bothered. <br /> <br /> "Tart" made a weak attempt to be something, and failed. The result - a movie, unfortunately, so bad that it's very, very bad. Do not bother - it really is not worth it.
