This owes much to the plot of the BOLD CAPTAINS. Although he is quite grown up, it is in part the story of a wealthy boy who is hanged as a crew member aboard a cargo ship and becomes a man in the process. Moran's title is a boy's girl also raised on a vessel owned by his father. When the cargo burns, she and the crew members are evacuated to our boy's ship. However, the captain has contraband in his mind and his intentions are not honorable with regard to Moran. The inevitable follows - our boy falls in love with the male Moran and her for him. In the end, evil is subdued and lovers are united. Some interesting dialogues indicate that Moran does not belong to any man - "and no woman". (A nod to Sappho here). Dorothy Dalton is appropriately asexual as Moran and is not very attractive either. Valentino does well in a role of romantic action. His sexy and physical build are shown off advantage and the role is quite masculine. He is very attractive. This is not a great movie, but it does pass the time. What really shows is the beauty and sensuality of Valentino.
