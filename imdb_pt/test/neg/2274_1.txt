Well, Anne is very old. Wentworth looks younger than she and he should not. Louisa is very young and very cheerful Oh sister Mary is very beautiful. She should be average, not pretty. When this actress complains about the way Maria owes everything I think she's too pretty to be a claimant. Lady Russell is very old. This is crazy. If you read the novel, she is Anne's most mature friend, perhaps as old as Annes's mother, who would be about 18 to 20 years older than Anne - then, around 50 years NO! It's crazy, it's no good. How is Anne so happy at first? She smiles when she says, "Oh, the worst is over, I've seen it now, the worst is over." OK, if anyone saw Roger Michell's 1995 version, you can not compare these two. That one is right. This one is far away. Read the novel and you will know what I mean.
