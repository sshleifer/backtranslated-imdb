Any Russian movie fan will have a hard time believing in the sub-par spectacles that Mashkov and Bodrov Jr. have called, and may be completely baffled by Bodrov Sr.'s banal and confused script, which is combined with a strangely weak direction. . Most characters roam the movie as if they did not know who they are or what they are doing. It's also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills have not advanced at all since FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and her on-screen exposure is mercifully limited. This is a terrible Mafia movie; so much so that GODFATHER III looks like a winner in the genre. To see the most important Russians, check out Bodrov Sr.'s work on PRISIONEIROS DAS MONTANHAS (which also includes Jr.), Mashkov's turn on VOR (THE THIEF) and Bodrov Jr.'s new criminal in BRAT.
