In 1913, at Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children on the farm and after an explosion, a group of children are buried alive. Nowadays, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness, when family savings were spent on treatment. Without money, she moves with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay home at night, and Sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes friends with Mary, the mother believes that she is an imaginary friend. However, when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah chase her near the mine. <br /> <br /> "Wicked Little Things" is not a totally bad movie: acting is good; the makeup is creepy; and the cinematography and score are excellent. However, the story and hence the script are very weak, in fact a bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, with a widow moving to a home in a remote location because the family spent all its resources on the patriarch's illness. But when it arrives, coincidentally the little zombies attack people with no consequence, for example, families do not look for missing persons. Then the wicked Mr. Carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical cliché that he will die in the end. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah is running away with her mother and says she's tired and can not run anymore, it's one of the dumbest phrases I've ever seen in a horror movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Zombies"
