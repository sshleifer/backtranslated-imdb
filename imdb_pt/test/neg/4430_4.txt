This outdated adaptation creeps along the plot of Dickens's wonderful book, substituting the emotional impact for hurried transitions and any external locations with drawings. It is not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to question the point of doing this in the first place when there is neither time nor money to do it justice. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is very kind at first, causing his transformation to have no power, and this is not aided by his lack of reaction as he observes the visions. The other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley) to non-compromising (Bernard Lee) to seeming to be about to forget their lines (John Le Mesurier). You do not even earn points for effort, to be honest.
