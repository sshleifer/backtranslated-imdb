Gee, the beginning got where the first stopped (good start). Then down the hill from there. You looked like you were watching TV and you keep switching between this teen novel, a Predator movie, and some low-key detective show. The characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the last 45 minutes (the characters of the teen novel and the real story of the Alien). <br /> <br /> So, to the end, the producers quickly went broke and decided to end the film, so they decided to drop a nuclear bomb in the city. <br /> <br /> PS - What's the crap business with the cameras being so magnified you can not tell what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers, do a good job with fight scenes and get as far as we can see the fight.
