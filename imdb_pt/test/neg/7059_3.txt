It was not long before Halloween had started the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continual mediocrity. As early as 1983, the genre was already struggling to launch more than three decent offers a year, and in '88, talisman and slash became practically the boy of horror movies. At that time, all the major studios were aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a profitable direction, leaving the independent and almost inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that John Carpenter had created. Although there were still an impressive number of features reaching the shelves in '88, most of them were poorly produced and taken as a whole, they were eminently unpleasant. With that being said, there were some jewels among the rubble. Scott Spiegel's Intruder in its uncut form was an excellent classic, while Evil Dead Trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely finished in style and coolness. William Lustig's Maniac Cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and, two years later, Dead Girls and Mirage proved to be the latest seductive breaths of life in the crisis category. <br /> <br /> It was the continuous release of schlock as Berserker. , Blood Lake and Rush Week that cursed the horror film to eight years of obscurity. He finally took the great budgetary exorbitance of the Scream of Wes Craven to provide the necessary resuscitation. Having heard nothing of the Warrior Devil before I came upon him unexpectedly, I immediately assumed that it was part of the low-browed garbage that led to the fall of the slasher phase. But with that, the film presents an intriguing premise that fits comfortably alongside Scalps and Camping Del Terrore as yet another welcome addition to the catalog of indigenous influences. <br /> <br /> A truck parks on a forest road two ridiculously dramatized country boys. The woodcutters are only onscreen for about ten seconds and then killed by an invisible threat. Then we come across a troupe of five young adults who are going to the same spot for a practice shot-shotgun spot on some of the local wildlife. The area is owned by Neil Willard and was broadcast through three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian healer who had been rumored to have left a curse on the estate. According to legend, every ten years a Demonic Warrior with an extreme hatred for humanity pursues the forest, taking revenge on those he considers responsible for the theft of the tribe's house. It would not be much fun if these myths were a lie, as regular as a maniac killer appears with blood taste. Will the children be able to stop this ghost killer? <br /> <br /> Demon Warrior is best described as a larger budget (but still woefully cheap) re-scalp image of Fred Olen Ray. The bogeymen of both films are virtually identical and the director even spear a scalpel sequence to confirm my suspicions. Things start promisingly with a first person cinematography on Friday through Friday and a couple of shock surprises that were composed with finesse by director Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway did a good job with photography and the tribal drum sheet makes a refreshing change from the more traditional synthesizer trash of the late eighties. Thriller flurries are juxtaposed with a pair of credible steering beauties and there are even a few attempts at humor. The killer seemed successful in demonic robes and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main weapon of the crime was a skilful touch of the director. <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray's notorious slasher was notable for its lack of credibility and credibility. atmosphere. Unfortunately, despite being produced with twice the budget, Demon Warrior never comes close to the movie that mimics so desperately. There are rumors that most of the actors were recruited at Baylor University in Texas and were not even paid for their inclusion in the film, so of course needless to say that the dramas are appropriately abysmal. I especially liked the hilarious John Langione ?? an "Italian" Native American (do not ask) who portrays as much excitement as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. Warrior started with some credible glimpses of the director's brio that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index. Unfortunately, the venomous cocktail of hideous performance and a final ripped out directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan I had in mind for a rating. Too bad the dramas had been so scraped from the bottom of the barrel because sometimes Demon Warrior showed flashes of potential. <br /> <br /> All in all, is Patterson's movie a mix of ideas? some of them were good, but most were incredibly mediocre. Because this was released at a time when the slasher genre was diluted to avoid the happy scissors censors, there really is no blood worth mentioning. Even the scalping sequence is relatively mild compared to the graphic representation of Olen Ray. Demon Warrior has a strange moment of credibility, but not enough to warrant a purchase. Not as bad as the aforementioned Berserker, Blood Lake and others, but it's not really that good ...
