Gargoyle begins late at night in 'Romania 1532' while a peasant (Daniela Nane) travels on her horse and cart tending to her own business when the moonlit clouds over a live Gargoyle descends and attacks, she manages to escape from the Gargoyle and takes place in a castle of some description where an infuriated crowd of local villagers and a priest are able to put an end to the Gargoyle, or so they think ... Cut to today Bucharest, where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are about to negotiate the safe return of the son of a wealthy American ambassador to their kidnappers. In search of one of the hijackers, Griffin loses him on the roof of a building, but finds a large pool of blood and no visible sign of what has happened to him. Meanwhile, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are renovating a church when Gregor's (Mihai Bisericanu) church worker informs Richard that he has found some ancient relic, the two investigate and find a cave with lots of slimy cocoons and a very angry and very lively Gargoyle who wastes no time killing them both. Griffin & Wells are in the case when they are missing and soon realize that local legends of monstrous Gargoyles are true with a local priest named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown) planning to flood the world with them ... <br /> <br /> Co-written , co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorski under his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is another masterpiece that Wynorski can add to his credits, no. The screenplay by Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. Lawrence and Bill Munroe sucks, is uninteresting, monotonous and as simplistic as possible. To begin with, I wondered if there was only one Gargoyle that put all those eggs, because I'm sure I could not get pregnant. How did he survive in that hole for 500 years? What did he eat? How did the priest know he was there? Why did not anyone else find out? Why did the priest want to flood the world with them? To rule this? The Gargoyles will hardly dominate the world and then let some priest simply rule him as a king and if they did what they would be left to rule? Much like the guys who wrote Gargoyle, I do not think he thought of it well, did he? Whichever way I look at it, no matter how I approach it, from whatever angle I try to find out, no matter how many times I try to make a square in the Gargoyles circle it just does not make sense and the story has huge holes in the plot, lapses in logic and it is not so good to start anyway. The character is boring and clich√©, the action repetitive and uninteresting, while the film as a whole is a real hassle to sit. People do illogical things and everything that happens is very convenient, like when the priest tries to convince Griffin that the Gargoyle exists and only one suddenly appears and attacks. The cave full of cocoons is such a rip-off of Aliens (1986) is embarrassing and the ending was lame. The little bit of the big Ferris Wheel at the fair was funny when the guy scoffed at the boys, feared the heights and forced him to participate. Director Wynorski cuts costs and steals scenes from other films in. In fact, the best Gargoyle scene is a car race in Bucharest, but it was taken from the action movie of Jean-Claude Van Damme , Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, no shocks or atmosphere. The special effects are terrible, the CGI Gargoyle seems to belong to a computer game and has little interaction with any live cast member, there are many scenes of people staring into the sky and trying to look scared. There is not even any worthwhile blood to make the thing watchable, there is a terrible decapitation, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the special effects are terrible, but otherwise acceptable, Romanian sites seem appropriately Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and shows with a very cheap look & feel. The acting is not good, a victim of personality bypass that Michael Pare does for the dull heroes. Gargoyle is a fucking movie, flawed in everything a decent creature must strive to achieve. A total waste of 90 minutes, as far as I'm concerned, one to avoid.
