I had high expectations of getting into this movie, but unfortunately, I feel disappointed. I bought for $ 5 on a used VHS location, and the version I bought was the English-dubbed version. The dubbing is horrible, so beware. "Lola" was not as good in this movie as in "Run Lola Run", and the crook came out of nowhere. And "Lola" begins to realize what's happening the second she gets to college. It seems unrealistic to me. I was also wondering if the original version had American songs on the soundtrack ... they looked extremely out of place. Too bad for this movie, I really thought it would rock.
