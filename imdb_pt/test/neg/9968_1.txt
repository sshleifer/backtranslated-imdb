The only thing of interest about this movie is the subject. Taking a look at the "family" of Manson from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. However, trying to understand the incomprehensible is something that really can only be accomplished in a masterpiece - and this is not. <br /> <br /> Presumably, because there was so much information to insert into a screenplay, this movie was done in a fake documentary style with reenactions. The problem is that writing and directing make it impossible to establish the things that make a film watchable, such as character, story, theme, and so on. <br /> <br /> Worse, there is an incredibly weak sub-plot that follows a small band of Mansonites of the past few days as they go after a reporter who is working on a story on the anniversary of the murders. It's dumb and nonsense, and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a great wasted opportunity. The ray of sunshine is the performance of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who in real life did most of the murder. Considering that the female characters come out as giggly airheads in the 1960s flashbacks, Pitman manages to convey the real feeling. <br /> <br /> In short, do not bother with this movie.
