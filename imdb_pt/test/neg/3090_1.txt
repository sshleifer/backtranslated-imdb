what a waste of time! I was expecting cameron diaz better! I guess it was not really her fault for being in a terrible movie. the film does not capture the beauty of europe ..... and was not successful in taking the public to suspense or admiration. weak attempt to tell stories and narrate - the dialogue is monotonous and was not able to convey what sometimes I think simplicity is beauty. without love, energy, electricity on the screen. too bad !!!!!!!! 1
