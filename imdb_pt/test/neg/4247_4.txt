Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid it will not. I hated this movie so much I had to shut it off in the middle of the movie because of the disgust. A lot of time is spent in crying and emotional embarrassment, the point of the character Bullock being devastated by his divorce is hammered into the head of the viewer excessively. Enough!! And why do not we hear more about her ex-husband? He is portrayed as nothing more than a suit that appears from time to time. Something must have made her want to marry him, what was it? What is it about him that makes her so devastated by the divorce? More time could be spent on this instead of one more dose of Bullock lying on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is flamboyant, clich√©d and terrible, much like one of those special "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something. There is no imagination or creativity about anything in this movie, it's all very predictable and therefore annoying. This film also goes into overdrive in the cutter factor, very stupid and not funny as it should be! This is just another one of those horribly made movies "I'm Woman, Hear Me Roar" as well as "Waiting To Exhale". If you want to see "I Am A Woman, Hear Me Roar" films that are truly fun, original and well made, then see "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this crap !! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
