It is very easy to roast, bake, skin and burn this film for all its abundant flaws. It was done by high school students and teachers and an entire community; it shows! Of course, I could examine the script that is simply ridiculous. A monster created from the garbage of a growing Californian city begins to eat trash and carry trash cans throughout the city. Soon this huge beast with wings no less begins to destroy buildings and even plays the "beast and the beast" act with a young high school girl. Luckily for her there is a gang of boys, her ex-boyfriend nicknamed "The Penguin" and the town drunk to help her. The direction is horrible, the production values ​​are terrible, the performance non existent and the pace slow. The film is difficult to sit down - period. However, that being said, it is also a miracle of a movie when you consider that this thing was created by an entire community. You can see all the collective effort of the actors, the current mayor and the actual firefighters and police, even the photos of the local area used. I was also really impressed with all the local companies credited at the end of the film, helping to fund or contribute in some way to the film. When you look at the movie from that perspective, it's really an achievement. I did not know anything about it before I sat down and watched. Now that I've discovered something about it, I'm impressed. But make no mistake - I do not have ... NO ... I want to sit down again.
