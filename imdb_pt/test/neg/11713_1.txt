I saw this movie in a show that was showing bad B movies and trying to get you to buy them. It was basically just a long trailer, but it gave you a good idea of ​​what the movie was about. After seeing the trailer, I thought of renting this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but it could still be fun in a perverse sense. IT IS NOT FUN in any sense of the word. The movie has two (or should I say four) things for that and it's not the number of deaths, it's women. They are hot and very naked and Lovell could be a legitimate actress, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on T & A and tacky dialogues. This is not even a scary or scary movie, unless you're talking about watching the actors trying to act. The value of production is pathetic, performance is worse and writing is the worst. What was the point in making this movie? To scare people? To start the "Massacre of the Electric Saw"? To try to be funny? To show women's breasts? To put a guy's head on a retarded outfit with fake hands and legs? To have a character just say the word "Snow" over and over? In order not to have real violence but to have enough nudity in an attempt to cover up the fact, is there no real plot? To be able to make a sequel to a movie that no one saw or will watch? I made a mistake in getting this movie, do not make that mistake either. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
