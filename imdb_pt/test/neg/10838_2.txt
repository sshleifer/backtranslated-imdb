This was by far one of the worst films in which Sandra Bullock performed. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing screenplays. This is definitely your forte and acting is not. I actually lasted 54 minutes in this movie before getting so bored with it that I felt compelled to leave the theater. It's a hole from the beginning until well, 54 minutes after the movie. The premise of "Guess what happened to me on the way to the ...." was done repeatedly until death. Somehow, it seems like there's nothing funny or romantic about people betraying each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be a fitting movie for their especially impressionable teens who can see Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where writers / producers / directors thought it would be good to show how "smoking" a cigar is acceptable ... while driving ... and having no consequences when caught. I'm not a prude, and I smoked my share when I was younger, but I guarantee I will not take my teenagers to see this and they are solid A & B students. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent " The Net "or" Hope Floats ", which I believe are two of his best works.
