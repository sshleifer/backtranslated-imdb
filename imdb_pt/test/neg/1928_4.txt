..that separates good and memorable movies from movies like this. It's not fun, touching, funny, interesting and sometimes feels a little sub-human. Directors act as if they were from the other world, at worst, when they should be relating to each other and to the public. <br /> <br /> Starts conventionally enough. Rich kid gets a new car for graduation, but the dean says he can not have the car until after the ceremony. However, he has fun, and stops at the diner on the wrong side of the rails for a quick discussion with the local backwoods. Wise-asses the waitress / girlfriend's yokel head. Shockingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn the diner they left three minutes earlier (are not they all within five feet of the gas station?). They said they had to pay the price in court. , so the only reason to keep this 'fish out of water' to stay in town is to think about the scenario that both boys have to help rebuild the restaurant. Worse than that, the rich kid staying with the family of the non-rich kid ... in the living room above the attic. That 'room above the attic' rescued many people who needed a bed ... Rich boy is inexplicably well treated by his girlfriend, who never mentions him that he almost killed her. This is not a good omen, of course, with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained. You do not know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) falls in love with Kelley (Chris Klein), or because Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerable, Leelee completely intolerable, and Josh does not record much impression. The most alive character is the judge who sentences Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild the restaurant. She takes at least one funny remark, which is more than anyone else. Everyone is so grumpy and moodless that you will feel a little lonely if you think of smiling while the movie is on. <br /> <br /> The ending is a way to finish the piece, not the most original, but at least it's over. I do not like spoiling a movie that some girl somewhere in the world can really love, but since I'm not one, I have to. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is not stingy, and although it is not convincing, its innocence and its homemade dialogue come from a nice place. 4/10
