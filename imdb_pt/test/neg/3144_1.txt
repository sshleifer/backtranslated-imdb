Ok, I agree with all of Barney's enemies on this site. I think Barney and his friends are all ugly and obnoxious and the show is very lop and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the thing that struck me most was how Barney introduced Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals in their show when it comes to parents and same-sex relatives. That would not be a big problem if the creators of this program did not use so many disparaging stereotypes of homosexuals. I mean, not all gays wear mascara and they love the colors purple and pink, and not all lesbians are ugly and virile looking with a chest that falls to the abdomen. As a bisexual woman, I think this is terrible for a children's program. If that were South Park, I would not mind, because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality. Many people who watch Barney are small or disabled children who usually can not distinguish fantasy from reality. <br /> <br /> And now that I think about it, Barney seems to be an ugly gay stereotype. . Let's see, he does not have a girlfriend, he is pink in color and wears sequined clothes (yes, it's true) on him. If you claim the rights of gays and bisexuals, stop mocking them in front of people who know nothing better. If Barney was black-faced and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time, the show would be taken off the air before you know it. <br /> <br /> I give this show a negative of five. Do not show your children such hateful crap. There are children's shows that are so less offensive.
