I bought this movie in the hope that it would be another great killer toy movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and I was hoping to see the same here. Boy, was I wrong. Most of the film was not at all scary, and the only time we actually see Pinocchio "alive" is the last scenes of the film. The little girl in the movie, her acting is so bad it's almost laughable. Also, the ending never showed what happened to the doll or what made them put the girl in an asylum or wherever she was at the end of the movie. So in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the "toy killer" genre. If you want a good series of toys, stick with the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's Revenge is a waste of time and money.
