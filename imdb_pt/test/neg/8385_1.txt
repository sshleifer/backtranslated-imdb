This movie was so bad If someone who starred in the movie is reading this, including the director, I hate you! LOL, that blond woman, who was running screaming through the forest. At least, cry more than scream and keep doing DODGY heavy breathing !! and God, if it was the director who solved the cameras, then go back to normal work. No one wants to watch the jaw of a frightened woman all the time. Do not even think about renting or buying or even having a copy of that within a 100-yard radius of your home, as it can be detrimental to people who enjoy good movies. ... When I got home, I thought I rented a movie for the acting and style of the camera.
