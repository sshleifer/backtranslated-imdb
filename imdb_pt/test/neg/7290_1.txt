I wish I could find some good things to say about this animated sequel (but not really a sequel) for "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but this would be a very short comment. The magic that the first one had is nowhere to be found. The animation is very poor everywhere, the characters themselves are not very well designed. The funds and the first plans are also not good. There is very little attention to detail here. And instead of an engaging and engaging story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and do not make much sense. I swear, even the characters seemed bored, and they preferred to be somewhere else. Which says the voice actors were bored and wanted to be somewhere else, at least That's the impression. Some of the same actors return for this disheartening effort, but an integral pair of the success of the first one was Michael J. Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch. I have the distinct impression that this film was played together. to capitalize on the success of the first without There is not much thought or care. But at least Cree Summer returns as the voice of "Kida." That's probably the only good thing about this movie, and even it does not seem to have your heart completely in it. Mind you, I think you could not blame anyone from the cast for not giving it your all considering what they had to work on. Or rather, do not work with it. It's a straightforward movie for video (and I use the term loosely) that should have gone straight to However, shame on Disney. Consumers deserve a lot better than this. This gets a 0/10 and a well deserved in that
