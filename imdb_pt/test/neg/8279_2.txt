"Graduation Day" - <br/> <br/> I bought this movie last week and waited for some time when I could relax and watch some "good" jewelry from the 80s, I got this and "Xtro" to You see, I've never seen any of them. I just watched and realized that my external speakers were connected as well. I just imagine what my neighbors thought when "Felony" started singing their 10-minute hit? I'm sure it was noisy and I'm sure they think I'm weird with this and the sound of the chainsaw and screaming at other movies. <br /> <br /> This was a movie very much like slasher, without suspense, no story, some cool killings, almost like the amateur side, I usually like movies like this, but he just did not click on me, now I I'm going to watch "Xtro" for the 1st time and have a margarita! /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
