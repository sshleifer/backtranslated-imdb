Frederick Forsyth's books are always intrinsically planned, with twists and turns, and usually a grand ending of surprise. This adaptation did not have any of that. Much of what was great about the book (Monk's story and the betrayed agents, the plot to influence the outcome of the Russian election) were completely missing in this book. adaptation. Instead, there is a completely new plot about biological weapons that was a yawn. <br /> <br /> Forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever beyond the reach of the antagonists. The joys of his books have always been the machinations of fulfilling his mission. This film was resigned to shootings and car chases early. Swayze's Monk could also have hung a sign around his neck saying "I AM A SECRET AGENT" for all the attention he drew to himself during the movie. And with all that attention, the amount of time it took the bad guys to catch up with him was amazing. <br /> <br /> Granted there was some energy for this movie, which is why I'm giving it a "3" instead of a "1". It was also great to see some underutilized pros like Patrick Bergin, Ben Cross, Michael York and Barry Morse. <br /> <br /> I hope someday someone will do justice to a film adaptation of Forsyth as "Day of the Jackal" did.
