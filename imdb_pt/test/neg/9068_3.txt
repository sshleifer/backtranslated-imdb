Do not worry - there are no spoilers here, just saying there is a very predictable plot. A couple decides to live in their father's love nest to write a book / article / newsletter about their adventure with a famous and tragic Hollywood star. All this production worked as a high school troupe doing an episode of "Murder She Wrote". The only performance I was sold in was the hazy old man they interviewed for the sources of the story. Apparently the directors thought the movie was getting too long, so in the end they stopped pointing their camera at some sort of scary image of the star and brought improvements to entangle this thing. Do not waste your time - even the tried and true classics of horror / intrigue fail in this movie.
