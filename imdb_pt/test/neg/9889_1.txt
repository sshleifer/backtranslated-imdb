This direct movie is based on a true story. I do not doubt it. It does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who actually experienced this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a large and large old country house that is really very cheap. Well, as we all know when watching horror movies, when you buy a cheap big house, this usually means that it is haunted in some form or form. In fact, the second time the house is being handed over to Angela, the smartass who lived in the house so far, it takes a moment to "introduce" Angela to one of the ghosts! Nice guy, huh? Angela contacts a psychic and paranormal specialist and tells them that her home is haunted and invites them to come and see the ghosts by themselves. They come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts walking around, sitting on the couch, hanging from the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. Some friends sleep during the night of the party, see the ghosts and promise never to return home. (Check out the girl who moves "I'm so scared I'm so scared." Totally without emotion.If she was so scared, why did not she get up, turned the knob and left ?!) Ghosts do not really do anything threatening, in addition to appearing (and there is no cloudiness or aura about them. They look like ordinary people). They steal celery from the kitchen, move chairs around a POLTERGEIST and a bisexual female ghost seduces Angela, who, take this, does not seem to care! This scene is like the kind of soft-core porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Hmmm ... not that I knew! Hahaha). Actresses are not your typical porn stars though. They should go to the beach and to the gym more. When Angela is not making love to the dead, she gets mad at them and sits alone in a room screaming "Why do not you go away? This is my house! Get out!" They do not leave. I could not help but think of all the times I've heard the psychic Sylvia Brown on TV saying that if you have a ghost in your house, you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say, "Look, you're dead. in other words, get out! "According to Sylvia Brown, as long as you are not hostile and unpleasant about it, they will leave! This movie seems to cost about $ 50 to make. It has a very cheap feel and bad acting. I could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder.
