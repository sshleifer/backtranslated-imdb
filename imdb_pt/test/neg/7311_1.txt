This movie was bad. I believe that Elton (or is Mike) Wong starred. Anyway, it was Wong who did not have that silly smile and looked mean. He plays a man who is hit in the head and suffers brain damage. He recovers and takes revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this movie, but he can not do much. But what little he does seems to make others pale in comparison. In addition, the film has a rubber cheese hawk that the Wong guy controls. This movie is not worth renting or buying.
