This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I do not even watch your life depend on it. <br /> <br /> This Laurel and Hardy movie is when they inherit an island, are shipwrecked and are set to be hung. An incredibly annoying movie that is not even funny. <br /> <br /> This was Laurel and Hardy's last film and a very low note to finish such a superb career. The movies of the 1940s were not great, this movie was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their heyday, the 1930s. The short films spoken are better than the long ones, my favorite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason why this movie is horrible is because it is dubbed. The actor opens his mouth and the words come out three days later. Crap Absoulutley, but let's end up with a high note, Laurel and Hardy were, in my opinion, the best double act ever.
