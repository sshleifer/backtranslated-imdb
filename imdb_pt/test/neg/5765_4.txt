It is an umpteenth shameful reformulation of the same plot in the nth horror film of the young-adult-in-danger-idiots-idiots-idiots of the beginning of the millennium: this time we have the story of a crazy miner who returns from the dead to take their gold back from the hands of the usurpers. We have almost no emotion, almost no naked flesh (even if the girls are really hot only one of them is showing her butt for a few seconds), the usual group of stars of the boulevard horror sun in cameo (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch , John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), lots of fake blood, only the crazy miner resurrected as a zombie is cool enough to leave you stuck - well, not exactly - to the screen until the end. Do not waste your time if you are not a completist.
