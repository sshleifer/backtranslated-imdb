In reporting these events that occurred a few years ago, (hard to believe that this actually happened), I thought, well, there is a basis for an interesting story here. Many secrets were never discovered, the horse was never found, the main conspirators were never captured, and so on. <br /> <br /> However, this movie seems to be distracted by the study of the character, and very little attention was paid to the plot. Some other issues are raised, such as why the heck Mickey Rourke would be in this movie? It's good to see Rourkes' career take off again, but he must cringe at the mention of this garbage. <br /> <br /> If the subject interests you, do an Internet search on the subject, you will be more educated and dare say more entertained. Avoid this.
