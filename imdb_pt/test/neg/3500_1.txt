Terrible, highly invented writing of a "benefactor" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in Los Angeles, or the US today. Positive criticism is a mystery to me - but could only be provided by people who feel that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded, no matter how superficial, simple, and totally unrealistic the results are. If you want to see a movie that deals realistically with the current problems of the L.A. race - the movie you need to see (and probably have seen) is Pulp Fiction. There is more honesty and realism about the breed in any two minutes of the movie than in the full 4 hours (oh, sorry, I only felt 4 hours) of that stench. <br /> <br /> If anyone needs proof that the way to hell is full of good intentions - then this is the movie for you.
