Rabbit fever is one of those quirks of the movie. It is a pleasant 90 minute ride, requires little from the viewer, and offers both, and on any terrestrial TV channel even in prime time, I think Rabbit Fever would be very well received. Which makes me wonder why he was pushed into the theaters. <br /> <br /> The film is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and features six women who have a vicious relationship with the Rabbit Vibrator. The film focuses mainly on the investigation of a supposed quality of dependence for the famous product of sexual help. The narrative is 100% tongue in cheek everywhere. <br /> <br /> The plot is strong, an introduction to some nicely rounded and enjoyable characters, some enjoyable story, peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story, and pleasant conclusions. Unfortunately there is nothing that looks smart or new. <br /> <br /> Rabbit fever has some sharp moments, some switches that suggest what writers are capable of, and all the credit to them is not just 90 minutes of jokes and innuendoes, I could probably watch it with my mother. But there's a bit of laziness about some of the scenes that stop you, those times when you're ready for it, when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a lot of comedy. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I left the theater feeling empathy for the characters but also came away with the bitter thought that someone had made a 90 minute movie made for TV, light entertainment and tried to put it in the national cinema . <br /> <br /> I think the Rabbit Fever reaches a little of what it set out to do, it's a quirky subject, a rounded plot, a well-presented cast and good fun for 90 minutes. But there is nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a cinema environment. Quite the contrary - some commercial breaks would have given the viewer the chance to take a breath of life that Rabbit Fever does not seem to have.
