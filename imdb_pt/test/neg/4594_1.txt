Where to start with 'Speck' is the true story of Richard Speck, a murderer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on some of the low-cost Full Moon Libertar films (such as Birth Rite) and works from here a screenplay by Don Adams (at the time) of the Full Moon. Unfortunately, although the film looks like an accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime, the script is not great, perhaps because the actual ramblings of the Speck were not terribly interesting! Despite the care taken to make this authentic, it results in a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killers of the same period (such as "Ed Gein"). Filmed in a dirty brown, not very sepia, for the most part and narrated by the star Doug Cole the film does not present the horror of crime because the narration is annoying, the coloring distracted from history and crime, although horrible and disturbing. watch is just that and no editorial work seems to have taken place in what is a very poor quality video camera at the events. There is no Speck motivation or life survey, just a cheap shot at a horrible crime. Released by Full Moon there is little evidence of Full Moon's best departure here, Charles Band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings (eg dolls, monsters, and so on) and not knowing what to do with this new reality. Band also introduced a special label for these films called 'Shadow Entertainment'. Banda said he regrets the Full Moon production period alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The Tempe era features uniform editing of Apple Mac and brutal handheld footage, much like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and while Witchouse 3, for example, managed to use them well, Speck is just annoying and rude.
