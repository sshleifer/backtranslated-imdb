This is one of the worst anime series I've ever seen. When I watched the manga magazine in a magazine, I thought it might be interesting, but by the time I got to the chapters, I realized it was complete stupidity. <br /> <br /> OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are correct, and the series has a pattern. But as the plot progresses, it becomes totally incoherent. The series tries to show some mysticism based on Christian mythologies, but it is total stupidity. It has some demons and stigma scenes ... Totally meaningless. It seems that the series tries to appear deeply thought-out, complex, or mythologically revised, but an observer with a bit of cerebral and cultural references will soon realize that all these elements used have no real meaning: THEY ARE THERE ONLY TO IMPRESSION THE OBSERVERS IGNORANTS !! The final chapters are full of totally meaningless elements: battles with devils with cat ears, references to a supposed fight between demons and time controlling demons (for no apparent reason). The final is totally meaningless; an ignorant observer will see in him a floating end that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: THE FINAL AND COMPLETE SERIES IS A TOTAL INCOHERENT AND INCONGRUTH.
