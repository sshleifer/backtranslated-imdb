It's hard to say if this intriguing movie adventure B is a farce, a tribute or simply spoiled, but it does not work the way you look. Based on Michael Crichton's novel, it's a crazy mix of lost cities, giant hippos, monster monkeys, naive visual effects and quarrelsome dialogues. The first thing that harms this knowledge is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language, and it goes without saying that the film does not improve from that moment on. Making all this ancient rope worth it, Tim Curry, turning into a feverish slice of ham and sporting a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that all this is a bunch of crap.
