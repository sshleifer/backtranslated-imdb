The performance of Danny Lee as a playful cop is the only point of interest in this film, despite having an excellent cast including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays a triad chief who wants to settle down in a life of peace and plenty, but Alex Man, a total psychopath who has a strong grudge against the CYF, will not let him. CYF tries to escape to Malacca but without success. After his family is blown to bits, his comrades dead or skinny, wounded and broken, CYF returns to Hong Kong to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Looks much better than it is. CYF is well dressed and handsome, looks distressed, makes a face and cries at the suggestion, but one way or another you just do not care. Andy Lau looks great, but that's about it. Carina Lau has a tiny little part that was cool, but she gets a bullet in the head at the very beginning so this ends. Alex Man is a cartoon villain that he is so exaggerated that at times can be intriguing, but the writing here is so simple that he ends up appearing like crazy over a variety of garden. <br /> <br /> Danny Lee is great though - too bad he's just a little dot on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie. <br /> <br /> Rent, do not buy. Or just skip it altogether. <br /> <br /> This is the continuation of "Rich And Famous", although apparently it was filmed simultaneously; was first launched because of the power of CYF's boxoffice.
