Disney-like entertainment with some non-Disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. Bad comedy alongside moralizations full of clich√©s. Noah like Abraham, Lot as his bad friend. Special laughable effects. Exaggerating acting with bad timing. Sodom and Gommora were destroyed before the Flood? Strange twists and many sub-plots that the Bible does not mention. God as a doubting parent just needs to be entertained whistling before deciding that the world has to be saved from disaster. <br /> <br /> The director of the feature films, John Irvin, adds another failure to his useless list of misguided. movies that seriously lack plot and direction.
