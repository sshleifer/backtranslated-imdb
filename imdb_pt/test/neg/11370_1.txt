Director Jeremiah Checheck, who brought us big budget issues like "The Avengers" and the remake of "Diabolique," directed this copy of the Die Hard concept, made with - it seems - a Blair Witch budget. <br /> <br /> A California nuclear reactor is overtaken by Arab terrorists. But are you ready? terrorists are not Arabs; they are really disgruntled American soldiers disguised as Arabs! We found that they do not really intend to blow up the reactor just making a statement. We're not sure what the statement is, but it does not matter. So there's really no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and blow up the factory because he's kind of crazy. So maybe there's a threat after all. But the army enters and all the bad guys are killed. Then there was no threat. Oh, and a good guy is dead too. Let this be a lesson to all. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds confusing and kind of a waste of time, then you have the idea of ​​what Meltdown is all about. <br /> <br /> The script never bother introducing the characters or even providing personal details that might involve them or emotionally engage the audience. Thus we are left with one-dimensional characters: the specialist-who-nobody-will-listen; the happy sergeant-trigger; the slippery politicians; the dweeby engineers. The story jumps from one cliché incident to the next in a composition made up of just about every action movie you've ever seen. But in almost every turn, when we think something is at stake, the script goes back and we find that there's really nothing to worry about. Like Die Hard, there's a cop standing inside, unbenownst for the bad guys. The big upset is that the cop here is .... A WOMAN! Oh and she's hurt too. But not so bad, just enough to make her shiver a few times. Oh, and instead of the walkie-talkie that Bruce Willis had this cop got a magic cell phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When he's not yelling at everyone Bruce Greenwood - his jaw made of granite - tries to calm her down on the walkie-talkie. He even makes a joke once, but we're afraid his face might crack. After all, this is a serious matter. <br /> <br /> But, in general, it's scene after scene of people arguing: the military specialist is arguing to wait (his reasoning does not seem particularly solid, but he's supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people in the White House argue with him; the army sergeant also argues with him; the good Pakistani nuclear engineer argues with the main terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Movie all the way and lines like, "Stop the broadcast! STOP THE TRANSMISSION !!!" may have you rolling off your couch while you wonder if the characters are actually referring to such nonsense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to compensate for the lack of production quality, the work of the camera is kept hectic in that fake documentary. The Grams style that supposedly imparts immediacy and energy to the scenes, but the way it is indiscriminately and politely applied here is totally annoying; even pretentious. Other attempts to increase the pace are done with the inclusion of nonsense black and white images that are randomly interspersed with the main action. But this is also pretentious and annoying in Blair Witch. In short, the stylistic attempts seem very amateurish. <br /> <br /> Music lives up to the visual - it's synthesized and cheap. More or less like a porn movie, but with less melody and a lot more heartbeat sounds. The graphical treatment is very bad too: cheese charts in red font yell at us "9:28 pm" as if the clock really made some kind of difference. <br /> <br /> Collapse can work as a marketing concept but of course the script was a second thought. FX - part of Fox - joined this tacky production and knocked over several million dollars. Now that's what I call collapse!
