I love comedies and I love independent films, but that was very slow and the mood was extremely regional. I think it would have been better if the main characters were nice, but they were just typical types of genitur√£o, as well as the people who caused problems in the schools for forty years ... I can understand the Great Praise for a young indie filmmaker when it is deserving, but this is an extremely medium movie.
