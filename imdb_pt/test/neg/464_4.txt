the movie is precious and the cage is a baby. <br /> <br /> But will someone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /> <br /> Where is the confrontation? The Ramones ?? misfits social distortion? the sexual cramps cramps?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at least they play the cure. <br /> <br /> In addition, randy's feathered hair and pleated khaki pants ... <br /> <br /> this definitely looks like a movie about "punks" as a bunch of The squares of the film industry see the punks. <br /> <br /> Although it's a 1990s movie, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early '80s.
