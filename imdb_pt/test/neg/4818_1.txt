As a native of New Orleans, I can say that almost everything in this film, from N'Awlins' atrocious dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of Crescent City's geography, is horrible. This is one of those Big Hollywood films that decide to stereotype New Orleans as: 1. A city full of idiots of French sound 2. A city full of people who sound as if they have just come back from the summer house of Blanche Dubois 3 Uma a city of drunks, where every day is Mardi Gras 4. A city of deep mystery, where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo (I admit that it may be a city of drunks, although every day is NOT Mardi Gras). "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies about New Orleans. I would not recommend it to anyone.
