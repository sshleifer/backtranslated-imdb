hair, the movie based on the Broadway hit, can not achieve any redeemable cinematic quality. you can not really get the game and make a movie. if anyone is so tempted by rock music to see this movie, it really slows down the quality of a Broadway show. worse than watching sitcom reruns. musical fiasco, and I can not believe that others rated it so loud.
