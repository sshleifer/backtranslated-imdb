A pretty lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot depends on a pretty decent idea, the writing is deeply thigh and two of the top three teenagers are absurdly wood. The problem is that for the children to go through with their plans, they need to be much more reckless than the one shown, but if they were so mean, it might be difficult for them to be nice, so they end up being even. In fact, I just started liking the movie when I started to wish them dead. One of those films in which in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realize we would not have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe they really would not. Avoid.
