Masters Horror: Sounds Like is set in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as a manager of a software center, having lost his 6-year-old son, Michael (Nicholas Elia), to rare heart disease he thinks has an ultra- sensitive. Larry hears everything tenfold, from people typing on computer keyboards, people whispering across the room, people stamping their feet, dripping taps, and even breathing people become unbearable to Larry as he is constantly bombarded with mental piercing noise. Eventually Larry decides that he has had enough and if he can not stop the noises themselves, then maybe he can stop listening to them with the help of a great intelligent flesh ... <br /> <br /> This co - Canadian-American production was episode 4 of Season 2 of the TV series Masters of Horror, usually written and directed by Brad Anderson. I thought Sounds Like was definitely a lack. The script was based on a short story by Mike O'Driscoll and I'm genuinely surprised at the amount of very positive comments you have here on IMDb right now so to begin with it would be very difficult to even describe this as a horror movie and it seems more a bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes, when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero, and the KNB boys can really do some work. Larry has this strange and inexplicable ability to amplify sounds and noises from the start, so this episode ends like 55 minutes of exactly the same kind of repetition that leads to a bloody ending, although it's too late to save the episode. This is very slow and although it is well written, it is not to be the subject of terror and I am a little confused as to who this should be done? Director Anderson does the right thing, but he just keeps repeating the same things over and over, until the last 5 minutes there's not a single drop of blood on the whole thing. There is no horror, no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically this is very well done, has good production values ​​and does not look like a cheap program made for TV. The acting is very good indeed and it's a shame that the story is a bit limited. <br /> <br /> Sounds Like is one of the worst episodes of Masters of Horror, many people seem to like it and okay, but it's definitely not for me. Another Masters of Horror, another disappointment.
