I liked the understated character Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually', and she is very good at 'Man of the Year'. <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams does not give as much performance, with a few minor exceptions, that was weak. Laura Linney may not have been miscast, but either the issue raped her character, or this was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think it was Barry Levinson who got old. So many weak performances, such unequal results have to be the fault of management. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great at supporting roles. Goldblum plays a sinister side with pleasure, and the combination of Walken's entrepreneur and movie commentator is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But the story is clich√©, the presentation seems to have been (it should have been) very good picture, and many actions are indifferent. The rhythm, the story and the direction are weak compared to, say, "Head Office" (parody of "Secret of My Success").
