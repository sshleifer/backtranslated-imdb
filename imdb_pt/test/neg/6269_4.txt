It's incredible that there were two movies with the same story released in 2005. This one came out the day before that one with Tom Cruise. Did not they do that with Truman Capote the same year, and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Writer / director David Michael Latt did not have the budget of Steven Spielberg and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the protests of Rhett Giles, who played a pastor who was giving up his god. Gary Busey was scary as an LT army.
