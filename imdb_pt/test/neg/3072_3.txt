Terrible. There's no getting around that. A script at the level of a Mexican soap opera, a choice and use of the filming locations that make the film labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantino's work, so poorly made, are more of an insult than anything else. I suspect if it were not for the shameless and untrammeled exploration of the generous curves of Matadinho, no one would struggle to go and watch this movie in any theater. <br /> <br /> These are the types of movies that make me have no desire to watch Portuguese cinema.
