Seven pioneering children strive independently across many miles of Indian territory and the harsh climate to get to Oregon. <br /> <br /> According to the story, young people who traveled alone for long distances - such as the Children's Crusade. '- were manipulated and exploited for being abused and sold as slaves, but these children are very tough and try their best to prevail in fulfilling their goal of making a home westward. The film is a little bit syrupy at times, but it's good for fans of 'The Waltons' and 'Little House on the Prairie'. <br /> <br /> Dean Smith does a cool performance as 'Kit Carson'.
