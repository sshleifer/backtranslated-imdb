I saw this movie being screened before something I rented for a while ago ... and it looked decent. I saw some good things about the Full Moon video, and I thought it was worth a shot ... Unfortunately, that was not good. <br /> <br /> The story is about a bed possessed. A couple moves to a new apartment, discovers the bed and strange things begin to happen. Strange things as the woman discovers eccentric sex. And the man discovers bizarre sex. And the woman takes pictures of the eccentric sex. And the man photographs bizarre sex. And both begin to have dreams about dead people doing perverted sex. You'd think a movie with such an eccentric sex would be nice, right? <br /> <br /> Well .... No. The problem is that this is a horror movie, or at least a suspense and it just does not work. There is little tension, no suspense and no fear. In addition to some disturbing dreams and visions, there is nothing to worry about this couple. The whole movie is basically both having these visions and playing in bed. Of course, you have a monstrous fight at the end ... and a bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular ... There is only one murder, and one good scare, and that's it. <br /> <br /> And the bizarre sex? Have no hope (or anything else). Her idea of ​​eccentric sex is the woman above, fully dressed, trying to strangle her partner with a tie. It's not exactly my idea of ​​a good time.
