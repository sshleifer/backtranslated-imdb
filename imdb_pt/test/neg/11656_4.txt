This was included on the album "Shorts: Volume 2" - a rather boring collection of short films. Shorts are among my favorite movies, but somehow the people who set up this second collection have had a hard time finding quality content - and it was not as good as the first volume or other collections of short films. <br /> <br /> This short film seems to be incomplete. There is a story, but very lacking, that the viewer, like me, feels a bit left out and not accomplished. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (who is a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. You speak with an accent that is sometimes a bit difficult to follow. Given that I'm hard to hear, I certainly would have loved it if it had been closed with subtitles. Anyway, her boyfriend is going to swim while she's dozing. When she wakes up, her dog is gone. She panics and makes the guy follow her all over looking for the dog. They spend most of their time arguing and being unpleasant. So, out of nowhere, they stop for sex. Later, they find the end of the movie for the dog. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, they both looked dysfunctional and unpleasant. She was a demanding and demanding woman and he seemed to have contempt for her. When you wondered why they were together, your little sexual interval showed that bond held them together. <br /> <br /> Some may like the characterizations - I still found people irritating and unreal - more like caricatures than people can know or know. Also, the reward for all this is not worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).
