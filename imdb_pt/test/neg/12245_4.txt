Silly movies have come so far since Mel Brooks in 'The Producers' (1968) said, "Do not be stupid, be smart. Come and join the Nazi party." Brought us lovely movies, like "Young Frankenstein", "Airplane!" And even "Naked Gun". But the good die young. Fortunately, the genre made it through the late 1990s. And then ... Wayan's brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'scary movie'. Suddenly, the word parody was an insinuation to gross sexual jokes. Most of the films claiming to be parodies have since followed suit, including 'Scary Movie 2', 'Date Movie' and the film to kill the 'Epic Movie' genre. Of course, there were some reliefs. There was 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. Will Ferell has become a vehicle that tricks near all sports imaginable. In addition, the Wayans Brothers left Scary Movies and were made by the trusted Zucker Brothers. Although these films have had some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically doomed to be movies loved only by pre-pubescent males who have just discovered what an erection is. People who have not explored the term 'parody' and cut and paste movies together for a quick chuckle. No heart, no brains, just cheap glue. Unfortunately, 'The Comebacks' has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who starred with 'Anchorman' alongside Ferrell) leads a team of opponents to win against a coach (Carl Weathers, famous for 'Happy Gilmore'), who put him back in training. Koechner proved promising as a supporting actor, but as the protagonist in this film, he just seems scripted. It sounds a lot like you're doing a cold reading passionately. In addition, the jokes about being a tired trainer, who throughout the film encourages the team to fail at school and then runs the police in underwear, have been made before. Yes, this is a fake movie. But remember that even spoofs can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a sophisticated view of modern society. Also, reliance on stereotypes will not bring us more laughter (who knew that a movie with talk-talking people could lead to stereotypes of gangsters (not really, but you see)). While I would admit to laughing at least a few times ... it was not on the same level. The football team itself had a lot of stereotypes, including a Mexican, an arrogant athlete, a fat guy, the skeletal nerd and the mentally deficient help. Even the only woman on the team was reduced to a stereotypical female mood, barely clad in little disposition and issuing insinuations. In fact, his character, like most others, never developed. It's a sad state of affairs for this movie. If only he were not so dependent on stupid sexual jokes, he could have done something for himself. In fact, this movie will probably be a cause for jokes alongside 'Epic Movie' for the future. Koechner really deserved better. The script was generally poorly designed, even naming the 'The Toilet Bowl' championship. So yes. Fake movies are dying. There's a movie called 'Meet the Spartans' (be ahead of the trend, boycott now!) That includes a parody of Britney Spears' collapse. So let these children continue to have erections ... but people grow and lose them. We need sustenance. One day, they will learn to stop spoofing and restoring them. Hopefully, one of the heroes will be 'Get Smart', made by master Mel Brooks, which will be released next year. Overall Rating: 2 of 5 (Stars)
