Even in her glasses using geek mode, Kathy Ireland is very easy on the eyes, but her acting is not easy to watch. Most of the actors in the movie either go way beyond the top (besides the "fancy fun") or act a bit embarrassed by being there. The effects and soundtrack are nothing special and relatively low budget. The plot REALLY extends the ability to suspend disbelief. Grab a gift to laugh if it comes in a premium movie channel or network Saturday afternoon TV, but do not waist money on this thing. <br /> <br /> A noteworthy mention for curiosity purposes is that one of the Underground Mafia is played by Deep Roy. Deep is now famous for playing (and doing this well) all the Oompa Loompas in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" by Burton.
