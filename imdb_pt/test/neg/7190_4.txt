Ok, everyone is so excited about this movie that I hardly dare add a negative review, but I just did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say first that I saw the film in Russian language overdub, so I will miss some dialogue, but not much. <br /> <br /> Good things first. There are some hilarious moments (the Elvis impersonator, for example). The actors look good, too, the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the disadvantages of this film. First of all. There is practically no history and the end we already know: Yeltsin wins. So no drama or suspense. They have tried to solve this problem with an emerging case among the actors mentioned above, but this story kind of evaporates. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this film are not funny, they are serious and dangerous. I am willing to believe that flying some spin-doctors from the states helped Yeltsin to win his campaign, but the real interesting questions that must be addressed are: who financed the campaign, what they received in return, how the opposition was treated separately? to show some commercials? <br /> <br /> So what we have here is a film, loosely based on reality (but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without plot or subtract.
