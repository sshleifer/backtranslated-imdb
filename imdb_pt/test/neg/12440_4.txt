If you liked William Hickey in "Prizzi's Honor," he resurrects his character as Don Anthony in "Mob Boss." This is a very weak "Godfather" satire with few laughs. Stuart Whitman seems puzzled by what he's doing at this festival? Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the best efforts in the film, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. Eddie Deezen hesitates between the comedy "Three Stooges" and an imitation of Woody Allen. Fatally flawed, "Mob Boss" is so derivative that boredom quickly outpaces comedy and the movie trails with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense. - MERK
