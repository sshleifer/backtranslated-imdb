Dooley and his canine partner, Jerry Lee are back together in this second sequel (?!?) I honestly had no idea that they did a sequel let alone two. And for a movie that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time, after Dooley retires, he has to mate with his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee to poop. Really elegant stuff. I mean, come now. The original had at least some good laughs. This one does not have one. Jim Belushi looks old and worn out. Both Belushi brothers were great in the 1980s. If John had not died, would he be as bad today as his brother? That thought makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: USA network
