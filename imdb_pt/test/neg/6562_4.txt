That's the only word I can think of to describe this movie. Do not waste it like a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but wasted as a waste of opportunity. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I think of all the Star Trek novels that were written that would have made a much better movie than the story that Shatner chose. The setting was like a medium-sized television episode, while the ending seemed like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first film. Nimoy, directing II-IV, focused on Spock's character - how he faced Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom, and how he handled his emotional life now that he had a chance to get started again. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he did not. We do not know much about Kirk we did not know before. Once again, one of the novels would have been better - try "My Enemy, My Ally" for a very interesting character study about our friend James T. Secondary characters are mostly used for cute, and the subplot of Scotty-Uhura seems off the left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore fans can not find much to enjoy here. Sorry, but it's true.
