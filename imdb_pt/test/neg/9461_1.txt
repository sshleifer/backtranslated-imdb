One of the commentators is wrong. This is not Pat Patterson's only movie and he did not die two years after it was done. He filmed a movie called "Electric Chair" in Pineville, NC. He filmed it a few years after Doctor Gore. Patterson died in the late 70's. I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there !! It sucks too. That was a big deal when the movie came out. No independent horror films were being made in North Carolina. This movie did not help at all. Patterson used to do bloody effects for H. G. Lewis. He was also good at magic. His bloody scenes in the Body Shop were really well done. The film was filmed in a building that also housed a 7/11. You can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes. The budget was less than $ 20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it. Only Patterson could understand. Still ... it's entertainment and it's a classic.
