One can give me a reason why only one American dies in this movie, and when he does, is supposed to be a very emotional scene, but when the Delta Force crew kills hundreds of Russians in slow-motion action scenes, or thousands of Arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you should cheer up and say, "Take this, you non-American monsters!" I know I've used a lot of "slow motion action scenes," but that's because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, in slow motion. Each one of them ... And this squad must be called "Invincible Slow-Motion Bullet," since they appear to have supernatural powers that help them deflect bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they will have some sort of superpower of regeneration, which is all they need to kill the entire non-American army that lies between them and victory. By now nobody cares that they have been asleep by another laughable slow-motion action scene ... That is, if they are not laughing loudly at the bad acting, the extravagant dialogues and the incredibly poor story. What I did was ... The cast is made of unknown actors, who will probably remain unknown, since they do not even play characters. They are just playing guys with guns (and, let's not forget, superpowers) ... The only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not so bad (though they are in slow motion) for a TV movie ... But it's still a crap ... and at the same time it's so bad that it's good ... OK, maybe in the end it gets a little repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
