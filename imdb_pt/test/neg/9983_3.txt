210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or I hear) or the R-rated version released in theaters? Both are terribly terrible, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell said they would like to have never made this movie (the last of the two men reported this in a IMDb interview!), And I can see why. Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and an indifferent attempt at a plot. <br /> <br /> There is not much here, besides cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the movie: "It was like a moment that I would be watching, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians doing it." <br /> <br /> Truth. What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
