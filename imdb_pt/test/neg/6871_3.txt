And one, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> That reason is Margaret Leighton. She is a wonderful actress, on stage and screen. We have little chance of seeing her, however. I think this is especially true in the United States. <br /> <br /> Here she plays a nice role. Not only that, but she is also very pretty and pretends to be a kind of bomb. <br /> <br /> Walter Pigeon does not uphold the Drummond artists' tradition. He is always dependable, but not very fun. He is not a scoundrel or a scoundrel. Consequently, this seemed to me a talent effort with little action or suspense. But take a look at Leighton.
