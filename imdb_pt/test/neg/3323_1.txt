Why did they release this movie about us? It seems they set out to make this film a slap in the face of Anne Rice and all the respectful fans of Vampire Chronicles. Ignores the baseline work provided by Interview with the Vampire, mutilates the plot of the novel and has Stuart Townsend stumbling around drunk. <br /> <br /> Stuart is NOT our Lestat! Our brat, our rebellious adventurer with the best sense of humor. Stuart is a second person, annoying Dracula in black leather. He has NOT read the books or knows the character ... is he illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and yet he made a point of reading the books and getting to know and love Lestat. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, it's not a "Stand Alone" vampire movie, it's plain and simple trash.
