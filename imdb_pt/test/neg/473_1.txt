Let's get something out of the way. I am a HUGE fan of Bruce Campbell, I have the Evil Dead series, I have the action figures, and I have seen Bubba Ho-Tep. I am a fan of laughable horror films, tacky and know how to appreciate the whole "it's so bad it's good" deal. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say the same about this movie. I watched this movie with great expectations, I wanted it to be good, exaggerated, something from the BC that we all know and love. It started promising enough, but after the first 20 minutes I watched the rest of that excuse from the movie as if I had just been shot with tranquilizing darts. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is not bad; two men do not get along, both killed by the same psychopathic woman, half a man's brain is transplanted into the other's head, they argue, disagree, and comedy goes on. <br /> <br /> What killed me was how extremely disorganized and annoying it was! It had the potential, even as a camping movie, to be much better than it was. The plot was boring, even the physical slap of Bruce could not make it work. <br /> <br /> The word can not properly express the ridiculous robot in which the brain of Bruce's wife ends up being placed. Easily the ugliest robot I've ever seen anywhere (even for a B movie.) The whole idea is dumb. <br /> <br /> What the hell was going through Bruce's mind when he made that steaming pile is beyond me. Why Ted Raimi was not rushing to his big brother asking him to put some meaning into Bruce and not to mention a few lessons on how to make a nice movie on a budget is beyond me. <br /> <br /> What a shame Bruce !!!
