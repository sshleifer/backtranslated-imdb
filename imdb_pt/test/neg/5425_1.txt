I can not say I was surprised by this atrocity when I watched a few months or weeks ago (I do not remember). I saw this as a two-part episode of Zoey 101, because that's how they showed up here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed with the Nerd Makeover thing, it's just an example of how unacceptable, demeaning, superficial, negative, biased and stereotyped people in the entertainment business and frankly, I'm extremely annoyed. It was not funny at all. A nerd is a stereotype and makes people very offended. <br /> <br /> Second, people on Zoey 101 have no real problems. Logan has a great house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Zoey is also rich. They never have to deal with the things that today's young people and teenagers need to deal with, such as peer pressure and stereotyped problems. Besides, the actors are horrible. Jamie Lynn Spears does not deserve to be on a television show as successful as Zoey 101 (what's wrong with the world?), She has no talent as an actor. In fact, she's worse than Britney! The Chase and Zoey thing was incredibly predictable, I mean, how could the show continue with Zoey and Chase's courtship? What other problems could they have? Except for the fact that Chase can not get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! The absolute worst 48 minutes of my life watching television. Ever. 0/10 (and that's generous)
