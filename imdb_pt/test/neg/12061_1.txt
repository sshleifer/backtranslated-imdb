I must first mention that as a group of friends we often find entertainment in interesting films that are known to be terrible for the comedy value, hence our Camp Blood rent. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie we rented that had been filmed on what appears to be a camcorder, and it was so bad that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD was returned and a refund was required, with the additional suggestion of some A quality control type is implemented to prevent the garbage being stored. <br /> <br /> Do not do what I did, and let curiosity get the better of you, it's so bad that it's not even funny.
