I really love horror movies and I try to give each one as many credits as possible (or sometimes more), but this is really pushing the ticket ... most of the cast was very capable but hardly any of them could act in all - but, again, think about the writing / dialogue of this mess ... some good makeup, but absolutely special fx ridiculous. After all, I give you 3 out of 10 - and I'm having second thoughts about that!
