Do not be deceived. This is not a zombie movie. Get it out of a guy who loves zombie movies, and who rents them all: the good and the horrendous. Yes, this movie has an extinct sequence of zombies, but it's basically an artistic exercise of existentialist fear, which is a long way from saying it's boring. If you've worked hard all day and want to spend a few hours entertained, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Living Dead" has cheap special effects, mediocre acting and dishonest dialogue. All of this is understandable in an independent, low-budget film, and I can forgive those shortcomings as long as a movie has a fun story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" has almost no history. Also, acting is not ridiculously bad as it is non-existent. All actors seem to have studied at the Buster Keaton School of Wood Faces. Had he killed them to show some emotion? (And no, screaming is not equivalent to emoting). The only character who actually had some pizazz was killed first. Granted, there was another character who briefly held my interest. He looked and acted like Kyle McLachlan channeling Norman Bates, but it was very, very late. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a minuscule detail: the film is a visual medium. That means brightening up your scenes well enough for the viewer to see what's happening. And all those artistic jumps and closes might have looked cool at the time, but all they did was make the movie shocking and confusing. There's nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple and clear way - just look at George Romero's low-budget movie, "Night of the Living Dead," to see how it's done in a superb way. And I know these people had a small budget but if you can not hire the equipment and technicians needed to really make the dialogue audible, then go ahead and make a silent movie (so those Buster Keaton wood guys can really work ). <br /> <br /> I'm going to say this to the movie: the zombies were scary. Unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory, the thicker the better, the zombies here were just shuffled and bloodied faces. In fact, it worked to make them more like us and therefore more frightening. That's the reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1. The sad part of all this is that despite all its flaws, "Rise of the Undead" does not insult its intelligence. The filmmakers really seemed to want to make an original, clever and scary movie, and it's a shame they failed so miserably. If they could just give up the very extravagant edition, buy some extra bulbs, increase the dialogue and create a real story that really go somewhere, so I think they have the talent to do something really good. <Br /> <br /> Trust me: do not waste your time on "Rise of the Undead".
