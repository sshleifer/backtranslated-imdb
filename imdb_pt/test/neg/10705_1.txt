The plot - in the future, when almost all men were killed by a Y chromosome-directing virus, a genetic engineer (hot) "creates" a man in a chemistry lab - is intriguing. Despite the somewhat promising premise, the film falls in almost every respect. The dialogue is laughable. The characters are paper thin. The exploration of a single gendered world is superficial. The worst part of the whole movie is the Asian detective who offers such cheesy and inventive phrases that you will want to vomit. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how this garbage was produced on Earth. Most of the film is male. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are just animals." All women - even the "straight armed cases" - seem to show anger, fear, and hatred for men. If you want to see a science fiction movie something like the movie's premise, you'd better look elsewhere.
