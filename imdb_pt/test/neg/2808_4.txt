I did not expect much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes in which I really laugh, and I think it's pretty bad. There is also no real plot, I always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been placed anywhere in the movie because there is no connection between them. But the worst was the "performance" of Kim Franke. He has a facial expression throughout the film, as if he's playing a retarded guy, but I believe that's not the case. All in all I rate it four out of ten, I've seen movies worse than this, but I would not spend money on this again.
