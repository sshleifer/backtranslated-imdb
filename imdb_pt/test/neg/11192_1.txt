If you want a great April Fool joke, then please show this movie to someone. However, it's important that you do not critique the movie, but talk about what an artistic triumph is and how "they just do not make great movies like this." As his victim witnesses many disjointed and senseless scenes (such as a cute dog being punished for no apparent reason, a cow standing in bed, a woman licking the feet of a statue or Jesus apparently raping a woman), they make many comments using words like "glow," "juxtaposed," or "transcendent" - all the while acting as if the movie really made perfect sense and was not a complete waste of an hour of its life. Also be sure to keep a straight face and pretend to be shocked when (and if) they say they did not understand or thought they had all the art of a cow patty. So, to continue to tinker with them, show them all the comments about the IMDb, since almost everyone (except some trouble makers like Almagz and Rooprect) speaks enthusiastically about the genius and artistic talent of that movie! When you're done with this little riddle, they'll probably think they're idiots and make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> That, to me, is the ONLY possible reason to watch this horrible mess of a movie !!! That, or you can show it to the prisoners in Guantanamo in order to get them to talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous painting of dogs playing poker or an Elvis velvet painting are superior artistically.
