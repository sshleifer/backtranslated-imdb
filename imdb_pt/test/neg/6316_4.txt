Being a big street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I was really looking forward to this movie! <br /> <br /> However, it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose. Most of the characters that I could not associate and just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter movie so superior. <br /> <br /> There are some good points though, the Animation is superb !!!
