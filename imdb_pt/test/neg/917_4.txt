I'm usually a fan of "artistic" and "foreign" movies, but when I saw that my reaction was "it should be called experimental because it does not make sense." The "action" is static and, at the same time, is reflected from one place to another. There are not enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently, the main point was to show that, in the face of murder, adultery and generally strange and dissolute behavior, the healing offered by the powers is to banish a totally innocent Negro.
