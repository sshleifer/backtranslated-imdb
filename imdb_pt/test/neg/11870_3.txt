I am from Romania ... and so I apologize if my English is not so good. <br /> I just saw this movie and I must say that I am extremely disappointed. I've always liked Wesley Snipes movies, but this is terrible. I'm sorry I spent more than 3 hours downloading this movie. There are many mistakes in the movie. For example, the stage in the film is not Lia Manoliu. The name of the stadium is Ghencea. The name of the football team is called Steaua Bucuresti, not Uli. The stadium scoreboard is not able to display graphic images: video replays, live images, etc. It is a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. Uli's opponents (Seaua) are featured on the scoreboard as Din (probably Dinamo Bucuresti - who are the main rivals of Steaua in the Romanian football championship). The pictures of the football match are a match between Steaua Bucuresti and Poli Timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look on the internet and you'll see why). Police cars in the movie are not done properly. There is not a single dark blue police car in Romania! They are all white! The "error list" can continue and continue ... but I will stop here! In short, this movie is horrible. Not worth renting it, it's not worth buying a movie ticket for it, it's not worth downloading it! I sincerely feel that Wesley snipes played in this movie. An earlier movie of your ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in Romania ... it was OK, but that's terrible!
