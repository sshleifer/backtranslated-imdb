In a quiet town, two girls witness the murder of one of their friends for a strange boy named Milo, who lives on the other side of town. After the murder, his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead. Then, sixteen years later, a wedding brings the girls back to their hometown and Claire, a teacher, becomes obsessed with Milo not having died, since she has recurring visions of him and her friends dying one by one and nobody believes her Milo is separated from it. So now, she goes out to discover the horrifying truth. <br /> <br /> When I came across this movie, I was very skeptical about it, especially when I had "From the creators of Anaconda" on the cover. , but reading the little plot outline on the back of the video box sounded good and quite refreshing for a change. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the movie. It seemed difficult to try to be clever and very psychological, but this last element was not very good for me and was basically an extended and unconvincing thriller. Hey, I admit you had your moments, but hardly enough to make it either effectively creepy, or memorable. But, a brave one for the filmmakers, at least the story is not a repeat of those slasher imitators that followed "Scream" and shock horror, is there no self-referential humor evident? in fact, there is not even a touch of humor. Although, perhaps it was very serious? Especially since the plot is somewhat absurd, but that is not their main problem. What a disjointed plot we got, I did not know much about what was happening, since it seems to take a good look at some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. Not! More like irrelevant scenes and yawns that induce cliches that we see from time to time. You can also see some influences from some of the "good" horror movies of the '70s, one of them being "Do not Look Now." That's when our main character continues to see the figure of his past in a slimmer form. The other would have to be one of my favorites "Alice, Sweet Alice," with the person causing the problem wearing a yellow cape and committing terrible deaths. Interesting idea, but comes across rather shallow and many glitches arise. I liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character's childhood, as the performances and circumstances had something scary about it, but when it bends into adulthood it is tiring and monotonous for the most part and the performances were not horrible but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way to put it. Most of the dialogue made me moan, incredulous at how awkward and artificial it was. You'll be screaming "no duh!" on the screen because you just can not believe what you're hearing. The police detective gets the weight of it! <br /> <br /> Quality - the movie is not bad, it's actually better than normal for the video, I would say. Very smooth things. With some inventive and prominent camera angles and a poor score it works reasonably well. Another factor that stood out and was the key to building the melancholic atmosphere were the crawling sound effects and that bicycle bell leaves a ringing sensation in your ears. The scenery of a quiet elementary school was well done and the rest of the action takes place in a house. But, do not expect any suspense or real surprises, as the execution of these does not exist. The deaths are not pleasant and are slightly bloody and are more the consequences of what happens to these bodies, which try to disturb him. The villain of this play, the mean child Milo Jeeder, was slightly unnerving, but the voice and the yellow cape make a mark to begin with, but it seems to lose its effect when we come to the conclusion of the films. The advertising phrases in the video compare him to (Jason), (watch out) Freddy and (this is no kidding) Chucky, but you're kidding me! Right? It is labeled "The new face of evil," yes of course. All he needs is to learn some ways and solve problems. Overall, the movie left me with a bitter taste, as I could have gone without seeing it. I probably wish I had. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect too much in this movie blur. Or, better yet, skip, because you will not lose much, really.
