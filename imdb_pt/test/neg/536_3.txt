This movie stinks greatly. The only reason I gave a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming. It is totally indifferent to a plot and the lack of development of even insubstantial surface character made it seem just a lot of nice designs. This is by far the worst anime that came out of Japan. I can not believe they actually put their names in this crap. What a rip off selling this thing for $ 20. If you have not seen it yet, do not bother. If you have, I pity you.
