Louis Gossett Jr returns to the pit again as Chappy Sinclair goes to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux, who prepares for Jason Gedrick, who wisely refused) to teach a new group of recruits, but this time they uncover corrupt Air Force that deal with toxic waste. This is a series that gets worse and worse with each subsequent entry, but this does not have the zip or even the action to make it worth seeing on the cable. The Iron Eagle IV is directed with such indifference that the dogfights emerge as if we were watching a playstation 2 played by two lobotomized teens. It's horrible to watch and Gossett Jr, who made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do anything as long as he is working. When I look at your post, win the Oscar. Some of his best films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Whereas the last two films have him co-starring Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it is in fact something to say that three guilty pleasure action movies are rushing to their best work. Of course, Mina Enimiga and Diggstown remain their best post-Oscar work. <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
