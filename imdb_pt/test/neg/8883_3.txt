Maybe I missed something, but I found GOYA's GHOSTS a tedious fantasy melodrama. As for the story I was trying to tell, I discovered that a confusing mix that happened in all directions. And perhaps it should have been done by a Spanish director with the appropriate subtitled languages ​​and not with unconvincing English. I can not judge the historical veracity of the story, but it seemed to move along with a similar plot of the "tragic fate of the artist's model," as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. Was the film a commentary on the religious injustices of the Inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what? I never seemed to be able to figure it out. The various characters of Natalie Portman also seemed ridiculously stereotyped. And finally the film was crowned with the final melodrama of a head and a disheveled Bardem body hanging on the edge of the cart going to the sunset - with Ines and Goya following behind from behind! ???? than that?
