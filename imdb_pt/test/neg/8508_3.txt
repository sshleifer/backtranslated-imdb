Firstly, I'm a big fan of Tolkien, and how I'm going to base most of my critics on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure movie, well done with cool special effects, nice sound. follow and act well. Now, if this movie was called something more than the Lord of the Rings, the reviews would not be any good as they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it picks up the basic story of Tolkiens. books but then goes and "hollywoods" all they can, countless scenes from the book are over or missing or changed a lot, the characters are changed from the book too, one thing I think should be punishable! What the film lacks is a deep insight into the characters, I know it's almost impossible to make a good movie with a good book, and it did not work out here anymore, especially the character's motives are obscure. <br /> <br /> As an adventure movie, it would rate 7+ / 10 As an adaptation of Tolkien, it ranks 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean honestly, what the hell was Arwen doing? rivendell ford? And as for the comments that this movie is "the best of all," I can only say that you are much younger, or have not seen good movies ... Peter Jackson should have called this film film. adventure movie based on the Lord of the Rings.
