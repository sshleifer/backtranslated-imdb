This is a movie that revolves around two mysteries (which I have now demystified). First, did the filmmakers understand the concept of 'parody' before using it to bombard the public throughout the film? Parody is when a reproduction tries to mock, comment or honor, through derogatory humor, the original work. In other words, there must be reasons to parody this work, and they should definitely be smart. I did not see any of those in the movie. I saw some horrible 10 second jokes that fell within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said, "Hey, I was drunk last night watching Survivors, and I had that brain fart for a direct DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script ... because I I intend to direct this film without one! "<br /> <br /> And here lies the second mystery: the career of Eric Robert. I used to think Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now I realize it's because he's stupid (and therefore deserves the career he's had). After watching this movie, it is clear that it would have been better if it had entered into adult films, with higher budgets, more ... intense ... scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate plot and attractive lines , and a much larger audience than this movie B reject (C-movie?).
