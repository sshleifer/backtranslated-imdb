I love how everyone treats this show as if it were the next big American comedy. I watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person who approached a real teacher was the guy he loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just beautiful people trying to read the lines written by people who never really entered a real classroom. I loved how all the episodes consisted of the two idiots (one who lay down and one who did not) got into some kind of crazy problem that indirectly involved his students. The British girl who thought she had found a nice quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he was an idiot. The hottie who was there for the specific purpose of being hot, and the main and his footman that served to somehow move the plot almost nonexistent forward. I loved how almost all the teachers in this program were very young, but I ask you to think about your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . they looked like that? Or did you go to school that had middle-aged people teaching you? This is the school everyone else has attended. The program lacked any kind of research on what happens in schools. In public schools, principals do not have the power to raise and dismiss teachers, the school board, but in all the episodes I watched, the principal threatened to dismiss her teachers. Think about your history class. . . . . or think of some history class, have you ever seen an incredibly hot British chick teach an American History class? No. Have you ever seen a teacher room so big that you could actually play basketball? No. Teachers could have been a great show if they had relied on some form of reality. What makes teaching funny is the stories you get from interacting with students, and teachers find it funny because they deal with students every day. The overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching has only caused four more camera sitcoms to have unrealistic people in an unreal environment, saying unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry, I just did not buy it. The show could have been modeled after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and should have focused more on the teacher's relationships with his students and not on each other. <br /> <br /> He gets a star for trying and a star for hot (she was really hot). <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a failed sitcom that went down in history as an attempt to understand a profession. I just hope that if they make another comedy based on teaching, they learn from their mistakes, so a monstrosity like this never touches the television screen.
