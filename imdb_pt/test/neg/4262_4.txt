Amitabh and Jiah Khan, raised high expectations for their press conferences, although it was very easy for the critics, and for the fans as well, that after all, this very inspired product, Ram Gopal Verma Factory, floor, at all odds! Why, because Jiah was so immature and childish, and Bacchan, confused and insecure. they themselves did not know, what the hell they were talking about, to the press, keeping up with the slogan, that some love stories should not be understood, or some trash of that kind! Why is the title Nishabd? Ramu needs to update his knowledge of Sanskrit, since Vidhu Vinod needs to study the Mahabharata, in line, another glorious failure of the year, Eklavya! Comparison with the Sweet Hearts and Lolit's is inevitable, as the so-called plot line has supposedly inspired them. but unfortunately Ramu hardly made a serious effort to plunge deeply into the psyche of aging and young people. Is the lollipop sucking the last indicator of innocence? and contrary to this trace of childishness, the spectacle of legs at the dinner table, with a Vijay, who is Bacchan in that role, exploding in shouts of shameless laughter unceasingly behind wings? this girl, in fact, is in her seductive game, attracting poor Vijay to think, she is in love with him. the legs are also thin enough, and this act of putting the water hose through the legs is pretty obscene. is beyond the understanding of anyone, how can a girl, coming as a guest to the house of a body, be so brazen, bold and overworked? and why the stupid wife, played by Revathi, remarkably well, though scripted and uncharacteristically characterized, encourages her own husband to dance with a sexy young girl? this part of Vijay, trying to get some refreshing into his monotonous life, is absolute bullshit. because apparently it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well-established life and a hobby to recreate. This reminds us of "Blame it on Rio," the older dad, and his young love, superbly played by Michael Caine. Bacchan looks terrible in close-ups and, above all, where, like Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons, he looked elegant and handsome, that's why puppies are sometimes attracted to older men, for their charming personality, compared to boys' vulnerability young. their age. The only good thing about this movie are those green and sprawling landscapes, winding roads and nice cinematography. No substance, or even any bright demonstration of emotions, drama, or even intriguing, stormy sex as in Lolita, this shallow film has no wonder, fell flat on the floor, and had to be taken off the screens during the first few weeks! next time, before copying without thinking any Hollywood theme, Ramu should do his work at home, and Bacchan should think twice! you can not fool all people at all times, Mr. Bacchan!
