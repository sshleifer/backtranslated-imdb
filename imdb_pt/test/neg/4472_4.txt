4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie was not funny at all nor was it worth investing any kind of emotion in the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the funniest .... The rest of the cast does its job, but the story never gets too deep and there are many holes in the plot that are never filled. This was not much fun, though it was funny at times. <br /> <br />
