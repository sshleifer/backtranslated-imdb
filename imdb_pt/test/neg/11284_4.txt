I have to admit that despite all media promotion and being nominated for Oscar, my expectation of the movie was not that high before I watched it. And I actually found what I expected; a film trying to be kind to both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be authentic to foreign viewers and quite funny to everyone. But it must be understood that it is not possible to be favorable to everyone, so the film remains an average for all. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is telling a story that occurred in 24 hours. To fit the story into an entire movie, some scenes are added without a connection to the main story. These are mostly the scenes of selling ice cream to the eccentric local people (ie, goat herder, elderly women, etc.), and each of these sales scenes are tempted to be interesting to the viewers by comic book skits . The subject is mentioned as a universal problem: a local-merchant producer's struggle against holding companies and monopoly, but this was the interesting subject of twenty years earlier. Most readers will remember Ferhan Sensoy's "Grocery Store vs. the Grocery Store" in 1980. This was the correct story at the right time. Soon the story is not strong enough and it pays to be a movie like now. <br /> <br /> Except some gibbers due to the local accent, the performance of the cast is so successful. The lead role is played by Turan Ozdemir with excessive body language, but even so he is successful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, against the limited budget, considerable efforts of the director and the players are obviously giving the film a good mood. . But this is not resulting in a film good enough to compare with the Italian neo-realists or that it is worth being nominated for an Oscar. Note: In real life, normally the ice cream vendor would stop their own production. and be the reseller of one of Manda's competitors.
