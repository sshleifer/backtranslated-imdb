I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried that I'm turning me into one of the left-wing liberals they ridicule in South Park. Because I found it extremely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? First of all, there is the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Second, and frighteningly, is there the initial strike of meteors hitting some (unnamed? why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "my god, imagine the tragedy that * could happen". Because, you know, this happened to Asians. This can happen to white Americans, and that would be tragic. <br /> <br /> So, later, a major meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the floor is annoyed because this may mean that our boys have less time than they thought. Not too bothered in America. No mention of many people dying. <br /> <br /> Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been so symbolic. Among a team of hardcore punchers, their job seems to consist of standing on their backs, occasionally saying "Hey, you're the guy". Same. Why did they even bring it? It's not like he's small - he weighed down that bus for nothing! Not once does he lift a tool, drive a spaceship or even help fix anything that explodes. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted on a useless paper), who seems to be drunk most of the time and hits things with English wrenches instead of fixing them because "Dat is how we make desires in Russia," it's pretty awful. <br /> <br /> All cemented, of course, by the site of the blonde, American children with blue eyes, all celebrating in corn fields, being saved and everything is working. Because all death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> You expect the bad script, the dishonest performance, the implausible plot (fat, middle-aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts Including someone who seems to be retarded? But I could not believe the racism and xenophobia implicit in the film, and the insensitive disregard for the lives of anyone who was not fed on American corn. <br /> <br /> It is a chilling indictment of the attitude of a part of the West. . <br /> <br /> And it's a low quality movie too.
