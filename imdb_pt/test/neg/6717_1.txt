I think this movie was made back and forth, first they record a lot of scenes and action, and blasts, and then the story writers started to work trying to find a story to put together all the scenes. This movie is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen, its average porn movie comes with a much better written script and much more consistent. The movie does not make sense. Seriously, even if you're a Segal fan, there's no reason for you to want to see this movie, unless you're one of those people who likes to face accidents, because this is a horrible accident, and should never have been released. about this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
