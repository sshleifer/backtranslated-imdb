A good cinematography, good acting, good direction ... can not justify a story that is not and can not be accepted by any society. Amitabh has often used the media to make this junk sell saying - if such an incident happens ... then what? I would like to ask you if such a thing happens to your own child or your grandson (say girl), so what are you going to do? I think all parents will have to be extra careful before interacting with any 60-year-old neighbor if you have a -jia- with you. Such films should be banned and discouraged, otherwise you inspire more Nithari cases. Such acts are villains and the villains in the movies are punished.that should be the moral of the story and not glorify their act or them.
