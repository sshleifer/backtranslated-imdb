"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that stereotyped small-budget films that struggle for less may seem worse, but I would say that an anti-formula "pseudo-intellectual" indie film pretending to be more is worse. <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never regain the 91 minutes of my life that I lost in your movie. From the beginning to the end, the script failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the public would like to see right or wrong. In storytelling, the three dramatic conflicts are man against man, man against the world and man against himself. The screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in New York, and is concerned about the dynamics of the man against himself, where each of the characters in the film is so self-absorbed into a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that film atrophy before the public very eyes. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters indulges in unexplained bad behavior (heroin addiction with no history of why the character is an addict; a bride who has sex with the boss / investor of her fiancee even that the character is too cleverly written to have sex with such a despicable character, a man who starts out as a decent guy, but is attracted to a runaway investor, and converts for some unknown reason into a bourgeois idiot like a fuck ; cyber geek, who does nothing but find online dating and an Asian gay man who dates an older HIV positive man, but does not have scenes that establish why the relationship works and why love develops). Crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's addiction, the suffering and self-loathing of the bride, which might explain why she would sleep with a tidal bag; the background story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" character and would turn out to be an idiot; a plot for the chubby fat geek; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and the HIV positive boyfriend are missing. <br /> <br /> Without the proper details, all the actions of the characters seem forced and planned. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCORING I found Mr. Johnson's direction without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can be described as mundane at best. Johnson chose small spaces to film and failed to capture the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic film, seen as the filming of a play, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film. I assume Mr. Johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for a full score to improve understanding on every shot. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" is an annoying and absolute failure in the production of films.
