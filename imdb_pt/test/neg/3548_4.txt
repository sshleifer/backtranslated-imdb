I usually do not try to guess a crime thriller, but the Cleaner was totally predictable. Samuel L. Jackson playing the character Tom Cutler, along with his profession, created an interesting twist at the beginning of the film, however, was about it. Even without thinking, I knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes I had already discovered who the killer was. Instead, relying on myself and having seen several films that make a turnaround, I watched their conclusion. What a disappointment, I was right from the start. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters was good, as was the performance of Jackson and Harris ... except Eva Mendes. From the starting point she did not play a believable character in correlation with the script and that ruined the whole plot too soon. Maybe it was a setback or just a weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and anguish to the situation that was forming around her. This would make the buildup a little more attractive and the end more dramatic. However, Cleaner is assistible, not memorable. I've seen CSI episodes that were more exciting than that.
