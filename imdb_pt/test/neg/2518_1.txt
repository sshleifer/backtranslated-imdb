I, like most other people, watched this movie after listening to it from Patton Oswalt. Strangely, it was easier to find than I thought it would be. But it should not come as a surprise that I thought I'd used it. <br /> <br /> The plot is summed up masterfully within the title. It's a bed that eats. Nothing more, nothing less. There is an effort to cast a plot, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The blood of a demon has ended up in a bed and, as a result, becomes possessed. It devours everything that happens on it, absorbing it and then dissolving it into what appears to be Fanta orange. There is an artist who fell victim to the bed but got sick and ends up behind a painting in the room where he lives. The narrative is told entirely through it. <br /> <br /> This movie fails terribly in everything, even in being bad. Still, it is not without its own brand of charm.
