I do not pretend to look pretentious here, but calling this the next cult classic is yet another example of the demotion patterns that filmmakers have for themselves. This film is an offense to everything we consider sacred, not to the good "artistic" way of offending. This film becomes the archetype of the PAINFUL dialogue, transmitted by even more pathetic actors.
