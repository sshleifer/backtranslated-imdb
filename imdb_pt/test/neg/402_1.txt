I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie any day, but this one was just awful. The acting (?) It was terrible almost to the point of I completely turn off the movie. I thought I saw the worst of all time, but this one is with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - it was the acting that made this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I found the actor clumsy and the male / female protagonist was extremely annoying. This movie had absolutely nothing for it. I may be asking a ridiculous question here, but why the nudity and sex scene? The producers thought no one would watch if they were left out? I think they were probably right! Oh, where's Price and The Tingler when you need them?
