With such a promising cast and director on whom I heard great things, I was totally disappointed with this movie. It started with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely confusing mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and nonsensical scenes (and yes I watched the full version). I love Robert DeNiro and, as usual, he did a good job as an actress, but in all his other gangster movies, no matter how many people he kills, I always respected his character, but in that film he was a drug addict . , rapist without caring about anyone but himself. In addition, James Woods, another excellent actor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and he left completely off the left field and in the end the writers just threw this random comment about how his father died in a crazy house and that's why James Woods did not like being called a madman. So much was left undeveloped in this film. Also, we never find out who the men at the beginning are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out about Joe Pesci's character again. It seems the writers gathered five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story in which the characters were young. The story went well in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job. Overall, I was very disappointed with this movie and I do not see how anyone can compare this to godfather 1 and 2, or even to Goodfellas. I'm sad that I lost four hours of my life watching this movie
