Ufa! What can you say about this bizarre and stupendous mock-u-mentory about Ed Wood's fantasies? Well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! The wood uses raw pieces of innocuous and incidental photographic material, and then builds a "story" around them - and what a story !! Wood himself starred as Glen, an ordinary Joe who happens to enjoy relaxing in his bride's lingerie and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the Glens of this world, showing that Glen is like all of us below, just in Angora. Ummm ... okay. But then we have this very bizarre montage of some horny devil, a girl in captivity, a few rude people pointing, some footage of Moore, and finally a beautiful Lugusi, playing some sort of invalid and distorted Puppetmaster. Lugosi is a howl, releasing a garbage like "Beeevaaare ... the dragon beeeg greeeen who sees at his door: he eeeets leeetle boys, puppydog tails and beeeeeg snails!" Um, okay, Bella ...: = 8 / There's a strange and distorted logic of Wood going on here. After all, he reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bald." Hmmm, it must be this alien / cross-dressing / habidashery cowspiracy-thang !! Glen or Glenda star in a plethora of Wood schlock actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to persuade every unloved miserable of each. . Everyone already knows about Bela's sad story: by the time Wood used it for this flic, he was probably wanting another dose and needed the moolah, but even for him that depth is unreachable. One of MooCow's favorite wooden mooments comes with the stocking filming buffalo scene - it's sooo loopily demented !! The MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings", and git their hooves on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you will not believe it! : ??
