This very low budget kitchen sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK because, anywhere else in the world, the market would need to exist before a green light was given. Probably self-funded, this is clearly an attempt to correct important issues, but weakens your point of view where the question needs to be posed, who would put money to distribute it and secondly if a market audience does not exist to watch , buy or rent this movie, why would anyone bother in the first place? My opinions may sound unfairly harsh for a first-time director, but that's the kind of film that will only undermine the commercial viability and quality standards that have only kept a British film industry.
