AWFUL wot more I can say that I remember seeing him in the movies (see how painfully he is in memory) as a 16 year old boy. Mark Hamill was the skywalker of the older generations and was not great at it, he was worse at it. In addition, a somber soundtrack from Then Jericho AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH. There's a movie as bad as this I saw in the movie Arthur 2 on the rocks. Funny like that question "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" It's easier than "what's the best movie?" which incidentally varies between Italian (original) work, untouchables, Casino, things to do in Denver, Goodfellas (get a sense of what I like ??? - this will fool you!) Looking for Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please never watch this movie or it will stay in your memory too!
