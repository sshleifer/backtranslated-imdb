I stumbled into this late night movie on TV. My brother and I could not stop laughing at how awful God this movie is. The bad sound effects whenever Ninja White or Ninja Black punch, kick or use a weapon are hilarious. This movie is almost at the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because of your crappiness. I'm not sure if the director wanted it to be so bad on purpose because he knew that idiots like me would buy it.
