There is some reason to relive characters 10 years after the fact when the only reason they worked for the first time was due to the actors who played them. <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet, who can replace them at low prices, since most studios know that the sequences do not bring the same recipe as the originals, so they cut corners from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Where are the good movies going to the movies if powerful Hollywood studios can clog 3,000 movie theaters that open the weekend with anything they feel the general public can be sucked into. <br /> <br /> Enough enough people, this sequel has to stop and Hollywood folks need to start acting together or start distributing the much better foreign product that is floating in limbo. <br /> <br /> Wake up Hollywood because people have woken up and are not buying. just because it's new and brilliant. Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves because we're getting the theaters back once and for all !!!
