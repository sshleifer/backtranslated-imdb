Before the days of home video, Stan Laurel's pre-hardy comedy Kill or Cure was known - as far as it was known - just because some sequences were included in Robert Youngson's Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20's compilation. Youngson knew what he was doing: the best "Kill or Cure" jokes were brought in intact in their compilation, while the rest of this only slightly funny comedy remained in Youngson's cutting room. <br /> <br /> Laurel portrays a commercial traveler selling a patented drug, Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: That name is the funniest joke in this movie, which does not say much. I must point out that this film dates back to 1923, the leg of the Prohibition. During Prohibition, many Americans bought patented remedies if they had medicinal properties, so - if Knox-All contains alcohol - Stan's work on this film is less desperate than the one he and Ollie showed. had in 'Big Business', selling Christmas trees in the summer. Too bad for this movie that is not as funny as 'Big Business'. <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but do not hear him in this silent movie) making a lively sales conversation with a man who seems to be paying attention ... until we find out that they are outside a deaf institution- changes, and this man is deaf. An arrogant woman emerges from the gates: Stan quickly tries to attract his attention by waving his fingers at her. Of course she is not deaf, and she promptly hits him with her umbrella. I found this offensive sequence, NOT because it involved deaf people (the deaf are not the target of the joke), but because it encourages the widespread misconception among people who hear that they can communicate with deaf people by simply wagging their fingers at random. and performing Charades without actually learning the highly complex grammar of sign language. More amusingly, a spinster in this movie has a pet canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a gag involving photo trick to allow a man to hide behind an object that is more narrow than his body. I've seen this device in several animated and live-action movies, but 'Kill or Cure' is, I think, the oldest movie to be used so far. Stan Laurel, an underrated actor, does a bit of physical business here that is worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, in which he conveys his emotions - and a change in his behavior - while moving away from the camera. back to us. Still, Laurel never became a front-line comedian until joining Oliver Hardy to form the greatest comedy team of all time. 'Kill or Cure' badly ranks 3 out of 10.
