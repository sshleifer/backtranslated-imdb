I really wanted to like this movie, but I just could not. It had the potential to be a cool and cool remake of a cool show, but that's when it went undone. It was very hip, very cool. First of all, all the cool lines and scenes were shown in the preview trailers, which I've seen many times. And the editing was very disjointed, so the scenes did not seem to flow together and all seemed out of place. Claire Danes, who I love as an actress, could not get her to become the high school actress. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His style a bit stupid, but actually clever, it was funny and refreshing. Overall, I would recommend just watching the previews instead of watching the movie and wish it was over.
