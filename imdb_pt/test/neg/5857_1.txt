I saw this movie last night, a satire of the reality style shows that seem to be making the rounds right now. <br /> <br /> What can I say. I absolutely hated that. As interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe a moment or two just a little fun. <br /> <br /> Maybe it has something to do with me definitely not being a fan of the Survivor and Big Brother programs, but if this had been a video / DVD or if I was watching in the movies on my own, I definitely would not have supported more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
