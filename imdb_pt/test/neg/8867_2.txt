It's painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" never saw such brilliant parodies as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is terrible and the actors too. They would not know how to act, even if it hit them in the face, as I felt like doing while watching this pile of junk. <br /> <br /> The movie is stupid and has no humor in it. I'm sure I could make a better movie with my friends. It's incredible to me that a movie can fail so much. It's not a smart or funny line. No trace of intelligence behind it. It's a pathetic movie and I would like to meet the person who really likes this movie. Disgusting!
