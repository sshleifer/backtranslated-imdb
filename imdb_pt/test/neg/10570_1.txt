This movie is somehow showing 6.2 stars, it seems inconceivable that the director has so many relationships. I'm at a loss to explain this. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You only have a certain number of hours on Earth, do not waste 1 & 1/2 of them on this heap of Guano retarded! <br /> <br /> There is no story, as apparently the director "wrote" (and I'm guessing with a blunt orange crayon) the script the next day at the conclusion of the day's shooting. The "story" has been called extravagant, it is not without purpose, there is perhaps "history" enough to fill a commercial. Do not you hate ads? <br /> <br /> Now while both leads can take action, they obviously have decided not to do this here. And similarly, the writer / director can actually write and direct as evidenced by his next work "Love Toy" <br /> <br /> So to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you are paid to see that avoids it. <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing the Quest for Monty Python for the Holy Grail, "Run, run away!"
