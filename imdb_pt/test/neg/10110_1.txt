This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast is international - an Australian who pretends to be British, American on stage and a character with an English name with an unrecognizable "European" accent. What reasonable efforts to act from this heterogeneous crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of special inanity. So short were the budget shoestrings of this film and the overall production values ​​are so low that it would have no problem winning a limbo film competition. In the last twenty years, we have seen horror movies and suspense films of extraordinary quality (although not necessarily "high") that were made without any budget. Recent examples include the ill-done but totally scary "Blair Witch Project" and of course - the latest - that low-budget winner, SAW, with virtually unknown leads (Gary Elwes is just someone you do not remember even if you've seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS, it's shocking to find a well-known actor, Dominique Pinon and Hollywood, Jeff Fahey fighting bravely to save the film. It is shameful to see the once handsome (Fahey) in tacky make-up uttering bizarrely bad lines. I would have rated this movie 0 out of 10 if that were possible!
