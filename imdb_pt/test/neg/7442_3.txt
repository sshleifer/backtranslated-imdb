Unfortunately, producers do not know when to leave well enough alone, or are being recycled to the point that every piece of garbage that Hollywood generates is ready to render on Alpo. It seems that every science fiction adventure movie must support a sad list of subsequent films, and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, under the direction of Paul Verhoven, was a wild and stylish walk, even for a small social commentary on what the dark side of biotechnology is capable of transforming us. This movie does not have any of that, plus it might tell us that drugs are bad for you and can make you regret it when you're sober. Robocop 2 does not have the vision, the deeply frightening sight of what we are becoming, and instead, awkwardly takes us on a boat ride on as nauseating traffickers and their victims really are. Social commentaries are doomed. This really was the big one for me. If you do not care about anything but SFX, go to it, my friend. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this sour cake without yeast and preserve the pumpernickle of the first oven, accurately and heavily measured. It's that simple.
