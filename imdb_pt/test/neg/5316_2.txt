Get Shorty was a great movie. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comedic acting and a serious plot. Be Cool is like a cheap knock-off trying to go through a sequel. John Travolta, like Chili Palmer, seems to have forgotten that he's been in the mafia. He plays as if he were a bored movie executive, rather than a bored executive who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in almost every role she has ever played, is tense and confused. Should she be ditzy or intelligent? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add all the clichés of movies you can imagine. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inopportune gangster informant on Andre 3000, the heart-souled girl with a nice set of tubes on Christina Milian, a pretentious pretending enigma in Vince Vaughn and a stupid celebrity by Stephen Tyler . The only funny part was Rock, who invented his own new cliché as an aspiring Samoan fat actor. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: DO NOT MAKE SENSE. Get Shorty was smart with Chili playing one group against the other and coming out on top. But this movie tries this out with about a million different characters. And neither does Chili seem to know what's going on. Get Shorty fans should be warned: this is a very different and much worse movie.
