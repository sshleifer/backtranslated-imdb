Critics began to call the Oscar-winning club, understandably. What after Halle Berry won for Monsters Ball, then headed straight for the diabolical Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Do not Cry and follows with The Core. Jamie Foxx dives as a pilot in Stealth after stealing a gong for Ray. Now it seems that Hollywood star Charlize Theron plays for all of his "Monster" Oscar with one of the worst sci-fi shows ever made. <br /> <br /> The film loses the public's interest after a mere 20 minutes, the only thing that really pays off is the fact that despite the film being trash Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a rude and ridiculous premise. Not only is Flange Æon shallow, but for an action movie, it's also very annoying. This is only going to please Horney's comic book fans who like the idea of ​​Theron running half naked for 90 minutes. Flux only succeeds in failing. <br /> <br /> Against the virus of 2011 that kills 99% of the world population, and in the last city of Earth, Bregna, the survivors, about four hundred years later, in the year 2415, continue to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed his cure. <br /> <br /> Not all is well in this utopia and it is not what is beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the endless jungle, but what not said, unwritten, taboo that holds and unites these taboos unwritten words that hold and unite those unfortunate together who find themselves within those walls of paranoia, conformity, and unquestioning obedience. Shot in and around Berlin, ironically, this is a story against a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its people are no longer able to reproduce, and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life. <br /> <Æon Flux is the assassin who was designated by the clandestine rebels to change the course of Humanity, forever. This is the story of his struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. <br /> <br /> Æon Flux combined bad reports, impetuous rhythm and terrible effects. Looking more like an unrealistic video game than a movie. The only thing that is happy about the failure is that there are no sequences in progress, the Flux may just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank God for the bad box office of the time. <br /> <br /> My final verdict on this really bad feature? There is not really a story here just Charlize Theron jumping in a black suit like a grass hopper. The acting is very idiotic and unemotional compared to the other theaters out there today. It's too much of an attempt to be like an adaptation and does not really draw much of the cartoon which is what I was hoping for, the only thing that was done in half that pays homage to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene. Avoid at all costs.
