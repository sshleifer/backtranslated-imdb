It's so fake! The plot looks like a generic adaptation of the average movie blaxploitation. Common themes of blaxploitation, such as racism, oppression and the struggle for the integrity of their community, are described in a simplistic / superficial way. And the jokes are not funny either! Dolemite does these monologue comedy routines that are really painful. All the people around him deliver this canned laughter. Even the soundtrack seems to be faking the funk. For best comedy in a blaxploitation try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience, try "Black Heat".
