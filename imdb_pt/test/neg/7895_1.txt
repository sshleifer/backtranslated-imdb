I watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan and he was really looking forward to getting the "soul" the movie claimed to have. Boy, were we completely wrong. When I finished watching the movie, I felt two things: remorse and relief. Remorse because I regretted wasting my time to watch this horrible piece of excrement, and relief because I watched it for free on the cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives a bad name to black people by putting so much horrible stereotypes into it that I believe all smart blacks everywhere are trying to spell. I am Asian, and I feel very very sad and sick for those who made this film. What else to say? Poor writing, even worse performance, and horrible plot. <br /> <br /> Even if you're bored to death and have no other choice, do not watch this movie. Seriously. The movie really has nothing to offer except if you want to see things like illegally drinking smaller, killing animals, women's degradation and in general: A REALLY REALLY REALLY EVIL-OBNOXIOUS-POTENTIATING-AMAZING MOVIE. Disgusting.
