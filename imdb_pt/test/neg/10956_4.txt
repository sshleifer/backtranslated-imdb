This is a bad movie b from time to time. In fact, it really is a much better quality than many movies b. He had a consistent script, decent direction, cinematic and I've seen worse performance. The zombies were great, clearly these were Romero's zombies, and they were really an interesting story of zombies. Obviously it's not Oscar material, and if you do not like zombie movies, or b-movies, you probably will not like it, but if you do, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> It is very good, although never clearly explain how it can heal from zombie bites and shots. But if he has more than one line of dialogue, where his bad acting is really evident. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he saw this.
