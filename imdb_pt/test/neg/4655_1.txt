A Lassie movie that should have been "put to sleep" .... FOREVER. This is how I would describe this painfully dreary waste of time in a movie. So mediocre in every way that it becomes a monotonous and uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. It's neither an achievement like a movie "so bad it's good" or "so bad it's memorable". The idea of ​​Lassie becoming bad is intriguing, but so little actually happens, and so slowly, that you feel your life slipping while sitting there, watching the non-actors read their lines of waiting cards waiting for their insignificant payments. <br /> <br /> It's an empty, empty shell of a movie. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your time, or your child's. Unless both are heavily medicated. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, avoid, avoid! This will drive you crazy! Hahahah, get it? BARKS! Hahahahahahaha! <br /> <br /> Sorry, I had a rough week.
