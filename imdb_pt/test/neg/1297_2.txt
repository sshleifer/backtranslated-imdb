This movie was total rubbish. I was sitting watching this absolutely furious that this was funded. They definitely spent all of their budget on the special FX instead of the screenwriter and director and some of the actors. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was bland and meaningless. The story has not been reported to the public enough. Rather than being from the perspective of storm people, the narrative was told more from government figures and the army, which really is not a way to connect to them as most of us hate politicians anyway. The writer attempted to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the little subframe on the father and son, which failed completely. <br /> <br /> As for the direction ... oh god, his techniques for trying and creating tension and discomfort are repetitive and over the top. The camera's accelerated movements and then the sudden lightning flash to the face of a character when something horrible happened was pathetic. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched until the end was to see the special FX. Which is a bad thing, since special FX should not make the movie, it should only amplify the history and the experience. There was no story. <br /> <br /> I really would not mind seeing this, total rubbish and an embarrassment to the British film industry.
