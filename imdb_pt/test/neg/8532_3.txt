Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this movie ends up being a clich√©, sub-par movie haunted with a totally implausible ending. Lane # 1 for everyone considering seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi did not drive it. Although the commercials of the film represent his involvement, in fact he is one of four producers. It's a pity that someone as talented as Raimi allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a bad movie. I do not think he would have ever managed anything like that; this task was left to the Pang brothers. <br /> <br /> The script for this movie seems to have been compiled from numerous other "horror" movies, so you will find absolutely no original content in "The Messengers". "What we have is a scene here and there that was ripped from" Pulse, "a couple that could have come from" The Birds, "one or two from" The Others, "etc. Almost every scene, almost every line the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to discover the "surprise ending" long before it arrives. <br /> <br /> Right, here would be a good time to point out that advertising The campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this film. certainly see them even at the beginning of the movie.I'm sure that whoever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a single angle to have any box office feature that would otherwise be totally missing.Now you know, so do not be fooled! lme does not, above all, be something that resembles the chemistry between the actors. It just is not there. All the interactions appear as clumsily blistered. Along with the banal story and ridiculous holes (what is a guy who murdered his entire family still lurking around the little town where the murder happened, anyway? No one thought about arresting him?), All for a deep ghost movie unsatisfying that can only surprise anyone over ten years with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything less than a figure wrapped in sheets jumping from a closet and shouting "Boo!" Everything we have for our buck this time is another badly made movie about spirits who try to warn people away from a home. If there is any message that "The Messengers" offers, it is "Do not waste time on this movie".
