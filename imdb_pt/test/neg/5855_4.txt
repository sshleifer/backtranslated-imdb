This movie coincides with Mike Allred's comic mini-series "Red Rocket Seven" and tells the story of an alien who escaped to Earth to wait for "Astroesque", which links to the book of Apocalypse and Apocylpse. That's just part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read "RR7" too). You can easily say that Allred is accustomed to telling stories with pictures. The direction is very good and the effects are not bad for a $ 500 budget. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and probably did not dare say they could not act. Also, Mike is not showing off his writing skills in this movie. His dialouge feeds the plot and does not allow you to enjoy the characters. This was really disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comics. 4 out of 10.
