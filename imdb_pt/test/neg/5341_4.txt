"Black Friday" made this plot much better, which is why it is remembered and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten potboiler. "Shed No Tears" was the working title and would have been better, since he was a completely evil character for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Philip Bennett is newly hired when he is involved in a traffic. accident. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) has been involved in some experimental animal operations - bringing them back from the dead. His colleagues asked him to try his operation on Phillip, who died. While he is operating, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, is going to the electric chair and the trans migration of the soul occurs. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul of Panino. He is a changed person, he is rude to his family and begins to walk through the ancient places of Panino. He takes on the old Wolf gang - named after Philip Bennett, he's also the ex-girlfriend of Wolf's novel - who smells like a mouse. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to improve punctuation and begins to eliminate his enemies. Bodies pile up, including his girlfriend and a police officer, so his own family begins to fall victim. <br /> <br /> But - I hate those "bad dreams" movies - you always feel disappointed. This movie would have been better if he had remained in the character as Panino and had a final shootout. Eleanor, your fianc√©e, would have ended up sadder, but wiser with your brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, had a great career mainly in B movies. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
