IMDb lists this movie as a comedy. I have no idea of ​​the genre in which this movie fits, but it's certainly not comedy. tragedy perhaps. <br /> <br /> I will not say if it's a good movie or not. All I know is that it's not a comedy. I wanted to laugh tonight and what I got was a bizarre notion of someone clinging to some ugly chair. <br /> <br /> This movie is not what is announced. It is foolishness from film school that I can only assume that it is meant to "make people think". I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, not even I do not know. It's ridiculous nonsense that makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> It made me think about it. It made me think, "I wish I had those ninety minutes of my life back." <br /> <br /> I'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal leaning on their worldview that will make this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
