Oh, man, I hated this movie. Granted, the sites on the site were great, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. Now, I will state from the outset that I am VERY critical of the way guns, especially firearms, are portrayed and treated in the movies. Being a war movie, the portrait was fine, but the handling of shoddy weapons in the film would never have been tolerated by a true SEAL team. The performance was more of wood than my first sailboat, the transported equipment (or lack thereof) was laughable, and the dialogue was, say, devoid of ANYTHING interesting. Well, except for the reporter, who was actually prescient. Watching this movie was comparable to watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson where every scene was so bad you just could not turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they certainly did. The scene in the water, where, after firing at the first enemy, they explode DAMN BOAT UP, having to face a possible drowning, made me laugh so much that, for a thousandth of a second, I almost thought it would be worth waiting for movie to . Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy into the depths of the ocean (the way it was filmed, with the many camera cuts, it looked like they fell about 20 meters. so stupid that I was stunned. Then again, so did the whole damn movie. I like action movies, but not this one. NOTE: The version I watched was a TV version, pan & scan. I can not imagine making a difference except for making the whole thing blessedly shorter!
