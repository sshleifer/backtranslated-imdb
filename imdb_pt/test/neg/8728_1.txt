I agree in many parts with the quite complete review already posted on the theme of the miniseries, and I agree that it has its pros, not just its cons. For example, the original film managed to truncate many of the middle and late parts of the novel in a single set, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani, who, in reading the novel, is a farce. , probably born of the studio-cut shenanigans the other reviewer writes. This was one of the great failures of the original film, and the miniseries, to its credit, includes many of the original plot lines that were taken from Lynch's film due to the expansive nature of Herbert's novel. <br /> <br /> However, this in itself is a double-edged sword. Instead of completing a celluloid text transfer of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. Similarly, although this is certainly a "complete" account of Dune's plot, it is also a rupture with the original heart and soul and the main vision - prophecy. Where are the inner monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and demonstrate what the different characters are thinking, without the need to suddenly change from one point of view, or to expand into unnecessary and blatant spoken words or monologues? Gone. Much of the original agony of Paul's decision to choose jihad or death, the choice to fulfill prophecy or to flee from it, certainly the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one that captivates people who are far from science fiction fans ) is missing. <br /> <br /> Without prophecy, what is the purpose of the Dune? It is simply a more learned and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad it is that all this is given to us. Lynch's film was flawed, yes. But a flawed film could lead to a correction by another filmmaker, taking on some of Lynch's best movie scores and rejecting some of the more exaggerated aspects of the style while restoring the plot. Now this story will probably never be translated to film again, and this I find heartbreaking.
