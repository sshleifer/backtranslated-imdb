I have always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic endeavors to be deeply pretentious, and I never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he invented by chance, and which are just direct contact photo prints), his real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that was accepted as art than as porn. But surely that had to happen eventually, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes story. "L'Ã©toile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... has a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. Sea stars have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies - but if that has anything to do with the subject of that movie, Ray stops saying it. I was much more impressed by the title cards of this film, which (in French) can include rhymes, a pun ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux. <br /> <br /> As so often in Ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this film. Unfortunately, photography is (to a large extent) so blurred that we have little opportunity to enjoy it. I'll rate this mess at a point of 10.
