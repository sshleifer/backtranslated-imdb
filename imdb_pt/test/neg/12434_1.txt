Larry Clark is not known for his talents as a writer or director, but has made some undeniably important films. Kids, Bully and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park, all achieve the intended goal: shock, disgust and even disgust. These films are intransigent in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. The children exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among young people. Bully touched on similar issues. Ken Park dealt somewhat with sexual abuse and suburban boredom. Undoubtedly, all these films exposed something horrible and left a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skaters from South-Central Las Angeles who go arbitrarily to Beverly Hills. skating. It is. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has an essentially non-existent narrative. And, like Kids, features a cast of beginner actors who have been drawn out of the movie scene. However, unlike Kids, none of them have any similarity of talent. There's better acting in porn. This film undoubtedly features the most terrible performances I have ever seen in a movie. One can respect Larry Clark by exposing these young people to the filming process, but these children are absolutely terrifying. I might add that apparently these gentlemen also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most terribly ineffective garage punk you've ever heard - my advice is to pop some migraine pills before entering the theater, or you'll regret it later, however . <br /> <br /> But again, it's not like they have too much of a script to work on. Every line that is pronounced is artificial, pathetically delivered, and annoying beyond measure. The story itself is ridiculous. It begins reasonably, but soon falls quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. This naturally begins with a whimsical sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clich√©d national Lampoonish encounters, characters being killed for no reason, and ultimately resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. The shots last much longer than necessary. Be prepared to watch people skateboard for about fifteen minutes in a row, long filming of characters doing nothing or skateboarding the streets. But again, with the script in scant 32 pages, they need as much useless filling as possible. Maybe Wassup Rockers would have worked better as a short film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could go on like this. This is the worst movie that Larry Clark has done yet. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie if only by their shocking pederast clowns, look elsewhere. This is by far the lowest film he has ever made, and it is also the worst. It's awful. Like, Uwe Boll horrible. Definitely the worst I've seen at the festival. <br /> 1/10
