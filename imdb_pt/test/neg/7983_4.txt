There's not much about "Reckless" that seems right, starting with the off-putting title (thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas, who adapted his own piece, bringing the title along with it) and continuing with the cast (Mia Farrow playing wife for Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be her son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that seems to be the inside of a snow globe, but Farrow gets an amazing dose of reality after he admits he hired a man to kill her. She escapes into the night, taking refuge in a very strange couple who wants to help her rebuild her life. The production design and art direction of "Reckless" are good, but they are services for a completely empty, often alienating script. It's supposed to be a somber Christmas comedy, although the cast is lost with this bland, occasionally offensive material. * 1/2 of ****
