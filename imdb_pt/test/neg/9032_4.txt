Have you ever wondered why these guys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis, and others - can survive all the shootings they are at a disadvantage? I think I found out. Enemies always lose, and the hero does not. <br /> <br /> Here, Seagal has a pistol and overruns half a dozen pesos by shooting him a few feet away. One of the heavy ones has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them have. It does not really matter. There could be a thousand shotguns firing at him and Seagal would still emerge with his ponytail intact. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to hand to hand combat - forget it. The evildoers may or may not be armed with blades, knives or blunt objects, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura, sushido or joke or whatever, takes them away with a few strokes of contempt. Not only is he a master of those other skills, but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once he hurls someone's long bones just as easily as we were breaking a toothpick. One he breaks the spine of a guy on his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what. (I'm getting into the spirit of the movie here because Seagal uses that line, "I'll tell you one thing" several times, along with, "What does that mean?") These guys are totally deserving of extinction in any good manual of Xenophobe. They are all black, speak with unintelligible accents of Jah-may-can, wear dreadlocks that seem in dire need of a shampoo, torture and murder with resourcefulness, and - here is the worst part. They are anti-Christian. That's right. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> In fact, the voodoo element comes close to being the most interesting element of the movie. They did very well the components of the ritual - cigar smoke, rum spit, sacrificial chicken. They only left out the possession dance in which the spirit rides the dancer. They should have read Metraux on Voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot follows the usual conventions. What was done to Jaqueline Bissett by voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is made here for a friend of Seagal. What was done to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "McQ" is done here for Seagal himself. At the opening of the film, when Seagal makes a brief speech about having seen a lot of meaningless violence in his DEA career, he is now retired and when we are introduced to his friends and family, I tried to follow his affiliates to see if I could choose which would be horribly murdered or mutilated to generate their quest for revenge. <br /> <br /> The performance does not require much comment. But Charles, the Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright, is really good. Wright has considerable scope. Here he is an associate of dubious loyalty, quite sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars" he has a comedic part that he belittles perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jamaicans have never flown like film villains. I do not know exactly why. It's a small movie market. And if you go to Jamaica, head to Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo dealers as heavy, and if you're in the mood for another typical action movie, this should be a satisfying sight.
