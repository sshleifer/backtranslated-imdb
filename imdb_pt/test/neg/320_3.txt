If you're looking for a cinematographic masterpiece, that's not it. If you are looking for one of those horrible movies that are so horrible that are really good then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this movie that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles that say "Jack-O," and then add the word "Lantern" as if the viewer was not able to find out that the movie was about a giant pumpkin pumpkin shown on the cover and scene of the movie. After that, the film goes in about 20 different directions, none of them makes much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in people's houses, in the woods, and yet he never seems to do much. He does a few deaths, but the long buildup of these deaths is so poorly executed and built that you almost wish Jack-o would discount his anger at you, the viewer. Also, the plot consists of bad acting, free nudity and a ridiculous plot. The acting in this film is among the worst I've seen in my 35 years of film. The boy who is the protagonist of the film (the director's son) has as much emotion as a corpse, and almost all other actors are so bad for a lot of reasons (especially the big-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But having said all this, if you understand what it is (which is a steaming pile of manure), then you will get some laughs from that movie. What I also found amusing is that the producers of the DVD decided to release a "10th Anniversary Version" of this film (as if the original was not good enough). And someone really got the idea to make a mini-movie "behind the scenes" that is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I do not know why) ....... I'll give that 3 pumpkins broken 10 ...
