Seagal was off target with this movie. I'm a fan of him and I expect cool fight scenes and a sharp liner, but this movie did not have any of that, instead it had injections and cheesy music. Even if you are a fan of it, I highly recommend that you stay away from this movie and watch under siege or even on deadly terrain.
