Yesterday was one of those days we decided to go to the movies. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less randomly, but we were interested in seeing the current state of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart, and I must confess Immediately that it is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for their appearances in soap operas and / or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) did some pretty decent things after leaving the world of soaps. So we decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake that was. This movie fails on all fronts. Bad performance (the best performance is actually a guinea pig, which very convincingly pretends to be dead). (Black people do not need to wear sunscreen, as far as I know, and heating systems in the Netherlands.) they do not make clouds like they do in New York, even if that sounds great in the movies, people do not wear T-shirts outside on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). There's a funny moment involving two puppies, and that's it. <br /> <br /> So that's what I think, but more importantly, it seems like none of the people who came out of the movies liked it. I heard one of them saying that he was extremely disappointed because he really liked the book. I did not read the book, but my advice would have to be: read the book, do not watch the movie.
