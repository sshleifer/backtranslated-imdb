I saw this movie today on the big screen and I honestly do not believe some of the comments made by people here. I was really expecting to be touched by this movie, but it was not. <br /> <br /> I am ex-Australian and very patriotic towards this great country, but I feel that this movie does not do justice to us and those soldiers who have fought in this battle. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly filmed. I thought the acting was terrible, they were not believable and they gave me no reason to care about them. People are saying that this movie was graphic, there were some graphic scenes, but I found the most very weak. The war scenes were very short and last only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, a weak film that does not do justice to these soldiers.
