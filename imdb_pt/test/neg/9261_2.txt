I bought this movie for 99 cents at K-mart several years ago (along with "Hawken's Breed") and I think anything with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donahoe is certainly very valuable. It was not. "Dark Obsession" (the title I bought) was a small cut above "Hawken's Breed" (IMBD rated 2.4), but not enough to allow me to keep it at home. I threw the two movies in the trash. <br /> <br /> This thing fails on many levels, it is difficult to reduce it, but let's say it is absurd, incredible, boring, hedonistic, confusing and even in 100 minutes, for a long time. <br /> <br /> I love Byrne as an actor, but this schlock really does look bad on his resume.
