Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not a funny phrase or joke throughout the film. This movie is so bad that it makes the Austin Powers movies look like Shakespeareans. A few more films like this and Steve Carell can say goodbye to your career. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this movie? She's a good actress, but she's just terrible. <br /> <br /> The writing is pathetically lame. There is not a funny line, smart or witty. There is not a good view. <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible. The comedy depends on the timing. Someone should tell the director that. Each line that is supposed to be funny (and it is not) is delivered with absolutely the worst comic sense I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
