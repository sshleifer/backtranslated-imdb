(Warning: Some spoilers ahead.) <br /> <br /> What an incredibly bad movie. This makes Iron Eagle 2 look good. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) is shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to stop him from shooting down an Iraqi plane full of innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to take revenge. Among other things, he, sitting in a tank, chases Banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife in a field. He can fire shells and steer the tank at the same time. After receiving the tank exploded by a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a combat jet. With him, he kills several Allied fighters before assaulting NATO headquarters in an attempt to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An extra bonus is that Major Baxter (which Holiday hangs in her office) has placed the rating. insignia on his right shoulder on his back. Elegant.
