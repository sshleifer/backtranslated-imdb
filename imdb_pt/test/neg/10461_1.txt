I agree with all the comments posted so far: this movie was a waste of time and energy for both viewers and those who did. Terrible CGI, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is Alabama, but it looks like California. But the worst thing has to be the Native American angle about it, which pulls every stereotype you can imagine, from the boss surrounded by smoke, the furious warrior, people talking without using contractions ("Do not do it!"), Native sharks Americans playing in the air, etc. It just shows a lack of respect and understanding that I was tearing my hair off. A Native American with a little self-respect would have thrown the TV through the window in this garbage. So to close, I would say that this movie is practically an offense to everyone.
