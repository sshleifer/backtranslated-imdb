I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And then I should play with the most humble version of Latt / Howel. C Thomas Howel had more heart and more sympathy than Cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). Now that's hard to imagine until you take it all out on Spielberg's version that cost over a thousand dollars. There would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no Cruise. Because I doubt anything is worth more than a grand prize in David Michael Latt's version. So comparing apples to turnips, I think I have to go with the turnips. At least it gives independent films a chance in the market for epic science fiction disasters.
