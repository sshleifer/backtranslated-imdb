Devout fellows noir, make no mistake, this is a stench ... poorly filmed, misrepresented and there is nothing ... nothing here for the movie buff for another solid B movie from the gold mine of the 40s and 50s of classics. I tried based on the relatively high IMDb rating. There is no way to explain the taste, but I did not find anything in this movie to recommend to other members of IMDb. This is a classic example of having watched a movie and feel as if you had been cheated in x number of minutes that took the film to reach its grateful end. Having Alan Ladd on the cover of the DVD / tape is almost a scam, he's been on the camera for less than two minutes and almost has no dialogue! This is not that kind of weapon for HIre's people ... it's a classic in the bad sense of the studios that are spending no budget ... We all look for the great ... save your time at Gangs, Inc. Paper Bales ... it sucks!
