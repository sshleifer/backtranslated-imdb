I read the positive comments about this movie. I suppose the people who were in this movie must have accessed this site to give a good impression because this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I always watch the whole movie despite the quality or the lack of it, which explains why I watched the whole movie, but I do not think I've even laughed once during the duration of this movie. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was wrong. If you liked it, maybe you should dismiss the buttons because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells that you left behind. This film had a poor script, bad acting, bad direction, weak plot ... nothing of virtue and it was not fun. If you have not seen this movie, do not.
