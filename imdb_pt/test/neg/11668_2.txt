I watched all three mad max movies in succession for the first time a few days ago and was bitterly disappointed with the third installment. It destroys the good work of the first two films with fragile and tacky action and a plot that transforms the apocalyptic Australian lands into a comic sand pit that one would expect to see in an adventure movie for children. Max's character is unrecognizable from his obscure and cynical personality seen in the previous films and has become a predictable and uninteresting savior that has left me feeling betrayed. If you have not seen this movie yet, you just have not seen it. Let the story end with the road warrior and spare a painful hour and a half. (Spoiler Alert) The other big issue I had with this movie that really left a bitter taste in my mouth was the flying man. We had already seen him on the road warrior, where he had helped the most, and yet when he reappeared in thunder, it seems the two had never met. whether it should be a different character or a relative of the road warrior turning man I do not know. however, has not been explained and is a weak element in this weak film. 2 out of 10. does not get 1/10 because of thunder fighting.
