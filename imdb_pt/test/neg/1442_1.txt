Everyone I talked to said that this movie would be good and very strange, so I figured I'd rent it. In the middle of the movie I was thinking to myself what the hell was going on and what the meaning of this movie was. This movie from beginning to end is so bad that even the parts of the movie did not even bother me. I mean what will they get with the next Volcano 2 The return of the lava. I mean, come on this movie is so stupid that the characters are so poorly developed, and Eva Robert Englund makes the movie worse, I mean it could very well be turned into Freddy Kruegur and Spook people. I was really rooting for the bad guy to win what's bad. I mean, look dad's a cop he did not seem to care much about the fact that your daughter is going through one of the most momentous times in her life. I mean, if my daughter were treated like this, I would do everything in my power to keep the guy in jail. It also seems obvious that Dee Snyders' character would become bad again. This is one of the worst movies of all time right there with the Volcano and 8mm. Do not waist your time you will not enjoy it ....! <br /> <br /> Grade If there was a degree not on this site I would get this, this is how bad this movie is!
