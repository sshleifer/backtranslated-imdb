Perhaps the most astounding outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this comedy vehicle straight-out by the director, pairing Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake invalidated their marriage. Where do they really stand with each other? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others say, there is an element of suspense here: The idea that these two miserable people can escape from each other, free to inflict their horror on some other, companion unworthy. <br /> <br /> It's funny to read comments here about how unhappy Lombard's Ann Smith plays in this movie because Montgomery's role is as much as a leap. Ann Manhandles, witness snaps, small clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives bad reputation to his profession. Ann is also arrogant, of course, the kind of wife who keeps her husband hostage for six days because of a petty dispute, bringing up things like what he did in Paris when he was 20 and would not even know her still. "I forgave you!" she says, as if she were big of her. <br /> <br /> For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have some illicit pleasure with your "lover" before you tie the knot forever. For Ann, it's an attempt at pre-wedding sex that must be repulsed with a bottle of champagne on her head, followed by expulsion from her apartment and her life. <br /> <br /> The acorn does not seem far from being seen. the tree, as Ann's mother is scandalized in apoplexy when she discovers what David tried to pull: "Oh my poor baby! Thank God your father is dead!" <br /> <br /> This is a rare good phrase in this laugh, Comedy that can be considered a merit. <br /> <br /> One can call this an example of the "new marriage comedy," in which the bonds of marriage are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls "idiot plot," in which the plot depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh of American morality, but can not really do much more with it than a no-joke scene, where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing. <br /> <br /> Lombard died within a year of the release of this film; It was the last film of her that she lived to see. Shame could not have been better! She was arrogant in "My Man Godfrey" too, but in such a nice way that you did not have to go with her, you wanted to. Here she plays with laughter that is not there as she sadistically breaks David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls his eyes much like Groucho, a study of splendor. <br /> <br /> The only decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner, Jeff Custer, who makes a play for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond underestimates his many reaction shots, and even a drunken scene, all to a good effect. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** Such a decent guy is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting David after she prompts him into a showdown, calling Custer a "piece of jelly." Jeff leaves the scene, leaving Ann and David together for their future murder - suicide. Here's a Custer who managed to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
