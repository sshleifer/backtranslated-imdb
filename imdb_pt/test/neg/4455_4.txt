It's a pity that such a lame plan hangs in such picturesque locations, with some documentary-style reporting being pushed for extra length. A shorter film may have kept the tension a bit longer, and a more charismatic lead may not have spoiled its lines too much. The female protagonist was also not allowed to do enough, resulting in a cute but annoying affair. It develops in the end, but the main actor's own redemption is a little too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. Not awful, just a shame. Uninteresting, but good enough to decorate the TV hours of the first hours.
