Mystery of low budget murder about a public defender trying to wipe his client out of a murder that the man had been convicted of for 12 years before. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the DP believes the man is innocent of the murder and works to find the real killer. Gig Young as the PD is well, and James Anderson as the doomed murderer is actually very good, but the whole picture just ramblings along with little suspense, and despite some good actors cast characters, the performances are generally below the pair. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more at home making westerns - he was producing Gene Autry's Columbia TV series around this time - but even though he had tried to inject some animation into that picture, the script would have defeated his attempts. . At best, the movie climaxes with a court scene that is directly out of an episode of "Perry Mason" and is as predictable as it is.
