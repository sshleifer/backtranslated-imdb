This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. It's been a long time since I've seen, but the jokes are not funny, the plot is painfully predictable, calling the main characters stupid is to refresh their intelligence widely ... ugh! I just wanted to punch Tom Arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when I finished watching that piece of cinematic filth. I do not even know why I always wanted to watch it, but remember if you watch this movie: DO NOT SAY I DO NOT AVIEI. <br /> <br /> PS character Tom Arnold sings a song in this movie called "I am my own grandfather." Nuff said.
