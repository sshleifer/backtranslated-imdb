This is a meaningless remake. Beginning with the opening of the original title shots was a real mistake as it reminds the viewer of what a great chiller of period piece it was. The new version that follows is an exercise in redundancy. Brian Kerwin plays a "city boy" photographer who returns to a deserted, half-abandoned city populated by a scattering of underdeveloped cliches: the lollipop sucking Daby-Doll Lolita, ornery old coot garimpeiro, crippled veteran and his Asian wife, etc ... <br /> <br /> Kerwin's character witnesses the fall of 'something' on a hillside and soon after strange things begin to happen as bits of rock strange blue are scattered. The temperature starts to rise, all the water in the area disappears, people begin to act strangely, things explode. Kerwin's character gets in and out of the car more often than humanly possible in a movie. The film develops no sense of place, no character development, no mood, no tension. Everything that made the original Jack Arnold, a scary classic of Cold War paranoia, was abandoned. It just goes through its minimum hoops and then it ends. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special - the ship's interior looks like pieces of sticky film wrapped around some strings that were then hung in the front. camera to frame some of the most uninspired and awkward wirework ever placed on the screen. The script is repetitive - everyone says it all at least twice, Kerwin says "let's get out of here" at least three times during the movie, twice in a scene. Many things are left unexplained in the end - why do aliens need all the heat and water, for example? - not that someone watching would care; if the filmmakers did not care, why should we? <br /> <br /> The performance is adequate - rather than the script, which sometimes has an improvised quality under-rehearsed, deserves. Although actors often seem to want to just finish it as quickly as possible - a notable example of this is when Elizabeth Peña records the briefest and symbolic moment of "desperate frustrated hands to face the gesture" before accompanying the son in a bad mood Stevie to watch him make annoying "grumpy teenager smashing something off a table" gesture. <br /> <br /> Continuity errors include the sticker (GB) on the back of Kerwin Jeep appearing and disappearing, a double action of gas on the exploding car, a city person being in two places simultaneously - once in The Alien's POV Stevie then immediately fired on a reaction shot, Elizabeth Peña seeming to close the car door twice ... you can tell I was stuck, can not you? The movie makes the biggest mistake. It's boring.
