Poor Casper Van Dien, his career drifted away from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. In Meltdown he is a cop who is dating TV reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten and his brother is a scientist who is trying to deal with a high-speed commentary to Earth. But in the business of the fugitive comet, even a near miss causes some real problems as the Earth's orbit becomes misaligned. <br /> <br /> From Earth's survival, we go to the survival of Van Dien and his immediate family. . His daughter's gangbanger boyfriend, Ryan McDonell, actually proves to be of some use, especially when he suspects that a guy he knows as a corrupt cop can mean a lot of damage to the Van Dien group. <br /> <br /> My only question here is Why did not they have Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew to deal with the terrible comet? <br /> <br /> Pass these folks.
