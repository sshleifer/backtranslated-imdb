As I write this in November 2005, I have come to realize that the great British cinema boom has come to an end, and while people claim that much of it is up to the British government not to give filmmakers tax incentives, I think the cause is a lot more. simple - Lack of diversity on the part of producers in recent years. Let's take a look at what the British were producing in 1995-2005: <br /> <br /> Funk gangster thrillers. LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a truly great movie and a lot of fun and people went out of their way to mimic Guy Ritchie's style with generally disappointing results. <br /> <br /> Romantic comedies. Yes, well I know that four weddings, notting Hill etc were produced by American studios, but they are still vaguely "British films". Unfortunately, because they are guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula that generally involved Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time Black Comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy really is? In the British context, it is usually a rambling film, often with contemporary political statements made and which often resembles NAKED by Mike Leigh. The BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE of Jasmin Disdar is a good example of the third kind of British film Shot in 1999 but scheduled for 1993, it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and is later revealed to be a Serbian and a Croatian, so we have a summary of what was happening in the Balkans at that time, although the chances of two ex-enemies in the Balkans bump into each other on a London bus? This summarizes one of the main flaws of the film - Irony takes precedence over probable situations, you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots, but the result is likely? Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film. It's called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, but surely this audience member met stereotypical people cliches that I could not believe in three-dimensional characters
