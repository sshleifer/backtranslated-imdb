This movie is a hodgepodge of several idiot cliches. For example, boy-meets-spoiled-rich-girl and she begins to fall in love with him harassing her in college (a backdrop used in recent Indian commercial films). A sexist glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (ad nauseum has been used in several other films). As with many other recent Hindi commercial films, the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else.
