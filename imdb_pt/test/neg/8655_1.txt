I would give this movie a 1/10. This film is devoid of common cinematic substance and focuses too much on the current "fur trend" in Bollywood films. I definitely would not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me feel discouraged is how such a stunning track as Yash Chopra Films could succumb to such a horrible production? They may have forgotten to keep in mind that there is a larger audience than the "adult" audience as well, that when exposed to such rude films, can ruin their growing mentality and succumb to things devoid of meaning and recognition. <Br /> <br /> In general, movies should not only be fun, but should also include some meaning. Certainly, this movie is a huge disappointment to Yash Chopra fans, especially myself. I am very disappointed with the plot, acting and everything. Why can not people put some substance that can be enjoyed after being confronted in the movies at least once throughout the movie? The point is clear. I would like to summarize my opinion: "Horrible - Disappointment - Lot of adult material - Lack of sensitive substance" - Lack of normal psyche - Useless - Could get a Cornetto or a Chocolate Temptations "
