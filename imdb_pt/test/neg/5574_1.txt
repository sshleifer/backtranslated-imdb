This movie is so bad. but it's so bad I was laughing my ass off. for people who like movies, do not watch this. For people who like good and bad movies, I highly recommend this. the lines of the story tremble, the script is horrible, the acting is horrible to mediocre. The soundtrack of the movie was tacky, but I loved it. the legal slogans were a plus tho. ha ha "If you can bleed, you can die." the fight scenes made me laugh. It seemed to me that they spent more time in these parts than any other because the fight scenes for the most part were fairly clean. I almost feel like this movie could have been good if it were not for the f / x .... no, it would still have been a crapshoot. the eye thing was tacky. and as the girl was eating the boys' stomach in the kitchen, they could have done something where she was actually eating something or at least putting more fake blood on her face. and the blaze of the lighthouse disappointed me. I thought they could have gotten real fire instead of bad computer synthesized things. and the ending was so predictable, which surprised me when they really did what I could do. so in general. I say this is a classic as much as the bad movies. It 's in my background 5.
