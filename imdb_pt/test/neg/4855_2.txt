Although this movie has been highly praised, I personally found it annoying. There are beautiful Brazilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even though it is unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie for so long. The central woman takes one man after another narrowly and puts the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and helped by the excellent performance. It is a rare glimpse of the interior of Brazil, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep your eyes open.
