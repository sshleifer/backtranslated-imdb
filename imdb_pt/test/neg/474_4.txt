I like B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked 'Running Time'. However, I do not know if I will watch this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, after saying that, I'll bet the comment strips and special features will be worth watching! This movie has many holes for me to really enjoy, even though it's a cheap movie. First of all, Ted Raimi was annoying, just annoying. There was nothing in his misrepresented / written character that had not been done better a thousand times before. The direction unfortunately was sub insignificant and the choice of a few shots ... yikes. I do not expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell did not deliver. <br /> <br /> I did not buy it thinking it would be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall', but still I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I have much less. At the end of the film there were no scenes that appeared to me, no dialogue that resonated within me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line to petes sake! I do not recommend this movie.
