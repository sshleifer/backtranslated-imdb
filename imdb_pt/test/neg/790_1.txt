Now, this movie is the worst I've ever seen !! It is simply a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie, I just wasted my time watching this cheap crap. I can not believe anyone would produce such a disaster. A waste of money and time. Nothing to learn from this movie, it's just an evil, hollow movie. I do not think they could have made it worse, this movie just won its title as the king of the worst crap. The acting is a disaster, the meaning ... oh well, there is no sense just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the child suffering at the end of the film, and the death of the wife that again was another stupid blow to this movie. Do yourself a favor, if you really have a bit of respect, stay away from that horror !!!
