I'll put it straight for you, this movie is very annoying. It's about a flood, that's it. Blah blah a little about the family, politics blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> It's all the fault of the meteorologist, poor fellow. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a tough guy who expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a very irritating character. <br /> <br /> If you are from the UK, or anywhere that might flood, then you may like this movie. It's as if earthquake movies were most appreciated where earthquakes happen. <br /> <br /> This is not really an action movie, where time is the enemy and you must either conquer it, or literally overcome it, it's more like a time bomb that should be turned off. <br /> <br /> When looking at this film, it is understandable that the UK thinks the world is overpopulated, it is not, but for them it is. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie is as exciting as picking crusts and I can not recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, too far. <br /> <br /> The problems with the film; I will not go into them any more because the film does not deserve such dissection. I suggest to you Londoner - buy more boats. If you bring children into this movie, they will fall asleep or become uncontrolled and bored, screaming demons.
