Firstly, I just want to say that this show could have done well, much better than it is doing now. What caused this was certainly the performance. Miranda Cosgrove, who acts as the main character Carly, seemed almost worthy of her own show when she was in Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big disappointment. Not only does Miranda not act convincingly, but she is incredibly rigid when she moves. She seems not sure how the character "Carly" would move or stand. In the first episode at the end, when she throws her hat up, her arm never comes off the side of her elbow. even when she was dancing, it looked like a stick in the breeze. And the song? The theme song was great, just because Drake was there, the music was very good and Miranda's voice sounded fake. I have to admit, the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, this is Nick. They are practically known for stupid characters and lines. But wow, it's iCarly the worst of them all.
