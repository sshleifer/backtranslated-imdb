'Tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction movie can go. <br /> <br /> I can barely find something good to say about this movie. The facilities are completely wrong. A comet must hit the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but no one believes the scientist who foresees this. A whole underground city and a launch pad for nuclear rockets are built in the mountains of California without anyone noticing. As the comet approaches Earth, the news hits the TV and newspapers almost a day before the event. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br /> No kind of emotion comes to the screen. The genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city is a savior of mankind or a beast? The director or Dennis Hooper, who plays the role, does not seem to decide until the movie was made, and it really does not make a difference, because acting and directing is so confusing that you wonder what the movie is trying to say. The special effects are so cheap that not only can they not be compelling in the era of computer effects, but could not have been convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this movie was made. <br /> <br /> total waste of time.
