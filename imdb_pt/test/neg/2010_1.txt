My original comment on that particular title was deleted, either by a IMDb user or by the team, just because I just do not like this movie to the point of sincerely writing what I felt after seeing this poor excuse for a movie. Where is my freedom of speech? <br /> <br /> Obviously this movie was made by students because it was so lame and amateur. Of course, do they need to start somewhere? The script was incoherent mess and the same thing happened. With low budget and B class actors, what can you expect? There are some CGI in places, so poor, it looks like an old PC. Some may say, this is some sort of clone "Alien", but this time it is Dracula (in a vintage fantasy) that is sucking the other cast dry, one by one. The scenarios are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large spacecraft. It would be fun to know what the stars (Erika Eleniak, Casper Van Dien, Coolio and Udo Kier) thought about the movie after it was released ... Coolio must be the worst rapper who turned actor! <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time and money, I do not know why I bothered to rent this movie. Honestly, I hate this movie. With Uwe Boll's House of the Dead, Dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever. (Well, I've seen even worse than these two) <br /> <br /> Avoid! Any other movie will do better.
