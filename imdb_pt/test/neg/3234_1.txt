Dean Koontz's book, "Watchers," is one of the best books I've read. Unfortunately, the film is a sad caricature of the book. The disillusioned middle-aged hero and solitary maid with whom he finds meaning for his life are turned into the movie into a couple of idiot teenagers, the stoic security officer and the conscientious sheriff are combined into a cheating villain - you get it. ? The filmmakers brought an exciting tale of love, horror and adventure into a Z-Grade horror film targeting - very badly - the teen market. <br /> <br /> Buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be much more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
