"Son, you must stop the experiments I started !!" It's a shame that nobody has said that too, whoever has lit this project !! I was almost literally dragged into this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight performance when we were in high school. Now a midnight movie in high school on a Friday night, you're not expecting much, but come on !! And seeing him again, years later, I keep my original opinion on that. Great special effects, but so what! Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Unless you like blood and courage and watch some Hollywood veterans (Steiger & Hunter) play foolish for a buck. DISGUSTING!!!
