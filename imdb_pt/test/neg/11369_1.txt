If you thought NBC's 10.5 was stupid, you'd be glad to know that the FX reached the bowels of hell made for TV and clenched your fingers in this pseudo post-9/11. Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete rip of 24 and a bad ripoff in that. The filming style was the now used "docu-action", complete with grainy B & W "rawcore" gravel cuts. I'm not sure what that means, but it sure looks like something the DP told the director before filming. I do not know what they were doing here, but it reminded me of the guy in the office who thinks PowerPoint presentations with fly-ins and animations are "cool". <br /> <br /> The story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in Southern California. That's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there are safety precautions up to ying-yang. For the sake of reality, they put 2 CHIPpies out of service in the mix. Because they could stop 6 people, right? Six. I mean, even Bruce Willis had to deal with more terrorists in that stupid Nakatomi building. <br /> <br /> Leslie Hope (from TV Teri Bauer) plays a CHP employee who has trouble talking on the phone after firing her. bulletproof vest. Her voice sounds like a sullen, monotonous Sally Struther TV commercial. Your character is just a plot device, and after she performs a small duty, she is promptly discarded. Yes, Teri Bauer is dead! <br /> <br /> Bruce Greenwood stars as FBI S.A.C. Tom Shea, who continually points out how he punches foreign diplomats in the face. Your boss is out, so no one in Dept. of Homeland Security believes in its prediction of the situation. He is the wiser of a group of paranoid public officials who fear to blame any kind of catastrophe. He is calm, he is strong, he is annoying. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing rescuing or entertaining about Meltdown - OK, well, maybe Teri Bauer being killed was quite unnecessary and funny - moreover, nothing redeeming.
