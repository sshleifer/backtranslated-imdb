This is just another bad Chuck Norris movie. Norris plays a cop on the trail of a serial killer of women. He put the guy out three years earlier but the guy somehow manages to cross the bars in the nut house where he's wearing what looks like flossing. Then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives him on a cliff of 400 feet and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation. The Irishman Jack O'Halloran is the best thing in this movie, but as in Superman II, he does not say a word. Somehow, that should make it more threatening. Ron O'Neal, of Super Fly and Steve James, is lost playing with the mayor of the city and the partner of Norris, respectively. The film also contains the stupid subplot of Norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 80's. By associating Norris's "serious" turn with exaggerated musical cues signaling each future scene predictably, the film becomes a daunting task. The buildup during the killer's quest in the theater is interesting enough with Norris crawling through the shadows to discover the refuge, but the final fight is disappointing after starting in such a promising way. It's more of a disappointment than Cannon Films, and it's like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.
