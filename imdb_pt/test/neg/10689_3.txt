Given the budget and inexperience of everyone involved, Livin 'tha Life could have been worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (which I always found very annoying), as a previous commentator noted, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (most) reactions happen for a long time (the problem of a director), has some comparatively subtle and funny moments, like when he's trying to instruct Jamal about the proper method of smoking a joint with a friend. All the while, he is generally more balanced and secure than Jamal, which could have been the germ of a good exploration of the contrasts in the relationship, but it has not been developed very far. <br /> <br /> But the inexperience of the writer / director / director of photography / etc. it is no excuse for your inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of a close? Even Ed Wood could do a close. I do not think it's a matter of budget. I could only give an overview of what any of the actors looks like, and not just because of no close-up, but the lighting ...! Lights for outdoor photography can cost a lot, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! This would require moving the camera closer to keep the reflector away from the shot, helping to solve the close-up problem at the same time. If this is too technical, you can turn the actors around so they do not get in the shade, or you can expose them to the shadows, and if it had not been filmed in Los Angeles, I'd say enjoy the cloudy days. Needless to say, the films that this is responsible for are all, with the possible exception of Bernie's Weekend, better than this, but Livin 'tha Life would have made a much better impression had it not made the viewer to close his eyes. the only way to catch a glimpse of any human element that might have been. <br /> <br /> The scene at the barbershop is just plain stupid.
