"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama set in the Japanese prisoner of war camp of WWII. The story cuts across past events and the present day, when old veterans plan a reunion. This is a very popular and controversial miniseries here in Australia. The budget was spent ($ 6.5 million in Australian dollars); historians and veterans criticized its authenticity; and critics called into question the disturbing blend of comedy and drama (shadows of "Pearl Harbor"). Writer John Doyle (half of the successful comedy team Roy & H.G.) tried to defend himself with comments about "the characters are composed of real people"; "the troops used comedy to deal with the situation"; "is based only on actual events"; "one of our actors was there" etc. I have no problem with these points. Many superb fictional and factual dramas came out of the Japanese P.O.W. "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence", "Bridge over the River Kwai", "Paradise Road", "Empire of the Sun", "Blood Oath" and "A Alice. " The comedy of black humor has been used successfully in dramas: "Life is Beautiful", "The Great Escape", "Seven Beauties", "Stalag 17", "The Colditz Story" and even "Hogan's Heroes". So why "Changi" is a monumental failure? - the performance in "Changi" is uniformly excellent, the music and the cinematography are good - it is the writing and the direction that disappointed it. Each scene seemed to give me déjà vu waves. When Anthony Hayes is made to stand in the scorching sun, I thought, "Did not I see Alec Guinness do this on" Bridge on the River Kwai "?" Sudden flashes of surreal songs and dances brought Dennis Potter's "Singing Detective," but without the finesse. This loan happened so often, that it was too lazy to write and cut, instead of paying homage. The constant interplay between past and present histories left me unable to focus on both. Flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it has left me distanced from the characters where intensity was needed. The "Business" is exaggerated - every conversation seemed to include "stone the bloody crows" and such, that I was saying "I understand the point, I know they are Australian." Cultural stereotypes extended to young Japanese and Japanese; tense British officer; Most Wise Japanese Commander; fun-loving, rudely Aussies etc. I thought I was watching "Heroes of Hogan on the River Kwai". After 3 episodes I'm leaving.
