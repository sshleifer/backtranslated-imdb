Occasionally I accidentally leave the television on after "South Park" and end up getting some of the high school disaster that is "Mind of Mencia". It's the only time I wanted my room to be cleaner because I would be able to find the remote much faster. The truth is, Comedy Central needed a replacement for "Chappelle's Show," and what they got was a show that appeals to both the idiots who miss Dave so much that they cling to any minority show or are satisfied with the simple "Mexicans love tacos" jokes that Carlos Mencia shovels in every week. I have to understand, though, that there are some people out there who actually find Mencia * shaken * funny. I firmly hold my words when I say that I believe these people exist only in myth. However, if you're really out there, just ask that you never enter my residential neighborhood, and read the main differences between Carlos and "Chappelle's Show": 1) Dave was funny. You may want to highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was FIVE TIMES as nervous as Mencia could expect to be. However, every time a promo of his little show goes on the air, it's all about him, playing his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before. You're right, Carlos. And not in a good way. Chappelle did not need to tell people he was nervous and funny. We all just get stuck to see the show to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had race jokes that plunged into some depth of different cultures - things that some people did not know. about. Like the segment of the game "I know black people". The big prize was a hair cream that blacks wear. This is deeper than Mencia would ever dare to dive into. So, how dare he call himself nervous? If Mencia were writing that sketch, the big prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid. And my accusations have some merit. I saw a promo for his show (which I affectionately called 'My TV monitor taking a minute for thirty minutes') a few days ago and it was a stereotyped Olympic sketch, which I admitted to myself was pretty Funny concept. Then I saw that the Mexican who won received a green card as a grand prize. That's it?! Is this the closest to the fire you want? Who could not think of it - in seventh grade? For fans of the show, if you're watching and miss one of your jokes - maybe because you and your friends were arguing like "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and is not in any way part of the joke where someone funny would have something smart to say - just remember that there are only five possible options for success: green card, tacos, edge jumpers, lawn mowers and, of course, duh-dur. Just remember - whatever it was, it was screamed. Enjoy! <br /> <br /> 4) Kind of relating to number two. Every time he says something that laughs, he pauses to tell people (while laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with the latter." So do not say that for the love of God. Or let people decide alone. He and Comedy Central keep pushing this crap in my throat saying he's the program that's more controversial than "The Da Vinci Code." You are not. You will never be. <br /> <br /> I've never been offended by the content of the series. I would never give so much credit. I am offended that Carlos Mencia has thirty minutes to shout unnecessarily. Yes ... I am literally offended by this fact.
