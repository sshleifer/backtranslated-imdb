First, let me say that I missed the Halloween movie night watching this crap. Secondly, let me inform you that the current DVD provided by the Shriek Show is not without cuts, so you will get very upset. Third, that scene is the highlight of the movie and since it was cut, well, you see where I'm going. <br /> <br /> I know that many horror fans dig this movie. It is atmospheric, filmed in the woods with a very nice scenery, waterfalls and such. But after the opening kill, which has a very brutal shot of a machete being trapped in a hunter's groin, you do not have brutal real deaths after that. And with a horror movie, you kind of want it. At least I do. The director and co. I do not do anything new with the killer in the idea of ​​woods, several of this type of film were all made right at the same time in the early eighties. The only thing this has to do with it is that you do not hate the actors as much as in other movies. They are kind of nice. Children have a reason to be there: one of them owns some property on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no cabin or house, so why buy a property in East Jesus, especially if you are not a hunter or something? Well, I'm sure some people buy land for campgrounds, but this seems unusual. Either way, two endemic endogamas appear and begin to chase the campers and catch them one by one. And, as I said before, you have practically nothing to do with decent deaths after the killing machete in the beginning. The ending has a kind of death by Connie, but even that is not enough to save it from being almost equal to the completely forgettable film, The Forest, which is mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> If the Shriek Show had been able to get a real uncut impression then this review could have been a bit more forgiving, but this is the day and age of uncut DVD movie releases obscure for moviegoers like me. When you ignore us, you receive criticism. Unfortunately, the presence of the great and paternal George Kennedy is the only highlight of this film to detach it from the garbage of the other garden that was produced in the past.
