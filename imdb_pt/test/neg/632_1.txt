I did my best to watch this two-hour fiasco. It combined the terrible special effects and plot of the original "Blob", with an execrable boost of the script (excellent in the original) of "Runaway Train". The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and thought it would combine that with a chance to host a selection sofa. What an amazing stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is eager to show us why he's going to take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as the creator of a typecast, a US senator from Texas and plays well. He should play the leading role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this film seem to have achieved their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial Scream Contest. Special effects are unbelievably bad. H.S. children in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. Writers must have stolen the clich√© bank to rack up so many. I could no longer watch without being forced to sit in the Mechanical Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Warning Emptor.
