It is inconceivable to me how anyone could have liked or laughed at this movie. I'd say it's the worst movie I've seen in years and I see a lot of them. Maybe I forgot about high school? It's also very hard to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels who did such a brilliant performance of George Washington in The Crossing. It seems that since he made Dumber, he went into the tank. Do you believe he even wrote and directed that garbage?
