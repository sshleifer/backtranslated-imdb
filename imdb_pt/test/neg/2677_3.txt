There is a lot wrong with this movie. You could say that making a Halloween sequel was a bad idea, and we should feel lucky that the previous entries, even the lowest ones, were still watchable. But still, "Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers" - even today - is so bad, it's shocking. Poor film production is worse, in fact. There's a lot of guilt out there. But where to start? Whose shoulders is this guilt resting? <br /> <br /> Was director of style-on-substance director Joe Chapelle? Well, at least the sixth installment is new on the visual front. And as far as the visual effects go, you can see Michael killing in gruesome ways, even if it does not fit into the overall tone of the series. <br /> <br /> Daniel Ferrands' troubled script being the culprit? Well, to be fair, he did the best he could. By the time you reach the sixth entry in any series, you're running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme for Michael's reason is not a bad concept as much as uninteresting, especially the way it is treated here. And it really does help that the film has been cut into pieces and stitched so many times that the story is completely lost to the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe Dimension / Miramax could have spoiled everything. After all, this was the first studio movie of the series "Halloween" and we all know what happens when many cooks enter the kitchen. Heck, look at the unbelievable lows they dragged "Hellraiser" to? I think everyone is to blame, because beyond the actors and visual effects, it seems that no one struggles to make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> The end result is that no matter how much you cut, cut, cut or electrocute until your head explodes, "Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers" has never been a good movie. Marking an all-time low for the series that almost killed any credibility for Michael Myers, "Curse" is just that: cursed. The angle of the thorn was never interesting, nor was it probably expanded. The unnecessary gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the name "Halloween." Towards the end, the movie stops making sense, stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and finish the movie before anything is lost. It is sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film, even if the man did his best in the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there are other strong cast members in this film. Paul Rudd plays the weird and anti-social adult Tommy Doyle of course, while Marianne Hagan does a good job portraying the nice female lead. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Lloyd's reissue was a shame, and thank God Devin Gardner does not make any more films. As the child in the movie being chased by the "Man in Black", Danny is the anti-Jamie in that he is annoying, crying and absolutely unbelievable in his role. It's sad when you can not even feel sympathy for a child in a horror movie. But I think it's "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. Essentially, this is the anti-Halloween, made by a director who did not know what he was doing and a studio that had its own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the edgy "Halloween" because of its sci-fi twist, but in fact it's just stupid. Save for some good visuals and decent characters, "The Curse Of Michael Myers" is almost as bad as it gets. And this comes from a fan!
