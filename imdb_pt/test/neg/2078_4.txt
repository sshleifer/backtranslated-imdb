Before I begin to investigate whether this movie is worth it or not, I must inform you that I have never seen another adaptation of Carmen, so if you are looking for an evaluation of how you rank among others, this may not be very useful. <br /> The only time I came across Carmen was on the car radio when I traveled through Spain on a family vacation as a teenager. I did not pay much attention because I did not like opera at the time and did not know anything. The story exists 150 years ago. Do I feel like I lost after watching this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because if all the actresses representing Carmen looked like Paz Vega, I would have all the adaptations happily seated in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vicente Aranda also co-rewriting the story with Joaquim Jordà), the story is told through the eyes of the original author Prosper Mérimée, a French writer making his way through nineteenth-century Spain. He encounters Jose (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a delinquent soldier and one of the many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sensational, sexy and gorgeous gypsy woman who has the devil's mouth, the temper of a bull ' and who imprudently leads men to their fate. The moment he meets Joseph, she is drawn to her independent behavior. But she catches him, wraps him around and lets him go, often. Until one day Jose is wanted for murder. Carmen convinces him to join his band of gypsy smugglers. They seem to be settling down, she fell in love with him, but she knows the charming Scamillo, the bullfighter. Can Joseph contain his jealousy or does it destroy him? <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and seductive story, something that almost resembles a plot of Shakespeare or Ovid, with pictures of immense passion and emotion that can make us or break us and transform us to do things out of character. . It is poetic, ardent and, above all, slutty. I hung up, did not know where I was going to turn. I always hoped that Jose could change Carmen's dirty little ways. I will not say whether he succeeded or not. <br /> <br /> The above synopsis is what I took from the movie, but I was not impressed with the movie itself. It was only after watching her that I delved a bit more into the story and realized how much of a missed opportunity Aranda had made in recounting the classic of Mérimée. It was a shallow, mean-spirited mistake of the period that saw Paz Vega spend most of the time partially or completely naked (not that I'm complaining about it in particular!). First of all the acting was bad. I was not impressed with Sbaraglia as Jose. I'm still not sure if he was a weak actor or if José was supposed to be a weak character, I did not read the book. He was supposed to be a man with a burning desire for Carmen, but he spends most of his time looking confused, jealous, and a little somber. Paz Vega was a bit better as Carmen. I was convinced by his hardened and perverse character, despite having seen more convincing performances by her in other films, such as Zapping and Lucia and El Sexo. She seems too beautiful to play a gypsy woman (not that I have met many Andalusian gypsy women), so in a way, the role did not really fit her. The other actors in the movie were not great either. They seemed to do everything without much enthusiasm. Is the story passionate, emotional? They seemed kind of arsed, as if they could not wait to get out the cramped 19th century costumes that they were wearing. <br /> <br /> However, the costumes, I was impressed with - one of the redeeming factors of the film. I like the Spanish culture, I liked the uniforms of the soldiers, the women's hats and the flamenco dresses. They set the time right. That's all I can say about it. Sorry, back to criticism. <br /> <br /> The script, as stated above, was co-rewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà, and so poorly done that it left Mérimée revolving in his grave. It was boring. He did not make the best use of José's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just acting). There were lines of cheese piled on top of each other, Satan and diabolical connotations everywhere, among millions of profanities. I know the Spaniards are partial to the weird expletive, but the movie was full of whore, 'whore', literally in every line. Perhaps it was realistic in the 19th century in the poverty of Seville, but history itself did not need it. <br /> <br /> Editing and camera work was monotonous and common. There was only a little that I really liked, and that was when the camera followed a close-up of flying in the air, which rests on Carmen's face. That was good. But the rest? To conclude, it is sad to see such a great story being wasted with unconvincing acting and direction. If you are a literature teacher, let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. However, only the male half of the class will be paying any interest in the film, thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, stay with the opera version (even if I hate musicals). I give this movie 4, just because I love the plot! And Peace Vega!
