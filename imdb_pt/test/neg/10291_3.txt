This movie was * good * relatively during the early parts of it. <br /> <br /> We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... none of that matters because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Although it was a major turnaround ... it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately downgraded the movie from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else see why the turnaround is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it's bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the hour and the previous twenty minutes. There is no connection with the killers. <br /> <br /> The killers are in about 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two FBI agents are in only 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty. /> <br /> We get ... vigilance ... Oh, the Assassins are voyeurs. Which does not make sense, because they were only described in limited terms as being just psychopaths. And the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we're seeing on the three floors goes out the window while everyone's dead in five minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a lot of FBI agents in the beginning ... what do FBI agents sleep together? Everything in the same room. Being found and murdered by amateurs and then personified by people who know nothing about being FBI agents? A policeman three meters away apparently can not hit any of them with a standard police pistol that can fire multiple shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd heels that they think we'll believe. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after being revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere ...
