Having watched the first scene, I realized that the performance was so bad that I could not catch it later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology, just as a five-year-old tries to make it sound like he knows what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> The second-to-second storyline is completely unrealistic and almost every decision the writer made was the kind you expect from a below-average student. The general plot was as unoriginal and predictable as a packet of sausages. The few attempts to make the dialogues seem intelligent were limited to neurotic and apologetic behavior. A ten-year-old might like it. But it would take a five-year-old to accept the lack of realism; Because the advanced cell function allows someone to bypass a code lock by touching it like a magic wand, choose one of hundreds of voices through a ventilation system (and thus by pulling out Superman) and repair a home computer just by feeling what is going wrong instead of looking for flaws? In fact, this is an example: the failure was that one of the cooling tubes (aluminum strips) on the CPU was broken, as it would be if an exhaust pipe from a V8 engine was blown off by an explosion. This is something that can not happen and if it did, it would not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric current passing through this tape, but when he (without doing it alone, his arms worked by the autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient) put a pin on the tear, a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without initializing . <br /> <br /> And so goes all the way. Like when he escaped from an interrogation room at NSA headquarters, lighting a lighter below a fire sensor, resulting in open doors throughout the building. Of course, the NSA did not foresee this insightful approach to escape, nor did it put guards outside its room (or anywhere else) to protect a living advance in military nanotechnology. Then he left and got a taxi. Examples like this are not just numerous, nor is there a single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, the so-called great effects were terrible. He threw a basketball back to a child in the park, and the boy was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized trolley. I'm sure that if I paused and looked for the cables that held this boy's posture the way only the cables do, they probably did not know or bother to turn them off completely. If someone is thrown so far into a tree, they would say at least (or rather, be hospitalized with broken bones), but the boy was just confused and amazed. <br /> <br /> Moronic. This is the word for every creative decision made throughout the production. I'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist, someone as ill-qualified as he can not get better. I feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it, and the time it took to write this. Although it seemed therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get an approved pilot. The only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily would be prison or lobotomy.
