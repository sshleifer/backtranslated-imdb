Truly terrible waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this movie until completion, but we had to turn it off about 30 minutes from the end. And I can count the movies I hung up before the end, on the one hand. <br /> <br /> The script and direction are heavy and deeply uninspired. I would not be surprised if they found the script in a 1983 pile of scripts. For example, the annoying threat threatening the real estate guy on his home phone. I mean seriously. The police would be knocking on the door in a few minutes. Scenes and events are just bathed by you like shit on the river. It's hard to understand the real thrust of the movie. The narrative flows among the characters in a seemingly random way, breaking the pathetic attempts to build the characters. Oh and what "characters" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is terrible. He could have just sent a cardboard cut from him and stayed in bed. After about 60 minutes of the movie I had built absolutely no attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor obnoxious. Just a disfigured doll from a shop window that ran through every scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his usually grumpy and unemotional delivery. Is he happy? He is sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring at you from a disfigured piece of flesh. And the Native American theme is simply awful and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Good guys are, at best, despicable. A white-collar stereotype and a neurotic stereotype of ex-wife. Archetypal wife Cue with shotgun face off with the villain, "you will not shoot me" which is both unnatural and unnerving. The richie nix character seems interesting at first, but soon falls into an irritating unilateral psychotic character. Which seems at odds with the apparent intent of making the bad guys somehow sympathetic or at least realistically motivated. <br /> <br /> Roasario Dawsons's character begins with some promise, but soon falls into a sickly, childish parody of the gangsters. Jackie Brown pinto scenes. Do you really want me to believe that your character was so attracted to Rourke? Or worse is she just a slut who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /> <br /> In short, a complete mess of a movie. Characterizations and performances without hope. A lead and banal script, along with an uninspired direction. And finally, extremely dull. It's not even bad comedy. Laughing at Rourkes' face gets quite old after sitting in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
