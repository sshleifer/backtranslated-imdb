I am a big fan of Thomas Harris, I have read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book that I love the most. So the movie was my biggest disappointment and I really do not understand why some people here give it a nine or even a ten. Either their requirements are very low or they have not read the book or both. Even if I had not read the book I would still regard the film as the absolute average and I would give it a five. The scary and mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear once in the movie, when I first saw it in the movies until I fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important character, totally omitted? Why was Barney shown as an ignorant donkey whose only ambition is to make money? And, most of all, why did the psychological process Starling end up with, caused by the drugs Lecter applied to her, came down? Not to mention the fact that the end was omitted too and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling are well known and I accepted it, although, like many others, I was very disappointed because I identified Starling with her. For stories like Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal who owns such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they are adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say, this is "yesterday's snow". Ridley Scott has made some incredibly good movies, but with this he does not live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships with each other in The Silence of the Lambs, he should have done Hannibal as well. My only comfort is that I've seen the movie only twice, it's been a long time and thank goodness, for that reason, I can not see the movie scenes when I read the novel. I'm sorry, but I really can not recommend it to anyone.
