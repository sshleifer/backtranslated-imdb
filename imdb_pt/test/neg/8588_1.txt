Another stupid attempt to make the film "violent" and "intriguing" - whatever that means. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - "Television killed football". Yes, whatever. This is another film that shows Delusions of Grandeur by Oliver Stone. If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his camera moves and Kid Rock songs? He even plays Cameron Diaz in the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to find themselves in a movie that is so bad. Since "Scent of Woman," writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. Their characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices covering what would normally be redundant and banal. He needs to reinvent himself by showing how he can act without shouting. He has to stop feeling sorry for fake scripts with cheesy lessons like "Organized football is messy" and staging a good story.
