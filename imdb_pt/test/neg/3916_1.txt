Oh gosh! ohdear ohdear ohdear <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... er ... 'movie' just puts the space movies in shame. Every science fiction movie I've seen in the past year has been disappointing to some degree, and now I'm seriously reconsidering the genre of movies I really like in the future! (Maybe I watch romantic movies from now on!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And that's not saying much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so foolish that it rivals Battlefield Earth and Baby Geniuses in sheer evil. The special effects are obviously fake, the Big Mac Truck seemed to stoopid with its roller coaster seat restrictions, the killer robots looked like a sillier version of the Power Rangers, a huge fat guy is sucked in from a first porthole window and . .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can do better than that. What really shocked were the two young good-looking things that accompany him and run with nothing but his underwear (??) for a total of two-thirds of the film! The obligatory 'sex scene' between our young heroes was so poorly executed that I almost choked on the laughing friendships on the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The only character worth mentioning is the pirate captain / cyborg. / crazy scientist. He exuded the word grotesque and was predictably contemptible, but I believe he could have been much more menacing. He does and says things that are very funny (all the best scenes surround him!) So for the captain I give that movie an extra point. <br /> <br /> But this movie is so bad that you will want to vomit abuse on TV or maybe throw your TV out the window! It can even kill some brain cells and put it into a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain struggles to walk around his cock leg when it is obviously a fake cock leg! I would have given 0 out of 10, but since he breaks me with his antics ... this movie gets 1/10!
