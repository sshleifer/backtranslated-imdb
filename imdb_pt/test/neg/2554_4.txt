If it had not been for the hilarious role of Christopher Guest, I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were simple, the movie was agitated and slow, certain characters were unpleasant and painful to watch, but the character of Guest kept me laughing so I stayed with him. <br /> <br /> I feel there are much better choices there!
