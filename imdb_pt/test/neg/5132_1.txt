My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 in the blockbuster. If I had known how horrible this movie would be, I would not have paid a penny. I had no warning for this bs. The acting can not even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is awkward, and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the male villain ... god, who could not say that he I was going to attack Emily and the music tracks ... my lord. This movie makes me want to cry. Never rent it. In fact, if you happen to look at it, evaluate your eyes. This movie is not from God, it's from hell. I'm just going to get the last two lines to write blah, blah, blah shiz, because I really do not want to continue with this review.
