I watched this movie last night, I'm a big fan of the book, and I was really happy with the version that starred Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon. But this one is awful. Oh my God, I do not understand how they dared tear this classic story apart and made the characters totally different, starting with Beth changing to being the younger sister, and making Amy the third. And Jo's interpretation, Terrible, Jo was a young feminist, intelligent and a little annoyed, and the actress who plays Jo in this movie acts like a silly and very boring little girl. What about Laurie going to war? I'm okay with the fact that when a book is made into a movie, there have to be some changes, but it does not rewrite the whole story. very very poorly done.
