Semblante! Antoine Monot, in an imitation of Kevin Smith's Bob Silent, keeps asking for it, but writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert simply can not say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. Of course Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman underestimated the old-school fame of "There's Something About Mary," which graced any story of abandoning a small town. In visual fascination, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his two-door tan six-series BMW, wearing aviator goggles, going nowhere. It is true that he * accidentally * sleeps with his wide-eyed Bohemian sister (Marie Zielcke), but who would not? Thumbs up also to how it goes in black and white in a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you're looking for a slightly more serious interpretation of what intoxication can do with you, I suggest that you check "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".
