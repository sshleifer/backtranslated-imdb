Being a big fan of Laura Gemser, I picked it up at a video store just to see another Emanuelle movie. Boy, I made a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE IN EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is together with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but this is the only connection with Emanuelle. Here, Laura plays "Laura" (original, huh?) A beautiful supermodel who will visit her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. In tow are his photographer Carlo (a Gabriele Tinti looking downcast) and a blond woman who is never named. Also living in Pia's mansion is Horatio (the sexy but dumb Al Cliver), a mystic who says nothing but nonsense. Arriving for the weekend are two daughters of Pia, a short-haired lesbian and the other brunette. A lot of sex is implied, but hardly shown. A good-looking actor plays Ali, the Egyptian servant, who is lucky with three of the women in the mansion. Laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and the blonde sex with Horatio in an Egyptian orgy, Laura drinks goat blood and is possessed during an Egyptian ceremony, Carlo attacks Laura. Everything happens with so little talent that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Far from being erotic, even the actors themselves seem bored during their sex scenes. Considering that there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of sex scenes available is countless. . Instead, a film that offers a first-rate Eurocult cast and never delivers the products will irritate every viewer except the hardcore Laura Gemser. Otherwise, avoid EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
