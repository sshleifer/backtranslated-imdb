Miranda Cosgrove is known for her "School of Rock" debut with Jack Black and her role as Megan in the "Drake and Josh" show and she became a fan favorite among the Nickelodeon audience, so it's no surprise that Dan Schneider would create a show just for her. Unfortunately, it turns out to be as bad as, if not worse than, "The Amanda Show". <br /> <br /> "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols in the high junior community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts and Freddie shoots and puts them on the internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, played by hilarious Jerry Trainor, who is known for his work on "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you this. Do not believe the 8.3 of 10 that this program received because it is pathetic in almost every respect. Dan Schneider probably spent about 5 minutes studying teen interests because all I see is him saying "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Aha! Teens love anything that starts with 'i'!" and most of the shows that were used in "Drake and Josh," if not, then they are very dry and forced jokes that do not count on a generous laugh, like "Do you want me to increase the AC to 60 degrees?" "No. We want you to turn that into 60 pickles!" Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all sets at the shows were used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified" which were simply spit and polished with random things to try to make it look different. The scenes in which the show is showing an iCarly network broadcast is as dreadful as the entire series itself. The dialogue in them is excruciatingly bad, which can be accepted by some as they are just two friends playing in front of a camera, but whats the problem with the really strange and bland antics they like "Random Dancing! "? And it only gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jennette are not at their best by far. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is sometimes not credible, but he does a good job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous dexterity of Jerry Trainor, who fits very well into his role as "big brother protector" and his wide-eyed, wide-eyed acting can make some pretty funny segments. Too bad they are not frequent because this may have given the program an extra star in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have done this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove his own cable TV. playground to jump and make bland jokes and pathetic lines of signage boards in all directions because everyone has an exceptional talent buried under the poorly done script and acting without weight. Dan Schneider did a great job with "Drake and Josh," so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is a failure. Jerry Trainor's performance saved this show from a rating of 1 out of 10, but he alone can not save "iCarly" from being as horrible as it is.
