This movie is so bad they would not buy it back from my locally used CD / DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four albums, but they would not buy back the Underworld, and the other two movies redefined the rank, so what does this say about that movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store, which even bought DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they would not buy back Underworld as well. This film is bad at all levels, and is one of those that came out in the post-Tarantino glutton of the mid-1990s. The only slightly redeemable element is Dennis Leary telling Joe Montegna that he is a "stinking friend" and calls him from "Mister Stinky Friend". This phrase is so deliciously horrible that I can not fail to quote it at least once a week in describing a stinking friend. But now that I've enlightened you with this quote, you do not have to go through the pain of watching this movie.
