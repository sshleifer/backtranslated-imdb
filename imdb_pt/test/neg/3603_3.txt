Another direct to the Disney video movie, which is essentially perfect for children. The problem with Kronk's new Groove is that everything that made the first movie a great fun has been replaced by a sadder and darker movie. In this film, Kronk learns many lessons at the expense of many others. It takes a long time to create a nicer movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns for payment and one for Birdwell hopes to defeat the Kronk Field Counseling Championship. This all leads to Kronk confronting his father and his disapproval of the son's direction in life. <br /> <br /> From Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's Thriller, Kronk's new Groove recycles every time he lets entertain. your viewers. If you loved the original, or are looking forward to the next TV series on Kuzco, I recommend Kronk to his loyal fans.
