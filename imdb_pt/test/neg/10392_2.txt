This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. A friend of mine took the shelf from the video store and almost forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. Ehh ... Where to begin? Writing, acting, quality? All this, sucked. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly some of the worst writings ever shown in a movie. The dialog box was worse than I thought it could be in the movies. Such blatant dialogues as "how are you doing?" ... "not so great, doctor" (directly after an attempt to exorcism the daughter of a man and then suicide attempt of his wife. Of course he is not that big). points, funny. If not horribly written, planned and obvious. The overall plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was as if the writers could not create anything better to write a lot of bad dialogues and play as many sex and nudity scenes as randomly. The only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed girl & Peirced) was filmed with such low quality that it looked more like a cheap movie than a feature film. Oh, yes, and they never took action. <br /> <br /> The acting? Horrible. x100 I think the only good actor was the little Spaniard who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And his part was written horribly. The worst performance? Arguably, Paul Kappellas, whose performance combined with shit music, a gun, and a semi-blue-white girl running through the jungle made the movie almost unbearable to sit on. He even ruined his own death scene, which should have been easy to hit. Although most other people have also been horrible. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters also contributed to the overall sucking level of the film. There were just enough characters for almost half of the characters to die, the same amount of people was possessed at one point, and then the remaining characters could not be counted in one hand. Like ... 50 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> Q. What is this with the climax of the exorcism films going on in a stable, anyway?
