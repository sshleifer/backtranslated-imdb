Ugh Even the ever popular Diane Lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting thing in the movie was to see if Rourke's face would move. We heard so much gossip about his ugly face lift, etc., as well as an accident on the side of the road, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional killer who somehow clings to wild, uncontrollable punk, and throughout this movie we're wondering why this guy gets this idiot, let alone get the guy in the first place. So the crime that was not committed has the professional to go after the witnesses. He would have put them right there. But then, we would not have a movie, would we? And why did the realtor agree to extortion? There were more holes in this film than in my drainer. The acting was horrible, the whole movie predictable until the minute and until the end. And a lot could have been done to make this movie so much better. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and you do not need to use brain cells in the process, that movie is exactly what the doctor ordered.
