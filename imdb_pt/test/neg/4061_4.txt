As a big fan of DM, needless to say I've seen this movie countless times. However, I watch purely for the filming of the show ... the rest of the movie is, um, terrible, sad to say. <br /> <br /> The famous director of rock music DA Pennebaker followed the Mode in the late 80s Music For The Masses tour, which promoted the excellent album of the same name. Title 101 stems primarily from the fact that the included concert material is from the 101st and last concert of the Pasadena Bowl tour, but it is also a reference to the film being a 'beginner's course' in the band and how it works. Depeche Mode 101. Amid the quartet filming live and exploring the United States, there is a second topic covering a group of DM fans who have won a competition to meet the band, go on tour on their own bus and watch the show Last. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the filming of the show is great. The mood is here at the top of its form as stadium rock gods, which was an unusual achievement for a band back in the late 80's. Although the film captures the band before recording their 1990 masterpiece, "Violator", there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here, for example, Behind The Wheel, The Majestic Never Let Me Down Again, Everything Counts, Just Can Get Enough from the Vince Clarke Years, Shake The Disease and many more. <br /> <br /> When Mode is on stage, they are brilliant. When they are not, they are very boring. Nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the boys as they check out the US in the last days of the Reagan administration. As an example, the likely "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exactly electrifying thing. I know all bands do not have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real excitement comes from several clips centered on the lead singer Dave. Gahan. Gahan appears at 101 as being mildly psychotic, talking about a violent power within himself that he can not control, remembering a bizarre rage involving a taxi driver and so on. There's a point in the movie where he throws a prima donna tantrum at a poor guy behind the scenes - really embarrassing. The man clearly had problems at the time, which fortunately were resolved. Composer Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are portrayed as very articulate, clearly massively talented, but also totally colorless; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member, Alan Wilder, is the only one of the quartet who takes away the personality of the rock star with any kind of aplomb. <br /> <br /> And as for the topic 'fan tour', well, it's countless scum. . Let's not fool ourselves. Maybe it's because it's all so late, but the bunch of devout young people does little for me, but it creates a sense of irritation. They are, to a person, singularly superficial and insipid people whose tricks are banal when they are not worth hiding. Let me reiterate .... * nothing * happens in the filming that is not on the stage that is of some interest. Anything. Endless scenes of children spraying their hair, arguing senselessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in the cities on the way to shows and meeting their partners in bed with another winner of the competition makes me think of only one thing - if Cure fans were with the annoying mind in 88/89. The love that young people have for the band is something I can definitely relate to, and sometimes it's contagiously happy, but if what we see is the most interesting thing ever filmed of them, then I'd hate to see the outtakes. <br /> <br /> But music is all that matters and, in this respect, 101 stands out. The Pasadena concert, one of the best shows of all time, makes the movie worth it. The recent DVD release of the film comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unreleased footage of the concert (80% of the performance), and thus makes DVD an absolute must for fans. The band's audio commentary (minus Wilder, who left Mode in the mid-1990s) on the first album is also, strangely, far more interesting than the film itself. As a document of Basildon's boys during his amphitheater idol period, Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you're looking for fun, you better have the live double album (now available in Super Audio CD format).
