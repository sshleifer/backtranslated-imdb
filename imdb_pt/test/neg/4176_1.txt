This movie was awful ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading because it featured a scarecrow and a scythe, and none of them appeared in this movie. The beginning was a mix of random scenes that, most of them, had nothing to do with the movie except that they kind of show that the man is psychic ... but not very well. .. After the first 10 minutes of the movie, there is an hour of just the man character watching over his daughters. It is vaguely interesting when daughters meet two girls who died the year before. But that is the extent of it. <br /> <br /> And why, I might ask, was this movie rated R? There were two drops of blood and four profanities. And how on earth did you enter a store? This film was misinterpreted, poorly filmed, poorly written and, overall, terribly executed.
