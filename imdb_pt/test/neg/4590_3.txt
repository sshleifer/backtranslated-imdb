Give me some time. How can anyone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? I know movies tend to do a very poor job of portraying hockey to the general public. And yes, this was done when the US did not embrace our sport in the current measure, but in fact. I played hockey all my life and watched even more, and this my friends is pure madness. The ice scenes were incredibly bizarre ... the particular case I refer to is the "sword fight", ie the "stick fight" at the end of the movie ... during which everyone is standing and watching , not with the fascination that this is really happening, but with admiration of who will win the duel between Youngblood and his enemy Rakkie. Yes, the ice story is a bit better, I do a little stress. <br /> <br /> I do not know, maybe it does not make sense to continue ... I mean, let's face it: the movie is right. Hockey is just a big battle on the ice ... oh yes, with a small piece of vulcanized rubber jumping around - occasionally, for what is loosely called a "goal". Youngblood is scary or hysterical, I can not figure out which one ... maybe someone has more luck.
