There were cool characters here, played by nice-looking actors and actresses, plus a famous band and some famous dancers ... but the movie simply did not work. When that was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was stupid, humor (especially that of Milton Berle) was totally stupid and music was not just my alley. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big band fan, anyway, and if I hear "In The Mood" again I'm going to throw up. <br /> <br /> This was my first look at the famous skater actress Sonja Henie and I have no complaints from her. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it's so dated that it's no funnier. Berle, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot and Costello etc etc were hilarious to the crowd in the 1940s and 50s, but the mood changes, and what was funny back then is not today.
