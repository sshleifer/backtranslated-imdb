This movie was horrendous. How could anyone like this movie, and for those who liked it because of the jokes, they really should look hard in the mirror and wonder if the stereotypes are not bad. Ignoring the face of racial stereotypes, it was horrible. It never had its moments, if paid homage to the 80, "Airplane!", Must pay a little more. Terrible acting, terrible script written, even for a movie with Mo'Nique or Tom Arnold. This movie was bad from the beginning but people may have seen the whole thing by the thought that the plane would fail. One of the worst movies of all time, stay away.
