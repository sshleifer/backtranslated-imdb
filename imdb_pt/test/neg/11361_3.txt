I do not understand why some of you (or many) gave this movie up to 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Of course, this may be a zombie movie with a few spatters, but that's it. I'm not a hater in zombie movies, but that was awful. Really, in fact, I should call it more like a zombie soap, because that's how the acting is. The production is ... well, okay. Just an attempt at plot development, horrible acting, silly effects, clich√©s, and an abrupt ending. Go ahead and enjoy zombie movies, but never give it above 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
