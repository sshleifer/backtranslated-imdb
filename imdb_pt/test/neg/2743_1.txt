On the heels of the well-received and beloved classic adult film, about the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood, George Lucas's American Graffiti, we have Cooley High. A kind of adaptation by Eric Monte, co-creator of the popular 1970s CBS sitcom Good Times. Cooley High was, and is, seen as a black version of American Graffiti. Instead of central California, as in American Graffiti, we have the black cabrini green shantytown of Chicago as the background for the story here. Instead of America in 1962 Cooley High is set in 1964. Film stars Welcome Back Kotter, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs and Glynn Turman as the film's main protagonists and their main characters. Garrett Morris plays the director trying to keep the characters of Jacobs and Turman, called Coceise and Preach, away from problems most of the time. <br /> <br /> You know, I'd like to say that Cooley High is a worthy piece of comparison to American Graffiti or that it's a great movie by itself, but I can not. The problem is that the producers of the film could not or did not hide the sad negative side of black life in America. Having the movie in the Cabrini Green part of Chicago does not help things. <br /> <Not even the gross coarse attempts at humor here. When Coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college, he finds out that his younger brother threw a toilet. When the gang visits the Chicago Zoo, one of the gang members named Pooter, has manure thrown over him by a monkey. When Turman's character, Preach, is being chased by two thugs at the school's meeting place (a dirty and depressing place to eat for much fewer people), he opens the girls' bathroom door while a girl is relieving herself. he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! High school, the houses of the characters, the bathrooms, practically everywhere in the movie show the unfortunate aspect of urban decay and poverty. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, there was a crude display of humor. in the movie. The use of violence and profanity in the film. Cooley High can be a ripening film, but it's a hard-and-hard maturing film with little or no intelligence and a taste for nostalgia that made people love and appreciate American Graffiti so much. <br /> Motown Records helped make the movie. The company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. But so far you have the same feeling that you've heard these songs before a million times. Not that they were not great songs within themselves, but the black music of that period of time was more than just Motown. Especially in Chicago. The music near the end of the film, by Spinners' G.C. Cameron, it was not that impressive. There were better Motown ballads than were done by better Motown artists than Cameron without question. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie showing where the characters went to pay homage to the movie Cooley High, which it purported to be American Graffiti. This shows that Preach, an intelligent student but with poor performance, went to Hollywood and became a successful television writer. Eric Monte may have defined himself as the character of Turman. The last scene of the movie's show, Preach, running away from Coceise's funeral, held on a dark, rainy afternoon, and all the desolation that Cooley High came to represent. Eric Monte, through Preach and that final scene, had a little lesson for all of us when we watched Cooley High and for the love of the past. Do not look back.
