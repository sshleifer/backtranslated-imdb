The only interesting part of this film was jazz and reggae New Orleans. He tries to be one of those films that has two fights that the heroine has to overcome, one of the past and one of the present that she can not do convincingly. The acting is bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised that this went straight to the video. The end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced, including the actors themselves.
