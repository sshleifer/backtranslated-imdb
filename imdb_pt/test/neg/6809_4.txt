Dustin Hoffman's feature debut is not as bad as it's reputed; a Spanish / Italian co-production filmed in Italy with the director using the pseudonym "Dan Ash" (!), the film is patchy, but it usually deflects and deals with a multitude of obscure characters in search of $ 1,000,000 hidden by gangster Cesar Romero (who, despite being outsourced - after Elsa Martinelli himself and Hoffman himself - expires even before the credit sequence has arrived!). Hoffman's performance, of course, is far from being as nuanced as in later films, but he manages to avoid embarrassment by interpreting what amounts to a rather awkward kind - an American Treasury agent an accident-prone Sicilian ancestry (called Puzzu, which no one seems capable of hitting!) sent by the company to retrieve the money and send it remains "discreet", but instead is always getting into trouble - although it turns out to be surprising ingenious in finding the loot, frustrating the bad guys and winning the girl (Martinelli as the daughter of Romero, who is a bit lost here) !! <br /> <br /> Still, the best moments of the film are provided by the moderate gangster Riccardo Garrone: in addition to his tough persona and the hilarious use of the dialect, he is flanked by a trio of idiots who does not prove an obstacle in fulfillment of your various schemes! Moreover, in view of the history being made in Rome, it is strange that the police investigating the case are Spanish (undoubtedly a requirement of the co-production agreement)! Over the years, I've lost several of Hoffman's Italian comedies - ALFREDO, ALFREDO (1972) - several times (I think, mainly, because Leonard Maltin only valued this) * 1/2 in his "Movies & Video Guide" ... but, then, MADIGAN'S MILLION wins a BOMB! With Pietro Germi directing and co-starring the delightful Stefania Sandrelli, the credentials of this film are certainly more respectable, and I really hope it will reappear on Italian TV soon ...
