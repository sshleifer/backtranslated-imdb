Dean Cain, the only Superman, plays Max Hooper, the super thief. It can invade any company and steal anything for the right price. Unfortunately, his latest assault puts him in a skyscraper where another person will set fire to hide his own attempts to steal the product. Now the thief sees himself having to be the hero who rescues everyone in the building. Unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and F.B.I. & C.I.A. are out there waiting for Max. <br /> <br /> The film is hardly acceptable. Dean Cain is a fun actor and did a lot better with more improved material, but here he is overwhelmed with a weak script and a very bad direction.
