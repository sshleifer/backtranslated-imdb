Exceptionally silly actioner with braindead takes on a story that would have suited a Spiderman padding issue. The action sequences never really flow as they should, leaving some fresh orphaned pieces in a sea of ​​sound and fury, meaning nothing. I really wonder how they will release this in the West. Sam Lee introduces himself as a mad, newcomer Edison Chan does not exhibit any acting talent yet. The robot is awkward and not very impressive, and the CGI effects (though done by American sfx people) are ridiculous, totally destroying any suspension of disbelief. I'm not looking forward to Gen-Z Cops ...
