Okay, with this movie there are a lot of ingredients at work: First we put a bunch of country truckers - good oily boys who have a secret desire to take the laws into their own hands. Second placed in bad country cops controlled by an outlaw bred in Texas. Third placed in a karate fight trucker played by Chuck Norris. Fourth, a stupid adolescent like Norris's nephew, captured by evil cops. Fifth Chuck Norris Show Fighting in Slow Motion. <br /> <br /> Now mix everything and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a very mediocre movie!
