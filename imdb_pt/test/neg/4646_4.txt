Well, I read the book first and thought, wow, that would be cool to see in a movie, so I started researching and found that there was already a movie made of it ... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and watched they ... they did it very wrong! at first this Hapi kid, who is no character of the book, then the mixture between the two books ("the river god" and "the seventh parchment") than Nicolas in need of funds while in the book himself is actually the financier , the whole thing about the Hyksos is also wrong. Taila supposedly invented the light carriage ... the whole thing on the grave is also very wrong ... there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of vacuum. sucking around him .. the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the old game of the good. There was nothing in the film about Nicolas being English and Royan was a Christian Coptic in the book, not a Muslim .. This list is endless .. There were only a few good things about the movie, the actors who played Royan, Nahood Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, not even close to the character who was in my head while I was writing the book. It is a shame that such a large book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith gave his permission for this.
