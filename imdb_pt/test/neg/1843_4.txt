The concept for this movie was very good. But somehow the execution failed in many parts. There are not many horror movies I can think of used dolls that looked so realistic. Especially when these puppets start to blink their eyes or move their hands. So much could have been done with this premise. There were many scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. And I really was waiting for scary things to happen. But the movie has never been scary. One of the main reasons is that the story is minimal and predictable. I really thought they did it on purpose in order to surprise us with a wonderful touch. Unfortunately this does not happen. Well, at least not in the way I expected. The cast also failed to make everything believable. It would have been nice if more depth had been given to the characters. In the beginning, when we are introduced to the main character. It seems that she and other characters are invited by some kind of artist. But it is also evident that they themselves have no idea what they are invited to. Of course this is part of the mystery. But this seems unlikely. If I received an invitation without having a clue what the business is, I simply would not. Also, most of the characters are not really nice with the end result that you never care about them. Another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise that is frightening enough and brings new elements that are never explained and are not relevant to the "mystery of the Doll Master." Overall, this movie has been a big disappointment to me. If you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls, see "Dead Silence"!
