You do not have to spend a lot of time seeing this made for a TV movie or a serial pilot or whatever it is to find out exactly what is in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this is not the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can not remember. While acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz to Vera Miles to Sal Mineo, writing is atrocious and the story is invented, full of insipid stereotypes and an obvious imitation of Ken Kesey. Why should Hollywood always present tales from the sixties as if the so-called hippies were one-dimensional idiots? It is a pity that such an interesting time in our exceptionally conformist social experience is generally portrayed as trash out and out, so that the slightest offense of the genre is now accepted as reasonably authentic, when almost nothing comes close to the way things really were . . The best I've seen so far is a memoir called Looking Back from a guy named Becker, but who else has heard of him? No one in Hollywood for sure. They are too busy pushing their guts like that groan of a movie to bother with reality.
