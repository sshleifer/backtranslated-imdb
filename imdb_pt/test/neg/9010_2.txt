I accept that most of the 50's are not scary by today's standards, but what the hell is this? When you see a title like this, you expect to see blood and a bloodthirsty animal. Instead, we have no blood and a beast that wants to conquer the world or live in peace on Earth ... yes, what people wanted. <br /> <br /> The overall story is good with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast ... but the title actually kills the movie. Night of the Beast would have made fans happier because there really is no blood to speak. <br /> <br /> I like how the 1950s movies had finals that left room for a sequel, but wisely never made one. . This movie is not the worst I've seen, but it's almost up there. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
