Just above the box that I'm typing now, I was required to pick a number between 1 and 10, and rate this movie. Unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero, and I have to put something. If I had my choice I would simply not put anything, no number, because there are no digits that express the futility of this film. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all those horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or pointed objects in the area, this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released to the public, it should be kept 24 hours a day, seven days a week, somewhere in Fort Knox. I'm angry that this movie was available for me to watch. I feel deceived by humanity, I had no idea that humans could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam, and Hitler got nothing out of this asshole Cowell. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the film's cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legitimate scarecrow in front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case is even in the stinky movie! 3) The slogan says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no damn victims that no one died. We do not know if the dam's cop died, and I'm guessing the killer did not die because it sounded like he was being hit in the head with a ball-bat. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, I lost about 4 hours of my life. That's right, four, it took me an hour to watch it (I quickly stepped through the 4-minute zoom scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), I looked at the television for about an hour after finishing, contemplating my life and The direction was following after that crap, and then I started crying for the next two hours because I know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there's nothing I can do to stop it.
