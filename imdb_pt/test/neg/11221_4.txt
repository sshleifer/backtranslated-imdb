I share the same opinion about Underworld as the previous review. <br /> <br /> I sat during the 1.5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was about, and more importantly, why the author and / or director had made certain decisions. to the plot. Overall I found the film unbalanced, consisting of strange sub-frames that (IMHO) really had nothing to do with the movie. Also, when writing a thriller, I'd say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about how the story is filmed ...
