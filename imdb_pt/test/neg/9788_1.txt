Being a former observer of MST3k, even I found this film unacceptable. Terrible attempts at humor-heck the terrible attempts to act. No one needs to read a speech about this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. Just click on their other comments and wow - they are all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me some change and I can make a movie better than that. One of the most incompetent pieces of footage I've ever seen and that's saying something. Watch at your own risk. <br /> Rating: 0/10
