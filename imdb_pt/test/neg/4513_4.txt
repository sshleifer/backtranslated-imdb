As a devotee of Mrs. Frank, I remember being so excited that the play was being redone for TV. That is, until I saw him ... This movie is a great example of how casting is important, and how leadership plays such an important role in creating a sense of purpose. The casting of any CENTRAL role is CRUCIAL for such a production ... shows like AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the lead actor. And in the cast of this film, the whole thing is destroyed by the atrocious actress Melissa Gilbert in the lead role. There is not a single moment when Mrs. Gilbert comes close to inhabiting the sensitive and mature spirit of Anne-Ms. Gilbert is "white bread" throughout the film ... the only time I was close to tears was while reading the most amazing line from Anne: "I still believe, after all, that people are really good at heart "- this is said by Miss. Gilbert so hasty, so devoid of conviction, that she may have burped and achieved the same effect. The film and dance legend Marge Champion was the dialogue coach for this production - she should have returned her salary! Although Gilbert ruined DIARY, other performances are satisfactory for most of the special times for Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell has no deep-seated soul and spirit as Otto, as well as the creator of the stage and film role (Joseph Schildkraut), but he is well. Doris Roberts and James Coco as The Van Danns are relatively shallow in their parts - they are strident and bombastic, but again, only on the surface. This could be due to the fact that the pace of the project is very rushed (as noted in previous posts) - this film is presented in 45 minutes less than the movie version - the difference due to the pauses for dramatic effect, which seemingly is required to propagate the appropriate MOOD to the story. This is not a must-see, especially for young people who have learned about Anne Frank for the first time - the original version of the film, and more so, the TV production of ANNE FRANK: THE TRUE HISTORY starring Ben Kingsley, who is CLEAREST thing capturing the disgust and reality of Anne's situation already filmed! Note: Especially shocking is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister, Margot, is NOT included in the opening credits along with all other members of The Secret Annex ... she is listed in the post- the actors who play Miep and Mr. Kraler. If I were Mrs. Marshall, I would have SUED!
