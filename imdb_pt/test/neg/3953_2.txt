In Stay Alive, the piece of technology that causes all sorts of problems is an online game: those who play it end up dead right away. How clever! <br /> <br /> Directed by William Brent Bell (Who?), and featuring an inexpressive cast of twenty-something people you may have seen before but probably can not remember where or what the hell their names are , this is an extremely derivative piece of footage directed directly to the PG-13 horror set; scary movie watchers will undoubtedly find the Stay Alive extremely tedious, highly predictable and not at all scary. <br /> <br /> The ill-developed plot follows a group of players with extremely foolish names (October, Loomis, Phineus). , Hutch and Swink!?!)

Eventually they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory who is killing whoever dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue the game to the end. <br /> <br /> With such a stupid story as this, viewers should expect a movie with loose ends aplenty, not an iota of logic (which made the game, how and why it is never explained), very little in terms of scares or gore, and a mute closing scene to leave the door open for God to forbid a sequel.
