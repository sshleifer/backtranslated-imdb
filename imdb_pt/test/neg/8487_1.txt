Well, I had the chance to see this movie the other day. I did not know what to expect as I've never seen the trailer and such ... but what I discovered by simply watching the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I wish I could give this movie a 0. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as I started the party scene, I wanted to get into a coma and it was very poorly done. The actors had no direction, there was a real story, I read some comments that say it's good if you have a child to entertain for 90 minutes, etc ... but really why should we expose children to this type of movie? ? He has poor humor, rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of his time. I'm sure some people in Hollywood will be on the streets after this movie bombs. <br /> <br /> Plus, as 39 people give this movie a 10. I mean, get somebody who really gives that movie a 10 or has some mental problem and or works for the movie company. This movie should have an average of 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10, due to the people who rated it 10. Truly sad.
