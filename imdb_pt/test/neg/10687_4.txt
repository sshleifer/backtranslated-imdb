If, like me, you actively seek out the rarest and strangest (and often the most horrible) world cinema has to offer, then you should look no further than Hong Kong's supernatural horror production in the early years 80. Often mixing bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy, and often filled with crawling crawls (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.), these movies are as bizarre as it sounds. Succubare is definitely a case in point: presenting a mountainous tribe whose wives prevent their men from getting away by casting unpleasant spells on them (which, in case they go out, make them fill with creatures contorted and die an agonizing death), some like that, martial arts and a lot of killing real life animals (much of what is perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no influence on the story), this film is simply strange. An extended scene in which tribal women hunt snakes and insects, casually throwing creatures in the baskets on their backs, is quite fascinating; a tribal banquet that sees a poor ox strike its head and then be shattered is utterly disgusting; and the moments that show worms crawling in open wounds and being vomited on the floor will have the touchy man loosing his appetite for a while. <br /> <br /> However, it is the chewing of live animals that truly qualifies the succubare for the legendary status among movie buffs. It's totally despicable to watch and yet be strangely attractive: the geek chews on a snake, plunges into a fat and juicy frog (nasty!) And devours a hungry rat (biting his head and then pushing the rest afterwards). /> <br /> It's not a great movie (hell, it's not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is only recommended for people who think they've seen it all. This gets 4 out of 10 from me, which is probably more than it deserves, but I reluctantly respect it for being able to make me feel a little sick.
