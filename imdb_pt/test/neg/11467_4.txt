I just went to see this movie with a friend. I quickly looked and read a little synopsis and found it looked interesting. We leave the movies without being too sure if we do not like them. <br /> <br /> The acting was good enough and the connection to the characters was good. The main character I thought acted a lot like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> But the plot I felt was used in other films. The script was a little weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character says "Oh my god" all the time. <br /> <br /> The special effects worked well but (sorry for that). The main monster in the main climax reminded me a lot of Balrok of Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was OK, but I felt it was already done. Go and see buy all means, but do not expect too much.
