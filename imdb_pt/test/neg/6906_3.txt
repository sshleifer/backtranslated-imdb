I took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and I would not recommend it to children their age. <br /> <br /> This movie had many fight scenes, which I found too violent and my kids found it scary. <br /> <br /> The subject was far above my children's head and the death scene was too scary for a child-oriented drawing. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we were all eager to see this, but it just did not cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Besides, the most serious thing drove me crazy all through the movie.
