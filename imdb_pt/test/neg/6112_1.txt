A good friend of mine said, "A monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere." There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It's simply the worst movie I've ever seen. It's worse than PLAN 9, worse than YUCCA'S BESTA DOS APARTAMENTOS. This is terrible. The talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes and believe me that's all there is. Make sure you have a lot of people around to relive you after getting into TOXIC SHOCK of GOING BANANAS, the worst movie of all time.
