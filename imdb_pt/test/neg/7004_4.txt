I met Yvette McClendon in a movie at the Los Angeles Film Festival and I thought she was a doll. After writing my review of your movie there, I wanted to see more of it! I found this movie, it was really bad. It's not her fault, she's just in the first minutes, where she's obviously being the person to pull you to watch this bad movie. Bad direction. Scenes are repeated, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has a very bad breast, but the other actresses looked very good. I really like Yvette, but this was obviously a bad choice of her. I can not believe I rented this garbage to look for it. I hope to find your other films.
