Parrots PARROTS? I've been around this ancient land more than most and have seen almost all the westerns that they produced. The history of the Old West is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most poorly produced, directed and acted stories I have ever seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but then it was obvious that you were operating on a tight budget, which played a distinct role in this insult to intelligence. I'm glad I did this show. It was bad enough to have to sit and watch the movie, in addition to putting up with the empty commercials. Once again, there was no actor who came close to being convincing. I kept hoping this would improve as the three days progressed. WRONG! I am ashamed to say that I wasted four and a half hours of the precious time I have left.
