As you can remember, I look like the three of the garbage trilogy and the first movie is the only one remotely close to being watchable. The second part was of low quality sewage and this plot is a bit better than two, but it's still a steaming pile of something I took out of my backyard last Monday. The premise does not make sense, because the lackeys murdered that poor lady and until 1921 I think someone would notice a lot of oily faces where a sweet old lady once lived. Second, this scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first film. It's just old clothes and a burlap bag. Let's face it, the show is rubbish and must be forgotten. A NOOSE!
