I hated the first film is really annoying and we only see the Octopus in the end. <br /> <br /> The plot The corpses are being found in the port of New York. Police have no clues or suspicions until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses to believe Nick's story, and soon the harbor will be packed with boats for the July 4 celebrations ... <br /> <br /> In this movie, we can see more about the Giant. Octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for your time. <br /> <br /> The acting is this movie is not bad, but also not great, but okay and can be watched. <br /> <br /> There are some really cheesy scenes for the movie, but if you get through it, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
