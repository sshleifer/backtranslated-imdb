Lovely music. Beautiful photography, some scenes are breathtaking and affect. But the dramatic tension is lost in such a poorly edited film that it is difficult to know exactly what is happening. Sometimes dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. He should be a factory worker who gets into trouble and works on a farm. We see dozens of sweaty, dirty farmers in the hot sun. Then we see Gere, looking as if he had turned away from an advertisement by Calvin Klein. Sam Shepard, another glamor guy, should be in terminal condition. But he looks great. Nice try, but it just does not work. Brook Adams struggles, but she gets lost on the stage. The real star is the girl.
