From time to time I'll remember that I actually saw this bizarre fiasco which is a cross between "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", Lana Turner LSD movie "The Big Cube" and the Manson Murders also occurred in 1969, but perhaps before this so-called "movie" was made! There are some descriptions of the plot already here, so I will not go into it. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins makes a parody of herself: a talkative actress, egocentric and faded. Maybe she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of Bette Davis's horrors. The old Hopkins girl has never stopped working, so you have to give it to her. It shows a little too much meat in this movie, something that Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there's a scene with Miriam on the sloppy Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade, which must have been filmed in 1968. Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just shocking how shabby it is and horrible. John Garfield, Jr. looks a bit like his father, but not as interesting. I think one of the Three Stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. If he's not one of the Stooges, he's somebody. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape that was given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like that. It's incredible !!!
