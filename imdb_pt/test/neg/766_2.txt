Tom and Jerry are transporting goods by plane to Africa. But being white men, they are worried that they will not be safe, so they put a blackface to fit. Once they are using it, they adopt a black dialect and completely inhabit their new characters. They collide in the ocean and use the wing of the plane like a raft. Before reaching the land, they suffer the advances of an overly affectionate octopus and a more serious danger of sharks, swordfish and whale. Once ashore, they become frightened by fantastic creatures and plunge into a cave. Inside is even worse when they find living skeletons in blackface. And when they leave the cave, things are even worse than when they are discovered by cannibals. <br /> <br /> "Plane Dumb" is a particularly sloppy endeavor of Van Beuren Studios. An example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before them. But the animators must have forgotten, because the lion never shows up again. Another example is the end that is not an end: it is just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to a YouTube poster, the cartoon "originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular black comedy team known as Miller & Lyles, but Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed, and co-directors John Foster and George Rufle were forced to rework the animation in a 'Tom & Jerry' story. "/> They should not have bothered. Rude animation and sloppy jokes make the movie a loser from start to finish.
