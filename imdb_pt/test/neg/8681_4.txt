On the plus side, this contains interesting information on a wide range of topics, particularly concerned with Himmler, the SS, and its research branch. It also has good piano music, some interesting scenes and great camera work. <br /> <br /> However, it is a very poor work of historical work. It has no clear purpose and the whole thing can be summarized as follows. Himmler set up a department in the SS to investigate the origins of the German race. They went all over the world. They did some things and launched expeditions to all sorts of places ... (these approaches were not explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to establish that the Aryan race and the German people were one and the same by historical evidence. They found none. The members of this research group were renowned professors, members of the SS and therefore connected to the holocaust, and were seen as OK after the war and became the leader of German institutes. <br /> <br /> These facts in themselves are fascinating, but they are never explored in depth and no coherent argument is presented in the program that condemns these people or exonerates them. Nor does that seem to be the goal of the program, the purpose of the program is not clear, it goes from one topic to another. Witnesses, while presented as credible, are few and without support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program does not know where it is going or why and not impress. The topics are fascinating, but this program tries to take up a huge area of ​​research and consequently does not seem to know what is going on. I would avoid this. Also the "Holy Grail" is the German lineage, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology, except in passing. Mentions of expeditions to seek the Holy Grail are made, but never fulfilled. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary is unconvincing and incomplete.
