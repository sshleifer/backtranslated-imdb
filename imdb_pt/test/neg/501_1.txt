I only recently saw Heaven's Gate. After I watched this 3 h 40 min western epic that is not a western, I read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all the events and the movie itself, I still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch, they are actually trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can appreciate this indulgent self on the really bad movie thought, I have to ask why. Although this is not a reason to hate him, it is historically far. He pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. Simply, the typhoons of cattle at the time wanted to kill all the cattle thieves and claimed they were all immigrants. You think you just do not care about these people and expect them all to be dead, because at least something would happen. Everyone in the movie talks about things that happen, and this is never shown. After sitting down with this gigantic waste of time, you wonder how anyone could actually do a 4 hour epic when nothing happens. Oh, and by the way, the Johnson County war was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County war was actually named so because it almost happened, in fact, two people died. I can not tell you enough about this movie. However, if you're like me, the idea of ​​watching a movie that ruined the careers and putting United Artists on the market "on sale" seems like an interesting case study, so watch this terrible narsisist movie without sub-text, and lots of photography (which is lovely at times)
