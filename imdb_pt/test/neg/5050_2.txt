It's a shame when high quality actors and actresses get involved with sheer crap, probably because they've been offered a lot of money. It's not one of Helen Mirren's best career moves. The acting of the "teens" is simply shocking, not helped by a script that is, in part, simply unfit. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above the average box office scrap, but this is really below par. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you watch on TV when there is nothing better and you drank half a bottle of wine and are waiting for the Pizza to be delivered so you can drink another half.
