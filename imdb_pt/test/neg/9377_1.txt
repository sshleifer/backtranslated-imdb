This is the only movie I can think of where after it ended, I was boiling with rage at the waste of money and time on the part of me and everyone involved in doing it. No wonder Alan Moore declined to have anything to do with V for Vendetta (a phenomenal movie) after this disaster. <br /> <br /> Not bad in a fun way, like Showgirls. It's bad in a way that makes you want to tear your eyes out. Plot holes the size of planets. The worst script in memory. Horrible acting by decent actors. Visuals that should be great, but somehow fail. <br /> <br /> It could have been so good ...
