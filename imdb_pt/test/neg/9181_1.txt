By far the most racist and ghetto design for children ages 7 and up. Children who watch this drawing will probably try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. I am disappointed Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. for agreeing to broadcast this terrible program. Wayan's brothers can be good at movies aimed at young adult viewers. They should stick with the movies and not make more episodes for this cartoon. Young celebrities usually start working on movies and make cartoon stories and, as they get older, move on to programs for young adults. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first started appearing in All-That, later he starred in MIB II, then Drumline, and now his TV show, Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out, where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally written for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how children who children watched on TV not too long ago can become those who engage with programs that are not geared towards children. It's very sad that this happens, but all celebrities change and grow. It's just the opposite of Wayan's Brothers' new cartoon. It is bad enough enough to deal with all the bad people in the ghettos, letting the younger generation attend this program, it will only convert children with possibilities for those who do not have a chance at a good life. Just my feelings about this cartoon and my beliefs about what will happen to our children if they watch.
