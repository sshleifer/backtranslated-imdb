The first thing I noticed is the music. It's nothing as incredible as the astounding theme of Ruggero Deodato, the Cannibal Holocaust, or the waltzing masterpiece of A Tale of Two Sisters, but I do not let that stop me so early in the movie. It should be assumed that Woman researching her hypothesis for her doctoral thesis that cannibalism as an organized practice never existed, one might think they should take into consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly, right? Or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis is true before it's even tested? This is incredibly ignorant and makes the film seem much more unrealistic and poorly scripted. <br /> <br /> This really is similar to Ruggero Deodato's film, simply totally ill-prepared. No guns, no decent hiking clothes, just plain nonsense. <br /> <br /> People do not travel like this to college without months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... <br /> <br /> Things do not work very well for our brave and stupid adventurers, for they forget to lose an iguana, and their ferret falls almost out is a failure, then fall into a mud hole, well, I think it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Ok, so they flip a coin to see if they continue or forget the whole thing. How does this scene make any sense? All your conviction lies in turning a coin? After that they must have spent time and money, and preparation just coming out of there. This is only getting worse. Definitely some of the worst interpretations, scripts and songs ever invented for the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike talks about how he and his friends were captured by cannibals and put in cages in mud pits with leeches 3 inches long. sucking their blood. I found this interesting because if you remember the first cannibal you encounter in the jungle, a man they confuse with a simple native, is sitting on the ground eating leeches ... imagine if they are the same? Really, although this movie is simply terrible, because the script is horrible and the acting is without emotion, considering the content. They simply agree to give up instead of being eaten by cannibals as if it were not a big decision. <br /> <br /> Obviously Mike is insane, but just as in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior, it is simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Ruggero Deodato's film easily feels that Americans have what they deserve, while in this film one can hardly blame the natives for what happens to Americans once again. <br /> <br /> And because of that the film seems a bit pointless. We already understood the first movie, so why the sequel was made? Is the lieutenant's name Rizzo ?! Could it get worse? Often with movies like these, when you look at the cast, you find that they have not appeared in many other films and their biographies are practically nonexistent, so you can imagine that I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this film that was in the Gangs of Scorsese, in New York. Now Lieutenant Rizzo looked familiar and I thought he was in the 2002 Spider-Man movie as a very small role as captain of tugboats. Reminds me of how William Shatner went from being the Admiral of the USS Enterprise to a police officer in a car. Irony, sometimes irony works. Shatner never managed to get the song right until his recent album "Has Been" was pretty good, just as Bono of U2 never managed to cut his hair right, and Dan Marino never managed to win Superbowls. <br /> <br /> Irony is simply sad, as Christopher Reeve, Superman can not walk the irony. The man will always be a legend, though, because he was such a nice guy, I digress one more time. <br /> <br /> At this point, you can say that I'm quite bored of even discussing the Cannibal Ferox. <BR> The message of the Cannibal Holocaust was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil? What do savages do in natural life, unknown to our moral records, or what do we do to others with malicious intent? The message of Canibal Ferox seems to be "Be careful what you are looking for, for you can find it". I'll tell you this by Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria comes back and writes her dissertation, stating that cannibalism does NOT exist, it saves other people who would be curious and go where angels fear to walk, but overall this movie was really bad. <br /> <br /> 10
