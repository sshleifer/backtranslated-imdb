"Shuttle" is / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting beginning, but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way I could imagine. This movie has lost its history, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All of the next scenes are totally out of proportion. The driver is a type of superman, because he survives every attack with a firearm, etc. even after stabbing his leg, he was able to put it in the box. But what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage. I really felt bad and cheated when the movie ended. It could have been so good if the story was so much better. In my opinion, even a child would make a better story. And why transport the girl with water and food. I stopped the counting of the plot holes halfway. And when the film reached its almost admirably over-the-top finale finale, I had given up completely (better to say "throw-up"). The worst thing about Shuttle is really that it can not be even worse than worse. Writer / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and will provide us with a decent thriller next time, thinking better he will move to a different genre, I keep my fingers crossed, but from now on I will read the commentary on his future films. first before looking, a waste of time.
