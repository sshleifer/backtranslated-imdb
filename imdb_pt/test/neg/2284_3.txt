It only took a vision of this dog, for me to say "never again!" It was so deeply memorable that I had to read other people's reactions before I could remember anything else (1) it was horrible, (2) Connery should have given up while in the front, and (3) the movie included a gross total . Rather it involves pretending to scan the retina through the most horrible (not to mention horribly inefficient) means possible. <br /> <br /> In fact, I never understood why someone would prefer even the best of Connery Bond's worst movies Moore or Dalton. Or Lazenby, Brosnan or even David Niven. I've personally discovered that Octopussy and Moonraker, among other "canonical" Bond films, are far more fun than that, and probably for the same reasons why others downplay Moore Bond films, that is, their ironic humor and surrender to the public. absurdity of all Bond's basic environment.
