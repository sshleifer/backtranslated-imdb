According to most people I know I saw this movie and for the comments I read this should be an extremely fun thriller that oh needs to be seen by more people. I did not expect this movie to surprise me, but I certainly did not expect to find this mediocre movie at best, which is. <br /> <br /> I am no stranger to French films being both French and having studied them as a student, so I am aware of the clich√©s and twists that may go unnoticed by the English / American audience. There are some great French films that should have been released internationally, but this is not one of them. To begin with, the plot is both improbable and complicated and too clever to be fun. then you really feel every minute of your race time of 2 hours and 5 minutes and when everything is finally revealed, you are beyond care. The main character itself is devoid of any real charisma or even talent to keep his attention fixed primarily on him and his journey at any time near the end of the crap, so even you considered swallowing the plot twists of the main plot. you've wasted your time! I actually remember hanging up before the credits really started rolling after the film's climactic reunion - that was the point where I was sure I had almost completely wasted my time on the way. <br /> <br /> The movie is not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it seems completely overrated. For example, I read somewhere that he outshines all Bourne Identity films in terms of suspense, or even that he has "wall-to-wall tension." I can safely say that some people are raving about this downright boring film. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generously helpful rating for this movie that I feel, and since I've seen some complete and total stinkers, I'll go, so save the 1s, 2s, and 3s for them.
