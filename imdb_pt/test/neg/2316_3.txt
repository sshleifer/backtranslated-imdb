"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If the IMDb allowed revisions of a word, that would be my own. This movie was originally intended for kids only and seems to be very difficult going to adults or older children to watch the movie. The song, the story, everything is monotonous and faded - as well as the impression in the public domain. Like other comedy movies with roots in traditional children's stories (such as the dreadful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and does not age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children today find this movie enjoyable! So my advice is do not watch this movie. If you MUST watch a movie of Abbott and Costello, almost any of your other films (except A & C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
