Interesting plot, but painfully dull. The script has no ... lack of acting. For me this movie compares to "Made for TV" movies. I was lucky enough to survive the movie without falling asleep on my popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It is quite safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... check out this movie. Very 80-ish. You'll enjoy this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, drink, super glue and tar. Or maybe you're just like me ... and have a higher standard for acting in movies. However, I liked the way the movie started and ended! Brand.
