This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was fully prepared to have fun. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But I was wrong. First, the strange loop? It was like watching "America's Funniest Home Videos". The fucking parents. I hated them so much. The typical stereo-Latin family? I need to talk to the person responsible for this. We need to have a conversation. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated it and had to mention it. Now the final scene transcends, I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of evil that it's a movie of its own. What a fucking dance. Horrible and beautiful in one go.
