I've seen this movie, but not in a single session. What happens is that he's playing on TV, I watch for a few minutes, I find that I've gotten everything I could and left the room. During those few minutes I do not laugh once, I do not take pleasure in seeing what I see, and I feel more depressed than angry. Curiously, I am told that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one can not get angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests this theory. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I spent nearly ten years in Chicago while I'm watching the scenes, I'm thinking of my own experiences in that rotten city and thus I'm clearly bringing a lot of my luggage to the piece. It is entirely possible, I am willing to admit, that if you are not a Chicago citizen, you will find the play amusing. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> And yet. John Hughes set up his films in Chicago and these movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a front-line writer. I think it's obvious he knew how to balance his situations comically, as well as make his characters sympathetic and believable. In a comedy (distinct from a farce), this balance is vital. And this is not easy to achieve. If it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to worry as we do in the real world wondering when a genie will someday appear. In "Adventures in Babysitting", this does not happen. I hated these characters. <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, all the scenes in this movie are complicated. There is no humor, no humanity, no person to be recognized. Only the actors reading their lines as if all they could do to stop themselves from screaming, certain that finally the hilarity will follow, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while, usually the moment I get up and leave, I start feeling sorry for all involved, which is a kind of emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. It does not act, it certainly does not act comically, and it is entirely possible that it can not. But lord how she tries. She seems to be over 17 years old, and acts younger, like a seven-year-old who struggles at a school game, sure that's how she gets a prize. And she is not alone. It's as if everyone can not relax and let the tale flow. As if everyone just had no idea what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Now this was an initial effort for Chris Columbus and he would clearly improve and have better writers (eg, John Hughes himself) certainly helped, so maybe some pardon is in order. But the movie just smells of despair. However, as I said, it might work for some. If any of the above appeals to you, and clearly made some of the reviewers, then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this mess as if you were a dark alley in Chicago, where, as you hurry up, you can only see shadows and hear murmured threats.
