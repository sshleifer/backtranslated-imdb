Last night I got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out kold', which I had bought once with many other cheap videostore videos. It looked like a good old-fashioned action movie, so I took out the fries and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started from the beginning. The main character is a boxer who's the coolest guy I've ever seen. Like the good person, he has to be cool, of course, but he's just a cunt! This totally does not fit with a boxer who has 28 KO's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra cash. Even cool guys can still be cool. Well, then came his first fight while he worked for this pimp. All the blows were clearly lost and this became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the punches. So there's this totally unhelpful performance from the entire cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave it a 1 because I've never seen such a bad movie.
