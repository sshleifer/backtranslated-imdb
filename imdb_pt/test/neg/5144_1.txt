It could be the worst movie ever made. At least the 9 From Outer Space plan was funny. I can not believe they convinced anyone to actually invest money to do this thing. Complete waste of celluloid. Before I saw this crap, I had some respect for Kristophersson. I think someone needed an amortization tax. Please, on behalf of anything that does not suck, stop who did it, before they suck again! This movie should be avoided by all people who are not on LSD, or my cranky cousin who insists on being a Native American part. If you are in the woods, and an owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. There is no need to make a movie about it.
