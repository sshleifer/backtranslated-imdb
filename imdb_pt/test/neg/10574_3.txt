And so began with "Shreik" a horror movie, then we had the Scary Movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however .... now we have: Spooky Movie * Spooky Movie 2 Spooky Movie 3 Spooky Movie 4 * Movie Encounter Meet the Spartans Not Another Time * Movie and many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *) <br /> < and ..... Superhero movie ... it seems that people who make these movies still can not understand what makes the sending process funny. using the cheats of other movies in a funny way is good if done correctly, but not many producers seem to know how to do this. Horror movie (1) did it well, the following sequences were then horrible as the tried to play the most franchise, but was rescued by the movie Scary 4. No other teen movie was good because he used the parodies well ... and his credit I'm tired of teen movies. however, this movie is a bad version of it all. depends on a slap on the cane that would make the three goofies cringe, violating Stephen's hawking image, and then when people start getting bored (and the producers knew when that would be) we're treated to Pamela Anderson in a tight suit. to conclude, the parodies should be about how to pay homage to an original movie with an original plot without resorting to movies from legitimate movies to the plot of a real movie. <br /> <br /> I shudder to think of "SCI-FI MOVIE" and put my seppuku knife ready
