Now it's 2008 that really takes a care in the world with a guy like DB Sweeney even back then it was not a big deal. <br /> <br /> Two tickets to Paradise is a story outlined which is fine and true where three friends took to the road in each of their personal circumstances. Again, a proven plot. The problem with this film, besides the title 'so bad is convincing', is the script. Cliché after clichés, three guys do the same things you saw in all the other movies on the road ... and blow up the vanna white house. <br /> <br /> The acting work of John C. McGinley is superb, especially if compared to that of the late DB Sweeney. (His career is dead, hence the delay, although I know he's shifting to TV, good for him). Also, John C probably has the least horrible character in the movie. <br /> <br /> The result is so general that it looks like you're watching a 1993 third-rate movie, or Jeff Anderson's Now You Know movie (it's also delayed me a few years, but at least that was more fun.) I mean, yes, I think I enjoyed parts of it. But the nerdy guy is boring, DB tries to be that failed guitarist (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has a weird relationship with a stripper, and John C is a player who is a wife and boy, after his father's death, as well as a visit from one of the bookmaker's henchmen. <br /> <br /> I keep thinking ways to make this movie better. But I think burning the script would have been a healthy start. <br /> <br /> But, as I've hinted at all the time, it's not the worst movie ever. And any chance I have of seeing McGinley in a leading role, I accept. I hope he starts to get some better projects.
