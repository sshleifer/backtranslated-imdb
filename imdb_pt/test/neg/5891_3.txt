I honestly expected more from this movie. That may have been the problem. There was not a single time the camera was still there. In the closes, the camera shakes, the objects move and I get a headache. The cuts are so frequent and so fast that the viewer often finds himself imagining what happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after having gone through so many useless thoughts to understand what's going on, they end up losing. To me, this was a basically terrible movie, destroyed by a videographer with ADHD and missing a significant significant plot.
