This is by far the most repulsive and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel to be invented. As a fan of Pimpinela, I was sincerely offended by what they did to the characters - but this atrocity is not worth watching, even if you are unfamiliar with the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blakeney, for example, never put people on their backs just to walk down the hall. Chauvelin would never have a row of women in his bed. Marguerite never had an affair with Chauvelin, or Armand with Minette, whoever she is. Chauvelin would not randomly shoot Tony in the head. Chauvelin's name is not and never has been, Paul. They completely eradicated any reference to Pimpinela disguises, replacing them with James Bond-style devices and weapons. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself ... The makeup is horrifying. Women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty mark wanders around her face at random. The poor and despicable actors have no script to work with, so it's not their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And whoever is responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as penance. (I counted 13 site legends in the first half hour before giving up. As if we could not understand that the volume of water between England and France is the English Channel.) <br /> <br /> The movie - Se I can say that since it's just a videotape with a filter - it's absolutely worthless redeeming. Do not waste your time and your brain cells with this bullshit - instead go watch the 1982 version of Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour, or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or ANYTHING except this one.
