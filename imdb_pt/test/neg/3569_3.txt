Why spend a moment crawling through this awkward, self-conscious movie? Once in a while, after an hour of tedious plot and amateur acting, we began to get bits and pieces of the big band swing that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, separately and together, the great musicians they were. Occasionally - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra doing "Marie" and, a highlight, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra confronting Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes" - we have a complete song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the DVD transfer is as bad as acting. My copy has only four stops in the chapter. That means you can have arthritis on your finger fast trying to move to where the good things are. The swamp in which you are moving is the Hollywood version of the life and battles of the two Dorseys. Tommy, superb on the trombone, and Jimmy, superb on the saxophone, usually did not support each other. In 1935 they finally broke up, with Tommy starting his own orchestra. Each had more success alone than they did together. They reconciled when their father died in the 1940s, which is where the film ends. Later, they managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by Tommy, since the age of the big bands had disappeared in years 50. Tommy died in 1956 to the 51 years, vomiting in the sleep after drink, tablets and a great meal. Jimmy died of cancer at age 53 in 1957. Jimmy was extremely talented and, in any case, a fairly calm face. Tommy was extremely talented and, in all ways, often an overbearing idiot. But good music compensates for many flaws, and the Big Band seems like the two maids helped define the swing era. <br /> <br /> They play themselves in the movie, and we see them evolving from buzz (with child actors) to grown men struggling and yelling at each other. The film is filled with not only her parents, played by those Hollywood cliches, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, who just want their kids to relate, but also a great story involving a Janet Blair romance. , as a childhood friend of the Dorseys, who becomes a vocalist with them and serves as a mediator and almost full-time facilitator, and William Lundigan, as a pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why she never became the star she probably should have become, just look at the movies, like this one, that her studio put into it. No wonder she left Hollywood. Lundigan simply takes up space. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie, and when can we actually hear the Dorseys play? Well, here's a song written especially for the movie and given to Blair to make a warble. It's called "for me." <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of a rosary ... the rise of a rising sea ... the brightness of a star ... <br /> <br /> pink of a rosary? The movie does not look better than that and it can not get any worse. Still, if you like Dorseys and if the price is right ... well, in hindsight I still would not buy it. The highlight, for me, is Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes". You can watch them on You Tube for free. You'll also find a bit of each of the Dorseys. I would like to know.
