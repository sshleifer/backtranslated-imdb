STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Evening * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a couple in Budapest, on business appointments and staying in a luxury hotel. One night, they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and invite her back to where they end up in a trio. All is well, until David gets some negatives in the mail and he and Tish end up being blackmailed. But when some people involved in the deception are found murdered, things get confusing and they are forced into the dark world of pornography and hardcore slavery to track down the woman who may be the key to everything. <br /> <br /> Considering that the original film dealt with the concept of snuff movies, this direct to the DVD sequel deals with the healthiest (!!!) theme of trios and despicable sex. It plays like a porn movie, a cheap piece of excitement with a lot of hot T / A action going on. If this sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be more at home in a porn store than a rental company. <br /> <br /> This tries to copy the original. the sombre and voyeuristic feel of the film, but while he does a great job, he still can not handle the original. It has an apathetic history, with a dishonest narrative flow. And compared to Cage, Schaech seems endlessly wood. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought it would be, I suppose, and better than average for those direct DVD sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days, but really, have not we seen enough? **
