Man, I start, everything about this cartoon, from the episodes, to the stories, to the script, an animation is for me the stupidest, coolest and most annoying cartoon that Walt Disney Television animation ever created and did, I'm so happy that both Toon Disney (2006) and Disney Channel to stop broadcasting it in the United States as of May 2008. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it is a wise choice to ignore this and cast black cloud of a cartoon, if you watched it don say I did not warn one to warn you. <br /> <br /> Its in for a boring and confusing time right and messy, I wish and I pray I've never seen an episode of this Star Buzz Lightyear Cartoon. If I could, I would have the Part of my brain removed that it remembers to have watched, yes, it is and it was bad.
