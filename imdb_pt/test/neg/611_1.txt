I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, I try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explain a true story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have helped many, though, due to direction and editing, it did not. <br /> <br /> History, in this case, is not fully addressed unless you read psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, sadly much has been edited ... Louise Fletcher plays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogues. In that case, I credit the actors for surviving this project. <br /> <br /> Why is the audience not allowed to see causality? ... The American public is quite experienced, and if they have cable, generally I honestly feel I could have written a better story, would not have edited the truth and allowed the actors to project reality. Richard Carpenter, as a director, seriously underestimated and insulted the American public. Karen's story is important, and it's sad that we've never heard it.
