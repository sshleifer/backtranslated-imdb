The book gains 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> PROBABLE CONTAINS BOOKS AND MOVIE SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> If you've never read Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male, the source material for Man Hunt, you'll probably enjoy the treatment of the story by Fritz Lang. On the other hand, if you're in my camp and you've pretty much memorized the book, the film will be a let down. I suppose you have already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints. Household's little novel is one of the greatest all-time thriller classics, tense and surplus, with just a handful of characters to drive action. Fritz Lang and his screenwriter Dudley Nichols feel the need to play in the protagonist's brother and a friendly floozy, the latter of which reduces the depth of the story, injecting extrinsic motivation into the script where the novel needs none. In fact, the true climax of the book was not the escape of the nameless narrator from his underground lair, but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive to go on his first hunting. And that's another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino can take us to Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why can not Lang? "Thorndyke?" What hat did they take it from? Which brings me to my bitterest complaint: the Household hunter is so quintessentially British, that he would bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can barely sustain the accent, which is only a little deeper and more convincing than Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood. He looked good on paper, and was a good actor for the 1940s, but as reluctant hero of Rogue Male? Let's look at Sceptered Isle itself for a more compelling version. Remake soon with subtlety and with, please! Am I going straight for free ??
