I was pleasantly pleased with the ending. I just saw this movie yesterday and I was going to turn it off, but I changed my mind. It was not at all the direction I thought the story would end. That's all positive I can say about this movie. All the actors are nobodys, especially the leader. While she is a young and attractive woman, she will never succeed. The writing, directing and acting are tree-lined, like what you would see in daytime soaps. The filming locations were very clever at making you think it could be anywhere, rather than brazenly telling you it was in Canada. As this was filmed entirely in Canada, I'm assuming that the whole lot was Canadien, which is not totally bad, since some recent productions of TV Canadien: Cold Squad, Stone Underover are very well done.
