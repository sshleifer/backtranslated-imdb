It's good to see Julie Andrews trying a dramatic direct role here - something she had not done for some time - but her Judith character (wise, they did not try to get past her like a 'Judy') has the old refined. manners and shameless hairstyle of yesteryear, and Andrews stages "adult" as any other actress would play frigid. It's a surprisingly bland drama in Barbados involving Omar Sharif (not the most lively leader of all time - not even in 1974!) Hoping to make Andrews a spy as he slowly led her into the proverbial room. The memorable ride has some pitch value: James Bond-like credits in the beginning are a tacky joke. As for Julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but that does not contribute much to the audience or to the movie. Blake Edwards walks up and down the funeral. * in ****
