A couple moves into the house of their dreams, unaware that he and his neighbors were built on land formerly used as a graveyard. It is said that the film was based on a true story, although how much that must be true is not revealed. The plot is not unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). In a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, the daughter's grave illness - to the ridiculous frankness - continually flushing bathrooms and garage doors out of control. There is little depth in history: once it was established that the land was used as a graveyard, we learned nothing more. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well-designed or memorable, nor is the atmosphere particularly special. The movie can be disturbing for some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message of this.
