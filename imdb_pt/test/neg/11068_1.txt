I am an avid movie watcher and enjoy a wide variety of movies. However, I found no pleasure in this film. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not feel like I had too much of a plot, the characters were not nice and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending just made me no longer like the movie. Definitely not in the same category as "The Cave" which was, in my opinion, the best cave film ever made. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a waste of $ 3.79 of rent and my time to watch it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one.
