Okay, so this movie is well represented. It has a good direction, but the simple fact is that it harms what all gays and lesbians have been fighting for all these years. The straight man "deciding to be gay" and the gay man "Deciding to be straight" I enjoyed until the last 20 minutes, then I was really offended. Like what usually happens in these films, heterosexual actors interpret the main parts and gay actors take on secondary roles. The protagonists are played by handsome men, but do not let that distract you from the fact that this is a movie that makes you unsatisfied. All the romance and relationships you expect to happen do not. Unless you're a priest, in that case God bless the heterosexual woman who heals our homos.
