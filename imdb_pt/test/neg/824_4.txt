If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, then Ali G is immensely better. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a movie at least. Borat is complete rubbish and I do not understand how he ranked better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can not put my finger on it, there is something wrong with the script Ali G: half of the jokes are as if they were written by a 15-year-old, not by an adult screenwriter. And a series of jokes including Mr. Cohen's lower body are pretty insipid. <br /> <br /> But the movie actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes that are also funny: like how Ali G becomes a member of the government for doing something scandalous and stupid in public (unfortunately true). in today's Western society: people have careers to do stupid things in public), also Ali's advice on immigrant and other politics. <br /> <br /> Ali G general remains a sympathetic character despite being a kind of mentally undeveloped for his age. But it's okay to watch, it's very funny. <br /> <br /> But never watch Borat, it's horrible and makes all smart movies sick.
