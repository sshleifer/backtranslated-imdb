No, I'm not joking here guys, and I can not believe how many people here have actually given positive comments! oh, wait, it's the IMDB comment section, silly me. It is interesting to note that, on this date, there were not enough votes to give this film a ten note, but there are dozens of comments on the film. What does that mean I wonder? Anyway, the script is terrible. Character changes his personality and motivation and actions in every scene in order to keep the movie running in something that vaguely resembled a rhythm. it was not even stupid behavior, it was there, too, but the sheer idiocy of the script transcended any stupidity the characters showed. for example: karl is disobeying an order because there are two bodies in the desert and "the killer is here somewhere," so he forces everyone to travel 40kms to find the killer, disobeying orders and driving everyone out. When the hero sees something unpleasant in the darkness and warns Karl, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there is nothing out there so they are going home. In the next scene, he is refusing to let it go and must hunt whatever it is. it's just a joke. yes, the monster is very impressive, but the crap that humans say about it only tries to nullify its interesting aspects, and the moments of predator and alien stealing were very tedious. and the end ... the end!?!?! jesus .... the worst movie I've seen in years, and I saw bug buster!
