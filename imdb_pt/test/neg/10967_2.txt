A look at the rating should tell you that this movie was voted by shills in an attempt to artificially boost the audience of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie brings nothing new to the genre of zombies. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (in acting and cinematography) and derived in its plot. The makeup looks awful and the zombies look even worse when fired. The lines are delivered rigidly and badly timed, with the exception of the bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this movie mess. The worst offenders are Italian (Hans), Ryn, the protagonist, and the leader of the bad guys. I've seen better delivery of the pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /> <br /> This is a self-proclaimed "Western zombie," but the only thing that makes him a "Western zombie" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the real name of the lead actor is Clint. The protagonist is not legal and mysterious as a traditional hero of Eastwood, and as an anti-hero, he also does not have the wise attitude to disdain it. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the false glossy comments. This is just another level B zombie movie that was made with competence for the budget it had (it has decent lighting), but it smells of low budget, driving for the first time and acting bad. There are a lot of really stupid scenes that make it look really amateurish.
