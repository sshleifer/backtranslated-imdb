I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep seeing what you have to improve. So when it's over, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you may never have back. Ice-T did his thug thing and, well, that was the highlight of the night. The photos of the bus seem to have been made with a toy in a box and the walking scenes in space were funny because you could see the ropes stuck in space suits. The script was missing and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and getting unconscious was amazing because he drove better than I could have on one of my better days. All in all, I've seen worse, but this certainty is not one I would recommend or want to remember.
