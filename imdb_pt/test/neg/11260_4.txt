This is a disappointing adaptation of James Lee Burke's novel "In the Electric Mist of the Confederate Dead." It is rather misinterpreted mainly due to the miscasting of the main players. Tommy Lee Jones, usually an excellent actor, simply does not capture "Dave Robicheaux", by Burke. As Robicheaux's main enemy, John Goodman does a sloppy job as the "heavy one." The guy who plays Robicheaux's comrade-comrade does not look like a former "A" leader. The rest of the film is mostly done with local unnamed people who simply do not do justice to a great novel. <br /> <br /> Jones' film and performance are too rushed for one thing. Robicheaux, in Burke's novel series, gives the impression that he fits well in his environment most of the time, being laid back and slow. This is like the deep south and south of Louisiana. So sometimes Robicheaux is almost manic in his efforts. Jones just moves at a fast pace throughout the movie. It does not vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. About the only good thing about it is the scenery. Overall, the film gives the impression of a TV movie.
