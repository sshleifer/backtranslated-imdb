Too bad some good talents were wasted. This is a tedious and overly self-conscious film that could tell its story in half the time. Is that Derek Jacobi under that beard doing two roles? Wow, who would have guessed. <br /> <br /> The emotional reward of the end was weak and unsatisfactory. It certainly is not worth the film's padded length to stand. I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The sound was horrible. First, they used stock music. Second, it was so loud during some dialogues that words were hard to understand. Only three sound crew members and one trainee? There were more people listed in the claims for accounting or the law. <br /> <br /> However, some of the camera work was good, and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Not a good use of preview time, at least for me.
