Good sadness..think I've seen it all .. Danny Thomas seems so out of place in this mess. He looks very uncomfortable. He can not sing deserves a lick, and when he's paired with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???) she easily ... EASILY overcomes him! Maybe the director realized that and made him do the actual comedy routines he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is fine, but the whole thing is a mess. Good for laughing, maybe.
