I really do not understand how this movie could have a rating higher than 4 here on IMDb. It's simply a huge mess, and I have to admit that I really enjoyed AvP 1: Almost no story, okay, I can live with that, but at least they got to the point pretty much at the same time. AvP 2 no. After the stupid premise was introduced, there have been well over half an hour of stupid and unfit teen cliches, silent dialogue like hell and almost nothing except for a few Alien scenes that seem like an excuse to have that first half of the movie. and Predator scenes that make you wonder if those guys who made the film even watched any other Predator movie or just did not care enough to be bothered. <br /> <br /> After that, that crap-fest finally reaches the point where the Predator begins to attack the aliens, or at least pretend to do so. And boy, it's that stupid Predator, blind and deaf. It's awful. How he managed to win these things, he is beyond me. He misses almost every shot, only realizes Aliens when they are right in your face or if it is absolutely necessary for the script, so it can move where it has to be. He is even caught by surprise by teenagers and insignificant deputies all the time. What was this guy supposed to be? After the first hour of that abomination, I was more or less constantly shaking my head in every scene. Close to no scene in this movie passes without unbelievably stupid dialogues, stupid Predator actions or stupid lack there-of or stupid actions from our "heroes." <br /> <br /> So, that thing is finally over. To my surprise, not only me and my friends did not know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I heard leaving the room was half crying, half laughing at those hours and a half they just lost. <br /> <br /> Do not watch. Never.
