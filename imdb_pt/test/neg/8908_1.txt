What a crap this movie is. The script is simply non-existent. The movie sometimes looks like a video clip. But it can not be that, since the soundtrack does not match. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. One might think it's a recipe for a hit movie ... here it fails miserably. Dialogues in this movie just killed me. The scene in which Harlan is questioned by a police officer is simply unfortunate. Overall, recent Seagals movies are hardly seen. What the hell happened to the guy? I know he's old, but does not he get "Hollywood" to give him a decent script or something? Is he running out of money for his getaways to India that he assumes anything they serve?
