The creature itself seems a little dishonest and Cotten is a bit too old to be taken seriously as an An eager scientist is still involved in creating lifestyles from corpses (one would think that he would have become an army of them now and not struggling to perfect his technique yet), but Neri gets well in and out of the costume and trusting Herbert Fux probably looks better as a serious lecherous thief / blackmailer.
