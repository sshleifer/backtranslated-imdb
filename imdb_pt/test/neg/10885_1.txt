The only good thing about this movie is that I now have a movie on the worst list of all time. Rest Stop being at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the terrible movies to. Actually, this movie is the worst, the worst-directed plot, all through the movie all I wanted to do was rip my hair off and kick the writer and anyone who made the movie possible. I am an implanted soldier and when I spend my precious time watching movies like that. These people should feel awful, they had to watch this before they left, and they should have been too lazy to redo after they realized it was crap. I am so amazed that our great country is letting others do it. Honestly, this is the first time I commented on a movie, I had to let the world know, not to waste your time. Delete this movie from the face of this planet. This makes humans look retarded.
