I can not believe I'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is strangely bad. If 20 different directors were hired to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of ​​the plot being filmed by the other directors, this is basically the result I would expect. <br /> <br /> I also think some of the scenes were inserted out of order - things do not always seem to progress in order. The film acts as if we should already know about half of the characters. <br /> And Steve Guttenberg tries to do manic comedy, a-la-Robin Williams in this movie. Ewww And the whole premise of putting an ex-convict in charge of a bunch of kids just does not seem realistic these days.
