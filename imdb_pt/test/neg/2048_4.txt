I simply watched this movie just because of Sarah and I'm also giving these 4 stars just because of her, on the other side This movie was easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The action was horrible. The script was not inspired. This was a film that remained in contradiction. The film was sloppy and unoriginal. It's not like I'm expecting a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. That did not even do that. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think of the general plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we continue to find. Really a shame, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I might be getting a little rough giving the movie a 4/10, but given the actors involved and again SARA's obvious writing talent, this movie really should have delivered so much more. <br /> <br /> This movie is just crap, I can not put it differently. From the beginning it's known to be crap. <br /> <br /> History, dialogue, acting, special effects, makeup, practically everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winning movies, but this is not worth seeing, I can not believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the characters' motivation is ... It does not exist, it all seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I honestly doubt it. I'd like to know what they tried to pull, but it ended up backfiring, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to that) Please, do it a favor and do not watch it. <br /> <br /> It's also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad Script, Bad Direction, Bad Cinematography. Q. 3 I bothered to comment on this as a favor to all.
