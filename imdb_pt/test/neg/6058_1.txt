I do not know how expensive the creation of this movie was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was filmed on stage in front of a movie screen (sure the blue box would not look so artificial). When traveling in a boat, the background screen was moved by imitating the movement of the waves, but the characters were not moving. The CGI effects: terrible (I'm not sure, but I think the effect was created with Paint and made a GIF sequence of them - the next time the creators hired a professional team of CGI creators). It looks like the CGI creator would have drawn on the image strip with shaking hands. Horrible, for sure. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it was created in 1983. A friend of mine told me the correct date: 2005. My jaw dropped, I was so shocked that I thought he was joking. People, I recommend you skip this movie, the story is also distorted, you will not like it.
