"Hoods" do not deliver the goods. This grumpy comedy features a stellar cast including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly and Seymour Cassel, plus several faces familiar to those watching crime movies, but it really is a flawed one if it has always been one. Writer and director Mark Malone, best known for writing "Dead of Winter" for "Bonnie & Clyde" director Arthur Penn, has set up a bricklayer who has a mafia boss Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) dispatching his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna of "House of Games") to hit Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob bombarded one of Pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants a comeback. The problem is that nobody has a clue who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mafia comedy, such a complication can be fun, but here it is simply flat. Angelo and a lot of wiseguys, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence") spend half the time trying to figure out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to make a success, so they track down a mob mobster Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from "Bad Boys") to do the dirty act. Before they can convince Charlie to succeed, they need to locate him, and Charlie's bastard Mary (Jennifer Tilly, from "Bound") reveals that he is locked in a psychiatric hospital. Our misfit heroes leave for the psychiatric hospital and depart Charlie. About half of the film ended before they discovered that Carmine is a short-legged toddler (Vincent Berry), who is soft and harmless. In fact, Carmine has the only decent line in the film. As our group of dismembered heroes walks away from his house with him in the back seat to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they need to get him home on time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to freeze the hedgehog, but he can not. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the psychiatric hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the boy picks up his pistols from the pistol and leaves several rounds aimlessly. Angelo and he fight for the automatic. The pistol slides out of their collective hands and hits the ground, explodes and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Now, keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the boy in the first place, and Angelo and he argued about the injustice of success. Then Rudy lands on the ground with a fatal wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a dull death scene. Angelo is in conflict because his father ordered the coup and Angelo fears his father will if he does not execute orders. There is a flashback subplot on Angelo's father, teaching him how to handle a weapon that provides some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun. <br /> <br /> There's nothing reminiscent of this depressing comedy to an end. Things get worse, and if you go through that nonsense of 90 minutes, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely bland. Good actors immerse themselves in roles that are neither funny. Maybe director Malone was trying to make another comedy like "The gang who did not know how to film right." If he was, he lost by a mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and growls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna, but she does not do much else. She's the stereotypical whore who does not even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this picture is pathetic from beginning to end. Initially, I hoped this could be an imitation of the "Ransom of Red Chief," where the boy drives the wiseguys nuts, but is not so lucky here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a child, but it's not the kind of surprise that makes you want to watch it until your resolution. <br /> <br /> Did I really buy this movie on a Canadian DVD Label? Seville ?? and contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give the plot, do not watch the trailer. If you meet Joe Mantegna, one of his first questions should be why he helped produce this yawn. It is neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines, and none of the characters stands out as interesting or friendly. The Seville DVD features the movie in full screen without subtitles or closed caption.
