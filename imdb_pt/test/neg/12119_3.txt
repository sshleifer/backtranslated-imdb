I loved both the latest film by Bellocchio, the masterpiece "L'Ora di Religione". It had a great script, great actors (well, I have to say that Castellitto is much bigger than the others), a brilliant use of lights for great cinematography. <br /> <br /> Well, Buongiorno Notte is a different story. Ridiculous script erupting tons of morale (and we could talk weeks about politics, you know we're Italian ...). Poor cinematography (it's too simple to represent dark years of the 1970s with dark colors and dark lights, to make some efforts more people !!!!). Bad use of music: what is the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of Brigate Rosse? <br /> <br /> And for all the people who claimed the main prize in Venice, I reply, "Are you crazy?" ??? "Maybe the Russian movie was bad but not so bad. I'm with P.E Do not believe the hype !!!!
