I can not find anything good about this miniseries. Why the hell would you forbid chocolate when you could ban something far more practical, like smoking or drinking alcohol? Also the fact that it is an Australian program and everything is set in England and everyone is pretending British accents is stupid. Overall, I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
