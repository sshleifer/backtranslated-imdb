... when nicknamed in another language. Let's face it: neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And, given the exaggerated lines they should say, this is a loose situation. Any kind of voice-over is certainly an improvement (and it actually is - at least in the German version). <br /> <br /> But that's only a minor point. The acting is bad. Accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen could not use his sword to get out of a wet paper bag. This becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of movement exhibited by the boy (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and athletics demonstrated by Sandahl Bergman. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some visuals are cool, I'll have to admit it. The dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. But most of the time the plaster is too obvious. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is not worth seeing. Even 'Conan the Destroyer' is better than this (albeit only marginally). I would rather see Bergman as Red Sonja as she should be, but I doubt that has saved that movie - ah, well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
