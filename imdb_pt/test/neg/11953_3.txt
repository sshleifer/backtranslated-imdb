This is the best Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I have ever seen! I'm giving a lot of credit to this movie! My best guess at the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show someone else's martial arts skills but realized that you can not simply shoot a guy fighting another guy and make people watch him, so he put a story behind the movie. fighting ... and people have not yet watched. <br /> <br /> The plot of that movie was thin onion skin. This performance was goofy and stereotyped of any Kung Fu movie. The dubbing was literally the worst I've ever heard. It seemed that if you played a small role in this movie, like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net, it did not matter who passed your voice. It could have been a dyslexic with a stutter and no one would have said anything. But beyond all this, the film recovers with the scenes of fight a little impressive. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were definitely what this movie was. But the instigations of the fights were utterly absurd! In most cases, a guy either comes out of the tall grass, or looks at the main character from a distance, and then attacks him. But once the fight started, things were balanced. There were only two things that really hampered the fight. Those constant sound effects that were added to every movement of a fist or foot or sword, and the poor edit that made 25 percent of the fighting VERY hectic and agitated. Someone would be in the middle of a back flip and would suddenly be on the ground being kicked, and then, instantly, would be standing again, blocking a punch. But while the cut-and-paste edition was more of a nuisance than anything else, it did not affect the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> In the end, this was not a great movie, but I did not expect a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like the one in this movie. All I saw in this movie was like spending an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that, but this was just one of those movies for which you have no practical use, so you watch when you have some free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Good morning gentlemen. <br /> <br /> -Scott-
