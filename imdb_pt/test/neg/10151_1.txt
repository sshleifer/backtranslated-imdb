I love cheesy horror movies, I think living dead and in bad taste are great and I think the Pajama Massacre II (not even related to this movie) is hilarious. But this movie absolutely stank, I did not laugh, I did not even like it ... you can see all sorts of mistakes that are neither exaggerated. Is the best scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she bangs her head on the sill? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this thinking that it is related to the series of pajama massacre. It's horrible and I have no idea how the distribution was. Rent it with a false name and burn it, do all others the favor.
