I knew very well when I rented this DVD that could very well be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. But to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen would be put off lightly. I am wondering if there is any legal action that can be taken against the individuals who have allowed this produced film. I mean, the funding had to come from somewhere, someone had to put money into it to be produced !! <br /> <br /> I would identify several production values ​​that led to the failure of this film, but this movie violated all the production standards of the universe. I could not get through the whole movie, as I began to get dizzy with the horrendous filming techniques. I also can not tell you how many scenes I just finished with the zoning because of the inexplicable and horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> I feel like I've been permanently marked for life. If you watched this movie before receiving this warning, you should think about starting a support group with me for poor people who have seen this monstrosity.
