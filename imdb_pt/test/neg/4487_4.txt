I was eager to see two bright young actors appearing in "Dear John", but it was very slow moving; and I felt that both the script and the direction hindered the flexibility of the main performers. I usually like cinematic adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the film did a great job of describing a realistic military action. The cinematography was very good at following through love letters, concentrating just enough on one keyword or phrase on each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum got bogged down in what became a series of very "hanged" expressions in response to the loss.
