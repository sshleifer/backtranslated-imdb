The most annoying thing about "Dies d'agost" (Days of August) is not simply that NOTHING happens in this film, but that the director Marc Recha has the courage to pretend that this film is a kind of homage to the Catalan leftist journalist Ramon Barnils . Unless mentioning the name of Barnils sometimes constitutes a "tribute," this claim is total fraud. You will learn virtually nothing about Barnils in this film, neither on the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) nor on the special role of Catalonia in that war. You also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic Catalan people for years after by the frank victorious and vindictive. <br /> <br /> The filming of the Catalan countryside is very beautiful, of course, but 'Dies d'agost' does not have an extensive and varied collection of such scenes to qualify as a travel diary. images - not brightly lit pictures of the forest floor, for example - is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here. (I recommend the "Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain" by Felix Morrow.) I would recommend the "Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain" by Felix Morrow. , which contains an exhilarating account of the Barcelona Revolt of 1937.) <br /> Barry Freed
