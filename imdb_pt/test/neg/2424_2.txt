This movie, like so many others (Remember the Titans, Miracle), follows the basic formula of the sports film: There's a guy, he's an idiot. Jerk is bad. Jerk must play by someone else's rules. The rules of another person change Jerk, Jerk is good. Insert tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.) Jerk tragedy effects, makes him totally change. Jerk must now play the championship game. Many close-ups on the sweat players and the balls. Jerk wins. Cite the coach or news or something that explains the title. Credits Have not you been touched? These films can now be used to separate the idiots from society. Anyone who pays to see this in theaters should be slapped.
