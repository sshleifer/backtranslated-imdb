I had never heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone mentioned it on a horror forum here recently, and reading about it, I gained interest because of the involvement of Meg Tilly and acknowledging it was an early-to-Friday show THE 13TH VI : JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately, it's sad to say it's nothing special. The premise has a familiarity: a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until the morning to join a fellowship. This girl is a young Meg Tilly, as Julie, who wants to prove to her loving and affectionate boyfriend Steve (David Mason Daniels) that she can make his cruel and conniving ex-girlfriend, Carol's brotherhood (Robin Evans), regardless of the tactics . she pulls to see it fail. Along with Carol's gang is Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily) who does not really want to cause trouble to Julie. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while she remains in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torment the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve looks for her while Julie, Carol and Kitty find an evil they could not imagine ... the corpse of a recently ill psychic "vampire" whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree will try to drain them vital force . The only person who can help these girls is the daughter of the deceased, Olivia (Melissa Newman), who is equipped with the same psychic power he has. <br /> <br /> I think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum, is certainly different from what you normally see in the thieves who were out at the moment. As the character of Adam West (... he was Olivia's cynical husband who thought the idea of ​​his father's ludicrousity ridiculous), I had a hard time adjusting to the tacky plot, and personally I never found anything inside the movie to cheer me up . The mausoleum for me has never been so scary (..it really does not get the same kind of strange quality that PHANTASM has captured) and the corpses that are used to attack the girls are ridiculously unconvincing (..there is a big scene where one the face of the corpse melts). I have a soft spot for low-budget movies from this time period, but I've never really been able to find a reason to get involved when you have this unlucky corpse of undead throwing electric rays out of your eyes causing other bodies to break free of his crypts obey his master. It's too silly to take seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a nice girl who is dating an old flame. Steve is his typical, clean, slim, handsome, all-American boyfriend who becomes the hero who seeks to save his girl from any sinister forces at play. To compensate the small budget director, McLoughlin tries to trick every book into exciting the audience, using a series of ooga-booga effects, like corpses chasing young girls, shaking and shaking chairs, closing doors, and levitating objects. by themselves. The film obviously has its fans, and I'm glad I got a chance to see it, but I was a bit disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was not the terror I expected. Adam West has a very small role as the concerned husband, waiting for his wife to get out of her depressed state towards a father who had nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is the disturbed Olivia, recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all, or else he would continue to attack the living. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Olivia's father, who informs her of what he was. I was not particularly impressed with Tilly's performance here (she was basically scared most of the time), but she would have a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point on. This will no doubt be of some value to those who watched back at that time, for the purposes of nostalgia, it can entice movie fans of this era.
