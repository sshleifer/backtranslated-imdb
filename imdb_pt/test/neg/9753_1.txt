the actors can not act. every dialoague was plagued by accents and loss of character. Channing Tatum never moves your lips or changes your facial expression ... NEVER. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new. some street kid gets involved in a professional world of dance and turns his life around. which along with the whole incident involving the little boy is taken straight from You Got Served and Save the Last Dance (I'm not saying these movies were good either, but that means that this movie did not bring anything new to the table). <br /> <br /> And the dance ... THERE WERE ONLY 3 SEQUENCES OF DANCE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE AND 2 OF THEM WERE REMOVED DIRECTLY TO TRADE. maybe I'm being overly critical because I'm a dancer, but maybe that's what needs to be heard. Channing Tatum is NOT by any means a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique or any wow factor, which are part of the criteria of a street dancer. All the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except the poor technique and some acceptable turns, but nothing more. the grand finale left me thinking "... OK, now they're going to get serious" all the way to the end when I realized that this would never happen. <br /> <br /> I admit that of course it is difficult to make a good dance movie, but Step up is no exception to the rule. You Got Served, except for its inconsistencies with the street dance culture, at least, had the dance aspect. Save the Last Dance was rubbish, and so was almost any musical from the last 10 years (though I was impressed by the Moulin Rouge) ... look at the Center Stage for Ballet, look at Beat Street for Hip-Hop
