Well, now, the thing is - for this movie to work, you will have to accept the following - a woman who is murdered is alive again at the end of the movie, a detective stops interrogating the bride of the dead woman because a newspaper reporter asked her he. not to, and this same reporter, in love with a beautiful blonde dragged into the night court for suspicious behavior, ends up marrying her in return for the judge to let her off the hook. Are you following me in this? I can not say how many times I paused and rewound the image to repeat scenes that just did not make sense. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) remained married, but I have no idea how they came to that decision. In fact, I can not figure out how the filmmaker made the decision to make that movie. Oh, I suppose there is some entertainment value here just for the absurdity of it all, but it would have been nice if even some of the pieces fit. Still, I'm not ready to add this to my list of Top Ten Worst. I think the nightclub scene with the feathered ladies might have saved him. But why did this happen in the movie? I just do not know.
