Maybe I was young when I saw that. Maybe I did not grow up with the Grease and Elvis movies. <br /> <br /> I could not. I get "black" comedy (Black Adder, etc). I have irony and fakes. But I do not understand this. <br /> <br /> I did a search to find out the name of this movie (counting on the help of people on usenet and the most excellent IMDb Message Boards) so that it could be my first pointer 1. Horrible!
