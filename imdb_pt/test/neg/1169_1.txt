I own a vacation lake house not far from Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from the Gein property to be exact. I saw his land, the graveyard where he is buried and where he dug, and I bought it at the hardware store that was owned by the Worden family. When visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The true story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and creepy, because the creators of this piece of junk have decided to invent their own story is beyond me. The actor who plays Ed is a very big man, Ed was a very small man, meek and timid. That's part of what makes his story so scary. He did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows it is mostly sand with a bit of dirt. You will not break much of a sweat by digging a hole. They did not have to hire an actor with the physique of a fighter, just do your research. And if the writing was not bad enough - there are no mountains in Wisconsin, and I'm sure 911 was not available in 1957.
