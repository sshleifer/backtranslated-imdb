Frank Tashlin's "Censored" is a short film by Snafu that aims to teach the importance of the Censor in preventing military secrets from leaking. Snafu tries to tell his girlfriend that he is in the South Pacific, but Censor frustrates every attempt he makes to send the letter. These early scenes are the best, with the invisible Censor ripping the card from the sky with long mechanical arms, nets, and even a specially-employed eagle! The second half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send the letter with the help of Technical Fairy, First Class (who is actually teaching her a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing end of only one dream . The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of Snafu's extremely half-naked girlfriend, who is seen even with bare breasts, though with strategically placed members at all times! Destined for the military, Snafu shorts were often characterized by a lack of greatness, but these scenes, on the right foot, are by far the most erotic I have encountered so far in any of these shorts. Despite all this, I prefer the Snafu shorts that go to the jugular a bit more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. For great examples of this, look for "The Goldbrick" by Tashlin or "Spies" by Chuck Jones. 'Censored' is quite weak in comparison.
