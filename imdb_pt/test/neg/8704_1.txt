I as a Christian am outraged after seeing only the first half of this photo. The movie's site says they researched the film before writing, but I believe they forgot to consult the definitive source THE BIBLE. I sat down with two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was as if they invented what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible to what they thought modern viewers would like to see instead of the truth. Personally, I'm too young to remember the Ten Commandments of the 1950s, but it can not be worse than that. I wrote to the network and can only hope that they apologize publicly for this farce.
