This is an incredibly bad action movie. I'd say your main flaw is that it's annoying. Arghh! Wardrobes, chic retro design and decent cinematography do not prevent this movie from being a snoozer. The second (major) failure of the Mod Squad is the lack of character development - underscored by the lack of talent of the actors. I usually enjoy the work of Claire Danes, so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this movie. Giovanni Ribisi is woefully mischievous: how could his style of cotton mouth acting and bumbling could fit into an ACTION movie? As for Omar Epps, well, he needs some acting lessons to learn to thrill. The man had the same facial expression as the whole movie! My suggestion is to save a few dollars and wait to see this turkey on the cape.
