I doubt anyone who wrote this script actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they did it did not go very well. None of the characters are as they should be: Fanny is lively and aware of her mistreatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into Aunt Norris's personality. In addition, Fanny's first-person narrative is highly unsuitable for both the story and her character. Fanny is not a fun heroine and I would say she is not meant to be. In addition, in the film version, Fanny blatantly flirts with Edmund from the beginning, when they were raised as brothers and sisters! Austen's Fanny would have cringed with flirtation of any kind, and the novel paints Fanny / Edmund's pairing as highly uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike some other Jane Austen novels (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park is not based on the strength of its female protagonist. It is a type of novel very different from the others; it's not meant to be a love story. I watched this movie because I just read Mansfield Park, and I'm absolutely horrified at what I see; Miss Austen is rolling in her grave.
