Cronica de una desayuno combines the worst flaws of Mexican cinema, a rare feat these days. <br /> <br /> It's pretentious: it wants us to believe it's deep, just because some scene is out of focus, another is pseudo-surreal, another still plays with the Eisenstein-Infante-Caifanes tradition of laughing laughing, editing it's fragmented, and it's all so solemn. <br /> <br /> There is a weak script: the main story hardly develops, so it has three other smaller and unnecessary stories, stuck in it. They are only good for making the movie last longer. <br /> <br /> Most performances are bad. A real feat, bearing in mind that many of the best-known Mexican actors have been cast. <br /> <br /> There is an unnecessary language abuse. To such an extent that Paloma's character, which symbolizes a child's dreams of freedom, uses it completely. <br /> <br /> It's homophobic. The character played by Eduardo Palomo is the saddest and most punished representation of a transsexual I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's very annoying. I ended up envying the people who left the theater before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Anything he tried, was done better, in Mexico and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> In other words: "To leave for the mother, nothing like a bad movie"
