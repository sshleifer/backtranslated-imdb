(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the film, however, it may change the expectations of the film and thus provide a less enjoyable experience.) <br /> <br /> Already rented a horror film, waiting to be in the air . the edge of his seat in fear, and instead howled with laughter at each and every stupidity of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and really scare the viewer. It was cut badly and jumped a lot; making references to the past seems more of an excuse as to why the plot was going in its particular direction. Writers should not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been performed because the poor construction of time along the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the film increasingly tiring to watch. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than writers have abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller, was the fact that gradually it was based on cheap tactics to a scare. The acting did not make it scary, and the situations hardly made it scary, so I needed some dark scenes with things jumping around you to make it worth it. Even those were predictable. <br /> <br /> Not even the blood could have saved the plot, and rivals the blood of the successful thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw tried to follow the incredibly fascinating psychological theme of Se7en, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed by the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the killer's psychology. The early scenes provoke the viewer to think that this is a psychological thriller; Believe me, it's far from that. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention bad acting? At first, Cary Elwes seems to make a convincing performance; however, this deteriorates completely in the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears of laughter for this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The performance of Leigh Whannell is also terrible and very complicated, though not as bad as Elwes' performance, and the big red flag with that is that Whannell is also the writer of the film. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw would never make up for the loss of all means, and that is what makes it a great failure. It was a wasted opportunity, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover had chosen roles in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm angry at myself for wasting money on just renting it. Definitely not worth the $ 4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything that has to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The great tragedy of this is not the lack of basis for the plot, is that the plot of great potential was thrown out and the bad acting added insult to injury. I will avoid the poor puns that surround the title and conclude with this: do not watch this movie.
