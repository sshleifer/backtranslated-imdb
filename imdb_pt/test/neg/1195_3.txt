If the League was unknown by launching this script, the supporters would simply have turned around and said "no - you're not having the money - that's terrible." As a fan of the Gentlemen's League, this is your poorest excursion to date. Not particularly funny, not particularly funny, there are some moments of laughter. They exist, but they are few and far between. I felt the shape was tired and really creeping. The film refers to writers who are bored of the characters and shows. As to being a movie. I felt that the Christmas special had better production value; the FX's are generally very poor and it's clearly obvious that they did not shoot in the original Royston Vasey (they filmed it on the cheap in Ireland). The score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. In addition, the characters' accents were largely their TV equivalents. Tubs and Edward, very underused (again), simply did not sound like themselves. Disappointing really, because I was hoping for something much more fun. This really was the equivalent of the League of comedies of the 1970s, where the cast goes to Spain ...
