After reading other reviews on this site, we were not sure if we could criticize this movie because it did not look bad enough. However, 2 minutes into the movie, we knew we were on another flop. No summer is complete without ice cream, but this movie served a melted, sour, and broken bottom ice cream cone (you know, the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a nap). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was this? It appeared to be a psychotic sorcerer driving through the neighborhood. That's it. Nothing else happens. First of all, what are the qualifications to become an ice-creamer in this city? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous psychiatric hospital known to man. This hospital was plagued with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and large syringes on the head. 2. Have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the children. 3. Make sure your truck is stocked with severed, cheap body parts, and do not forget white eyes! <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are pure caliber B-Movie. Mixed with a lot of unknowns is, who's beyond .... a version of Macaulay Culkin !! Even his brawny charm could not save that kick in his pants. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The whole concept of the movie smelled! Who would kill an ice-creamer in a shooting? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this issue. <br /> <br /> Whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted in Hollywood. Did they honestly think that a pillow under a kid's shirt would make the public believe he was really fat? Have they forgotten the arms, face, legs and all other parts of the body? Secondly, this movie was made in 1995, but the wardrobe appeared to be drawn from a lame 1980s movie, evidenced by the big brother's white, tight-fitting pants. <br /> <br /> While we were watching this production, we both developed severe cases of ADD. We found ourselves leaving the room to walk aimlessly. At many points in the movie, we found that looking at a blank wall behind the TV was more fun than the movie itself. We were surprised that this film did not make it to Bottom 100. Then we took the tape from the VCR and left it on the black top to melt like an ice cream cone below standard.
