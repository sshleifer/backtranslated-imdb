I just caught it on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie. One of the most monstrous movies I've ever seen. In addition, the TV reporter in the film was that annoying Jerri from a past season of Survivor. The only fun thing was that the "secret base" was the home of Fantasy Island (and a million other movies and TV shows; the place is located in the Los Angeles area). I expected Mr. Roarke and Tattoo to go out and greet visitors. If the tattoo had been eaten by the snake, I might have given this film a 2, but that's fine. Watching people stand there and shout for five minutes while the Komodo or the snake hovered over them instead of running away was very funny, especially as you could actually tell they were just screaming in an empty spot where computer animators would come later paint on the monster. I nearly fell off my chair, however, when in a flashback scene they brought the snake or komodo - then normal size - into some indestructible solid steel vessel with some air holes drilled into it. Would not a wire cage be enough? I LAUGHED A LOT! I think they could not afford a real komodo and snake. I have to remember that I rented Showtime for their series and not for their movies.
