For various reasons, this movie is just plain awful. Other posters listed some of the historical mistakes of this film. Well, I have a lay knowledge of Roman history and even found the blatant inaccuracies. I often forgive mistakes in historical films because I understand that the goal is to entertain and not educate. And shrinking a long saga to a two-hour feature requires some, let's say, historical license. But this film goes far beyond mere rounding. <br /> <br /> There is worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the film uses flashbacks that just make the story more confusing. Unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period, they will be quickly lost. In addition, the film was obviously filmed simultaneously in Italian and English, with several actors being dubbed later. Sometimes the actors appear to be in completely different films that have been edited together. In fact, this is not very wrong. The actors were obviously glued to an ancient Rome, generated by computer and with a computer. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this boring mess any star is because I always find Peter O'Toole entertained. But that's no reason to rent it. If you are curious about Roman history, there are much better films available.
