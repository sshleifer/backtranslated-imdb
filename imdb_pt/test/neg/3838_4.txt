I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it might have been a much better movie. It had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed tasteless. In showing the background on the two main characters, some seemed to really go wrong. Most of it was useless and did not help the movie at all. This was also not the best moment for Dennis Hopper. However, the main saving grace of this movie for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this movie, he almost makes Mr. Blonde look like a nice guy. All in all, it was watchable. Still, I kept thinking that some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the movie so much better, in my opinion.
