That one could have conceived this absurdity and then produced it is incredible. That it actually went on the air on television and the advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is incomprehensible. This stunning excuse for children's programming is almost as vile to comment on. I burned - yes, I burned - any Barney tape that people gave my son. Finding such horrible programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where, they take those child actors? Are your parents meaningless? These children will be drugged before they are teenagers. Wow. The final insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to get it on IMDb.
