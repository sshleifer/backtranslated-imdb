I disagree 100% with the reviewer who disagreed 100% with the reviewer who gave this short film an "F" rating. Making money from political propaganda only obscures Joe Dante's inability to take another Howling out of his bag of tricks. The Masters of Horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly gruesome tales, except for this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite being acclaimed by those who wish to promote their political influence, "Homecoming" is the least effective episode of MS. first season. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entrance is a parody of the genre, falling short of horror and humor in his handing over of a banal political spot. <br /> <br /> Dante can only be blamed for removing that stench from the shelf, since it was not his creation. The zombie subgenre is very popular this decade, and between the crop of predictable tributes of George Romero and empty fantasies are various works intended to promote political or religious messages. Such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. Maybe Dante is not really a Horror Master either. What has he been doing since The Howler, anyway? <br /> <br /> If you want an anti-war zombie movie with some references to pop culture passed as humor, Homecoming may just be your thing. If you're a horror fan looking for something masterful, take ... any other episode of the series. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer," based on a short film by the Bruce Jones and Berni Wrightson team - truly scary.
