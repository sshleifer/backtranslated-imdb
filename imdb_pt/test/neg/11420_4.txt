There are rumors that a fourth underworld will happen. If so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. With prequels that follow the original films, you always wonder in what order you should watch the movie, so that it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I think it does not matter as much. The third film in the Underworld is not up to par with the other two. They also had their obvious flaws, but this lack of some things and looks like money. It seems like it's not going full speed, which is a shame, because the actors could certainly have used better material to work with. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but it's nothing special. A good movie, but Rhona Mitra could not fill Beckinsale's shoes (yes, she plays another character, I mean the void, that Kate B. left) ...
