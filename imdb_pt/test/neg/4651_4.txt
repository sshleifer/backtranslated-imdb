It's definitely not a good movie, but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be. Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man, his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene, causing his revenge on those directly responsible and indirectly for the losses in his life - most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell plays the artist with his typical talent, albeit with a limited touch. In fact, I thought he gave one of his best performances. What exactly does that mean? Mitchell wears an eye patch, smokes endless cigarettes, wears a heterogeneous tunic and talks about his wax creations. They are not your ordinary wax dolls, but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological functions. They become zombies in effect. I thought the premise here was inventive, if nothing else. It has some ridiculous explanation, but it does serve the plot. This is a movie from the 60's to be sure with some psychedelic cameras from Bud Townsend and company. The performance is mediocre, but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger make interesting turns. The wax figures of the past Hollywood era are made very effectively and most of the local footage was very credible. The end of the film dissipates into something not very real - or another example of the 60s cultural cinema or the end of the screenwriter's creativity. I'm betting on the latter. Despite its many flaws, I liked the movie. The opening scene showing an actor being tormented was effectively made, as was a police chase on the seashore.
