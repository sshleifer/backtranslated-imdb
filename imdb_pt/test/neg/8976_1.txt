Honestly, on the subject of the death penalty, I could take it or leave it. The problem I have with this documentary lies in the fact that it is a complete love festival for the murderer, with no sympathy for the family. The execution of Wanda Jean, with her totally one-sided view, only reinforced my view that she should have been executed for her crimes. She tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but nothing in the video held that view. She seemed uneducated, but also her entire family, but that does not mean they were all retarded. I can fully understand if someone opposes the death penalty, but completely ignore the crime, as if that had not happened, and try to put Wanda on some moral hill, is offensive by nature, and that is not the side of the crime. the question that I would be associated with.
