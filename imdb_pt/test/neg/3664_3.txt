I have to start by saying that the actresses and the actor did a great job with what they worked on. The problem in Dark Reality is that you had a bad director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative that it ended up spoiling the movie. From beginning to end, you can say that the quality of the film roll itself is low, but the lightning and shaking camera only harms you, obscuring what is happening. The sound is muffled and often not understandable. I'm sure Huston (the director) would argue that this was to induce a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than enough material to do so. Having to result in camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome. <br /> <br /> The story is good. A basic sadistic story of a hijacker who avoids clich√©, keeping the girl in a state of despair all the time for good reason. Billy Bob of Silence of the Lambs treated his victims better than Netwon. The biggest problem with the story is that dead people constantly harass the main character in their mind, and for the second time they appeared I was advancing quickly, as this was trying to destroy the only decent part of the movie. In the end, the way the director mounted it, randomly showing blurry things and almost invisible scenes (not because of the horror, because of the lighting, angles and camera) ended up destroying the movie. Huston was obviously trying too hard, and at the very least, it looked like a bad movie school project. If you want to see a decent story, fine, but remember that the quality of the movie is enough for most to turn it off.
