This is a weird movie. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but it is full of sexual innuendo. The whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of ​​some shrunken bosses of three dead boys doing some fighting crime, but the same said that children facing a gang of older and tough guys is a bit exaggerated but again, parents are mostly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, Meg Foster plays a very mafia leader, with the beautiful AJ Damato as the leader of the bullies. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well chosen as the young lovers, although for a comic actress of her talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is unusual, but I do not think this is enough to make up for poor quality and clumsy execution. The scenery is all dull and the "special effects" quite disheartening. Sit here, unless you're in a good mood.
