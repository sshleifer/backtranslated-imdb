The filmmakers have done their utmost to find ONLY the following demographics: Peace-seeking Palestinians looking for solutions, Palestinians (particularly older women and families with children) who are especially bothered by security and Israelis who do not believe in the security barrier, sympathize strongly with their supposed effect on the Palestinians, and find it unnecessarily divisive and / or a waste of money. Oh yeah, they put a member of the Israeli government behind the fence, but they do what they can to portray him as inhuman and indifferent, and they ask him very important questions that are really statements (eg "The wall is bad "For the environment ... it's destroying everything"). <br /> <br /> I have no problem with any (well, most) of it being featured in the film. <br /> <br /> As much as I may disagree with people that they interview, their views are valid enough for a documentary. However, there are at least two sides to the issue of Israel's security fence, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (and many others) construction of the fence and believes it is having a positive overall influence, this documentary "does not present the opinion of even one of these people. They even interview an Israeli Jew who claims that "all Israelis support the fence" and are therefore insane, and then stubbornly refuse to interview even such a "crazy" Israeli. Oh, and to top it all, they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young Israelis (real exceptions to the rule - I've been there) who are laughing at / about their Arab neighbors on the other side of the world. fence. <br /> <br /> A "documentary" is a film that explores an issue and presents a full range of facts, opinions and perspectives. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. This is a cheeky PROPAGANDA MOVIE that very clearly, very purposefully offers a battery of support for only one side of a highly contested, emotionally, and politically charged issue. It's no more a documentary than, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
