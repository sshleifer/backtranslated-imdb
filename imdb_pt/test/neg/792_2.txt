I thought about checking this movie as I'm currently making a movie about a mysterious box, so it would be great to see how this movie took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> Before going to the movies I had a great expectation of this film. with actresses like Cameron Diaz, you'd expect the performance, especially hers, to be great. the performance was a kind of disappointment for the film, the characters' accents changed throughout the film, which made it unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​a strange box that can make your dreams come true, but destroy others, is such a brilliant story, but I feel that the director disappointed, this movie had the potential to be much better than that was. <br /> <br /> this movie did not have half term for this. was very confused and needed a constant entanglement. no one wants to go to the movies and leave thinking what I just watched 'I did not realize anything', can sometimes be exciting and make people want to watch again, but this movie made people want never want to hear about the movie again. When I watched, I realized that half the audience had left before the end. I feel that each person was disappointed watching this movie because of high expectations and how slow the parts of the movie were. <br /> <br /> Leave the bad spots to one side ... scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. It was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and frightening it would be to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it look great, this scene seemed a bit more distant from the 1990s than the 1970's that this movie was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> This movie was confusing because it had so many different bits. parts that you would expect to be summed up in the end, where everything is clear, but this did not happen, this was totally against the expectations of the audience, even leaving the film on a cliff, not giving the public a reason why things happen could work and do very well, but this was not, it was a different movie, different and creative than I thought, he had potential to be better, disappointed not liked, would not buy on DVD to be honest.
