There is a point in the movie where the head of the "death machines" (a multiethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive, I think it's called nowadays) talks about using leverage on a businessman. Except such is your delivery that sounds like "leatherage". At what point did this viewer get excited thinking that this dull movie was turning into a new world of wickedness. But that did not happen. The crew chief had to speak while the "death machines" did not say a single word throughout the movie and said she spoke. Endlessly. There is action in the film, but it is not so exciting and the story wobbles from one clich√© to another. The three "death machines" change to survive another day at the end of the movie. I hope there has not been a sequel.
