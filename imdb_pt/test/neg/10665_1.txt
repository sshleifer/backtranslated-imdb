He agreed that this movie is well filmed, but it just does not make sense and it does not help as they did 2 hours look like 3 just about a little love story, <br /> <br /> this could have been a bold episode and the beautiful or the oc, in short, please do not watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you from your sleep, I gave this movie 1/10 because that was the smallest, and no this is not based completely in a true story, more than half is made. I repeat that the direction of the photograph is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the film is a little too much, the actor's anasal voice only makes me want to blow my nose. Unless you are a true fan of knit this movie is a huge no-no.
