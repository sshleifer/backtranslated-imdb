I knew five minutes after the monster appeared where he was going. But when I saw the opening credits, I said "oh my God, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (from Star Trek)." Gil Gerard (of Buck Rogers, and he is almost unrecognizable), so I saw John Callahan who used to star in my " Favorite Soap, All My Childen. Put a few pounds, but he can still act. Then there was Veronica Hamill. Too bad I did not get sick around to see her in the movie. I lost 20 minutes for him movie. It was that bad. I have never seen William Katt (of Perry Mason and The Great American Hero). <br /> <br /> All these stars and a bad movie. I hope you have received the payment. Bad Bad Bad
