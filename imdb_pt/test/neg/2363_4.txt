Now any Blaxploiation fan will recognize the ingredients: Big Afros, Topless Girls, Surreal Bad Fashions and a few "jive" conversations. In that case, add a lead that can not act, a plot that makes little sense, be edited by someone with no bandaged hands and the most terrible fighting scenes and you have 'TNT Jackson'. Not bad enough to be good, but not bad enough, this is a wonderful mess from start to finish. I particularly loved the endless continuity bugs and the white stuntman's stunt. <br /> <br /> This is so bad that the Far East martial arts of the 70's meet with black power that hurts, but it hurts a lot! I'm ashamed to admit I almost liked it.
