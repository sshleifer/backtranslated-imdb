One guy, unlikely Shy Walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. That's the whole plot ... with bad acting overall, of course. Walker wanders around a corn maze (corn? I get it! HAHAHA ... it's not funny) and yells "Girls? Where are you?!?" about 1000 times. For some reason, whenever he passes a pumpkin, a squirrel sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin was laughing at it, yes, well ...). Your daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there's no reason to scream (maybe because they're still stuck in this horrible movie?). Twin girls leave 'The Shining' and appear from time to time. Most of the maze maze looks the same, so Walker's quest is very old very quickly. Filmmakers realize that NADA is going for this movie (even the music is repetitive), so they try to do interesting things by turning the camera very fast, filming them upside down, inserting smaller images of the same scene at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary, and turn the camera around 360 degrees (at least I suppose this was done intentionally, but it's likely they're just examples of incompetent movies). More often than not, when Walker is wandering the labyrinth, you can not see his face. I think the kid holding the camera can not look that high ... This movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'Dark Harvest' (which has nothing to do with this movie except for the fact that it also features a cornfield). Do not be fooled by the R. rating. Walker says the word "F" three times and now we have "a horror movie", ugh. The scarecrow on the cover does not even appear in this movie ... and when you're wishing those scarecrows from the first movie come back, you know things are bad! Instead, we took a yellow-boots face behind our hero (unfortunately he's dressed like Mr. Walker, so I did not even realize he was being followed for a while). I discovered the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before Walker (the movie is almost over when he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the movie goes on and on ... and in case it's not slow enough, there's some slow motion! The last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very bad sound dubbing. If you do not know, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. At least they did not end with the promise of another sequel!
