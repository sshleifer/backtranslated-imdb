My wife and I watched this movie because we planned to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and the sea landscape (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We expected a well written and well-acted movie, but were disappointed. His only redeeming grace is an extensive and remarkable sequence of fishing, full of authenticity: stuck tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars and passionate, albeit superstitious, fishermen. <br /> <br /> The sequencing of the film is stagy, its dialogue flushed, and the acting ranges from hard to completely "over-the-top". One scene, in which Bergman emphasizes how his male, native and naive husband, his ferret in an "innocent" (but apparently deceased) rabbit would be perfect for a Monty Python skit. <br /> <br /> When the volcano exploded, we were expecting a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the cast). Unfortunately, the film continues to drag on, finally reaching a melodramatic and absurd ending. Unless you're actually fishing for old-time tuna fishing, go through this mushy effort.
