Shirley Temple films for Twentieth Century Fox are not despicable because they are poorly made (Darryl F. Zanuck oversaw most of them, after all); they do not retain much of a "classic" stature among film aficionados, especially since they are overwhelmed with the gritty Hollywood optimism of the Depression era. The public of the 1930s was soothed by the pleasure of seeing a sulky, sometimes orphaned girl, making the adults look silly in comparison (they shook and twisted their hands as she danced her troubles). Seen many years later, Temple's vehicles barely take advantage of history (always aided by musical sequences to reinforce the content), and their timing and exaggerated reactions can leave most modern viewers rolling their eyes. No one could be blamed for his exasperation over Temple's performance here (screams at the top of his lungs) or the perversity of his dance steps, laughing with a crowd of sailors for "In the Cod Dance." Still, the fantasy aspect of this particular story, previously shot in 1924 by Laura E. Richard's book, is enough to captivate those in the proper saccharine spirit. It seems that Shirl was taken from a shipwreck by a government-appointed lighthouse keeper, but when a State Council officer discovers the tyrant is not at school, she threatens to take the boy away. It really does not matter if the plum-faced police officer is right that Temple is not being raised properly (the woman is transformed into the proverbial villain almost immediately); one can immediately see that Temple can support herself by taking care of herself and her elderly guardian of the bargain (as well as the local widow who has her hooks for the Captain). Temple is not the only one rehearsed; January Guy Kibbee is made for eye-popping reactions so often that you wonder if maybe he did not shoot them all in a day. The dialogue is steeped in metaphors on the seashore ("You can not rush a trout!" ... "Well, do not give up on the ship!), And something about the whole enterprise seems strangely mad.
