Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and a number of other so-called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because of the fact that they love portraying India and Hinduism in a bad light ... and Deepa Mehta makes her money out of it anyway. In any case, Hindus are too kind or frightened to protest against the way Muslims protest, so that anyone can take any liberties with Hinduism. And it is a fact that during the 1930s women in the west were also mistreated when they became widows ... except that no one likes to point out anything bad about the West or anything beyond India and Hindus. She paints an incorrect picture of India and the situation of widows there. Nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. She finished the film by saying that there are 34 million widows in India. Of course, among a billion people, there will be many widows. But how many lives has she described in the movie? Deepa Mehta is finally selling India and poverty to make money. How pathetic ....
