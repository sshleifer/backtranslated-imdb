Hahahahah Probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Obviously, this is not intentional though. It takes about half of the movie for the main characters to realize that the big mountainous thing is in the middle of the city is throwing up hot red things, and the other half spends diverting the flow of the city through fire trucks (you're right). This certainly made me laugh. The acting makes Arnie look like an RSC actor. It's amazing that movies like this are commissioned. A more interesting version would be someone approaching an active volcano and filming, and would probably cost about 20 pounds. ($ 40) I can see a guy flipping the movie to a movie company "well, there is this great volcano and bursts into a city .... very radical hey" If you can find it in the dollar cans, maybe it's worth Worth buying as later Watching this most of the other movies would be fine.
