Nothing but emptiness, a pleasure for those who knew the 80's, but well, very boring for those who are not interested in it. NO screenplay in this movie, but a wandering hero in an underground New York full of aristists and night clubbers. It is aimless, meaningless and naive. But not totally unpleasant.
