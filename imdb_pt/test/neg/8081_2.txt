That's what this movie is. Good God, special effects suck in this movie. It's hard for anything to suck more than the plot of this movie, but the special effects can get it out. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. There are four fucking teenagers out there in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is an idiot and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. A paramedic comes to help you, but gets stuck when the chopper breaks. Then all five realize that there is a forest fire that we see is started by a guy pouring tons of gas all over the forest. All they show us is their boots, and they show scene after scene of this guy walking around pouring gas and starting fires. Meanwhile, teens try to escape the fire, only to find that the boot man somehow managed to get ahead of them (as they ran through the forest on dirt bikes!), Pouring gas throughout the area they passed and starting over fires. He does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and sets him on fire. I will not ruin the ending, but this guy's resistance will make you shout "WHAT'S THE BLEEDING HELL?!?!" on the screen. Either way, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only way out is through a mine filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I will not even try to describe the ending, because it's very ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you do not come. What you will not, because you can not expect what happens. This is due to the second major problem with this film: consistency. <br /> <br /> Any aspect of consistency is too much to ask? Apparently yes. I can not even count the number of broken members in this movie (they keep breaking their arms and legs while hitting their bikes). I think each character breaks at least one member, and several more than one. They then stall until the scene is finished, and then forget that they must have broken limbs. There is a scene in which three of them, supposedly with broken legs, begin to dance. But then his wounds suddenly return when the plot needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally, the CGI. If there is a hell, it is to watch the fire in this movie. All they did for the forest fires is to align the dirt paths with the CGI fire. You can clearly see that the single CGI fire is along the paths, and all trees more than 60 cm in the path are not touched. And then they walk away and show the whole forest being swallowed by the flames. It is difficult to describe in words how ridiculous it seems, but I assure you that ridicule is quite impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those bad guys who are good. There are times when she descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part stays above the line and is ridiculously inept. I can not wait to see the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in the pack of four with this one.
