This movie made me laugh a lot. It was a bloody joke to tell the truth. So unbelievable and the worst plot of all time. The acting was also bad. I do not know how many Bollywood actors and actresses started making this movie. The script must have been a joke. The visual effects in this film were painfully excruciating to watch. I believe a kindergarten child could have done a better job of visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job at inventing a storyline. <br /> <br /> The plot has numerous attempts to copy great Hollywood movies. as Terminator, but fails miserably. I laughed out of my head watching this movie. A total disaster in the history of Indian cinema!
