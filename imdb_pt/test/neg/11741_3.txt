What embarrassment ... This does not do justice to the original with horrible acting from everyone in this movie, Hitchcock must be spinning in his grave. The essence in which Marion is killed in the bath is so ineffective and unoriginal. The only good part is that they used the same song and it is so obvious that it kills in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
