I really had not heard much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people would think that this movie went very slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you see Nicole Kidman going to a nude camp. Wow. Shock. That scene, the dialogue, was great. And then the movie came down. <br /> <br /> Although I respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie sucked. It was too slow, too predictable and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great as always, but this movie is not good enough to sit on. He tries to be shocking and abnormal, but makes little use of the talents of all the actors. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.
