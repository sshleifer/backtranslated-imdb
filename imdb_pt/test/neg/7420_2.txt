Developing films based on real events involving cryptozoology or the supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and writers. It is necessary to reconcile mainly the reported testimonials, the conflicting sources of information and the creativity of Hollywood to produce something that the public can enter. Unfortunately, for SASQUATCH, none of this seems to happen. <br /> <br /> The movie begins in the typical film noir when a research team crashes somewhere in the Cascades by plane. From then on, the search team disappears, and despite attempts by local law enforcement and rescue teams, they have been missing for some time. While one of the passengers is walking, infrared images are speckled on the screen (the la Predator), which subtly suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of passengers' fate. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the accident victims. Knowles brings together her own search and rescue team with the explicit mission of finding her daughter and the rest of the research team, along with the invaluable technology lost during the crash. <br /> <br /> After the rescue done by Knowles The team is assembled, the whole movie runs the path of strange characters, dizzying cinematography and a totally unoriginal plot. I literally had to stop myself from falling asleep during this movie as it tried to scare me out of my wits. The only cast member who held his own was Henriksen, who does not compensate for the lack of depth presented in all other characters. The exaggerated sound effects were also annoying; basically, I did not know if I was watching a movie about Bigfoot or grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Neither was the plot so good. It was very underdeveloped, since the spectator is mainly subjected to typical scare music, found in anything similar to the genre. Obviously you did not have to be a genius to find out who would be taking off all your clothes in the middle of the movie, or who would be the first unlucky soul to be attacked by Mr. Sasquatch. As far as good points, there are none, and therefore I gave this film 2 out of 10.
