I just missed my Saturday night watching this crap! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick ("X-Files"), the decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl for credit; a very reasonable rating of IMDb (5,6); and many good reviews on IMDb. To my complete surprise, the film is horrible: the characters are poorly constructed; The story tries to be funny, but it's totally silly; the character of Mercedes Ruehl is incredibly stupid for a Princeton professor. So I decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and found that most of them are made by IMDb users only with reviews, so relatives or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote such rubbish. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title: "No Return"
