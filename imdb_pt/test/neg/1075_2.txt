This movie did well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in that they threw them into the wackiest farce of The Gazebo. Frankly, I'm shocked to see all the positive comments about this bland, ridiculously planned comedy. Both main characters have the maturity of seven year olds and are much less interesting to pass the time. A veteran support cast, including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor, offers excellent support. And the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich landscape of Spain seem exuberant. And there are four or five really funny scenes to accompany two scenes and a bunch of recycled and bland trash. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend It Beged With A Kiss.
