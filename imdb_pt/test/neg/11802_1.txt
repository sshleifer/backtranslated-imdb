Okay, they say it's real. They do not list any screenwriter or director, but a showing of this movie will be helpful to anyone - it's not real the way you expected it to be. Speech rarely sounds like a real natural lecture ... but it also does not appear to be scripted. (possibly vaguely scripted). To me, it seemed so much more that they were always trying to improvise. (which they almost always did badly). So they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural scenes. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on, they knew they had certain places to look for things that were created ... and they told them to improvise about it all. <br /> <br /> ************* 'Top Spoilers' **************** ********* ******** ************************ <br /> <br /> Okay, it's so bad. Each item, point or thing that could be weird or used as a scare, is magically stumbled by these people. Let me list the ridiculously obviously false things that happened that I remember: 1) Less than 2 minutes entering the house, they light a light - the sparks of light and a chandelier almost falls a face . <br /> <br /> 2) They found an old medical bag with a bloody butcher's knife as they explored the basement. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear a noise a closet, so they open the door slowly - BAM - a cat is there and jumps straight for the camera while screaming. <br /> <br /> 4) Then they notice that there is a hole in the wall. , so let's put their hand on ... wow, they took out a doll from a baby wrapped in mummy tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-oh, it looks "heavy" here .... BOOM - A chair flies across the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no ! The girl who was scared of insects had a ladle in her sandwich! LOL! ridiculous <br /> <br /> 7) Let's get off the Ouija board ... oops one of the legs on the clipboard fell off the side of the board. This could not be because people were pushing, could they? (they find out that a ghost is called Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that noise in the chimney ... CLINK - Oh my shackles fell "I think she * kept the people up here." <br /> <br /> 9) Now weak girl will brave looking at the chimney pit ... ah, what is this, she sees something ... and is asking people who are not looking at the chimney which is. SWISH - falls straight into it. (perfect camera) It moves well in time. It was more chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate and each 'clean' our designated rooms - it would not be something if things started happening one by one for these people now ... ok: <br /> < CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly her room is shaking ... but nobody does it. DUDE # 1: Actually says to himself "Charles, this is you Charles ... it can not be you because you are just an invention of my imagination, are not you Charles? Well, guess what? <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: Hear things ... to communicate ... and it's there, getting bruises or something. </ DUDE # 2: He was in the attic, reached for his arm through a hole in the ground and got a splinter .... I do not remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11 ) Dude # 2 runs, gets Chick # 2 .. They hear the chick and the guy screaming, they find them chained to a wall and tied to a table. (*) They leave Cut to black The final text tells us that They have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also discovered the next day that a 911 call was made by they name a someone named "Charles" . <br /> <br /> ************ * 'Main Spoilers' **************** ******** ********** about ********** ********** <br /> <br /> Okay, when I first heard this movie being done, I could not wait. I thought it was going to be real. REAL, REAL - and more professional, with more professional people. I love the idea of ​​this sort of thing, I would love to see real haunted scenes. Before this movie was released, I saw some comments from people online. They both claimed how fake it was and how stupid people were. Time went by I forgot the movie ... so I realized that it was never released in theaters. So I figured it went straight to the video, we rented it ... I thought every brutal review was completely true. It's too bad, I really wanted it to be good. Random thoughts: The house did not seem to have TVs, radios ... kitchen gadgets that I remember ... which would make me think that no one has lived there for a long time. Especially the house is truly known for being haunted ... I'm sure no one lives there. But it looks so clean and neat ... and what was a cat doing there? The property has no neighbors nearby. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, you'll just want to rent this if you and your friends want to sit there and make fun of it ... or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued him. (you'll be disappointed if you're expecting a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> Random Thinking: I believe the producer says "the images you see are real". Well, technically, it's a real shot, is not it? Real images of fake hauntings? Maybe that was his loop hole. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a star - strictly in the fact that they told the story of Madame LaLaurie. A true New Orleans story. <br /> <br /> The best performance was the guy who taught the participants about ghost hunting equipment in the beginning. He was obviously real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
