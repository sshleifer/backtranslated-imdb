Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the adopted daughter of a newly deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; his uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), annoyed at not getting out of business, asks for a blow on his niece. When chef Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) walks into the wrong hotel room by mistake and knocks Hitler Invincible (Jung Yuen), he is mistaken for the killer and sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls in love with the beautiful heiress and ends up promising to protect her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo's men while Kensuke is worried about playing an arcade game with police officer Daniel (Sam Lee). Uncle Kazuo keeps Yumiko in a hypnotic trance, and takes control of the deal, but runs at a point of bothering himself when his gangster friends threaten to reveal their illegal activities unless he tells them control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Kensuke joins two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo) who are hunting Invincible. He learns Kung Fu and tries to free Yumiko. No Problem 2 is a disappointing movie considering the talent involved: Yuen Baio, an 80s kung fu star, manages few fight scenes, but there are getting a little old for acrobatics these days; director Kar Lok Chin offers the kind of idiot parody I would expect from a horror movie; Jung Yuen resorts to mocking his character in Operation Scorpio; and Sam Lee ?? Well, Sam Lee is as boring as ever! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, like Gangster Ben, impressed me; he has an obviously strong screen presence that has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood - he has starred in two of the Matrix movies and is about to appear in O.D., directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed with Wakana Sakai, but for a completely different reason: this beauty is easy and must go much further in the movie business. <br /> <br /> What movies are being parodied, but at 104 minutes I found this movie a real chore to sit on. If people making funny faces with silly sound effects make you burst out laughing, then no problem 2 can attract you. Otherwise, I'd be good alone.
