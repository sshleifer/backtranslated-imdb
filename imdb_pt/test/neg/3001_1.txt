'Northfork' is what's wrong with indie movies. For all your comments from harsh edges and attacking large studios of non subjects, this is the sacrifice we make. For nearly two hours I was subjected to torture and the pain of a movie that begins wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new territory and happily dies. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories that detail a dying city and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one James Woods) must force the remnants of Northfork to leave before a dam opens and floods the city. The other story has a boy who returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) who gave it to his parents. He is dying and is visited, I think, by the angels. Among them Anthony Edwards with bizarre spectacles and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Although this is the "plot", it's not about what the movie is about. The movie is about nothing. It does nothing, it says nothing, it leads to nothing and there is nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by definition, more likely a later effect of the pretentious and surreal aspiring to David Lynch - we are an important art film that you can not see - steering style. The whole film is filtered through a gray and somber backdrop that, I suppose, fits into a movie about death. Instead, this simply makes the movie a lot harder to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about men in black, watch "Men in Black" films, not very impressive, but compared to "Northfork". 'they are elevated to the status' Citizen Kane'. If you want to watch a movie about a dying boy, watch 'Lorenzo's Oil'. If you want to see a movie that has the destruction of a city across the water, watch 'The Brother, Where Are You?' If you want to watch a movie better than 'Northfork', there are hundreds. If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there are only a handful. 0 * out of ****
