Maybe it will get better. I would not know. I went through the first twenty minutes before cutting him into a period of mourning. It was obvious that the plot itself was familiar. One man, Paul LeMatt, a professor of entimology at Columbia, drives with his dog to a small Ohio town in search of his ex-wife, Diana Scarwid. There he meets people who ignore him or are hostile. Oh, they can smile, but there's something going on underneath. <br /> <br /> This type of arrangement is home to the filmmakers and spectators, and it is full of possibilities. You can produce a well-designed commercial success such as "Bad Day at Black Rock". Or he would have, and probably did, a good episode of "Twilight Zone." <br /> <br /> The cast includes some experienced artists as well as some previously prominent names. Kenneth Toby, a science fiction veteran, is the superficially amiable motel manager. Diana Scarwid can give an impressive performance, as she did, say, "Silkwood". For some of the others, their scope is limited. <br /> <br /> But it is misdirected and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Example of beaten steering. That LeMatt dog does not like Kenneth Toby right away. So when LeMatt goes out into the street, Toby runs off to his bedroom window, looks at the dog and something fires. Cut to LeMatt on the street. He hears his dog howl away. Then a POV shot, presumably, from the dog running toward LeMatt, past it as the wind blew and LeMatt gaped at the camera. Cut to an identical shot - coming from the other direction! Whatever the camera represents, what LeMatt is looking at is never shown. Maybe it was nothing, because suddenly the wind stops and LeMatt is alone in the street, looking a bit puzzled. "You should never have brought that dog in the first place," observes a smiling Toby from the porch. Question: What the hell is this scene? <br /> <br /> Example of wrinkled writing. Well, TWO examples. (1) If you sat down and wrote a stereotypical waitress in a small-town diner, without any type of craftsmanship, you would appear with a blank baby with hair on top of the head, chewing gum. , walking among the tables. Right. (2) Anything that looks like credibility is thrown out of the window in favor of special effects. LeMatt's car stops, then explodes while waiting to be repaired in the garage. Chugging for a stop: believable. Exploding: supernatural. Not even Edgar Allan Poe would endorse such an event. <br /> <br /> And the invaders themselves? Think of a modest masterpiece as "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." Something is going wrong in the small town of dr. Kevin McCarthy, and it takes half the film for the mystery to be unraveled, and all the time of suspense is increasing and the doubt is increasing. Here, twenty minutes after the movie, a stranger enters a motel room and rips out his plastic face, revealing a pulsating, emitting naked brain. The pregnancy is aborted. <br /> <br /> I will not tell the end because I do not know what it is, nor do I care. I suppose it has something to do with insects because why else would Paul LeMatt be an entimologist? (By the way, who's dealing with your lessons?) But I'm not sure bugs were involved. It is quite possible that the bugs business was accidental. The writers may have made him an insect specialist and then forgot all about it. Would not surprise me.
