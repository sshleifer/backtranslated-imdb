** Possible Spoilers ** Three young people on the wrong side of the law have the chance to change their lives and become useful members of society by becoming cops disguised in The Mod Squad, a resurrection of the hit television series. the 1960s, directed by Scott Silver. Given their less than stellar origins, and because of who they are and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go places that other may, then they are called by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate a decadent night spot, suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring. For starters, Julie gets a job as a waitress, while Pete and Linc simply "go out" to find out what they can. Julie quickly reunites with an old boyfriend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who ends up getting involved with drugs, which are tied to the dark business that happens at the bar. Before it's over, the 'squad' is inside him up to his neck, at the same time he is confronted with a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with the drugs and, therefore, tied with the investigation. From the beginning of the movie there is a feeling that you are arriving late; as if it were assumed that you know what is happening, as well as the origin and operation of the squadron. All you get here are brief biographies of the three that give you nothing more than a glimpse of your past; There is nothing about how it all really happened. The thought was probably that, in doing so, it would lead to the story more quickly, it would make things progress. While this is true to some extent, some additional context would have made the texture of the story a little more interesting; the way it was done here simply depreciates the credibility of the whole process. The plot is marginal to begin with, and any time spent developing the character would have been worth it. What is delivered, unimaginatively, is a less convincing story, full of one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors receive no help from the script, nor apparently from Silver; Danes, Ribisi and Epps come close to mending Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time allotted to them, combined with the lack of support, they are still far from giving life to these people. Farina, a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here, looks like nothing more than a caricature of the "good cop". There is a feeling that everything was given once in this film; some details and nuances would have boosted the stock considerably. The supporting cast includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It's a shame to see the talent of the actor involved here wasted; much more thought and planning should have been made in that film. The way it is, it's poorly designed and poorly executed. Danes, Ribisi and Epps are like the Major Leaguers who were imprisoned throwing by all the marbles in the sand place; instead of trying the title, all were hung to dry. As Terry says in "On The Waterfront," "You were my brother, Charlie, you should be taking care of me." Well, obviously there was no Charlie to take care of them here, and after "The Mod Squad," everyone can only hope that something better would appear next time. I rate this 1/10.
