When I first heard about this movie, I eagerly went out to rent it, believing (mistakenly) that it was one of those bad movies that were fun and that I was in for a surprise. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the rhythm is agonizing, too slow. The pace does not even begin to pick up until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The plot was boring and the ending was meaningless and confusing. For those looking for a tacky horror movie with cheap thrills, look elsewhere. This film provides the tacky swords, but is extremely lacking in "emotions", cheap or not. <br /> <br /> Try "Child's Play" instead.
