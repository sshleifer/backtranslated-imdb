I was 19 in 1970 when I left and having heard how funny it was when I left and reading the reviews here, I finally rented and watched it. I did not laugh once - a very dull movie - and I usually love Reiner. I can not, for the life of me, understand why this is seen as funny. I did not have a laugh. And I love comedies! Well, at least now I know what the whole scream was about. It's not my idea of ​​comedy. Will rent the browser or the love nest by Buster Keaton - now those are comedy classics! If you rent this - have a reservation rental so your whole night is not a loss. Rated 3 out of 10
