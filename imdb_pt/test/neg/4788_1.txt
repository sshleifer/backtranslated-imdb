With the plethora of repetitive sitcoms and derivatives playing in the fall, summer, winter, and spring line-ups, it's good to see a show that stands out from the lot in more than one area. <br /> <br /> "Earl" has an unusual approach. It's not about the "daily thoughts of an eccentric family" (zzzz ...), or about the other annoying things you see everywhere on sitcoms. The show is about this little white trash thief (Earl) who pulls out a lottery card and makes a good time. At that moment, 'Karma' took it from him. Overtime, he discovers that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he's doing, so he starts a quest to correct all the mistakes he's ever made and he's got all his actions in a role. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant premise for a sitcom. Luckily, it landed on the right hands. Running the program produces extremely satisfying results: you have an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching on many occasions. You can not help but fall in love with Earl's sincerity and steadiness, Randy's simple mind, his good heart and his remarks about life, Darnell's extravagant and cheerful personality, and Darnell's calm, laid-back way that really makes him easy for you. When you combine the series innovation with your genuine mood, good heart, interesting characters and well written dialogue, you really do have a guardian. With programs like this (and the incomparable "The Office"), NBC is obviously tied to something. Have they finally released a cubicle or two to ensure quality? Let us wait. And let's hope that more quality shows like these take up the line-ups; shows that we, NBC viewers and executives, will stop crying in the days past of NBC's golden days (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
