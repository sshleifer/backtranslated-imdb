This was the next to last film appearance of Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990, after four decades as an actress and well-known producer. Ireland made some waves in the press when it left its then husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning its long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in the number of screen deaths, has had one of the most enduring marriages in movie history. <br /> <br /> "Murder" seems to be a film this was placed on Cannon's production schedule because of Bronson and Ireland. Ireland already had cancer-related illnesses in 1987 and you can almost imagine the two actors wanting to do "just one more, for the old days." 'Assassination' is carelessly done as a whole, showing the lack of Polish and waning funds that would channel Cannon in 1990. But there is a kind of nostalgia in seeing the couple together one last time and the movie makes you wonder what exactly helps one relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a senior Secret Service agent who is assigned to protect First Lady Lara Craig (Ireland). The President's wife has a reputation for being difficult, sending Service agents around and wanting to do things her way. That all changes, however, when attempts are made in your life and she must travel with Killian by car, train, bike and, believe it or not, buggy to escape assassins. There is little surprise here, as Killian believes that the killers are part of an inner work, perhaps arranged by the president himself. On the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop unfamiliar affection for each other in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are really very funny. <br /> <br /> What really understands me is how this movie was promoted in its release and how it is still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that 'Assassination' is another cold-hearted Bronson shoot-up. But much of this film - which was rated PG-13 by the way - is in a comedic vein, putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like Bronson and Western Ireland's "From Noon Till Three." Even the DVD shows Bronson with a rocket launcher ready to blow things up. What he does, but to a lesser extent than his other 80's potboilers. Overall, 'Assassination' is late in the work of Cannon Slop and really does not know what kind of movie it wants to be. In addition to moving from actioner to romantic thriller and vice versa, there are serious errors in continuity, property values ​​are cheap and the effects are terrible; Many of the blasts look like a matte work, rather than being made on the spot. Robert Ragland, who had shown good composing skills in previous films, joined Valentine McCallum on a track that is more synthesized and more suitable for television. <br /> <br /> Richard Sale's script has a real dialogue. Talks between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot. There is no explanation as to why the First Lady is called "A Mama" suddenly, nor why Ireland gets its British accent when the character is a native of Wyoming. Jan Gan Boyd, playing Killian's lead assistant, has a kitten-like personality and is frowned upon as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as killer Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are accepted in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> This was Peter Hunt's last directing show, which came on stage with 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' in 1969 and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin on 'Death Hunt' in 1981. 'Assassination 'is available on DVD by MGM. Home entertainment; is presented in widescreen format and double standard, with subtitles in three languages ​​and theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
