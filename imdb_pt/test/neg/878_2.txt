This is one of the most anti-romantic movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Casting: Richard Gere is very old looking for more romantic lead roles. Diane seems a little anxious to please and frown as usual, but she does not seem to be convinced of the novel. The support cast is not very memorable. <br /> <br /> Story: The medical drama with which he has to deal is unconvincing and uninteresting. The story is weak - it does not go so far as to make a movie about it. There is nothing new to say or no new way of saying it here. <br /> <br /> The scenery is a bit gloomy and the house you are in is not attractive. <br /> <br /> NOT meant to be a great memory.
