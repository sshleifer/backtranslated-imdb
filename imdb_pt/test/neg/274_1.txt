I had not planned to watch O12 because I did not like O11 very much. I thought O11 was a cool but rather boring movie of bank robbers with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway, I was persuaded to watch O12 one night and regretted it a lot. The plot is not only annoying but also meaningless. I honestly do not even know what it was about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and had coffee with another girl who did not like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you this. But even the guys who stayed until the end told me that the plot was still horrible and useless. My advice: do not watch. Go watch Team America (btw hilarious ;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the most boring and tasteless peace of crap to be on the screen in years.
