This is one of those movies I watch every time I'm on, not because I like it, but because it's so bad I can not take my eyes off it (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland"). The first time I watched, I kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and did not get my chance until about 3/4 of the way when they took the sneaking cops off their panties and handcuffed them in the park in an unfavorable manner. position. Also, the jokes are not funny, the characters are not funny, their mishaps and mistakes are not funny ... some, it's not a very funny movie! Not even on a level of clowning! And what about the reggae soundtrack? It's a movie about two white garbagemen and music is all reggae. Sounds out of place, does not it? If you like a good train, this is for you. If you like good comedy, look elsewhere.
