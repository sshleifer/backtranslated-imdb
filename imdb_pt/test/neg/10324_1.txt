I joined Blockbuster to watch some good old-fashioned action movies. Then I sailed around the action section until this movie caught my attention because the cover had in bold large letter SANDRA BULLOCK. An action movie with Sandra Bullock and is rated R! YAY! Although I admit that I prefer her in a comedy, but if this is something like 'Speed' then I got sold. Unfortunately Sandra really is not in this movie, her role is smaller: "Panicky kidnapped girlfriend" (She is in fifth place on the list of actors for Jeebus treme!) Apparently this was her first movie role (and after watching this movie, I realized Sandra is the only human being alive in this movie, everyone may very well be a zombie in a horror movie B. This movie deceived me by saying that Sandra was the leader ... I fell in love with her as Biff de 'Back to the Future 'when Marty yells' WHAT IS THIS ... !!!' God, I'd like to see it instead. Sandra is the only good side of this movie, every time she's on the camera, it's like she's taking shoving oars and shouting "CLEAR!" to make movies, but flat lines, no matter how hard she tries ... More about Sandra later ... The movie Think about the darkest moment of your life and imagine yourself living in that moment for 110 minutes (for me, it's this lme.) This film somehow makes Gun Fights and Bullet so boring, so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers are ashamed. And the idea of ​​the Bullet Time movie is a close-up of an AK in slow motion that mocks you while the caps spitting out of it represent every second of your life as it slowly walks away. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself quickly routing "THROUGH THE ACTION!" The plot? . . . Was there a plot? Music? . . . Even by the 1980s, muck is bad, but at least it's the only thing that kept me awake. Acting Sandra Bullock was good and. . . ummm. . moving. Is it good because it is classified as R? No, unless R means Ridicules-snooze-fest. <br /> <br /> And it really is a Cliche of the 80's when a movie opens with an aerial view of a city (swinging guitar or power ballet) and ends with a gun. fight in a sinister factory complete with steel walkways and assorted pipes. Both of which this movie satisfies. At least this movie establishes that it was from which it was unnecessary, since Sandra's hair was screaming "1980s !!!!" And a movie gets really confusing when you watch a killer stripper kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body into a box, which you sadly responds by saying "this is probably the biggest action the poor sap ever had." Another Hammy moment is at the beginning, when a secret-agent guy hides a crowd and apparently this movie thinks people jump in the air and fall to the ground when they die. All that the scene needed was the death of Mario or maybe the Contra sound effects, but Nintendo could have sued. <br /> <br /> And it's sad when the main action hero in this movie rips out other BEST movie icons. Before the big gun scene, the hero is found standing in a boxing ring ('Rocky' someone?), Sporting a leather fedora (not 'Indiana Jones' as well) with a spotlight behind him (Terminator the second before owning T-1000 What is really very sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can shoot better quality videos (with a low quality webcam no less) then this movie. I'm serious, most of Rant videos recorded with bad audio and blurry images are more fun than this movie.I can not even call this movie by its name because it's the name that brings back horrible memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a violation against human rights!) The only bright spot in this grim abyss is Sandra's career has begun to take off thanks to this movie.But, oh Sandra ... Why did you have to be in a nightmare? A feet quena background story about Sandra as an extra, seen as she is the only one in this movie that ends up being a household hold name. Which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for the unsuspecting cinephiles, Crafty little bug. <br /> <br /> I do not have much experience with bad movies, but I know BAD when I see it. I could recover from 'Labyrinths and Monsters' with a good old comedy Bruce Willis. But even Bruce could not cheer me up after this movie. I have not seen any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I'm excited about them now. Because I can not even imagine a movie worse than that. . . "GAG". . . 'Hangmen'. . .
