When it was released, this movie caused a sensation. I watched and was thrilled. Pretty women, usually young and nude, filmed in the classic style we knew so well from the picture of director Hamiltons. His photographs never become pornography and the same is true for this film. Today I saw again and I was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow scenes, all filmed with a little vaseline in the lenses, is actually all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed, but they are not real creatures with soul. Actually nothing happens. It's as if Hamilton were shooting using motion pictures instead of still images. And it gets so annoying after a while. I did not even watch the whole thing a second time, because I fell asleep. That is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. And you'll never get hooked on it! <br /> <br /> At that time, 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
