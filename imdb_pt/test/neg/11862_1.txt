First of all, let me stress that I am not a big fan of the politically correct. In fact, I like satire or black humor, even if it makes minority jokes. The reason, I am sure, that this racist work is not worth seeing, is that it does not mock minorities to demonstrate their condition of life, their social circumstances or the way they are treated by society. In addition, it uses all stupid stereotypes and prejudices to strengthen xenophobic feelings and reserves. It's really a shame, but not a surprise, that the other reviews have not gotten to that point because we all had a cheap laugh. Congratulations.
