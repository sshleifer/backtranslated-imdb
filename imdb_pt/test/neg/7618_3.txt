I once saw a bit of this movie, and was interested in seeing the whole thing just to see why the critics gave it two stars, the result is that I agree. Basically, the film begins with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) telling all his friends Muppet that they have lost everything, and he ends up sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) in the bank. Meanwhile, in another world (Heaven) the angel Daniel (David Arquette, who has been in the Muppets from Space) visits the 'Boss' (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the movie) to show that Kermit really needs help. In the flashbacks, Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and best Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Shrimp (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets prepared a show of stage for many people to see on the Christmas holiday, and everything seems to be going well. But the truth is that Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to close the show or the theater, and Kermit is doing everything he can to make sure that does not happen. Of course, Kermit failed the last time, and Bitterman says they're finished, and she can officially bring the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as the guardian angel of Caco to try to help him, but Caco is not in a good mood, and ends up saying "I wish I had never been born". Obviously, you can recognize the parody of It's a Wonderful Life, with Kermit as George Bailey, and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and in the end, Kermit obviously realizes how much he means to everyone, and back to find the theater. except as a historical landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo, the Rat and the Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf, the Puppy and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character that sounds similar to the Oz version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the parody of the Moulin Rouge, in addition, and the familiar faces are not fantastic. It was named the Emmy of Best Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". The Muppets were the 47th of the top 100 pop culture icons. Suitable!
