Because they all just watch the MST3K with their artificial friends who make (most of the time) funny and obvious comments about movies. And that's the only way these people watch and then they comment and vote on IMDb based only on that, they do not even try to watch the movie on their own. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie by itself, I did not read the comments first, I did not have some people saying what to laugh at, I just got the DVD (bought for the other side, Morons From Outer Space , an old favorite) and watched <br /> <br /> From the cause I knew what I was doing when I was a Golan Globus, Albert Pyun's movie, but generally they can be quite fun. <br /> <br /> The film is a not very stressful on the Alice brain in the history of the rabbit hole made so many times, and half similar in basic structure (but completely different in content) to Warlords of Atlantis, another fun B -Movie. <br /> <br /> The voice was annoying, but then that's the idea, that they even poked with a few lines in the movie. <br /> <br /> The hero character had one of the worst voices / accents in English fi lm history, but you grow to accept it and have fun. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's not a very bad movie, it's just a kind of B-Movie DTV movie, nothing too new, nothing too much, and would probably be more appreciated by a larger age group. young people (say, among children 7 to 14 years old) than I am. It's a bit of cheerful fantasy. <br /> <br /> Will I see it? again, probably not 10 years ago I would have. <br /> <br /> Do not be so hard on a movie, because some dolls have also told you, this movie is not taking itself seriously and it's certainly not Troll 2 or Space Mutiny.
