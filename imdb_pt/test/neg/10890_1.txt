I only comment very good movies and with a lot of trash. My goal is to help people who want to see great movies to spend their time - and money - wisely. <br /> <br /> I also want to stop people wasting their time with the trash, and they want to spread the fact that director / producer of these junk films can not get along with this for long. We'll find out who you are and vote with your feet - and wallets. <br /> <br /> This movie clearly falls into the category of junk. <br /> <br /> The director and writer is John Shiban. It is always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. Maybe he wants two paychecks. He should not receive any. So remember the name - John SHIBAN. And if you see anything else for it, forget it. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the plot - others have already. I'm a bit worried about how much the director likes to approach the poor girl's face when she's crying and screaming. These long-range shots are a little worrisome and may say something about Shiban's mental state. Maybe he should ask for psychiatric help. That's enough. It sucks - do not waste time on it.
