This totally unbelievable movie is so exaggerated and pathetic and unreal that during the 90 minutes of total torture I probably looked at my watch about 70,000 times! Lucy Bell is much taller than this crap and for her to sink it is very depressing. I have to admit that the whole audience I was in was laughing hysterically, but most were Greek or Italian, so I think this mood will probably make them laugh, but not me. All this movie does is make you nauseous watching all those slackers making excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. God, and I can never recover 90 minutes!
