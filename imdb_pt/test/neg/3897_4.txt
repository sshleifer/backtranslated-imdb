The opening scene of the beach at Fircombe, though entertaining in itself, unfortunately provides an adequate metaphor for the film - tasteless and faded. Actually, it's not as tacky as most of the others in the Carry On series, but maybe because of that it's not much fun. It's a fair bet that the title will attract fans of the Benny Hill show, but those looking for attractive women in bikinis and miniskirts while they will see some in this one will probably like some of the other titles in the series, such as " outer "or" continue the jungle "more. The rise of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a plotting device that seems quite counterproductive.
