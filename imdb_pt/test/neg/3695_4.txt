A woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, helped no doubt by a gigolo husband who speaks frankly and who openly betrays her. Of course, no one believes when she claims to have been approached by a giant man who came out of a giant satellite. To the delight of her husband, this could be the incident that finally pushed her away forever. Since the opening scenes, with your ridiculous television news and ridiculous satirical encounter, you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it's so bad that it's funny. Although not far from the truth, this is definitely not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most films of this genre, this is not really a science fiction or horror movie, but actually a serious drama that cleverly embeds a science fiction scenario in the plot. It's not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you were not expecting any legitimate drama. The acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget and, most importantly, it's well-edited and with great rhythm. It is never boring and can generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next. However, this is still a movie strictly for those who can not pass up the chance to watch a 50's movie with a title like "50 Foot Woman Attack"!
