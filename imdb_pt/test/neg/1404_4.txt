This was the movie of a character. The plot was not so hot when it was there, but the characters were interesting and very well-played. The story centers on the Travis family, following the suicide of their eldest son. I say it loosely, because the story is mainly about the surviving son and the mother, because if the father also had the story focused on him, they edited the film very badly. The acting everywhere was very good, particularly Emile Hirsch as the survivor and confused son. The characters were all very interesting and I did not mind watching them until the end of the movie when it seemed to just drag on. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint, however, was the story. The killing child should be the center of the plot. However, it really was not. It was something that happened at the beginning of the story, but then everything went everywhere. Then they mentioned that the son killed himself to remind him that this was the central thread. The other thing was that the great twists, of which there were many, were never actually explained or constructed, but only thrown there randomly and often from the far left field. To be fair, the end was very, very cool. But it also became clear where the inspiration for the story came from: about half of it (the half that was not being filled) was practically drawn from the history of Pearl Jam's music, Alive. Which reminds me ... <br /> <br /> There was a "poem" in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed himself. I could not have been the only one who recognized that the said poem was raised, word for word, from that same song. I do not know, this was a movie that I had hope for, and they really dropped the ball.
