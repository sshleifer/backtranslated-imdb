The production values ​​for this movie leave him short of Hollywood blockbuster status, and the script leaves him with little cult status. What remains is a weary stereotyped attempt at the kind of disaster film that will disappear with the ebb tide. <br /> <br /> A decent cast, or is a real actor, or can not be bothered. Beautiful Joanne Whalley can not bring any seriousness to the role of police commissioner Nash, who wears the most irritating vest on waist, above her skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the heavy part of the director of Thames Barrier with all the conviction of a candy floss fair. His Canadian nationality and accent were presumably drafted to appeal to a transatlantic audience. She, and she, fails. Her initial appearance in a pink jogging suit just when she gets to work is laughable. <br /> <br /> The part of "Siren old git that was right" is played by Tom Courtenay. as if he were acting while asleep, and the various twists designed to energize his son, played by Robert Carlyle, struggle to get any response from him. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer seems determined to commit hari kari rituals for his shortcomings as Director of the Met Office, or for his acting, or both, and only David Suchet emerges with some credit for his role as Vice- Minister. <br /> <br /> There was enough in history, and the cast and effects to have made a decent effort. Unfortunately this did not happen.
