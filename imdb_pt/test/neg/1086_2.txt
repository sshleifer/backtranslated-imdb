I'm very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie 9 years ago and still remember how angry I felt to sit in the movies and look at this mess. I'm a big fan of John Boorman's work. I really like your movies. So I went to "Beyond Rangoon" with high expectations. But I felt like watching a silent, cheap Chuck Norris jungle movie with all the cut-scenes. Even the soundtrack was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I can not believe John Boorman was the director because this movie was so poorly done. I think the Burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
