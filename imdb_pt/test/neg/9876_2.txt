I've never read the book. Now I really do not want to. I had no idea what that movie was when I entered the theater. I still do not really know what should happen, but I know that a good two hours have been wasted in my life. Two precious hours that I can never return. <br /> <br /> The plot was so predictable that it is laughable. Werewolves ... or something like that ... a Romeo and Juliet plot. I predicted the endig within five minutes in the movie. And I was correct. <br /> <br /> The acting is not horrible. The only two legal characters in the film were the British cousin and the presenter of the graphic novel Rambo. The other characters are also ... the dialogue is very mild and predictable. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part of the film are the transformations between "humans" and "wolves". If you wanted something shocking like the Van Helsings, you would be very annoyed. Imagine a ballet dancer, a bright light, then a wolf. Yeah ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this movie. Period. Especially if you read the book, because you just want to punch babies.
