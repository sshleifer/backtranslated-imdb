Unlike one of the reviewers below, I do not think a great and brilliant career should be ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of looking at the navel. Since it is good to see a British director trying to escape the boundaries of the convention, AKA's only claim to ground-breaking fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. At first, you think this may be an interesting device, but your only real contribution to the movie is to test your vision and patience. Seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a two-dimensional film does not make it more revealing or complex. If you can forget the triple screen (which, of course, is very difficult to do), then you have to deal with the unintentional hilarious script. The public is defeated by chiche over chiche over the British class system. The film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of Upstairs and Downstairs. In short: the emperor's new clothes. And a pretty poor outfit too.
