This movie is probably one of the 3 worst movies ever made. I rented it by chance, without reading reviews, and wow, I regret it. It really has no plot, it really does not follow the vampire genre. Simply god awful. Watching this movie will tarnish your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt like the writer / director / producer went through this drug spree and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it in the movie. The whole time I wanted the movie to end ... but the ending was even crazier. <br /> <br /> If this analysis can save only one person from watching this crap, I felt my time spent on registration and writing this review was worth it.
