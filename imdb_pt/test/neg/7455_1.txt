Why is it that Canada can produce decent movies to good in all genres, others then in action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. I just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity to undermine my willpower. It's nice to say that the cast of IMDb "Credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing, bad storytelling, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. Just go on and on. The film really has nothing to recommend it. If you are looking for bad action movies to enjoy laughing, there are a ton of other movies that do not require you to remove your retinas later. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie does not get government money for funding, otherwise I'll never pay taxes again.
