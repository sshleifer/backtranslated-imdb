This contains some information about the spoiler, but the movie is not worth seeing anyway ... <br /> <br /> Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to be part of this disaster, writer / director Damian Harris is beyond me. The story is filled with unrealistic police investigation techniques, which include going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect to his home and staying close to them. The tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have only female clients - and he sleeps with all of them. <br /> <br /> Even more exaggerated is the notion that female victims to a horrible S / M crime belong to a large but secret group of S / M lesbian executives. Filled with errors of editing and continuity, the film is sterile in all its pompous locations - including Detective Barkin's apartment. . And the idiot dialogue is suitable for putting one to sleep. <br /> <br /> Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably to create a noisy atmosphere at times. In addition, he failed to get Ellen Barkin that 110%. I firmly believe that she realized that the film was pathetic and gave up trying. <br /> <br /> Highlights were Peta Wilson, who wasted time studying with a Dominatrix for the role. The highly understated character actor, Marshall Bell gave his absolute best as ever. <br /> <br /> And as Damian could not deliver on any level, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, he does not know much about the real world of BDSM and chose to create the typical "Hollywood Reality" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and braincells and pass this by.
