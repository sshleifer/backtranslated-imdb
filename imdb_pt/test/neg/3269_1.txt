I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten and I mostly laugh because of the horse scene. I should have realized the movie was as empty as ... I can not make a good comparison. It's stupid and not even funny. Cast members of the original who chose not to star in this probably made the best choices they ever made in rejecting it; why, oh why, did Chevy Chase return? And how did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd get involved in this story? I bet that every person who has his name, even remotely attached to that garbage (for example, the supplier) has shame beyond redemption. So, after all, it is beyond terrible, terrible and everything. Avoid how you would do with the Ebola virus.
