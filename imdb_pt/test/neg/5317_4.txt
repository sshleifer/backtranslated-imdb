Stupidly stupid Garrido from ex-talented John Hughes, who will soon be making a movie with 'Look Who's Talking' sperm if his stars get younger. He re-recycles the "Home Alone" formula to produce this stupid comedy in which a baby walks through Chicago while the inept hijackers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley try to catch him, suffering with a very tiresome antics. If Mantegna and Pantoliano can not find a laugh somewhere in the movie, then you're in trouble, but the laziness of the movie is most glaring in scenes where crowds of people no longer notice a baby crawling on the sidewalk. Utter nonsense.
