If possible, try to see all five Universal "Mummy" movies in order, not so much for the continuity between the films, but for their obvious lack. Needless to say, Boris Karloff's original classic, "The Mummy," should not even be mentioned at the same time as the so-called "sequels," which seem to be exaggerated. <br /> <br /> This time it is revealed that the mummified remains of Princess Ananka went to the United States. And once again, as his eyes deceive you, Kumis, the Mummy, did not die a second time in "The Mummy's Tomb," but is alive and searching for his lost love. Princess Ananka, with the help of nine rhetorical tana sheets. manufactured during the full moon cycle. To complete the mythology, Kharis needs a janitor, skillfully filled by a skinny John Carradine like Yousef Bey, in charge of the task of Andoheb, the high priest of Arkan, of George Zucco. <br /> <br /> Kharis and Ananka must return to their final resting place in the hills of Arkan, Egypt. But as we have seen before, being in charge of a high priest's duty is a sure bet to end in failure, with Carradine's character falling on the reincarnation of Ananka, Amina Monsouri (Ramsay Ames). It is shocking to see Yousef Bey and the bandage of the PO come to blow on the beautiful Amina. Riddle me this - in both "Tomb" and "Curse," Lon Chaney portrays the Mummy with a flabby right arm bent helplessly on his chest. When he finds Amina fainted, he raises her in both arms without problems; as soon as he puts it on his right arm, he returns to the crippled position again. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is more remarkable - the monster takes the girl! But it is a short victory, as the mummy and her raptured bride succumb to a marshy tomb, an ancient Egyptian curse is fulfilled - "The fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods will be a cruel and violent death."
