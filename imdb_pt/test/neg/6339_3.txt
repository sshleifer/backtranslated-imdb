Disappointed comedy-drama with sentimental coating has Michael J. Fox ideally cast as a former child star who now runs a talent agency for small artists; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. This all sounds as if it could not miss, however, much of the scenario is given to the strident Christina Vidal as a fool that Fox believes to be the next big hit. They quickly lock the locking heads, and the dialogue causes them to go back and forth to an uninteresting finish. Fox and Lane are attractive, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to molasses. Slickly produced, but ultimately obsolete. * 1/2 of ****
