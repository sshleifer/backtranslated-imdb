Meltdown opens up a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system designed to deflect asteroids if they are on a collision course with Earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some doubts for him, but the test seems to be an absolute success. Then the asteroid breaks down and the larger piece is pushed to a direct collision path with the earth. Fortunately, the huge stone jumps out of the Earth's outer atmosphere and bounces off space. Unfortunately, the blow of sight is just enough to alter Earth's orbit, and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sun. <br /> <br /> While all of this is happening above their heads, Los Angeles cops Tom (Casper Van Dien) and Mick (Greg Anderson) are at a stakeout. They must collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they're watching quickly turns into a game of fire. Afterwards, Tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local television reporter who is also his girlfriend, Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). At a nearby hospital where Mick is treated for a minor injury, Tom has a brief conversation with his ex-girlfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her that he is worried that his 17-year-old daughter, Kimberly (Amanda Crew) is dating a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). Once Tom explains to Bonnie that he has discovered that CJ has a criminal record, she is a bit worried. <br /> <br /> It does not take too long, however, before everyone has something to worry about. The temperature is rapidly increasing all over the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to learn what's really going on. Nathan, who is his brother, calls her to say that he may have a way of surviving. Carly calls Tom; he, of course, readily contacts Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short time, the heterogeneous group is on the road. Before they can reach their ultimate goal, however, they have to go through gangs of looters, cope with a catastrophic water shortage and be able to travel at temperatures that are high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a handsome guy, and I really liked him in Starship Troopers. This may be because he is good at action scenes. It may also be because he did not say much about that movie. In Meltdown, unfortunately he has only enough lines in situations that are dramatic enough to show his fully mid-range acting skills. Amanda Crew is also fine, and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are also reasonably good, but Venus Terzo is sadly privy to Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a movie, however, is the story and the script. While the story here is fine and really has some real potential, the script is just plain awful. The scientific part of science fiction is non-existent, beginning with the asteroid pushing the Earth out of orbit and climbing with the notion that the "gravitational balance of the solar system" could "pull the Earth back" to its usual orbit " over time ". "When the temperature in LA reaches 120 degrees, the cars start to explode. <br /> <br /> Do you know what is worse than bad science? film are not only wearing long sleeved shirts, but also jackets? Why are people attacking each other for bottled water instead of turning on the taps at home? Why are the streets completely empty, but the highways are completely full? And why are the highways full of unexploded explosives? It is almost superfluous to note that the scenarios, the costumes and the production values ​​were good, especially when this only forces me to say that the issues were not. So basically you give a good idea of ​​history and combine it with a generally mediocre acting, a terrible script, low cost special effects, irrational twists and bad editions, and what do you have? less than and the sum of its unseizable parts. Sorry to say that I can not recommend Meltdown: Days of Destruction to anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: There is mention here that Congress has finally loosened enough resources to fund the trials that start the movie rolling. Although the tests here were totally irresponsible (looking at an asteroid with a nuke and not knowing the composition of big rock is actually far beyond the irresponsible and insane), the fact is that such scenarios pose a very real danger to the planet. Unfortunately, we did not track either close to all the asteroids near Earth that could be worrying in some orbit someday; and our ability to detect something in a collision course with us is limited, at best. <br /> <br /> Once we find out that we will be hit, we literally will not have any system to deal with it. There are no nuclear-tipped space missiles that we can launch; the space shuttle is completely unable to go beyond the Earth's orbit, and if it were, we could not throw enough of them or launch them fast enough for that to matter. I'm not big on government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I certainly think protecting the planet from the destruction coming from us from space can be interpreted as defending the country, right? FAMILY FITNESS: Meltdown: Days of Destruction is classified as R for "some violence". I frankly did not find the violence here anything but a typical typical video game. If your teens are interested in seeing Meltdown and you can not convince them, the R rating should not dissuade you from letting them see. It is not, however, a good idea to leave younger children in the bedroom with older siblings. While the shootings are not very graphics in the main, some of the corpses are.
