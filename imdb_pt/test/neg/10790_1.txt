This film, although well filmed and superbly represented, was horrible. I felt like I was watching a car accident - sure enough I kept watching, but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. Although it fit the tone of the movie, I was expecting something to improve this movie. I still do not understand what references to rage and child are bitten by the fox at the beginning of the movie. Fifteen minutes of plotting really did not do much. It's very sad to see a movie with good actors and a beautiful scenery lost in such a horrible and terrible story. There is not much more to say about this movie. Save time and watch c-span. It will be more edifying.
