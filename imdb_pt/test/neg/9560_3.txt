A tedious gangster movie that leaves you wishing someone else has edited it more ruthlessly. I would have thought that the creation story of Las Vegas would be interesting, but it fails almost every time. Warren Beatty's performance as the stupid and unpleasant Bugsy Seigel leaves you wishing you were watching the other person. Once or twice he goes through the haze of his performance to make an interesting scene, but most of the time you can not care about him. Annette Benning gives a skillful twist as her untrustworthy lover, but even then she is just a little bit tastier than him. <br /> <br /> I would not really bother with this drama, unless you're a devout Benning.
