After a good start, it turned out to be the worst piece of saint than the advertisement I've ever seen. This movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad for not reading the "holy bible". <br /> <br /> To resume the ... OK, let's call it a plot ... Basically aliens do not kidnap people (we already know ..). No, in fact, their demonic forces kidnap people who are into new age or witchcraft, or read pornographic magazines (as a protagonist does). <br /> <br /> It is complete with the little emotional piano music when the main character realizes he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> A quote sums it up, imagine a subtle piano music in the background: "You can not let others, even those you love, prevent you from following Lord .." /> and we should live in an enlightened era ... still working to do. Boycott this piece of crap.
