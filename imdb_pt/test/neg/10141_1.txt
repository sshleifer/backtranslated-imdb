this is really an "ok" series .. all in it are very good. but I just can not take Reba. she's trying to be funny, but she just is not and then she has a stupid accent !! if they took her out of the show I would love to see her every day .. <br /> <br /> I've been watching the show in 10 mins now and like I said before, Reba is destroying the show. However, the 20 year old guy (I do not know his name), but he's soooo funny, and he's really saving everything .. so here's the recipe for a great show. kick Reba at it and then put the 20-year-old in the lead role. <br /> <br /> I really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick Reba from the show and put someone else in the lead role
