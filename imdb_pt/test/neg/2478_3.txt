1) If you want to make a film that deals with social realism, it is very important that the audience identifies with the characters being portrayed. 2) The public can not identify with highly stereotyped characters or with obvious situations. 3) If you have a bad actor then you can not build any character. Either way, even if you have legal actors, their work will be ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jesus Ponce ignores these 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of fashion. Place, place. His script is so predictable: a woman gets out of prison, she knows her old boyfriend hooked, life is hard, etc. Anyway, the fact that the story is anything but original would not be so bad if only Ponce were not complete. Writing and filming incompetently. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long they will continue giving money from our taxes to make movies like that. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 3/10
