Terrible, waste of time. There is no camp or rubbish worth in this. Seen the best amateur films made by children from 10 to 12 years old in movie clubs. <br /> <br /> How can someone spoil movies about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to join some vampire / sadomasochist fans in the same room and just film. <br /> <br /> Nothing good could be found in the movie. There was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. Some overweight Goths touching each other can not be called the sex scene. Absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Well, the cemetery was good, but one should shoot a vampire movie at night. <br /> <br /> The goal was probably good: make a trash movie in the spirit of Ed Wood. The problem is that you can not make a bad movie intentionally. It takes talent and an effort to make a "real" movie. Ed Wood may not have the money, but he certainly had the effort. These guys did not have everything. Ed Wood was a genius compared to these guys.
