I've never seen the original 1930 version of the movie, but this remake is one of the worst I've seen in a major production studio in years. Seeing actors like Meg Ryan and Annette Bening once near a talent level, sleepwalking their way through poorly written roles is painful. There seemed to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play useless roles that have no impact on the plot and do not add value to entertainment. The character of Jada Pinkett Smith is used as nothing more than a trick to look modern, having an African-American lesbian character, but in fact she's there just to look cool. There is no real reason for Messing in this movie besides filling the amount of women in the original I take. <br /> <br /> The supporting characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotyped female characters, with Mendes portraying the fox looking to rob her rich but bored and slightly neglected husband, and Mazar, covering the roles of gossip. <br /> <br /> The film is boring, without charm, humor or sympathy for any character. It looked like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front of or behind the camera. <br /> <br /> There is a shimmering hope in the film, however much it may be allowed to shine surrounded by darkness and dying stars around is Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an incredible talent that brings his charm and humor to the film, in the small role it has.
