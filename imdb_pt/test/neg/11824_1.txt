This movie is an embarrassment. Nothing works at any level. Direction, script, acting, and editing work together to get your eyes off the screen. Everything is inadequate and inconsistent. In the beginning, you can sit and moan, shudder and laugh at it, but very soon all the effort to watch ends up becoming very heavy.
