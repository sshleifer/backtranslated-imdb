A funny thing happened to me while watching "Mosquito": on the one hand, the hero is deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does (mutilating dummies ... er, excuse me, corpses) through their images. On the other hand, the English version, at least, is very poorly dubbed. So I found myself wishing there was so much more And less dialogue at the same time! This movie is stupid (funny how this guy has access to all the cemeteries and morgues in his city) and lugubrious (where would we be in an explorer of the 70's without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!) ... Miss. (*)
