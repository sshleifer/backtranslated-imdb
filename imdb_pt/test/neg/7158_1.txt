The theatricality and drama included in the film are fantastic, but the facts and the research are far from solid. In citing Dr. Bovon, where the documentary attempts to establish a connection with Mary Magdalene of Mariamene, Dr. Bovon then clarifies that it should be used for literary purposes (ie, fables of the time) not for a historical figure. In fact, he claims, he does not believe that the Mariamene ossuary in Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He further comments in his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information about Acts of Philip (a literary work in the fourth century). <br /> <br /> So here we have a director who took a clip to the fourth-century Atos de Filipe fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st-century ossuary inscription. A very sad stretch and Dr Bovon calls the connection Jesus / Mary Magdalene "science fiction" - how this documentary should be properly labeled.
