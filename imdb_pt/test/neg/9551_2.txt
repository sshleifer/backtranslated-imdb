This is one of the Golden Turkey books. It's another of those "putting on a show" flicks. The dialogue is turgid. The music is terrible. The costumes may be the worst of all time. And the choreography of Nick Castle is hilariously terrible. Check out, oh, you guys who love bad movies. Only Perry Como is tolerable.
