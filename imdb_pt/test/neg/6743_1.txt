Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this whole piece of crap, and the only thing worse than watching this movie is seeing it in English class. This is literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. He totally ignores and contradicts any themes he may present, so the story is really very boring. Thank God, the '80s are over, and God saves any man born as "James Bond III."
