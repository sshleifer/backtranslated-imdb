Many actors have a plethora of good film roles in their souls. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> Then there's Linda Blair. "The Exorcist". That's it. <br /> <br /> When you see "Chained Heat" and see Linda Blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was going through your mind. <br /> <br /> Certainly not, "Oh boy: Oscar for Best Actress, here I come!" <br /> <br /> Just one more woman in prison filmed like she used to do for the cheap in the 70's, this one has names that you can recognize. John Vernon plays the dean ... that is, the director (with a hot tub in his office, imagine what he told the contractor?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how bad they needed the job. <br /> <br /> Special mention, of course, to our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil is like Sybil and everything Sybil does is perfect. Makes you forget what awful movie you're watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and one for trying to pass Linda Blair as a sex symbol. Whatever could have possessed them (understood?)?
