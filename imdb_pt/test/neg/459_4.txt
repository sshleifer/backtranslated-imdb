Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire on the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer's captain whose name for a short year has struck terror in the hearts of seamen and merchants from the Caribbean ports to London's trading houses. <br /> <br /> Hmm, that opening for the movie sounds like we're in a hell of a buck, loot, ripper of a movie, is not it? Well, it's not. It is not totally worthless as a piece of curiosity. Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne of the Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story by Herbert Ravenel Sass. The direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photograph. Jean Peters is in the title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and her support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. <br /> <br /> Originally meant to be based on real life pirate Anne Bonny, the movie turns out to be a tale of a woman in search of identity, and finding herself in the world predominantly led by men of piracy and sea-based mischief. Filled with clich√©s and familiar scenes, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely wrong. Peters takes a good look, and Paget illuminates the screen with an effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, though underused, actually looks at the role and does not exaggerate how the rest of the male cast does. Some critics have tried desperately to dive deeper into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it is Tourneur in the steering chair. But there is depth here, this is just a job for Tourneur, a professional granted, but its fine stroke and really lack of swash to go with the buckle in the action bets. <br /> <br /> Disposable at best. 4/10
