... but of course I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Now, I never expected to like the first movie. I'm not sure what's going on with the Disney marketing group, but it seems like every trailer they make for an animated film ends up making me a bit childish, or silly, or stupid, and yet the movies themselves are anything but that. And no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than in The New Emperor's New Groove, which is why I was rather surprised to see myself really enjoying that movie when I finally collapsed and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and left pleasantly entertained. <br /> <br /> Despite Disney's history with direct sequences to video, I still expected a better experience with Kronk here ... but in the end I was nothing but disappointed (and, unfortunately, not exactly surprised that I felt like this). There is almost no humor directed to adults. The original songs are uninspired and cute. The animation, though not bad, still does not come close to the Emperor (who was not a Lion King to begin with). <br /> <br /> The main plot as such is incredibly "minor" and consists mainly of a sequence of mini-story flashbacks - in fact, the most thing looked like a sequence of pilot episodes for one series of cartoons on Saturday morning than a single well-designed entity. David Spade gets about four lines in the entire movie and there's not exactly a lot of John Goodman either, so overall we got a lot of Patrick Warburton's Kronk - which was fun as a minor character in the first movie, but it's completely inappropriate as the main thing. Although the kids might find this a bit of fun, the only thing that Kronk's New Groove could do for me is make me want to go back and watch the original much higher.
