I have a buddy who works in blockbuster, and he gets 5 rentals of free movies a week, so one day while we were scouring the aisles for something interesting, I stumbled on 18 Kung Fu Guns and judging by the box alone, this movie It seemed very crazy, but even so we gave the temptation and rented it - after all, it was free ..... and thank God it was ... this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen ... budget must have been a pickle and a piece of rope ... the plot was ridiculous, the only mention of the "18 guns" is that there is some book that teaches the ways of the 18 guns that some thug is after - and that's it! there is not even one weapon fighting in this movie ... and the action sequences are weak ... 9 times in 10 the other guy's punches and kicks come within 30 centimeters of the other guy's landing, and there are MANY times when film is going to jump frames (the result of a ridiculously bad edition) .... the dubbing is so laughable, and hardly understandable ... and we will not get into acting. ..the end will definitely leave you saying "wtf ??", however, to be fair, I must mention that the fighting techniques used by the actors were a bit decent, and the old man is a crazy idiot .... but it is about this ... fortunately I did not have to pay for this movie but I think at least now I know just how bad a movie can really be ....
