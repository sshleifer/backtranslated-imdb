"The Messengers" directors Danny Pang and Oxide Pang are responsible for "The Eye" and its sequel, and their first American film touches as "The Grudge" -lite on a farm. A family of four moves from Chicago to a race. Sunflower farm in rural North Dakota. Almost immediately her teenage daughter Jess begins to see ghosts. Of course her parents and the police are skeptical. Admittedly the movie is well done and there are two or three effective scares, but she relies too much on 'boo' effect.Still is still a copy of carbon from many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climactic and incredibly horrible.Scares are on the low side too with a trend toward CGI.Overall, "The Messengers" is a very weak horror movie that simply does not deliver 4 out of 10 .
