I've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and I can not do that. But with a movie as bad as Night of the Blood Beast, the plot hardly matters. An astronaut falls and is believed dead. His body later revives, but is found carrying the embryos of a strange form of alien life. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted the strange creatures in Major John Corcoran's body? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the running time for Night of the Blood Beast in 62 minutes. Is this right? 62 minutes? It had to be longer than that. It seemed endless to me. Even with the MST3K comment (which was very funny by the way), the actual movie seemed much, much longer. And it's practically a snoozer from start to finish. I really like those alien invasion movies of the 50s, but not this one. He could not catch my interest on any level. The alien babies were too foolish to be taken seriously, the titular blood beast was pathetic, and none of the characters did anything to me. Add to this Roger Corman's low-budget custom and you have a real loser in a movie.
