Jeff Speakman has never been able to overcome the lower ranks of martial artists who have become actors (smaller than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "The Expert" you can see why. There are three major problems with this film: 1) The plot - or I must say plot - is all over the place, there are some characters that receive a lot of time on the screen, but serve little, 2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total, some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some occurring in the dark, 3) The score is overly zealous and arrogant. Oddly enough, this is really the most annoying thing about this movie: the score tries persistently to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic instead of the limited-budget action movie you're really into watching. With all that said, at least there's James Brolin around to give a touch of credibility. * 1/2 of 4.
