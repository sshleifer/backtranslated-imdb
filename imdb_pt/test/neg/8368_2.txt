I am a big fan of H.P. Lovecraft's books, and Mythos background has generated some good stories and stuff. And in the last few years did some guys come up with films about H. P.'s work? for the most low low movements? and showed them to audiences in places like H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them do not have a big move, but they at least know the heart and soul of Lovecraft's work and films like "Cool Air" or "The Call of Cthulhu" - are what I would think - gifts for the fan base and other loonies who like the creation of HP. <br /> <br /> And there are people like Ivan Zuccon who just rip off the name and create a movie that would have been fun to watch if I'd even driven and filmed with some friends on the beach. That's what Mr. Zuccon did as he seems ... but while guys like the previous Aaron Vanek or Bryan Moore movies may not have moved any further, they somehow still had more to offer, like a story, real characters and some connection with Lovecraft! Just babbling names like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" makes a movie not an adaptation of Lovecraft. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie will not only make Mythos fans shake and hide, but it will not please people who like good movies, 2. laugh at bad movies, 3. love to good movies Severe splatter movies or 4. watch everything that has Horror written on the cover of the DVD. I'm not going to get into the "mound" of this loss of time, as was already discussed by others here on this page, but like I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie I would have done with some nerdy friends. In addition, he lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous "nonsense, but he's art." The movies of this quality are fun to watch, if you know all the guys and ha-ha, see how XY is coughing up the fake blood we made with tomato sauce and stuff ??? but hey, you do not put this on a DVD-carcass, declare it's a real movie and you want money for it? <br /> <br /> I give 2/10 because of what I do not know? effort or something like that
