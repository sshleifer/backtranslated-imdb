Filmed in my old hometown by a university couple, this movie revolves around an aberration called "luther." Luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by a parole board in one of the most laughable scenes of all time), rushes to the local Kroger grocery store by eating the neck of an elderly woman with her metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther runs to the farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties an old woman and is hunted down and killed. Oh, and the SUPERBOY girl gets naked.
