Does anyone care about any of the characters in this movie? "Or what of them?" - I doubt it. That's the key problem - for a tragedy to work, we have to worry about at least one of the characters and none of them inspires any sympathy or seems to have any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> What may have worked in the 16th century certainly does not work in one can assume 'post-apocalyptic Liverpool' if this really was what it was meant to be. The problem is the characters in Liverpool post-apocalyptic, while still driving in cars, using cell phones and watching television, have again spoken in Shakespearean language - with a Liverpool dialect. Oh gosh! It's bad enough for you to think about - but that usually turns into pure spouse - with comments like 'eh lah you a bastard? And that was the announcement of Merseyrail during one of the scenes filmed in the underworld? Well, the good news is that in post-apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still working. <br /> <br /> Characters without exception are poorly drawn, wooden and more like charicatures in the lines of the Joker / Penguin in Batman and Robin. except there is no real plot to speak of - or if it exists - is one that does not work in a modern setting, where half the sets are dark and "Blade Runnerish" and the other half are blazing fluorescent or just normal 21st century. Costumes are also mixed with half wearing their clothes every day (Parkers are great in apocalyptic Liverpool post - apparently) and the other half wearing leftover costumes from a fancy party? <br /> <br /> The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most inane way imaginable - the tragedy is that this movie was made in everything. <br /> <br />
