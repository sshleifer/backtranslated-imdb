The script is the worst part of this movie, as it goes from one premise to another, losing all the important bits that would have made possible several different stories. (This movie is confusing because the audience does not know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low production values ​​and the acting was not great, but this is television, so that was okay. I do not care if some scenes seem to have been made at once. But having a not-so-sensitive script is completely unnecessary. Has any executive really read before disbursing the money? Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> The particular prologue was so poorly written that it needed a narration to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed, it was not clear what was happening, that is. The Russian Revolution was reduced to "some riots are happening in Petersburg", with the next scene being the soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution, to be able to fill in the details "those annoying Communists." The prologue is best ignored. <br /> <br /> This could have been a careful study of a person who is confused about who she is. Establishes this premise in asylum. I could then have her struggling to identify with the rest of the movie. No. The film assumes that it is who it says it is (even though there is no empirical evidence yet). This creates a melodramatic romance, a love so strong, that will believe anything she says. Okay, a love affair. No, because it does not make sense. Loving interest looks like a lunatic crazed (and incidentally scornful), exploding in wild gestures. This also does not work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue in the end. They never got married and she went back to America. The love story collapses. Although there were many love scenes, I was never convinced of the reason they were in love. I find the rom-com novels more convincing, although there are only one or two scenes that establish that they spent some time together. <br /> <br /> It could have been a suspenseful thing where the film assumes that it is who it says it is, and it strives to prove its identity. No, the judicial process is summarized instead of treated. The bizarre voice comes back, again to fill in the details of a better movie. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a madwoman who went to America and married another madman and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behavior. None of this in the movie either. There is a really annoying character in the asylum who comes out of nowhere and announces himself as an informant of the type "A Fleece about the Next / 'Twelve Monkeys." Luckily, it disappears, having brought nothing to the story.
