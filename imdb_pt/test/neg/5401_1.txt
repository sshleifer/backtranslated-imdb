I saw this on Sci Fi, and in retrospect, I'm not sure how I actually got to watch until the end. This is total crap. It's not a B movie, it's a "D movie" at best. <br /> <br /> Basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse (and sometimes not in one) is killing everything on its way somewhere in the Midwest of America. A load of people is missing (actually killed) and a bunch of different types of specialized op soldiers will go after them. The best part of this movie, I'll tell you now, there are some very cute girls. Let me now ruin this by telling you that everyone less the less handsome have their heads cut, cut, or hit so hard with a full body gun that the head explodes. That's no spoiler ... The blood in this movie is overblown and really grotesque. It also serves no real purpose. <br /> <br /> Here's what's good: the sets look OK, the actors sometimes act OK, the costumes and accessories, some of them, are decent. <br /> <br /> Everything else you can think of, sucks. Much of the evil is in the issue. Sometimes it just goes from a fast-action scene to a real, silent, inactive scene. Sometimes the characters do things that are not understandable and are always separating, but not in a way that the viewer can follow. It seems they separate without noticing each other but they also all seem to know that they are separating all the time and are okay with it even if they are in a really dangerous situation and there are bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left. Nothing in this movie is the least plausible, most is incoherent and confusing, and I do not really understand how this immortal, indestructible killer bandit was able to be stopped in the end, and frankly, I do not care. Very stupid, hilariously nonsense happens during this movie and I really do not mind listing everything here. And they're all so serious throughout the ordeal when it's almost ridiculously bad ... just awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete waste of time. There's no excuse to watch this unless the only channel you get is the SciFi and you're stuck in a chair in front of the TV. But if you're not stuck, it's best to crossword, play a frisbee or just think. There are many better B movies you can watch. <br /> <br /> My senior year in high school, my friend and I, in visual communication and renowned class, we made a long contract for the film (There was no full film, just a very long trailer) and we did a work better to film and edit the part with debut. It was better work than this movie. That really says something about it and I'm intrigued and worried about why Sci Fi shows something like this when there are so many good low-rated movies that they can show. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've ever endured that was worse than that is Raptor Island (another brilliant SciFi work), although it had a smoother and more followable flow than this movie, but that comes very close and it's definitely the second on my list of the worst movies I've ever seen.
