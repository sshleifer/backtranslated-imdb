Continuing in the sequence of "stalker / slasher" flicks in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride", etc., comes "Rest Stop". The simplest and useless of them all. <br /> <br /> We began, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a beautiful young woman in a filthy bathroom. <br /> <br /> This is where our interest is lost. We then moved to the clich√© couple, on their way to Los Angeles, with their eyes on stardom. . . That, by making films like this, they will never succeed. <br /> <br /> From the sexual play in the park, the couple heads, arguing all the way, to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom. Harmless enough until she leaves and finds her missing boyfriend and realizes she's being chased by a lame version of Joy Ride's Rusty Nail. . . only driving in "Cars" Mater. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if this had been directed / written / produced / represented by anyone else, it could have been quite good. But not. <br /> <br /> Because then comes the ghost story. Yes. . . You guessed. Plenty of "oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait for this stalker is a person, monster or ghost?" <br /> <br /> But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? That brother of Lawerence. Great. We are saved. (sarcasm) Oh wait, no, we're not. <br /> <br /> You know. . . if you want to laugh in a very bad way, or if you can get free rentals like me, give it a try. <br /> <br /> If you want, you will learn how NOT to make a movie. <br /> -AP3-
