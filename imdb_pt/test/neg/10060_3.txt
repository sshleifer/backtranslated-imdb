This movie is on my list of the worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is happening or the reason for the actions of the characters. All the movies need to have an internal logic, and this movie simply does not have it - the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Watching Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick squandering their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one because she plays the victim and is dead at the beginning of the movie. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be an incredible actor because he manages to look good, despite bad direction and poor writing; his performance is believable and he manages to remain in the character after all. <br /> <br /> If Lady Agatha Christie were alive, she would die of laughter! The movie is so bad!
