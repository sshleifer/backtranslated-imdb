Larry Bishop directs, writes and leads this softcore porn, draws fewer movies about motorcyclists who have nothing to do with anything. To call this one of the worst films of 2008 is to be kind to the trash I spent money in theaters. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I felt sorry for the girls, most of the time, who probably think they're making a feature film when they're actually making a porn movie. They walk on set for four days, say some sexual phrases to disgusting old men - thirty years older than them - then take their cloths and run naked for the four days they are on set. I can only assume that this was Larry Bishops's only way to sex. You see shot after shot directly at the girls asses. Shot after Bishop shot walking to a random girl and grabbing his most intimate parts, as if he was shaking his hand. How this crap was even funded is beyond me. Why Tarantino got his name in that is beyond me, but he's been fading slowly since 1994, so I can not say I was surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, you have that terrible feeling that only horrible (and I mean horrible) movies give you. When you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is magnified. After 15 minutes, I wanted to cry for being so stupid and wasting not only my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. There is no redeeming quality, or a moment in the movie that creates any kind of reaction or shows any kind of inclination that these people have any idea of ​​what they are doing. If you do not see naked women so often, then I think this movie would be for you. If you are eleven years old, you will probably like it. You can not even laugh at this, because every idiot doing this was laughing about the crap they were doing. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the production is horrible and the direction is awful. Nor is it worth your while renting to see the car accident. Stay away, stay very far away. You should not be reading these comments. I should not even be writing one.
