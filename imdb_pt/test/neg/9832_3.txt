The Girl on Lovers' Lane: 3 of 10: Homoerotic subtext in movies is a well known phenomenon. Many dissertations have come out of film schools about hidden subtexts in films like Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover's Lane certainly fits the homoerotic trope. In fact, it is so blatant and exaggerated that not even the MST3K, who rarely notes such things in their riffs, simply can not avoid it. <br /> <br /> The movie is about two drifters. A rich kid (Lowell Brown) running away from home with a hundred bucks and no street smarts, the other is a professional bum (Brett Halsey). The vagabond saves the child from a gang of thugs and they end up in a small town consisting of a restaurant, a billiard room and a brothel. Our careless scholar gets a second glance from the restaurant waitress (Joyce Meadows as the starter girl on Lovers Lane) who clearly has passed the age of being picky and whose only other perspective is the weird Jack Elam making an impression of Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> On the surface, it looks like a strange film for MST3K treatment. While the cast is old for the characters they are playing, the acting is really very good, with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam giving solid performances. The story is small, but hardly the material "Robot vs. Mummy Aztec" and the production figures are very cheap but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> It's the weird Batman and his homosexual tendencies that make this movie both horrible and hilarious. Halsey's biggest objections to children attempting to get laid at the ranch are hilarious, their inability to compromise with the waitress (or at least pass from first base) and the dozens of looks between him and the boy; a hand on the shoulder, the sleeping arrangements, blowing dates with the girl so he and the child can shave. You do not have to be Freud to discover this tendency.
