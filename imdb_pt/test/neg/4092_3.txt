The biggest problem with this movie is that it's nothing like Bruce Allmighty. The first movie played with each dreamer's fantasy of being able to control the environment as they see fit. Evan's experience is totally different. He has no control that Jim Carrey tricks, and instead, the story revolves around the power of belief. Now that would have been good, since the first movie was preaching the same message. The problem is that continuation is a preaching at the expense of comic relief. And to add insult to injury, this also puts the politics in the plot. You have the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this movie, and your main goal is not to make you laugh. In short, this film is a failed mix of Eddie Murphy's "The Distinguished Gentleman," and Charlton Heston's "The Ten Commandments." I'm not sure if Steve Carrell is guilty here, you get the feeling that it's your character that limits his abilities as a comedian, former anchor Evan Baxter should not be funny, he's basically an antagonist turned protagonist which, in this case, it only adds to the confusion about what this movie message should be.
