I could not even ... I mean ... look ... okay ... <br /> <br /> Wow. <br /> <br /> Not even a lot of my drunken friends trying to make fun of the movie could have fun in a little bit. <br /> <br /> I can only think ... how. How do independent filmmakers everywhere go through unnoticed years (or even their lives) and with artists like the guy who made it have a DVD on a shelf? It looks like a guy with a home movie camera came out with some guys he met on Subway and did the worst thing he could think of. <br /> <br /> "Hey guys, give me some ideas. Start with a corn field and work backwards." "Well, you have to have actors right after high school, and some broken corn stalks with pieces of clothing stuck in. And breasts." Thanks, man, I'm sure you and Windows Movie Maker will be side by side on your next eagerly anticipated project.
