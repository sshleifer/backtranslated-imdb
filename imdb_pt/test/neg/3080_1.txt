Committed stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). It is the story of Joline, who is determined to find the ex-husband who is in the midst of a middle-aged crisis. <br /> <br /> Committed was not at all what I expected to lack comedy that ended up being the genre. It was beyond stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck performed reasonably well, Graham's recent roles were lacking in brilliance and this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Graham's latest role was blessed which I also found to be misleading and did not appeal to me at all. <br /> <br /> Pros Affleck <br /> <br /> Cons Predictable, unrealistic, bad acting and not a comedy movie!
