This was something I was eager to see. The Ultimate Avengers films had surpassed my expectations and as Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters, I thought that the same production team would be able to do really good things with an Iron Man solo title. final movie was unsatisfactory. I did not expect them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to Iron Man's gray armor. The red and gold armor is seen for about ten minutes. It's not a major complaint, but not what I expected from the ads and the cashier. The worst thing, though, was the story, the acting and the CGI animation shadowed by cells for the monsters and the Iron Man armor that was not convincing. It did not go well with the cell animation. Even by itself, it looks like a bat and lifeless. Tony Stark's character arc, as unbelievably slow as it takes, is so forceful and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man, but after forcing myself through the movie I wondered if they could not have done something that had been as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
