Wow, I was told it would be a B movie that would be worth watching. I feel like I was cheated after seeing this preview event. The plot is a distorted version of several movies at best. Even the title is a scene from another movie, if you can give much credit to the movie. I'm sorry to say I was taken to the cleaning. I would not waste your time on this. This movie seems to be a bunch of aspirants who got together and made a bad idea of ​​a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment business, I can judge a decent movie and it deserves to be archived or discarded. My advice, stick to a classic like The Dawn of the Dead 1979. On a scale of 1 to 10, even a 1 is good for the producers because this movie SOPRA. (Below the limit of what sucks) Producers need to keep their jobs during the day. If you see the movie, please be honest in your post, this seems to have been overdone and inflated by some. There are some who saw this for what it is and posted correctly. Sorry, but, I must say this is one to be ignored.
