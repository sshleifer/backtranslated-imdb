I'm sorry, but this really looks like a modern imitation of Apollo 13. Totally implausible (at least Armageddon FELT like a comic book! It looked like a bad high school movie project), acting was as clich√© as one can get, and .. .. landing a space shuttle on an expressway in Los Angeles? Let's go. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the cliches: the pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in the way of everyone, the robust manager of "Go Fever." And one thing is to twist the laws of physics, politics or whatever to create a fun story, but at least make it GOOD! Fact and science were totally massacred by this. The shuttle does not have fuel tanks on its wings, and even if that happened, it could not divert fuel between them (and not even a DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you like bad acting, bad stories, low realism and cheesy cliches, this can not be surpassed!
