This show is pathetic. I can not even begin to imagine how someone with an IQ greater than that of a can of pea soup that has passed its expiration date can willingly sit through this litter for a full half hour. It's one of those rare shows that is so frighteningly awful in every respect that you can honestly say that it's less intelligent just by watching it. I conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show. This only misses for another Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and virtually a draw with Girls Will Be Girls. The VIP keys owe each and every one of us an apology. Whenever I watch this farce of a show, I feel sad for society. How is it allowed to continue?
