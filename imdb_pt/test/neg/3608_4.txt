The New Groove of the Emperor was a great touch for Disney. It was not a musical! He had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's Groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My 3 year old son still loves Emperor's New Groove, but fell asleep during Kronk's. There really is not really any conflict (which in the first movie leads to all the crazy adventures). Because of the lack of conflict, it almost seems that the animators expelled the writers and finished making the plot as they continued. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for something to happen to make the movie fun. . . and still am.
