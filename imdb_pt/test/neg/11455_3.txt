Cimarron was painful to sit on. Although Irene Dunn does a good job with the heavy script, Richard Dix's pompous and exaggerated role is brutal. The passage of time has not dealt well with Isaiah's character as well as other racial and religious notions, although the film is somewhat progressive about the roles of women and the mistreatment of Native Americans. The issue is especially weak. This is undoubtedly the worst of all "best" images.
