Shemp learns that he will inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Considering how hideous he looks and his personality, it is no surprise that he does not get a taker - that is, until an article appears in the article explaining his situation - and at that point five crazed women appear from nowhere to claim their new husband more money, of course). <br /> <br /> Although I do not hate the Three Stooges and enjoy watching their shorts from time to time, they never, not even on their best day, came close to Buster Keaton's brilliant comedy. That's why I did not like this movie, since it was a copy of the plot of Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With the Stooges, it was not uncommon for Columbia Pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle old Stooge shorts. So from the outset, this film is a pale imitation of an original. It is also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the jokes usually seem very forced (particularly the phone booth scene). The cousin Basil bit, however, was pretty cute and funny - albeit far from subtle! However, the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion. In Keaton's version, hundreds of women seemed to marry him and the action became very fast and furious - here, everything remained in a small room and lacked comic joke - ending in a failure. <br /> <br /> Overall, a dull retread. Also, before you mark this comment "it is not useful", be sure to see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I'm talking about - then you decide.
