This is the scariest movie ever made in Hollywood. It is a warning tale of how to take a European masterpiece and suck its life up to be a dry shell like an insect carcass on the window sill. Scary because it reveals how the Hollywood world really works: ignorant money generating scum. It makes me wonder how many great films could populate the corridors of my memory if the Hollywood process had not directed them to forgettable mediocrity. Cry for the murdered children! See Spoorloos or read The Golden Egg, if you have the courage, because they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life: when you are walking down the street and you see a "disappeared" poster; in common parking lots; when you hear the Tour De France on the radio; and especially when you think "what is evil?" in wearing a sock with a hole in a perfectly ordinary day. <br /> <br /> If I could give it a zero.
