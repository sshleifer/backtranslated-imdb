As another reviewer, I really wanted to like this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and promoter of classical music, but none of us could bear this movie. I would not even call it a movie. A better description may be a record of some chamber concert pieces. As far as I can remember, the camera never moved. Instead, I just sat on a tripod for the totality of each piece. The only attempts of dramatic effect were at the end of each play, when the movie cut to trees swaying in the wind or small ripples hitting a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to have used really large wave images, but the best he could find was a few inches high in some nearby pond, and again using a stationary camera. Truly pathetic. I can not imagine how anyone could justify rating this film above five. When we left, my father and I were completely confused about how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I do not know any good films about Bach. The world really needs one, but just because it does not exist is not a reason to see this. Someone's going to do someday. Until then, just continue to re-watch _Amadeus_.
