In the aftermath of September 11 in New York, this drama about American firefighters was designed as a greeting and a tribute to their professionalism. The story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) fell on the floor of a burning building, and only communicate with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta) through the radio. The flashbacks basically show how Jack is a recruit, seeing Kennedy as a paternal figure, as a fire department legend. Of course, these days Jack's fellow firefighters are trying to catch up with him, but it's too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and directs him to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best. firefighters they know. Also starring Jacinda Barrett as Linda Morrison, Robert Patrick of Terminator 2 as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The flames of the movie are, in short, everything I could watch and enjoy watching the characters deal with them, the rest is a bit too talkative for my liking. Suitable!
