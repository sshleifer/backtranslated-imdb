Even though I've sat and watched the whole thing, I must say it was not good. It was everywhere, with large pieces of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at times as well. If you do not know anything about Michael, you will not understand a thing. You have to rely on your current knowledge of man so that some pieces make sense. Acting was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander did not look like Michael at all, which was disheartening for me and by the end he literally looked gray. saying that playing Michael as a naive, but highly positive, kind and loving individual was fine, although they still did so from time to time. If you want to watch MJ's story, check out "An American Dream". "It's much better, but the only thing is that it will cover up to the" Bad "era. I have no doubt that they will eventually make a great movie about Michael's life story because Michael You rock ;-) !!! !
