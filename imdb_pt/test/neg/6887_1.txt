I think when people say that this is filmed beautifully, they are talking about the close-ups of frogs and the preparation of meals. Certainly does not refer to the set which seems to consist of about 3 rooms without external photos. Also all of this is filmed very closely. <br /> <br /> I got sick of the little boy who is farting with Miu or spilling hot wax on the ants ... also the Vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their hips. ? Kind of rude, at least the way the movie portrays it - a close-up of it would have been a dozen or so. <br /> <br /> So, finally comes part two ... a girl movie for Vietnamese girls with the handsome rich rich man who spends all day playing the piano (he's cultured). The beautiful maid steals it like the forbidden green mango. Deep. <br /> <br /> Except for some good close-ups, this movie is a failure. It is a kind of novel without dialogue. She's sick. How beautiful is that? The set looks completely fake. <br /> <br /> No, do not make the mistake I made and rent it because someone recommended it. I was expecting beautiful pictures of the coastal mountains of Vietnam or something like that when I knew it was a visual gem. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I like foreign movies until I prefer them. But this movie is dumb and bland. It will annoy you that something like this has won a lot of awards.
