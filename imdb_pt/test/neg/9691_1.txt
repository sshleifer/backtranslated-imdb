This is the most inaccurate and shameful Bible film I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I wondered why anyone on earth might like to see this. I'm so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight would agree to act in this shameful garbage. Many people who may not have read the Bible now will be deceived into believing that this film was accurate and that the thought of it really bothers me. I think manufacturers have a lot to answer. What's worse is, I do not think anyone could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical movie, since they can search the Bible for the truth, so I believe that the creators deliberately distort what the bible says, and that's something no one has. right to do and I find this very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about it.
