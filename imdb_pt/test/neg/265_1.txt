Ocean's Twelve: just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> An assault on art. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and a very slow development idea. That's why I characterize a movie that I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Do not get me wrong, you may like it. But I just like Ocean movies because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 is not about Heist, then what's the point of seeing it? Happy Soderberg saw his main mistake and redeemed himself, making a film far superior to the first. Congratulations on that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. In addition to his hit "Sex lies and videotapes" ... nothing else happened very well in this director's career. What a shame for him. But his fault only.
