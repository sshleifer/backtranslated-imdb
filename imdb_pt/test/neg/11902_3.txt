This is a bad movie, since its core message is very confusing and the plot seems to have been the result of merging several different scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense and is certainly not a movie that Miss Dunne or Huston should have been proud to do. However, it's worth watching the movie if you're a fan of "Pre-Code" movies, as it features an incredibly sleazy plot that says girls are good - even if they're not married and even if their partner is !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker helping troops heading to Europe for World War I. In the process, she encounters a scalpel (Bruce Cabot) who eventually persuades her to sleep with him. She gets pregnant and he then passes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does not want him back because she realizes he is not worth it, but later her baby dies in childbirth. Although all of these controversial elements are used, they are always alluded to - almost as if they wanted the adults in the audience to know, but they hoped that, if they expressed it or shot it right, the children in the audience would have no idea (after all, have been sorted and children can watch any movie right now). <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this whole plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the movie. and is never mentioned again or alluded to. It was as if they were filming part of a movie and abandoning it - putting it in yet another movie. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly starts working in a female prison (though we really never see her doing anything there). What we see are innumerable horrific scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to excite. And as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne makes a crusade to clear the prison and becomes a famous reformer and writer. <br /> <br /> But then, out of nowhere, another kind of movie comes along. and the business of reforming women's prisons is oblivious. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married, but he desperately wants her. Now, throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl - despite having had unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less deceived). But now, the only Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady, begins to sleep with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are strangers and are married only in name, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with her safety, strip her clothes and they are on the baby doing business! BUT, while she is pregnant with her son's love, he is indicted for being a corrupt judge. He assures her that he is innocent but he is doomed and it sure looks like he is a scoundrel - using inside information from people who came before his bank to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to free him and promises to wait with the child until Huston is released. The movie then ends. <br /> <br /> So, we basically have three separate films and a bizarre 30's idea of ​​what a cool girl should be. I understood that she should be a hard-working working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positive aspects about Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the movie. A strong advocate of women's rights can easily take offense at how weak and needy she was, and religious people can see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspicious! With a decent rewrite, this could have been a good movie or at least interesting as a lascivious and lascivious movie but could not decide what it wanted to be and it was just another tedious pre-encoding movie.
