Did you think after "Traumschiff Surprise" that the German comedy can not get worse? You can. This comedy is yet another attempt to perpetuate stereotypes of masked gay men as a good comedy. The initial concept (openly gay men in soccer sports) would have been a great opportunity to erase some stereotypes, but ... The real message of the film seems to be in what way gay men are so different from heterosexual men. Absolutely silly, of course. Even gay sex is treated as being of less value than straight sex. This film only tries to serve the general public, wanting to laugh about stereotyped gays. Well, do not waste your time on German comedy movies!
