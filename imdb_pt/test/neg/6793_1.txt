This show is the worst show ever! Norris and his family write, produce, direct, etc. etc. The only reason I see this is because my goofy wife likes this. How many times can Norris fly through the air in the sight of everyone to give a kick to an obviously blind villain? No trees, no building, just whoosh ..... thin air. It ALWAYS resolves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is. No star can get the glory. It's all Norris. It's really apparent that Norris is terribly stuck on himself and will not let anyone invade him in any scene, no matter what the content. Terrible acting, terrible script, terrible series.
