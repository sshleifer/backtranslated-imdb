the reason I gave this movie at 4 was for a few reasons, but this movie was not so bad. First, the issue that I found was also very poor at times, the script (or what they had of one) was not very good, and if it was not for Nunzio La Bianca, acting would have sucked. but all this aside (ha ha I know it's like the whole movie) is not so bad for an extremely low ind. , low budget film. If they had made more money, actors a little better (but those were intimidating, so it was good) and a script a bit more detailed, this movie would be great. Someone has to tell me that this guy was very influenced by the warriors by Walter Hill. I want to say that this movie is just like that. Anyone who has seen both movies will agree with me.
