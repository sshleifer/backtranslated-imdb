It may be that the film I saw is totally different from the one the others saw, however, because the actors are the same, I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe differed from that which circulates in the USA. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that was the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. (Followed closely by Waterboy ...) Because: Because in my opinion, this director took elements of all the thriller that preceded this one, mixed them up, put him in the wrong order with the wrong song and published. <br /> <br /> (Examples: Nothing is happy, the music is scary, and yet nothing is happy.) The "rancid" officer poked us in a way that would let the actor disapprove of any kind of acting. which comes out of nowhere in the end.There is an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone.) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a clever movie: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller: see any suspense that comes to mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing.
