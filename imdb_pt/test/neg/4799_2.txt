The bipolarity of this movie is maddening. At one point he is making fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other who wants to touch, with burned villages and orphans. Even the serious revolutionary hero, becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point. But the comedy parts are not even funny, because it's so obviously stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a rogue with a heart of gold. Add to this stereotypical effects of sounds, Latin Americans who speak English with each other and a villain who simply disappears from history. And what is the purpose? It is basically revolutionary propaganda without resolution and without planning (because there is no way these people lead a country). The US government is a villain, but who's going to make money by producing it? Not a poor farmer, of course.
