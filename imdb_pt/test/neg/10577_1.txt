This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I was not at the movies, my two young cousins ​​(who also thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as I thought), I would have left the cinema. There were two points in the film that I almost laughed at, but the rest was either boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a farce in all superhero movies (which I love), but it was actually mostly based on Spider-Man, with some oblique references to other superhero movies like Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie. Do not waste your money on this movie - there are many other better movies out there!
