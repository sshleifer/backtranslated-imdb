I'm a Boorman fan, but this is undoubtedly his least successful film. Comedy has never been his strong point, and here his snappy farce attempts are made awkwardly. Still, it is worth to see Boorman's eye of talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first roles, and as always she is sweeping to behold. (On a sad side note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
