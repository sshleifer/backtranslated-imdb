But again, what is always? I picked it up at my local 99cent store for, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). I remember seeing it on video as a teenager and thinking it was a cool movie. Too bad the movie and my memories do not match. Regardless, it's not a very horrible way to blow up a few hours, and it's cool to see some vintage Bill Paxton and Mark Hamill. Blah .... Blah .... Blah .... Dude, oh man, I can not think of anything else to say about this movie ... (Just filling the space to meet the ten line rule ... ) Good golly, this is pathetic, how bad is this movie that the best I could do in relation to it were five text frickin'lines? Anyway, ten lines of text, right? Hmmm, ten lines are hard to find when you can not remember anything about a movie you just watched.
