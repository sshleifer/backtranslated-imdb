Tom is about to eat a delicious Jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey comes down and leaves with his snack. Not too happy to have his sarnie stolen under his nose, Tom comes out in pursuit, determined to retrieve his pet. <br /> <br /> As much as I love Tom and Jerry, I have to say that this one is a bit stinky: the story is quite mundane; introduces an ill-conceived peripheral character who has no charm; and flogs the old 'dress up cartoon character as a woman' gag until death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, 'Flirty Birdy' rivals 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for the title of weaker Tom and Jerry caper by now.
