I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" flicks with bad dialogs and wood acting. So I've spoiled my brain to come to one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. I can not. You would be hard-pressed to mount a larger piece of cr * p than this Bruce Willis vehicle. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of "Super Drillers". "flying to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth.Realist? Not really.But who cares? It's an action movie.I'm not blowing up the premise. Bruce Willis is the tough-guy leader of the team, and spends his first time on the screen chasing Ben Affleck with a weapon for the unforgivable act of <br /> <br /> The team is called because they are the only people around the world who can punch the asteroid. Okay, I'm prepared to accept this premise if it brings us to action - the supposed flesh of the movie. More moody attempts, with each character coming out to do some crazy things before taking off. It's where the movie really got me. They get on the rock and start working har. You'd believe, nothing works right and everything has a suspense countdown !!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... um - Oh, surprise surprise, we save the day again !! <br /> <br /> And do not even tell me about spasmodic camera work. When I saw him at the movies, I thought he was sick. I can only assume that they were trying to cover up the gigantic holes left by the insipid performances by hacking to a different shot every few seconds (and that from someone created on MTV - Mr. short attention span himself). /> Just when I thought it could not get any worse ... wait - there's a finished tearjerker manufactured that was so stuck on it made the rest of the movie a virtual Kane Citizen. <br /> <br /> Summary: The jokes were not witty. The plot - well, I said I'd let it go. The acting was bad. Too bad. Even Billy Bob could not rise above the script, which was worse. Camerawork - again, bad. (I did not even mention the dumbest love scene in movie history - think of animal crackers). Rating: 1 out of 10. (I'm giving half a point to Steve Buscemi, which makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times when I was able to look at the lovely Liv Tyler and try to ignore his acting performance) This is by far the worst movie I went to see in the theater. .. ever.
