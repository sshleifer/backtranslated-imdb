Small spoilers <br /> <br /> First of all I must say how rare and charming it is to find a movie with basic messages: nuclear war will inevitably destroy all civilization, and women are to make babies. It is absolutely amazing how well formulated the plot is to hit those two points, as with a golden hammer. Essentially, everything about this movie bothered me. Casual sexism, the character whose only feature came from Texas, the mysterious choice of dying orange from Mars and, of course, the faulty science of it all. Then the Martian woman screaming as if she had just realized she was blind? What was that? However, I will give you credit. The fifties spit out some more stupid things. But not much...
