Now I've seen it all. Just when I thought I could not be more pathetic and tacky than the "Woodchipper Massacre," just when I thought that dialogue and acting could not get any worse than the "Black Weapons Massacre," just when I thought "No. Among Woods "would retain his title as the weaker horror film of all time, along with" THE LAST SLUMBER PARTY! "Somehow, this cheap and miserable manure manages to avoid lust but remains terrible! I could not believe my eyes - for the first time I can not complain about excessive nudity (or, in this case, any) in a horror movie, but still managed to leave me crimson for shame for renting it. Never before have I seen such horrible acts, dialect, direction, writing ... I could go on forever with this list! Here's a quick summary: <br /> <br /> A mental patient somehow escapes the hospice, dresses up as a surgeon, somehow discovers where his doctor lives, and invades while the doctor's daughter is having friends for the night. Then begins the most stupid killing (ripped off from other films like "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Halloween") on this side of the universe.The characters have negative IQs, which suggests they are not humans.Then again, I think they are not since they have the tendency to bleed Kool-Aid when they are cut, as the slasher likes to show when he holds his scapular to the camera in WAY many scenes.It is only 80 minutes ... how many times should We look at that sapa so before consuming the whole movie? ... what I suppose would not be so bad in that case!! There was a time when I thought maybe, just maybe, the director make it interesting (a second killer was added), but unfortunately it was not meant to be! And then to insult even more, there is a stupid sub-conclusion super cop-out and a final conclusion even more stupid.Make a lot of sense but I would hate to give the most stupid scenes in history from the movies to those two or th ree fools (like me) dumb enough to rent this sewer. <br /> <br /> I hope that by writing this, I have saved 80 minutes of someone's life. I get on my knees to beg someone who still thinks about renting this: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE NO! This is a fan of the talking slasher genre; I know what's good for you! The only real victims in this silly, asshole nonsense are the poor idiots who sat through the entire toilet tank! Zanatos's score ... since there is no scale of negative points, I have to give a 1, but one below the average 1 in that. Avoid at all costs .... please !!!!
