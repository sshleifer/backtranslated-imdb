those people, who told me "this movie is good", look at them! this movie is for an audience, who has no trouble watching everything {especially when it comes to tough guys, guns, chase and robberies}. film with "The Inside Man" (the same loss of time). I'm tired of copying and pasting movies. And I'm unhappy, but what can I do? Fans of this kind of movies are so much more ... if you want to watch such a good movie, I recommend you "Lucky Number Slevin". I'm not bad, I just do not like this movie {weak actors, weak script, weak action}. probably someone else will like it. many people's tastes. WHO'S FOR ME "CHAOS" IT'S CAUGHT!
