Have you ever watched a movie when, after its conclusion, your left pondered what the world was about? Well, say hello to "Scream, Baby, Scream". It's not that the story is complex or something, it's just that it unfolds in three completely different ways ... 1. A fun drug movie from the 60s ... 2. A very exaggerated novel ... and 3. a horror movie (with very little to "Scream" about). To my surprise, I discovered that it was written by one of my all time favorites, Larry Cohen. Well, I think even the best have to learn through trial and error. <br /> <br /> Playing much like something from H.G. Lewis (only with less fx), this "bad" movie has its advantages. For most of the time, there is a cool jazz track to be heard, and there are some memorable scenes ... one of which is where a group of kids decide to try the acid and take a long bike ride. To the zoo. The camera tricks the director uses to indicate that his hallucinatory state is simply retarded, but fun. Trust me when I tell you that there is no need to run out of the house to get this one!
