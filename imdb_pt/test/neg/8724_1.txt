This is the "Battlefield Earth" of the miniseries. He has, with some exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that have condemned the film and will follow him to the grave in the turkey graveyard. Both are book adaptations with an endless amount of pages that have been turned into a complete mess by a screenwriter and a director (in this case, they are the same person) who clearly do not know what they are doing, either have an aspiring messiah who does not really delivery, like a hero (played in this case by a guy who looks like Mark Hamill, but unfortunately the force is not with him.) and a bunch of stupid thugs who like to betray and mess up the life of each other, both are containing scenes stolen from better productions and both are cheap productions that try to look expensive with some computer animations (usually poorly made). The exceptions that really make the whole thing worse is the awful work done by the guy in the lighting who does not even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room, camera work that for no reason at times is tilted Battlefield Earth mode, but most of the time are plans like a pancake, the extremely cheap and small set of desert that only contains a pile of sand in front of a scenery painted as a desert, which becomes very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea of ​​the costume designer is to try to imitate the "fifth element" fashion madness with the addition of the silly hats already made. Silly moments to remember: 1. All scenes with the guild faces, which look like the MST3K observer faces, but with silly hats. 2. Irulan appears at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (Why Butterflies? - Was that with parrots in the cleaner?) Combining with a silly hat, along with two guys with idiot balloon hats. 3. Paul, the stand-up comedian. 4. Baron Harkonnen in overdrive, shouting "I am alive". 5. Each scene with the backdrop, because newer fits in the foreground 6. All scenes with the false religious ceremonies of the Fremen, especially the "water of life" ceremony. 7. The battle scenes in which the same faces are killed sometimes and the same things explode again and again. It's a lot more, but it's a limit of 1000 words on that, so I better stop before you let me take it.
