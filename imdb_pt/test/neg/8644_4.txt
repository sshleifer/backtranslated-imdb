William Petersen (that guy from C.S.I) has a small uncredited role, but it's the best part of the movie. His character is clever and difficult, and it's a fun surprise to see him there. It has a range that lets you play just about anything. After your 5 minutes, it goes from seeming cool to nothing much. This leaves you waiting for your character to reappear in the movie, but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The movie itself is very poor. It's worth watching TMN or picking up at the library, but not much else. A lot of this reminds you of L.A Confidential, except that where this movie starts to get complicated, it's so loose, that it drives everywhere, but where it should. 5 out of 5 stars
