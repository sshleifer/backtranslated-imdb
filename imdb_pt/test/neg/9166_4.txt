Something of disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union boss of Roxton Garments in New York. His business partner is killed when an elevator is released and plunges twenty-seven floors down the pit in the most scary scene of the movie. Cobb does not know this, or let it be known, but the man behind the murder is Richard Boone, who protects the trade union business. <br /> <br /> So Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, returns from determined Europe to learn the business and join him. his father in a clean shop. He is shocked - shocked! - to know that Boone has beaten the union members and killed some who irretrievably irritated. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers who is killed by two Boone henchmen, led by Wesley. Addy Loggia leaves behind a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews, understandably and decently, engages. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cobb pays for his self-deception, Addy and Boone get their fair deserts, and Mathews winds with the juicy Scala, after which an opera house is named. <br /> <br /> There is no brilliance in any line of dialogue. A couple of lines are textually stolen from "On the Waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you'll speak right inside the grave." The plot is schematic and contains no surprises. The direction of Vincent Sherman is pedestrian. The photograph is flat and uninspired, although there are some good scenes from the streets of New York. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must have been easy for him, because he repeats Johnny Friendly's "On the Waterfront", only this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, on a smaller scale, does a good job. Gia Scala hits his mark, tells what the script demands and does what the director tells him. A gorgeous woman, her life sank early. The director and the photographer do a good job on Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a bleached face, eyes the color of a glacial lake, and is sometimes struck by a wide-angle lens that turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into a parasitic type of fish. I do not see him as a low-level muscular man. He and Boone should have switched roles. Harold J. Stone is his self-assured, although he is forced to be more "Italian", like Tony, than naturally comes to him. No one else in anything that looks like an important part is more than mediocre, and some artists do not even clarify this bar. Kerwin Mathews may be a cool guy in real life, but he's mildly sterile and belongs to domestic dramas on late-night television. <br /> <br /> Great title, suggestive of intrigue and shadows. Some good people in the cast. A potentially explosive display of a business about which nobody knows much, but trading in megabucks. <br /> <br /> And it all comes out like this.
