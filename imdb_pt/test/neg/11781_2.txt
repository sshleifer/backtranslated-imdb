This is one of the most idiotic movies of all time, not the stupidest, but one of the dumbest. That's 96 and a half minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably the worst Jim Varney movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie are the best and funniest part, but it's hardly worth watching the whole movie. On the other hand, if you are a Jim Varney / Ernest fan, then like me, you should add this movie to your collection. He has brief and rare moments of humor, although they are few and far between. The simple fact that this film is so hard to find makes it a collector's item and a must have for its ernest collection. I was fortunate enough to find this movie online at a cheap price a few years ago. I think I paid 1.99 more freight for that. And it was the only copy I found anywhere. Even though this is a really horrible movie, it's still mandatory to have a fan of Jim Varney and an Ernest movie collector like me. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this movie a 2, but that's only because I've never seen a 1 before;)
