A handsome young cast is wasted on this empty, manipulative and tempting film that tries to be a combination of a cute comedy and a shrewd drama. The plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seem endless, as the characters do nothing but moan and thrill. The dialogue is replete with affected cliches and attempts at pseudo-philosophy of the fortune cookie. <br /> <br /> Apparently meant to be a moving and deep look at life and love, the movie ends up being merely pretentious. The only real weight is the burden that the talented cast is forced to carry in the best possible way. But, never fear - they are supported by the puppet strings of the planned plot.
