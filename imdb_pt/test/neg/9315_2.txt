Historical films always take liberties - conversations are invented where no one can really know what was said, customs are adjusted to be understandable to the modern public, etc. However, historical films about real historical characters should make at least a minimal nod to the story. This movie does not. The only scene I really remember is when our hero surprises a killer who creeps into his room at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder with "I do not remember sending it to room service". The main value of entertainment lies in its evil; I recommended my local video story to put it on the "Turkeys" shelf.
