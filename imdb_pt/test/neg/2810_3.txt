If rich people are different from us because they have more money, then filmmakers are different from us because they think the world cares about all their thoughts. <br /> <br /> This piece of self-indulgent stuff seems to have been made just because the director thought it was time to make another movie, and someone would fund it. Not every trivial idea or reflection is worthy of a movie (unless you're a college film student trying to complete a course). When you have nothing to say, sometimes it's best to be quiet. <br /> <br /> The visuals are not breathtaking. They are quite common. The dialogue is insane and unbelievable. They speak words that no one would use all the strings in situations that are beyond imagination. Germaine Greer's zipless f ** k is finally brought to the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, no one falls into bed as easily as these characters. They mess up before they talk. Even more unbelievable is an aging, balding director who finds instant sex with the most beautiful girl in town, although gravity is already reaching Miss. Marceau at a young age.
