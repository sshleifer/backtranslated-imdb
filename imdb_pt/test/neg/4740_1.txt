This movie made me watch Paul W.S. AvP1 from Anderson and enjoy! I will not even dream of comparing Requiem to any of the Alien or Predator movies, it's a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE B-HORROR IN GAMES IN THE SMALL CITY OF THE USA NOBODY CARES. AvP1 at least had lots of artisanal art sculpted on the film sets, had eye bags that were not seen previously in any of the original films - but was ruined by characters / unconvincing acts. Requiem is bad acting at the lowest imaginable level, and also lacking in every other department as much as ... It is a sacrilege to include alien costumes and predators in this type of crap.
