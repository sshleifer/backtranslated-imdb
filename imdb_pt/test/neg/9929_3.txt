I arrived in the middle of the movie and was very disappointed. It was simply annoying and completely unrealistic. I can stop being unrealistic in many movies, but not when it's a crime drama thing. Evidence gathering and interviewing processes were simply weird. I began to move quickly to see how it ended. And then he got bored with it and just hung up and returned. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, simply did not believe in anything. Peta Wilson performed very well in this movie, but her character was out there and there was no one for her talents acting to make it work.
