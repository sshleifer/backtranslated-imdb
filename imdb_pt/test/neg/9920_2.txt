"The James Dean Story" is presented as "A Different Kind of Movie," explaining: "The presence of the main character in this film was made possible by the use of existing cinematographic material, tape recordings of his voice and a new medium technique - dynamic exploration of still photography ". The only "tape recordings of his voice" worth noting are a short recording that Dean makes when visiting his family in Indiana; he wanted to record any family memorabilia from his great-grandfather Cal Dean, intrigued because he played a similar name "Cal" in "East of Eden." Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and discovers that his relative was an auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family, obviously. This is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> An incredible "East of Eden" screen-shot / outtake appears near the end of the movie. It's a black-and-white scene between Dean (as Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (as Aron Trask). Dean is at his best hypnotist. If this scene only appeared here, and no East of Eden movie was complete, this documentary would be an essential and high-ranking film. But the scene, a perfect "10" in isolation, should be considered an extra "East of Eden". Dean's "Traffic Safety Movie" also deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> There are expected interviews with family and friends. My favorites were the guy (Lew Bracker) going through a box of things Dean left with him, and Dean's family. There was not enough of Aunt Ortense and Dean's letter to her little sister was very good. More readings from Dean's letters would be welcome. Dean's unidentified friend friend seemed to have a better thesis for the film; filmmakers may have considered development as a major focus. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's direction of Martin Gabel's reading of Stewart Stern's script is terrible. What were they thinking? Maybe the filmmakers could be forgiven for the closeness of Dean's passing. Do not expect "The James Dean Story". This movie is more about Dean's effect on people (both fans and filmmakers) than the man. It is very clearly an early piece of the "legend" of James Dean's myths. Tommy Sands sings "Let me be loved". The narrative refers to Dean as "He" with an air of God. The shots of Dean's family seeming to "know" the moment he dies are truly miserable. <br /> <br /> James Dean Story (8/13/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
