I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I hope I was the only spectator. From the beginning, there was something wrong about the movie, after a few minutes of viewing I was able to figure out what it was. THE MOVIE WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a bad old bad Seagal movie of poor quality. <br /> <br /> Why was this made in a movie? I saw some episodes of the TV series and thought it was okay, but I only saw repetitions of it because they did it. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the movie trying to figure out what the story was. and in the end I was not the wiser. It seems like I remember sometime from a character, maybe Farina mentioned that Mod Squad can get into places that ordinary cops can not. The 'place' turns out to be a 'club', one of the most difficult places to enter, maybe it was the students' night? I missed the plot line at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was cut from several leftovers from other remakes of TV series. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I do not remember any laughing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie did not have the real power to steal scenes from someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him Ribisi would have someone to fight back.
