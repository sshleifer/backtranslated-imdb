I watched it on Italian TV as a kid and I remember liking it - in view of mixing live action with animation; however, was universally criticized at the time ... and after all these years, I have to admit that the critics were right! What must have seemed wonderful to a child's eyes is actually very badly done, not to mention the bummer of a fantasy adventure; fatally, the two stars (formerly 'Young Man' Richard Harris) and the director (Hunt action expert) are ill-suited to the material! At least Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics supplied by screenwriter Don Black) is useful - if not exactly inspired. By the way, a number of well-known personalities are prominent among the voice artists in this British-Belgian co-production (Julian Glover, Amor Bessie, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and this being his last film work , Michael Bates). <br /> <br /> While the essential plots of the classic novel by Jonathan Swift ('giant' Gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the little people of two neighboring countries and, upon escaping, ends up in a land of giants real) appear here, is done on a strictly childish level (with stereotyped characters though fortunately little intrusion of the comic / romantic variety) - which makes the enterprise somewhat meaningless, outside its intrinsically experimental nature. since Max and Dave Fleischer had already done a splendid comic book version in 1939!
