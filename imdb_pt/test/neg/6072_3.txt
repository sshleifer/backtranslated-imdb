I expected a lot more than I got by watching this movie. It is not that I oppose literary license, (if that is what it should be called), especially when there is no explicit attempt to say "based on a true story." But this movie is about Beethoven - a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded in our musical experiences and I expected the film to be true to the story, at least in the primary elements. This film took so much exception of the history that could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My guess (because I had not researched the movie) was that it was true. In the middle of the road, I stopped the movie to search for IMDb. The rest of the film was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that this was not accurate with the story because it was so hard to believe in an important part of the story. To appreciate this film, I had to recognize it as a fantasy, a story "and if it were so." The movie did not have this honest warning. <br /> <br /> What disappointed me most was the fictional conduction of the 9th symphony. The very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of disbelief. I ended up doubting that anything was true to the story, other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and stay out of it and went about it and for that I give him a 3/10. <br /> <br /> Those who say that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus do not have the slightest idea of ​​life's composers and are looking only for what this movie really is because in the end it was a cheap a story - pulp fiction.
