A CAIXA (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Truly disappointing adaptation of the legendary Richard Matheson sci-fi chiller "Button, Button" about wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly, who really stretches out a small, well-crafted piece in a "WTF'-a-thon!" The mysterious (and ridiculously mutilated!) Man, Langella, postulates a million dollar offer for the "struggling" couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla and to the max!): A box with a red button that, when pressed, will kill some Strange in the world (!) Certain strings are linked, but does it really matter here? Why, in God's name, does Kelly apply such strangeness (ie nose bleeds, watery transport systems? That's right? Watery.Transport.Systems) when tension should be stretched as much as possible (oh, possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode, you're half right (the 80s TV reboot actually made a decent small-screen adaptation, actually rent that!) One of the worst movies of the year.
