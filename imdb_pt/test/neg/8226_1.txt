I have no qualms about how the movie does NOT capture New Jersey (like Zach, I'm from there). Good. Whatever. I lived there a long time ago. I do not need to see a movie that captures Garden State. <br /> <br /> What I have scruples is how bad this movie is. Let's make this easier for you. We're going to use some bullet points. There are probably some spoilers that follow. (Not that you could not predict the movie ANYWAY): <br /> <br /> -The musical positioning was maddeningly forced and patronizing. Example: Great: "What are you listening to?" Sam: "The Shins, have you heard of them?" "Not." "Listen to this song - it's going to change your life!" And then they continue to play that Shins song that was in a McDonalds commercial. (You do not love when the characters in a movie shamelessly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something?) I love it! Hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing you to "laugh", "Say 'aaaaaw" <br /> <br /> The scenes were so bad SO cliche SO MELODRAMATIC Example: the whole movie But no, really, example: They are in the rainy quarry of the ark Here he comes, Sam and his friend (the annoying drug addict), and he's gone, and he's gone. all of them scream !!!! BUT WAIT !!!! OH MY GOD !! Here they come! THEY KISS !!! LONG, DEEP !!!! IN THE RAIN !!!!!!!! <br /> < - The dialogue was so bad SO cliche SO MELODRAMATIC Example They are leaving the ark and Sam says something like, "Hey. Good luck exploring the infinite abyss. "And the guy replies," You too. "Oh my God! I never realized ... could it be? Oh my God! Large's life is like ... ohmigod ... A Sam says something like "Is that goodbye?" Is not that enough for you? OK, Largeman says something like, "This is not a period at the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipse. "And guess what happens when he tries to ride the jetway and get back to his life in Los Angeles.You know what.Don't guess.It's a waste of your time. "It's a W-type movie, Wes Anderson." When he's not busy being melodramatic and clichÃ©d, the movie often goes with cranky and cranky characters ... Hey, Sam's brother ... thank you Zach Braff for including him, because this really made the film a lot more textured.And also pulling out Anderson: the dialogue.Stage: Sam and Largeman are in a bar.In friends walks, "Vagina!" says one of them. they see him sitting with Sam, then one of the friends says, "Sorry, I said vagina." And Sam says, "Alright." <br /> <br /> - Inventive cinematography that is not inventive but meaningless and irritating. Take some time to accelerate / decelerate the movie. Once again, Wes Anderson does this effectively in his films. And it was well done in "Donnie Darko". But, in fact, it was useless. Wow. A crazy party where people are taking X and snorting cocaine. Better cast all the tricks! <br /> <br /> -You can count the good times in a hand (even if you're losing your fingers). That's what makes it even worse. The quarterback's retarded ... well, that was good! The little thing he (bigman) says when they are about to enter the quarry (something about the wheezing turpentine) ... that was good! Ah, wait, that's about it. <br /> <br /> You know, Zach Braff is, I guess, always a little too cute. But he's nice. But man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you noticed that?), Overly fluffy, all too much. This movie is terrible. Apparently, I'm at a disadvantage, as this wasted time is currently rated at 8.0. <br /> <br /> Please, if you are looking for something really pungent, subtle and unique. DO NOT. RENTAL. THIS. MOVIE.
