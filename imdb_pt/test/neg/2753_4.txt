If you like The Three Stooges, you will undoubtedly enjoy this 17-minute short. There have certainly been a few fun times, but like all Stooges' work, this revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy, and I have to confess that somehow the Stooges never really did it for me. Their joking always seemed more irritated than funny, and although it was obviously false, their mischief always seemed more propitious to cause hurt than to make fun of. In that short time, the slapstick revolves around attempts to find Shemp (who is Music Teacher in this) a wife, because he has just inherited half a million dollars on the condition that he marries within 48 hours of the will read. One of your students is interested but once the news of the inheritance is disclosed, suddenly there is a long list of potential brides, and a good fight of cats arises between them. Stooges fans will like it. For me, there are all the elements that drives me crazy about them. 4/10
