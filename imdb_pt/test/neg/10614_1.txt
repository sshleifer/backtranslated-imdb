I love those terrible 80's summer camp movies. The best part about "Party Camp" is the fact that it literally has no plot. It simply releases a weak batch of "characters" in one place, and then things happen occasionally. The clichés here are unlimited (SPOILERS): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the women's locker room, the walkers that happen in a colony of nudism, the competition at the conclusion, the secretly excited managers of the camp, and the embarrassing sexual behavior innuendo scattered everywhere. The only cliché missing is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. I repeat, never. One final note, be prepared to burst a gut by watching the absurd which is the "dramatic" scene in which Jerry Riviera and D.A. share a beer late at night, spilling their guts to each other. The dialogue literally does not make sense, and the performance belongs to a high school internship. It's a classic.
