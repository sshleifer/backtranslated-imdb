I love Lucy, but this movie is so bad I was squirming with shame for everyone involved in the first ten minutes. . . and it got worse from there. The "singing" of Lucille Ball is totally painful and the attempts to make her look younger through the use of soft focus made me pick up my reading glasses. It's bombs like that that give bombs a bad name.
