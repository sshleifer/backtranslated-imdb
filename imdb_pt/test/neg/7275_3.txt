Scrolling the TV and saw that The Secret Life of was on; gave George Duran a chance to be the host. I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that no one could be as much as he, but George was pretty annoying. He did not really seem to want to be a host; their stories were monotonous, they did not get involved with the guests. It looked like he was interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and he was just in the picture. I do not know if George will be "better" hosting this show, I doubt because he has already held his own show now. The show seemed to have more information, but only because we saw less of the host. The formula of this show was very delicate, and I fear that this has been interrupted forever.
