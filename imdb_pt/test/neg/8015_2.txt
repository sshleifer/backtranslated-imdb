I rented this because I could not pass up the chance to see Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones before Hollywood together, but it was definitely not worth it. The only reason I give two stars instead of one is because of the novelty of seeing them before they become big on the other side of the ocean. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun to watch, even if it is not. the biggest thesp in the world, is horrible. Owen looks very uncomfortable to be in such a turkey, in addition, he wears a ridiculous wig, notoriously badly adjusted at chin height (at least I hope it is a wig and not his real hair). And the scene in which he dances in a country with Zeta Jones only leaves you embarrassed by him. Joan Plowright goes around stunned the whole movie - she's probably wondering how she got into such a mess. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not terrible, but almost everyone is. Oh, and the writing stinks too.
