I'm not sure where to begin. From start to finish, bad, stinky, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100-degree day. If you force yourself to watch this as I did, keep some Vicodin handy for the pain. I will never understand how these films make it go through the cutting room without the whole roll falling to the floor. The film is a cross between Gumby mounts Pokey, finds the terminator, finds Wally Beaver playing cowboys and Indians without the cowboys. I've seen better animation in Blob's original cut. You will have more entertainment watching the And the Wind Took while suffering from vomit and poop. Bad acting and hokey lines will make you squirm and wish you have rented the Big Top from Peewee or watched all the episodes of Gilligan's Island from one side to the other. Ugh .. I'm going to cut my wrist now.
