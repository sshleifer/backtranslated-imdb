It must have been a long time since I saw such a bad movie. I have to say it's really hard to make a good and / or realistic movie about the air disaster, but this movie was a waste of time and money. I also think this is an unofficial way of trying to get a bad reputation on Airbus. First, the cockpit looks a lot like an Airbus cockpit, according to you have a stick, the third using computers to control rudders / ailerons via fly by wire. When I saw this movie, I thought the movie's intent was "not to fly with computerized airplanes like Airbus, to use Boeing, instead they have a direct steering connection and rudders." <br /> <br /> All I can say: bad story, horrible acting (most actors), the worst movie trick of all time ...
