I'm working in a video store so I started seeing this for free- thank god I had paid so my comment would be less tolerant. <br /> <br /> Well, the big idea of ​​the movie (geeky girl has no bloody revenge) is not so original so there are several parallels with "carrie" (making a joke with a loser, except for a legal girl who really regrets it, tamaras and carries a terrible family history). I still think it's a fun idea for the transhy teen horror movie, unfortunately they did not take much of the potentials out here and put emphasis on all the wrong things. <br /> <br /> What worked: I liked the actress who played tamara. she looked great (when she was hot) and her malicious phrases were fun ("Sean can not come on the phone. He's f ** king patrick!"). <br /> <br /> What did not work: the whole wicca thing was silly. I usually prefer rational explanations (she could have plotted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get revenge). there were a lot of logic sets and the blood looked really bad (when the boy cut his ear and tongue - please !!!) <br /> <br /> the idea was not Oscar-bound, but I just think they wasted the comedy and potential for suspense they had. It was bearable but far from good!
