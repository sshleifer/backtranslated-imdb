Right then. This film is utterly bland, puerile, has jokes from other films, has songs from other films (Blink 182's "Mutt", "We Luv U" from Grand Theft Audio), an inopportune leader, a ridiculous plot and parodies of movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Redeeming resources? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. Enough said.
