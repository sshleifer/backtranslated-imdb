***** Spoiler or two, it does not matter ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out in this movie. First, it was titled "Bruno" and "The Dress Code," and if you've ever seen this movie, you'll realize the irony of it. <br /> <br /> Second, it is about solving problems completely off the wall. . The adventures of a cross-country student are not something that there is an urgent need for a movie, nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in. Shirley MacLaine can walk around gender issues by tying up Bruno's desire to wear a dress for religion, which probably opens up an even more thorny can of worms - what was she thinking? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a bit of humor and it is not offensive, but the kind of unsettling feeling at the beginning continues to grow. Does it not only repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or maybe excepted?), No matter what. <br /> <br /> That's good ---- but for people to live in a society, everyone has to give a little to get along. Bruno does not just want to wear a dress, he wants to appear like a miniature of Gladys Knight on the awards night, and his final fantasy makes him look like a Cowgirl Cabbage. However, all other children dress and behave like ordinary children. So, what gives? If everything happened, we could all declare ourselves to be special or different and behave as we pleased, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> This acceptance of people who are "different" is also well defined, I doubt that someday we will see a movie about a child finding their true self and wanting to wear overalls, hunt geese and go to the tractor pulls and requires everyone else to accept it as it is. "Bruno" is a stupid movie and a complete waste of time.
