A malfunction in space leads astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) to roll into a parallel world, called Earth, circling the sun right in front of the Earth. As a being of space would pose a threat to the order of this world, Stryker is kept until a determination can be made about exactly what to do with it. Stryker, however, distrusts his surroundings and escapes. With the help of a caring nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will try to board a spacecraft and return to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in Space (or The Stranger if you prefer) is another of those 70's TV movies that would be turned into a regular weekly show. In that case, it is easy to see why this did not happen. First, there is nothing new in the setup of the show. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or Planet of the Apes. You know, a stranger constantly on the move, going from one town to another, taking on any strange work that might, for a while, being pursued by a government agency or a newspaper reporter. It's a formula that was made to death. The second attack against Stranded in Space is its leadership, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy be any less sympathetic? I was hoping he'd get caught. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. Finally, this is to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone hung three fake moons on the horizon, should I jump to the conclusion that this is a distant planet? So it's a mere coincidence that they all speak English, dress like people on Earth and drive Plymouth Furies? Yes right. <br /> <br /> The only highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Of course, it's hard to watch him in something so terrible, but you know the old saying - any Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I've never heard it too). As with so much of these 70's made for TV, I watched Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I would not say it's a great episode of any stretch of the imagination, but there are some good jokes along the way. So in the end, while I rate the movie a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
