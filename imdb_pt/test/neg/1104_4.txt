J.S. Cardone directed a little-known "Video Nasty" in 1982 called "The Slayer" and since then has had a hand in a handful of feature films; including the 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, has a plot that looks decent, as well as a scary poster that I seem to remember a few years ago about a movie that Tobe Hooper was supposed to direct. Well, I think he felt this was a lot like his 'Mortuary' zombie fungus film and then turned it around. I do not blame him for that either. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters who move to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her late husband. However, what they did not realize is that about a hundred years before; a group of children being used as miners was trapped in a mine pit. Of course, this is not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge ?? <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clich√©s; of the youngest boy with an "imaginary friend", the mother who rejects him and all the rubbish he always buzzed. J.S. Cardone tries to get horror fans back to the side of shocks and bloody scenes (mostly involving children), but it is not enough. The story does not work very well and really reminded me of the old Funeral, and that's not a good thing (although Mortuary is actually a better movie than this). Acting is also nothing to write home; Lori Heuring is decent-looking, as is the older daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but none of them can deliver an interesting performance. Chloe Moretz is a little better than the usual child actor. The plot is hardly credible and, in fact, the script can not even be bothered to explain the reasons why children attack sites. It all boils down to a typical and quite monotonous ending and overall I have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can feel free to skip this!
