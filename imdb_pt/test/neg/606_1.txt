There is no character in this sitcom with redeeming qualities. They are all egocentric, detestable, or two-dimensional. My husband watches, claiming there's nothing left, but I'd rather not watch anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom I can think of was worse was Yes, baby. At least that one did not get 9 seasons. <br /> <br /> Being overweight does not make a comic genius, and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if so, she is wasted with the grumpy wife. Jerry Stiller is convincing as a boring old man. Maybe there's a reason for that. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are ridiculed.
