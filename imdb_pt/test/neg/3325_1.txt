This film was basically created for the failure of the studio. One of them, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the play, but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to stage two novels in depth in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> I keep the only way these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned - work on a form of live action. either through a mini-series. Firstly, the Lestat Vampire only takes place from the 1700s until the 1980s and has a myriad of character vital to understanding the plot of the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat defines the events of the second part, Queen of the Damned. Without this complete understanding, the premise of a movie is destroyed. Lestat was not cruel and cruel to everyone, he did not want to agree with Akasha's plans, Marius did not create Lestat, Lestat did not love. Jesse or do it, Lestat could not be unharmed by the light, Marius was not behind David or the opposite, every character was completely represented wrong, BASICALLY the same names, different story. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. But do not go back to the theaters of the success of Rice's great novels and characters only to destroy what her faithful readers have come to love. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the books, do not really understand the movie, if you have read the books, you will be insulted. That said, I'm a big fan, I had to see the movie knowing full well that this would be the case and yet I did. Take 22, you must see it, you will hate it.
