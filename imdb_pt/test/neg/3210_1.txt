Now this is a real turkey from the overrated director Franco, who gave us classics like "The Vampires / Vampyros Lesbos". Yeah, I think bad movies can be so much fun. I love the hilarious hilarity of Doris Wishman, Dwain Esper, and Ed Wood Jr., but this proved to be too much for me. It's the first movie I rated 1. Where should I start? The script is stupid to the max. The dialogue is incredibly bad. The direction seems to be non-existent. The best music tip (used repeatedly in this movie) was taken directly from the movie "Der Hexer" (1964). And it's annoying! Poor Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one shot Sanders reads a comic Popeye while his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). The only thing that intrigued me was that Franco promptly showed female nudity whenever I thought the movie would gain from it - this is a real driving ability! Still, I fear that a movie where actors pretend to shoot with machine guns shaking them is not worth it.
