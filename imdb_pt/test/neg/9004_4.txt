I had a little hope for this one-hour movie made from old Poverty Row movies. It certainly had the potential to look more like a mass of home-made video marketed to the world. Unfortunately, though funny this movie still feels like a home movie, but with stock footage in it. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to the planned reading of a will in a midnight liner somewhere in the tropics . The ship sinks and well ... this is the movie. <br /> <br /> The film promises that Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others will be drawn from old films to interact with new images. We are well, but most of the time we have many new video images made to look like black and white movies, in which new actors are thrilled. The old footage is mainly interspersed to set the scene, but very little of the old and the new really do match, so it's clearly a matter of use. It's not very convincing and it's very disappointing for someone like me to be looking for a better built movie. <br /> <br /> Yet if you know and love the old Poverty Row movies, (this is very spoofy) it might be worth it. view. I would warn against buying, but can be had for about five dollars, the price of a rent, so the choice is yours (although if you can stay away from not paying for it do so). <br /> Disappointing
