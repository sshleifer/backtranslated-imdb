AKA <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 3 x 1.78: 1 within 2.39: 1 frame (Triptych) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> 1978 : A teenage class job (Matthew Leitch) assumes a false identity and enters high society, where he learns hard lessons about the divisions between rich and poor. An autobiographical report by director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE ... YOUR FAULT), an exposition of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, seen through the eyes of a low-income "commoner" whose worldview is transformed by his adventures among the upper classes. Unfortunately, Roy's script says very little that we did not already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is briefly inflamed by Leitch's relationship with a beautiful but self-destructive renting boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who ends up being less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to imitate. Also starring Diana Quick (as a scandalous snob who believes working class people are "ashamed to be alive"!), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson ("EastEnders"), Blake Ritson DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically extravagant cameo, blinking her boobs at everything and everyone, without a care in the world! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, much of the film's impact is diluted by Roy's insistence on using a Triptych effect (three separate 1.78: 1 images are letterboxed in the 2.39: 1 frame, each providing a different point of view of individual scenes), which reduces the image and distances viewers from the events on the screen. A long and meaningless film, very personal to the great appeal and hampered by a cinematographic process that can not reconcile the story in question. A single image version is also available (theatrical framed in 1.85: 1), with the title on the AKA screen: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.
