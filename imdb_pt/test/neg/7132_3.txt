Let me start by saying that I loved the original Grudge. It was not one of the scariest and scary experiences I've ever had in a crowded movie theater. I'm not kidding. Being a self-proclaimed japanophile also made the film look better in my eyes (if the scenario had been shifted to some American suburb, I would probably hate the movie). <br /> <br /> That said. This movie is a complete mess! I will not say it sucks, because A) the movie has some good points, B) "sucks" is the most pitiful in the history of lame put-downs. So what does the movie have for it? Well, for starters, it looks pretty cool: through filters and the use of dull, faded colors, Takashi Shimizu almost recreates the pessimistic and harrowing atmosphere of the original. Some scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just plain bad. Period. <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere, not to mention the Tarantino style, that is, the scenes are out of chronological order. This technique is useless in the case of this movie and just makes things more confusing. Frankly, a direct plot would have worked better. The original was also lacking in plot terms, but it made sense and the film more than compensated for its fine plot with many scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere. Grudge 2 does not have any of these elements and is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the acting skills of the TV show that make the original Grudge cast look like Emily Watson and Katherine Hepburn. Simply put, the movie does not work. It's very slow, very boring, and not scary enough to make up for the messy plot (which adds nothing new to the story, so even Grudge fans will not be satisfied). <br /> <br /> Oh, and what's this with the old man playing Japanese peek-a-boo on the bus? Is this supposed to be comic relief? Artistic statement? Or what?
