Five Fingers draws heavily on barbaric tactics of Hollywood's worth to elicit a positive response to the film. That's where this movie fails, especially because it's too graphic to be taken seriously. I was disgusted and disgusted at having done Five Fingers, and essentially I had to struggle to keep watching him. Torture itself is horrible. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are horrible. But obviously the creators of this movie did not find it enough. It had to go far beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively ruined any chances that this movie had to make any sort of valid point. For this reason, this film came out as nothing more than being self-gratifying. Five Fingers also relegates to film status B just for its indulgence in time manipulation. In other words, we are shown the present, and then the past is revealed in snippets. This is a bit of a turnaround from the normal manipulation of time by Hollywood. While the viewer is usually shown on page 95 in a 100-page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the film is essentially explaining the ending, Five Fingers is dedicated to retreat, which gets pretty tiring at the end of the movie. movie. Overall, Five Fingers made me feel stupid to watch the whole movie, because the torture is obviously obscene, and certainly it was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to demonstrate this. It surprises me that Dick Cheney did not appear at the end as a kind of torture superhero. This film is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy and irrational imbeciles.
