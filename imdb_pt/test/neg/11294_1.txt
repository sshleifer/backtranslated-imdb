I completely understand why this movie was made. Silence of the Lambs was an incredible movie - a horrible thriller with a superb story and high jump factor .... <br /> <br /> What I do not understand is why this movie was made ... and by that Anthony Hopkins agreed to reprise his role as Hannibal the Cannibal in this terrible and unsatisfying film. <br /> <br /> There is no possible way to ruin the movie besides seeing what it could, but for those of you who would rather waste your money, DO NOT READ ON. The movie is absolutely horrible. It's so bad that Jodie Foster's transition to Julianne Moore does not become a problem. <br /> <br /> The only way to really appreciate the movie is to set the clock and leave the theater exactly two hours after the movie, because up to that point it is a very interesting thriller. The cast between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of the other characters are very good. But literally at the two-hour mark, the film turns into nothing more than a D-grade horror movie ... it's sick, and it's stupid and almost like the team ran out of time, and threw one end in a day of footage. The initial buzz about the unsatisfactory and bizarre ending of Thomas Harris's book prompted director Ridley Scott to ask for a rewrite ... and honestly, having seen the movie and read the end of the book , I do not know what's worse. <br /> <br /> Please - do not waste your money OR time in this movie unless you are prepared to leave EXACTLY at the two o'clock point, because that is the ONLY way for you I will feel satisfied with the saga of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter ... continuing the mystery that made the first film, and waiting for this one, so great.
