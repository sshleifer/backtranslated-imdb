I remember reading that Darwin had a crucial experience on the Galapagos Islands, seeing the wide range of animal life there, and intern, he wrote his theory of evolution. Not according to this movie - it was inspired by the British interior. Okay, and as John Cleese would say, right. I also did not think Darwin was a man who suffered from a deep personal conflict and someone who suffered somber daydreams and flights of anguish. According to this movie he was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters due to illness, but I do not think he lost a family member would have greatly affected the man's scientific abilities. Well, not according to ... you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science turns into fable, and to some extent this movie seems to try to overturn evolutionary theory by saying that it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, which to me is simply gross. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific research, legal and calm, and always thinking logically. This film seeks to dramatize scientific exploration with clear head, non-dramatic and sensationalist. It's like a Canterbury tale. I would not recommend it.
