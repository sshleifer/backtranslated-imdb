The biggest problem of "In Search of the Historical Jesus" is that there is very little research on this. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and only in the 1980s, which included interviews with "experts" and discussions about "science" and "facts" to defend what the title of the film was looking for. cash in Unfortunately, "historical Jesus" is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of Christ. Unlike Shick-Sunn's "In Search of Noah's Ark," who spends most of his time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on earth today and where it might be, this film is basically the story of Jesus without effort to prove or disprove its existence. The famous Turrin Shroud is mentioned, but little detective work gets too much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> For fans of these almost documentary films like "Jupiter Menace" and "In Search of Bigfoot", etc. This movie does not offer much.
