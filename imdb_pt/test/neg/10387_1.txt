This movie had very few moments of real drama. After the first few minutes, the movie came down in a spiral that did not take us to hell and back - to see it was pure purgatory, to say the least. The acting was more horrible than the subject of the film and sometimes I could not stop laughing. The continuity between some of the scenes was terrible - the characters disappeared from the unexplained scenes only to be replaced by other characters that minutes before had been somewhere else. Certainly this was a parody of the Exorcist. The collection plate in the church must have been filled with copper the day Mr. Russo signed up for this. I speak Latin? Et tu Brutus.
