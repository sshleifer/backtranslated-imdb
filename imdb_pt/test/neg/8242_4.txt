I've always liked the Carry On movies, with their double meaning sexual innuendo dialogues and slapstick comedy moments, but I can see why critics give this two stars. Basically, many Brits are meeting on a bus to go on a Spanish vacation to an island called Elsbels for the Palace Hotel. What they did not know is that it is not completely built, apart from having to share bathrooms with their neighbors, they have bad designs and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, wearing a funny accent, for example, sounding peace like the bad word P). Starring Sid James as Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt, a crap apparently (I personally can not remember who he is Jimmy Logan as Bert Conway, June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques as Floella (a ridiculous character, not as memorable as his usual Matron), Bernard Bresslaw as Brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas. like Harry and Patsy Rowlands like Miss Dobbs.I admit it is not great but there are just enough dialogue jokes and of course Babs in the shower and it goes up to her ass with that iconic whistle and later a quick tear of the bra . OK!
