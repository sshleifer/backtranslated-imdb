Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day in the streets of Athens, a movie director ran into a prostitute and decided the world had to know his story because ... you know ... he's private ... and strip the shirt is very e ... so on. <br /> <br /> This movie is the result of his revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist ... but of course, full of pretty faces with the chest showing. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, then take advantage, if not avoid it, as if it were a plague. <br /> <br /> That got me out of the way of Greece for sure.
