As with many sequences, it just does not have the quality or impact of the original. The first belongs there with the rest of the greats. This just does not cut it. The first film had a magical feeling of "good time" that is totally missing from this movie. We fell in love with all these characters (except Richard Dreyfuss) in an age of innocence. Now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. While this is what happens in real life, we do not expect this to happen to our favorite movie characters! The film does not have the humor that the original had, and we were hoping to laugh. The little humor is dark. The first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever, while this one is good, but it does not even come close to the original. This film is so different from the original that it's not even a sequel. I gave a 4.
