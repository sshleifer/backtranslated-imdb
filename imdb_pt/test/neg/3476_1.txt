I just watched a preview of the movie. A documentary masterpiece, it was not. Fully absorbed in the subject, the film becomes incapable of leveling any kind of critical commentary on Mrs. Faye. Dizzy and sentimental, the only redeeming quality of the film was the use of dolls in an attempt (though failed) to structure some kind of narrative. But the most chilling experience occurred when the final credits rolled. The audience rose and applauded. As moths call it, 21st century Americans are still drawn to freakshows. The narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting pretty tired.
