This movie has possibly the worst title for a short clown ever dreamed of. Something appropriate, given the actual content of fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> I can do without the "Shemp A.D." things, but I'll admit to having a few moments of LOL from the two-man comedy offered by Moe and Larry in some of the new images (and compliments to those guys for trying to give their all, considering the position they were forced to enter even by doing these dogs). Another bright spot for this and AD's latest disaster, "Commotion on the Ocean," is the decided lack of screen time for Joe Palma and the back of his head. No attempt to make him speak or shake his arms like a chicken (see "Hot Things") may be worth an extra point of evaluation. <br /> <br /> 2/10
