Taylor Deemer Mrs. Drake English 10 PIB B4 March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> A shot in the dark <br /> <br /> It's hard to get through the movie Heart of Darkness because it's incredibly uninteresting. The book that this movie is based on has little action to begin with. So the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally impromptu idea, basically guaranteeing a failure. <br /> <br /> Most of the book is from the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlow in a job through the dark of the Congo and the people as a whole? I feel that the screenwriter has failed massively to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. You have totally lost the biggest issue of light versus darkness. That's the main point of the book and when that does not translate to the movie, all that's left is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> This being the case, the question is asked, why would anyone do it in a movie? An even better question could be asked, who would want to watch? It is totally a task to watch. If I had not contributed to a grade in my English class, I would never have considered watching the film. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Heart of Darkness is stripped of all its sight and meaning when it is taken from the pages of the book. The novel is torture to read up to the last twenty pages, but the next thought is that it is a decent book. The film is like a shot in the dark, no chance in the world to reach its target. <br /> <br /> How can a book on mental processes and the accomplishments of darkness be portrayed in a physical and visual sense? I feel that it is impossible to show thoughts accurately. Also, I feel that the time difference between the book and the movie creates important points that do not seem to fit. The novel Heart of Darkness was published in 1902 while the film version of Heart of Darkness is 1993. The 91 years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different grounds. The novel seems to have much tougher conditions, and the film does not portray Congo's prehistoric feel. The Congo, in the film, seems just another place, not the dark and inhuman place in which the book paints this scenario. I feel that this removes another important element that really adds to the novel. <br /> <br /> With two of the biggest aspects of the plot missing in the movie, the bit of decency that is in the book Heart of Darkness is gone. When the light controversy against the dark is the biggest theme, not including it in the film makes it seem like the whole movie will be incredibly useless and it is. It is monotonous, uninteresting and a great waste of time. There's no reason to watch it. The book is stripped of any meaning it has. If necessary, for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and credits Marlow: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich The Russian: Morten Skirts The intended: Phoebe Nicholls <br /> <br /> Directed by: Nicolas Roeg Written by Benedict Fitzgerald, based on novella by Joseph Conrad Duration: 100 minutes Rated P 13 (sexuality and language)
