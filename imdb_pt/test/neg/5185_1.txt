What makes this movie so bad? Is juvenile humor insignificant? Could it be the horrible music of fashion? Perhaps the uninspired go nowhere? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords gives his worst acting performance of all time and adding insult to injury keeps all his clothes the full length of that steaming poop sandwich. Regardless of why this movie sucks, the fact remains that it really does. I never wanted to be watching a movie with Dean Cameron instead of what I was watching in my life, but "Ski School" is a comic book genius masterpiece compared to this farce. <br /> <br /> Note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes loosen their Tupperware breasts <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: Starz on Demand
