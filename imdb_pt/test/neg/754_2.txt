Sometimes, changes in novels when they are made into movies are not only necessary, but they are a good thing. However, in the case of the Northanger Abbey, it is a very, very bad thing. Not only is the story torn to shreds, but the satire is almost completely missing from the film, and its mix of romance and intrigue does not even touch on the scathing comment that Austen put on his work. It can not be fun or satirical, and instead turns the character's fascination into his fantasy world into a drama. <br /> <br /> This also affects romance. It is sinuous and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons why Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, leaving the audience to wonder what he sees in her at all. <br /> <br /> I hope someday soon, we will have a more faithful version. if Austen's satire.
