When this show airs for the first time, I will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the scenario. With an open mind, I watched the first two episodes and, of course, discarded that it was destined for a half season at most. I happened to be watching A / E recently and witnessed an ad for this junk and could barely contain my surprise. I really hope people are seeing this for a laugh and not taking it seriously. The characters are actually some of the most ridiculous and ridiculous laughs on television, scripted or otherwise. It is obviously generating audience, so I must give creators credit for establishing and maintaining a fan base, but I sincerely hope no one is watching it under any pretense of seriousness.
