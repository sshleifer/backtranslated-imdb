Although it has been many decades since I last read Wells's "War of the Worlds," or "The Time Machine," or any other of his works, I believe they were all in London, or at least in England. . This movie from the "B" ("C"?) Series is set in the eastern part of the United States, as well as Orson Welles' excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. However, this movie does not exhibit anything of the quality of the narrative style of the Mercury Playhouse program. Thomas Howell's emoticon would not be acceptable at most high school theater clubs. I was really ashamed of him. His rolling on the grass on the hill shouting "My family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to his brother's death. Of the three cinematic versions of the story I saw, this was by far the worst, with the 1950 version of Gene Barry the best. Also, this was the first time I saw a "machine monster" dripping with sticky saliva as the "Alien" creature.
