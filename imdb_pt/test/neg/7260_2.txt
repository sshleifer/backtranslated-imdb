This movie begins by showing you a map and then explaining the radar and it is a long time before you see the deadly mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50's this dated piece is a little slow and the pay at the end is not very good. Although it has its moments like when Perry Mason's guy argues with an old man and when he says "I reduced the possibilities to one" I'm sorry, but when you restrict something you have a couple or more possibilities, not a ... you reduce it to one that you have not reduced, but you have in fact discovered what it is. The monster is the standard science fiction show of the 1950s, better than the locusts say at the beginning of the end. Acting is insignificant and the heroine is the most uninteresting ... actually, in some scenes she looks like a drag guy. You see lots of footage of fighter planes and other things, but you will not see much of the deadly mantis.
