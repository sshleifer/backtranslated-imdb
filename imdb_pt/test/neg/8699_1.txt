The reason this movie sucks, do these people even read a bible? Everything in the movie was about bassinets, God was getting out of it. This did not happened! God directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. Also people wandered for 40 years AFTER they arrived in Canan and betrayed God again! They had not wandered for 40 years and suddenly found this, it was a punishment for their doubts. Maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a Bible first, they would say oh, no, we understand everything wrong, try again. Everything in this movie was about Moses. They made God look like an idiot who was messing with Moses all the time. NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God was their all time and he wanted people to see that he was taking care of them. How dare they say the opposite, not even near the passage. And Moses was left out because he was angry with the people and shamelessly disobeyed God! He sinned much and was informed that he would not be allowed to enter into it. When did Moses run away and shout to God for everything in the Bible? NEVER!!!!!! In fact, read your story before you invent what you think is a good idea. Also all this God was out of it most of the time and made them do it themselves, is not it !!! God did everything for the people, He provided them in every way and God told them where to go. He was there all the time. The whole we have to do ourselves is true in some ways, but back then that was not how it worked! Yes today He does not work directly for everyone to see, but at that time he actually killed people after the golden calf thing! God worked directly with the people. Read the Bible next time on Echo Bridge or do not make another Bible movie!
