Ring! Ring! You have been directors of terror, how can we help you? Ready! I mean, hello, my name is Rugge? err, call me by my initials R.D! Ok Mr. R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well, the comments on my latest film "Dial: Help" were all negative and hard and frankly, I feel like my career has seen better days as well. Okay Mr. R.D, and why do you think it is? Well, I've gained fame and a well-deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about wild tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house on the edge of the park, to which I lent the idea to Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" revolves around ?? err?? Nevermind! No, no, Mr. R.D, go ahead and tell me about what the movie is. It's about a spiritually possessed phone line, stalking a sexy model and killing the people around her. Oh, I understand. This premise does indeed sound a bit silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, but I suppose there are deeper themes in your film, right? Oh yes of course ?? Um, what do you mean by that? Well, the symbolism of the telephone line is not for another type of terror? Or maybe everything is happening in the mind of your female heroine? No, no ?? It's just a phone that gets furious and kills people with rope, vibrations, electricity or ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all these supernatural things to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I realized that the mysterious plot of telephone that was slowly unfolding would not be so important or relevant, so I focused only on processing all the possible phone tricks I could imagine. Phone tricks? What do you mean? You know, like the wind blowing through the horn, dial tones that penetrate the mind and spinning tables in the air! Very original, Mr. R.D, but not exactly horrible and as an experienced director you should know that in the end, people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh, but it does exist! Everything has to do with negative and unprecedented energy, if I remember correctly! It's all a bit confusing, I'll admit. Hmm ?? I understand. Oh, well, as they always say, a good movie depends on more elements than just the story. Did you at least process some of your common trademarks in the movie, so your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! God knows I tried, but the murders and bloodshed are simply not hitting anyone! This is really a pity, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone likes a good part of sleaze and nudity in their horror movies and you even said that the film is focused on a sexy fashion model in danger! Yes but ?? But what, Mr. R.D? Well to tell you the truth, we promoted "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with revealing pictures of Charlotte Lewis on the cover but in reality there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R.D! Now I'm really disappointed, this is just blatantly taking people away and luring them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to rent "Dial: Help" and love it! Well, to round it off, I can console you by saying that every great director has a right to some wrong decisions without this affecting his career immediately, but be more cautious next time and do some research first, okay Mr. R.D? I'll; thank you! Welcome. Tell me, do you have any ideas for the next movies? Yes, indeed, I know! I was thinking of doing a Giallo with a killer washer! Does not that sound fascinating? Hello? Hello?
