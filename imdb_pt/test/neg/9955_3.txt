There are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for it and just played it together. I do not know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously he was chosen as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire. He seems so ordinary. I'm surprised he ended up in the genre. This is the typical "I'm going to create monsters that can be used to fight like an army". By transferring wolf blood (or coyote) to his contracted hand, he turns him into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as Frankenstein's monster, plays the gentle and kind man who is a victim because he trusts the mad doctor. At first, the scientist is able to control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But like the invisible man, he suddenly begins to transform himself and becomes a passive. There is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with a shrill voice (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave, but the father, the doctor, does not allow it. He is also run by a group of his colleagues who have mocked his research before and now he will have satisfaction. The way he plans to embarrass or kill them is very unlikely and depends a lot on Petro and the guys who are sitting waiting to be attacked. Not a very good movie. The strong point is the atmosphere of the forest, while people and monsters hide around the Spanish moss. Once again, the town's residents are a bunch of idiots, who seem to have escaped from a bad western. One thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and this seems unusual for a movie of that time. There is also an old woman who smokes a pipe that knows about werewolves but nobody listens.
