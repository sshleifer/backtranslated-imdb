Not only why? But "what were they thinking?" That must have been some kind of return for Gus Van Sant, because that's one of those weird movies that should never have been (re) done. It purports to be Hitchcocks movie frame by frame but without the magic or the tension or the big movie <br /> <br /> doing. Rent the original instead, spare yourself.
