This film was a sad attempt to recreate a crucial moment in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is inaccurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was far away. This film implies that the war was started on religious differences, but the Civil War was not Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestants. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill, nor ever "saved the day." The monarchists did not win, the battle ended in a draw. As another critic noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "Five Members" who would be removed from the House and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was decent. The producers tried the WAY and did not look so good. <br /> <br /> It could definitely have been better.
