I entered this film hoping for an imaginative twist on the Second Coming. Boy, was I wrong. The BBC is stupid in the rhythm of a movie, total idiots in creating suspense, fools in the intensity of construction. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how much the BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the laborious dialogue of rhythm and waste of time was painful to sit on. The first 30 minutes seemed like 2 hours. I kept looking at my watch, wondering when the monotonous, meaningless conversation would end. They squandered a perfectly good actor in the lead role because the material is so lazy and sloppy, written. All that happens is just to kill time. <br /> <br /> Out of 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). What a pity. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the "I am God" interminable blah blah blah blah, the dumb as doberts boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS CRAP.
