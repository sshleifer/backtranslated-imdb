I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. He set the standard. I'm never going to give a movie to 1 unless it was as horrible as this. I totally agree with the other reviews about this movie. But as I am Dutch, I watched with Dutch translation. Apparently, they did not have money for a proper translation, so they decided to drool him. With sometimes hilarious results. <br /> <br /> Do not smoke, do not drink, do not use drugs, do not watch Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can not believe I just said that.) I did not hold the script (Was there any?) In his hands while filming. I think they also did a good job at ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they did not do a good job.
