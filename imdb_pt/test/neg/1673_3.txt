As another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a family pack of 20 movies. I think you could say that this was a decent movie made for TV in 1980, but it's super predictable and the acting, with the exception of Robert Conrad, is generally unsatisfying. The football scenes are nothing special and seem to act primarily as a film fill. The movie is very old now, but a decent remake could probably do that in a good movie. However, is this really necessary? I mean, how many underdog sports team movies work together for the big game with the unbeaten guys that we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger children if you find it in the business bin but a chandelier from sports movies will find it lacking.
