Joe was first released in the US in the summer of 1970. Despite respectable notices, reasonable box office and an Oscar name, he disappeared shortly after and remained forgotten during the 1980s, before being reckoned with enthusiasm, somewhat unfairly, in the States United. end of the 90s Thanks to this long unavailability, his reputation came to see it (inexplicably) next to Michael Winner's original death wish. Although revenge is a theme, a film about vigilantism is definitely not. <br /> <br /> The plot is not worth being synopsis. It is a flabby, smug and bizarre digression about an accidental murder and the improbable relationship that flourishes from it. This relationship and the largely class-based peculiarities of its two clues are exaggerated in the ridiculous caricature; these two, and their situation, have absolutely no relation to reality. <br /> <br /> Almost everything about the film is unfriendly and unnatural, which makes the whole thing completely fascinating. Hippies are portrayed as sneaky and unique misanthropes, heavy drugs make you sleep or dance manically with lipstick on your face, and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana on the fly. It's much more of a 1960s movie than it was in the 1970s, so why some industry experts have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the early Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese of all people even got involved, though probably only to give a nod to the humid tones and lavatories of the dreary urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe looks a lot like a furious take on the likes of Easy Rider and Bonnie and Clyde, rather than a continuation of the same insurgent cinematic ethos. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie of any real artistic significance. - despite Joe's unrestrained fury at everything in his world, remains a story about absolutely nothing - but his value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. Filmed on the streets of New York during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War, and at a time when America (and significantly, its cinema) was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard, the film ends, in its own way completely oblivious and accidental, telling more about this period of history than numerous infinitely superior films that have struggled directly to capture it. <br /> <br /> But like a movie? Despite a really surprising and effective shock, this is basically a Michael Winner movie, but not so well done. How does this tickle your fancy? ** Incidentally, if you're, like me, a fan of identifying arbitrary background lookups, then check out Harold Steptoe at 1:22:11 at the hippie art gallery.
