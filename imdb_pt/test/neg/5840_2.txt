This movie has a premise that is good enough to get someone to talk, and a safe conversation start. "Would you sleep with someone you do not like or do not know for a million dollars?" Although the film has a lot of potential, the bad execution turns it into a b-level novel. The film has a great advantage, and after the proposal is made, we're actually in the movie, but then it drops dramatically. The last 3 quarters of the movie are spent by complaining characters, complaining and regretting what they did! The ending was so clich√© that it left me in tears! This has a premise very similar to "Las Vegas honeymoon" which is much better. Look at this instead.
