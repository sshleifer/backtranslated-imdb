I do not think this movie had the effect on me that was planned: to see American soldiers shooting wounded soldiers on the other side, and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them to make them talk made me twist on the other side. It certainly made US forces look like "the good guys." Should that be acceptable?
