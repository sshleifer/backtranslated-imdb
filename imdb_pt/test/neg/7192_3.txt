Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a potential composer; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a would-be inventor. They both work on a cigar bench in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a music publisher who also owns the building. Lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's girlfriend. When Lake appears dead, circumstances conspire to make Mary and Newton think Johnnie is the killer. They conspire again to implicate Maria, who goes to jail. But who actually shot the lake?

Wheeler and Grable sing for each other through the bars.
