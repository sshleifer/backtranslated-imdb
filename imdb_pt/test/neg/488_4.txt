This short film was the last and only short film by director Del Lord. The problem: it was very weak and the coffee scene was practically a carbon copy of a Curly "Busy Buddies" (1944). The interrogation scene was very funny, and the initial part of the coffee part. But there are many plotholes in this short. For example, why are puppets hidden in the trash can when the police come? In the remake of "Of Cash And Hash" (1955), director Jules White corrects this and the reason the lackeys hide in the trash can is because there is a shootout between the police and the armored car thieves. The scene in which Moe is having problems with the oyster was done earlier with Curly in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The frightening part of the house was not so good except for the hilarious scene outside the scary house. On top of that, the end did not have any pain. Classification: C-
