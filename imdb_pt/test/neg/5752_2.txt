For many months I was looking forward to this release. The previews seemed good, the first reports on the internet were encouraging, and Golden Eyes and Timesplitters were excellent marksmen (by the same people). Turns out I was very much mistaken! Haze had the potential to be up there with Call of Duty 4 and other next generation shooters, however it looks, plays and feels like something 5 years or more behind. I played Haze on a 1080 TV and was initially disappointed that the game developers had limited the graphics to 720. The Haze universe has no details and atmosphere, the feeling of "they must have really run to finish this" is always there. <BR> The controls are slow and heavy, and I have not yet found an adjustment for the sensitivity of the x / y axis. There are many parts of the game for a player that are very dark (visually), to the point that you can not see where you are going. Why not add a lantern function like in Halo? or better yet, night vision? The use of "nectar" for performance improvement is interesting, however, just as you get used to it, you change sides and do not use it again! Why bother? I could continue with many other Haze flaws, but instead I'd just say no, BOTHER! wait for killzone 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock the golden AK!
