I feel really bad about reviewing this movie because I would have liked to have seen it just as a conceptual production. The Covenant looked like it might have been a really original piece, but unfortunately they missed the big idea in translation for the screen. <br /> <br /> The story follows four (5) teenagers who are the descendants of families. who began the town of Ipswitch, a survivor of the Salem witch trials. They are also part of the secret sect called "The Covenant." Its power should be used sparingly as it drains its life force in small amounts and is highly addictive. In theory, this would give a good sci-fi action movie, or at least an interesting movie. <br /> <br /> But there were many blatant falls that did not allow this movie to come to its plot. total potential. This performance was not good, the soundtrack was mediocre and we encountered many unnecessary synchronization problems. Of course, the biggest problem is poor editing. The film has little or no coherent flow and makes a struggle to maintain a mental timeline or any sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> The movie has moments, but overall it was a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> A witchy 4/10
