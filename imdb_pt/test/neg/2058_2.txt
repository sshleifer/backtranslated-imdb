This movie is just crap, I can not put it differently. From the beginning it's known to be crap. <br /> <br /> History, dialogue, acting, special effects, makeup, practically everything sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winning movies, but this is not worth seeing, I can not believe how someone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality experience. The development of the film is incoherent, the characters' motivation is ... It does not exist, it all seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I honestly doubt it. I'd like to know what they tried to pull, but it ended up backfiring, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing compared to that) Please, do it a favor and do not watch it. <br /> <br /> Q. It's also full of clich√©s! P.S. 2 Bad Script, Bad Direction, Bad Cinematography. Q. 3 I bothered to comment on this as a favor to all.
