I saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote "I also expected a Steven movie", god I love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. I had some doubts because I read that "Ja Rule" was playing on it, but I thought I hope they give it a small role, so I do not get annoyed to watch it. And of course the opposite happened, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the hell were you thinking of joining a sry crew *** like this. Steven was broke and needed money? If you like Steven's movie, please skip this pure drama, you only have a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. But the "acting" of the rule already spoils everything The movie was made for his friend kurupt with his annoying hood conversation. <br /> <br /> My beer passed from fresh water tasting to which we washed the dishes. <br /> <br /> The story had no "good" about it. <br /> <br /> I hope Steven makes me happy again in a future movie. <br /> <br /> People this is not even worth rent simpel like that. <br /> <br /> And pitty :-)
