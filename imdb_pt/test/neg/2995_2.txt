I should live this movie, but I do not live. Won international awards, is foreign (I usually like movies like that) is slow (again something I like) and has no sex or gratuitous violence. The problem is it's annoying. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey one "successful" the other not. The failure comes to Istanbul to be successful in trying to get a good job at sea. Both live lives that are unsatisfactory, meaningless and mean. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not the first time this kind of movie is made. I have not seen anything new being added to this tired subject. There are long outlets that are just someone standing and looking out to sea or sitting at a cafe or watching TV. I understand that this sort of thing is there to show the emptiness of your loves. While this happens, I get the idea in the first 15 minutes. I do not need to be hit in the head with him for the rest of the two hours. <br /> <br /> The symbolism is also a bit heavy. the plate of fish-like live minnows with one off the plate and flopping around on their death bids. The symbols are best when they are not obvious, but they are there in the background, creating a climate a little below the viewer's perception. <br /> <br /> The film is so apathetic that it does not even give 1, so I gave it 2. To rate 1, it takes a talent to be bad. This movie does not have much energy.
