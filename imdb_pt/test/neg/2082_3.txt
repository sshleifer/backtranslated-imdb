The Greek spot for parts of the movie was very beautiful and the picture got all my votes and this is about the length of my raves for this movie. I found that all the characters were narcissistic archetypes found so often in American culture and were superficial and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands are easy to see, but I found their characters very narcissistic and unpleasant for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party, it made me wonder how this woman could think of herself as a competent stage star. I was tempted to press the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was herself and Raul Julia's character was so lascivious that he was absolutely chilling. The film was too long for my liking and I could not sit down again, even on the tip of a gun.
