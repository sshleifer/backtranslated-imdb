The Brave One is about a New York radio hostess named Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in the city in which she grew up and loves. She has her great fiance David (Naveen Andrews) with whom she is planning to marry. But one night while Erica and David are walking their dog, they are attacked and assaulted by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica recovers, but is broken-hearted and traumatized later on, and can barely deal with real life. She buys a gun from a guy on the streets for protection. But one day she is shopping in a store, and a man walks in and shoots the dead employee. It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a watcher. Kill anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or anyone else. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is tracking this elusive killer unknown and in the process, becomes friend of Erica. Erica begins to recover her sanity by killing these violent people, but she is not sure if what she is doing is morally correct. And as she and Mercer approach, he does not even realize that the unknown killer killer is right next to him. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster gives a very good performance in The Brave One. She brilliantly portrays this kind of violent and morally corrupt character. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. Both have excellent chemistry together and strengthen the film to a certain level. The Bravo One looks visually pure, and conveys some brilliant camera work, but not everything works to a great effect. The scenes where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out the front door to face the world. The camera swung sideways in an almost dreamlike way and really captured the moment with essence. While almost every time Erica killed someone, everything had to come out slowly and show their facial expressions in detail. Slo-mo was used correctly when Erica committed her first murder. But why keep doing this almost every time she committed murder? Camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film, but there are some scenes here that are simply an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Bravo is a lot about how these murders affect Erica emotionally. Her fianc√© is killed by a bunch of thugs, and suddenly her love for New York City turned upside down. She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and she says it on her radio show. I do not completely understand this though. Erica acts as if she had never realized that violence can happen at night in the city, and that is very stupid. If she has lived there all her life, she must be blind or very unrelated. Erica also seems to be a glutton to inhuman and murderous people. She does not even need to go looking for them, they just come to her as if they were begging to be shot to death by their wrong actions. The Courageous deals with morality and proper use of violence strongly at first, and then suddenly it glorifies it. The ending is very negative and completely immoral and inhumane. It also denies the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, which the film spends so much time trying to develop evenly, and suddenly its morale takes a comeback. The morale in The Brave One becomes very fractured, and simply shatters all over the place to the end. So is violence okay? Is it good to commit murder as long as it's for revenge? I practically refuse to believe it. You know why? Because I have a conscience, that this film certainly does not have. It is not right to take someone else's life, no matter how bad it is, or how much you hate it. Erica Bain tries to stop these evildoers, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard provide a lot of strength for this movie. The Brave has a strong message, but that message is immoral and wrong. This movie may look beautiful, well represented and cleverly strong. But it gets pretty bad in the end. I give The Brave One 1.5 out of 4. The message is very out of line and morally incorrect, and really can not be saved by good performance.
