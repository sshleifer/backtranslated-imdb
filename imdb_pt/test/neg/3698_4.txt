This is the kind of movie that BEGS shows on TV at 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the filmmakers responsible for the "50-Foot Woman Attack" thought. they were making a pertinent statement about women and dating and the dangers of the rum rum, all wrapped up in a science fiction allegory. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was a tax cut. <br /> <br /> Either way, "Attack" proves to be better for the viewer in the following circumstances: a) extreme intoxication, b) seen in a double account with any of these films by Jacqueline Suzanne (perhaps "Once is Not Enough "?) Or c) only one night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect. Pop in "Attack" and you will feel good, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special FX and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved on some monument somewhere in Washington D.C. - it's simply memorable. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Attack of the Woman of the 50 Feet"; buy a copy, send it to Gloria Steinem - she'll love you for it.
