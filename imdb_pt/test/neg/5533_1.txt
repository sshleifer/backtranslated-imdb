Wakayama Tomisaburo's portrait of the fugitive ex-Kaishakunin Ogami Itto seemed entirely natural. His behavior, his voice, his appearance, all this spoke of eviction. When he entered a space, I, like the characters on the screen, could feel that he did not belong there and that his determination to be there meant trouble. <br /> I read somewhere that Mr. Wakayama really Kendo Training (Japanese fencing) and that would explain his comfort with the katana, which was magnificently displayed in all the cutfest. If you watch the movies, from the moment he draws up to the moment he sheats the sword, you feel as if you are witnessing something inevitably ugly. He even twirled the katana quickly to shake off the blood before cramming it in, and it would happen in an effortless instant. <br /> <br /> Nakamura Kinnosuke's version appears as an interpretation. It seems like he was trying too hard to be someone else or telling someone else's story. As a result, every time I tried to get involved, I lost control because he did not seem to have a firm grip on the role. As if it were strange to him. <br /> <br /> The fencing on the TV series was entirely from Hollyweird's old school as well. Camera cuts to disguise Mr. Nakamura's clumsiness with the katana, slow action, stalled targets, etc. Extremely bad, from the point of view of the viewer. There was a moment in The Castle Wall Attack episode when Mr. Nakamura drew his sword like a child. It was embarrassing. He dealt with it like he was heavy! I almost fell out of my chair. <br /> <br /> And let's be frank: the story is about an excellent swordsman. Period. Fencing is a problem. <br /> <br /> Realism is not, though: fencing in the movies was excellent and manga-like, as I intended, I'm sure. (The baby stroller was equipped with a set of automatic quick-fire muskets operated by a 3-year-old? Yes ... manga style.) It's how history integrates historical cultural accuracy into basically the super- hero who makes captivating films. (Read Musashi from Yoshikawa Eiji [% historical legend]%!) I could not really watch the episodes of the TV series. They just felt cheap. Watch the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about.
