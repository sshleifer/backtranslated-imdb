I was really disappointed with this movie. I had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters. As a result, I was very excited to see this on DVD. I thought it would be a fast-paced horror movie with many scary surprises, but instead, it was a predictable movie in a snail's rhythm. He dragged and dragged without a climax and after all the difficulties that these people passed to try to escape, the end was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for a reason. This is not your typical horror movie with a central bad guy cutting off a handful of people to death. The story makes this film unique and provides a change for people who watch many horror movies. Even though I do not like this movie, I recommend that all horror fans see it at least once. You may surprisingly like it. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there is NOT a sequel to this forgettable movie.
