4 of 10 <br /> <br /> An unbelievable plot with some haunted house-type "clashes" that really do not fit. <br /> <br /> Gary Oldham's performance is very erratic ... not so much the quality of performance, but the consistency. Your character does not behave consistently. Sometimes calm / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes violent / loud / almost crazed. It's not just believable. <br /> <br /> Many movies of the 80's dated badly? Will they be nicer in 20 years? <br /> <br />
