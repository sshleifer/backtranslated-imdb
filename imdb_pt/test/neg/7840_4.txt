"Maximum Risk" is a step closer to Van Damme and a little bit more of the inspired action movie B that we have come to expect from the films featuring the macho Belgian martial artist. The film has plot holes, a lot of nonsense, a messy plot and a beautiful Henstridge who spends most of the time looking as if he's waiting for a cue. "Maximum Risk" is by no means distinctive and probably will not have much appeal beyond the young male audience. (W-)
