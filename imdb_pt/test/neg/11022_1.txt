I'm starting to wonder, after reading some of the reviews here, if I watched the same movie as the other reviewers, but after checking my facts I'm forced to a sad conclusion that I have. <br /> <br /> The witless wannabee comedy has to be one of the longest 94 minutes I've been through, and one of the dullest things I've seen, for centuries. Now, do not get me wrong, I love crazy comedies, but this tedious boredom falls far short of the vertigo of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that does not deserve (to mix my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as those great. Writer / director Charles Martin's dialogue is not witty, subtle or interesting - and there's a lot of it. He also does not know how to end a scene, with some relentless cuts, especially of people coming out of the rooms and saying goodbye, the rhythm of the movie would have been raised and then the fact that the limited number of characters is making crap and things for no reason , for no other reason than this supposedly comedy, would have been a little less obvious. The characters in this film come in and out of love with each other, and they enter and leave the apartments at any time, just to move the little plot ahead. At one point, people desperately yearn for one person, the next day they marry someone else-having been courted and courted so we will not know anything until one of the characters tells us, "Oh, they're getting married!" usually after someone made a faux pas or jumped to the wrong conclusion). If we knew these two characters were in love or should be involved in advance, we, the public, might have enjoyed the experience of seeing someone playing the fool in front of them. As are the characters who have just come across as selfish and petulant idiots, and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a poorly filmed play. The only moments of relief from boredom are Keenan Wynn, who seems to have come out of a different movie and decided to stick around and be a little funnier than all the dull things happening around him. <br /> <br /> Highly avoidable.
