As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the movies he's been involved with, I figured he liked Progeny. I did not do it, although the forms have moments. However, if you are expecting something of the caliber of the Society or Beyond ReAnimator, you could be in for a shock. In a way, this is similar to the Society, being a tale of an apparently ordinary world with horrible supernatural dread ... but that's when it ends. <br /> <br /> I'm not covering Yuzna when I say that. the fault really is not with it, since bad direction is bad direction, but the direction is good. What goes up in the film is both script and acting. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) has written a clever script but does not really work with Yuzna's directing style, leaving him to pause for the actors to deliver long dialogues when he really wants to throw the camera and end his bad mood self. This subject makes the movie strange enough, but it's worse. <br /> <br /> If the movie had been made with great actors, the movie would probably have its own. Unfortunately this is far from the case. The acting is wooden, shocking even for a low budget B feature. The inexplicably successful and renowned Arnold Vosloo destroys all the damned lines with close accuracy, delivering one of the worst performances I have seen in a long time. The man manages to turn every well-considered line of dialogue into the kind of ham line that you will play drunk on the mates next time you're at the bar. 'Hey Bob! Good God, I'm going crazy! WHAT IS ... COME ON ME! NOOOO! Actually, I can try this next weekend. The veteran's last minute addition (and personal favorite) Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film as it should, almost seems to give Dourif the film in a last-ditch effort to stop Vosloo from quitting, but frankly Dourif seems deeply uncomfortable (possibly waiting the next assault of bad acting) next to Vosloo, and even an eccentric twist of it can not resurrect the film. <br /> <br /> If acting was better, this movie would have been good. Hell, it may have been very nice, but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair, and makes the element of terror seem obfuscated and tasteless rather than an organic part of the film. I thought the alien torture / rape scenes were a bit hard to swallow, but the fact that the characters were so poor made them look gratuitous and unpleasant, leaving a nasty taste in their mouths. <br /> <br /> If you really like science fiction and do not have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian walking and a really extravagant rape scene, the progeny will probably be your cup of tea. But since I do, I'll probably never watch it again. Once was enough. On the plus side, this is the only science fiction film Yuzna ever bothered to do, so he obviously was not really satisfied with it.
