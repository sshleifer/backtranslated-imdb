I rated this movie as a 3 and it was generous. The scenery is heavy and gaudy, acting for the most part is terrible. I think Peter O'Toole did a good job as an actor (Tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the film. John Gielgud, despite his brief appearance in the film, still seemed to be playing Hamlet. The hard core porn parts were neither erotic nor did much to promote the story. Ok Malcolm McDowell had a good ass and the guy who played Macro was handsome. The guy who played Claudio, more like the traditional representations of Nero and certainly was at odds with the photo of Robert Graves' Claudius. The climax (?) Murder of Caligula, wife and son is imprecise in that he shows him after death lying on stairs in an outdoor area, when in fact he was murdered in the underpass on the palatine hill that ran along the front of the Flavian Domus that still exists today. There are places in this movie where practically anything caught my attention away from him - merciful distractions. If you want history, read Suetonius or Tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch Passolini's "Salo", but stay away from this movie.
