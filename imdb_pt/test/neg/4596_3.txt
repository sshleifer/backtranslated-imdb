I rented this in my local blockbuster under the title SPECK - this might be the way to look for it, if you still feel the need to see it after this review. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about serial killer Richard Speck. , who killed several nurses in Chicago in the 1960s. Watching the movie, we have the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. Unfortunately, this does not contribute to a good movie. Another problem I had was the almost constant music that let us know that this was a SCARY MOVIE, and some horrible narration letting us know what motivator Speck is. The performance was average for this type of film; to give credit where credit is due, the film is very well photographed for my liking. Your mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> Above all, if you are interested in the subject, it may be worth your time.
