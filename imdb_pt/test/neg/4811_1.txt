Ni√±as Mal is not a movie is a bad episode of an ill-conceived novel. <br /> <br /> The acting is not a bit better than in soap operas, I think the writer and director has seen many Mexican soap operas and can not conceive anything remotely different. <br /> <br /> Give up, go back to your soap operas so you have an audience to please. <br /> <br /> Stop wasting time and money and give a bad name to the respected Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> It's NOT a good movie or a good one, it's a mediocre novel!
