The original Road House is by no means an award-winning film. But it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It should not have been so difficult to make a sequel. There is no need for a big budget, big stars and spectacular visual effects. Even history did not have to be original. All he needed was a good vibe of time and some great fist fights. I do not mean "wire-fu" in the Matrix style, just some well-choreographed bar fights. A lot of them. There are some decent fights in the movie, but none of them are memorable, and the focus is more on the shooting game. Also, the way it attaches to the original movie is laughable, bordering on insult. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, an undercover agent of the DEA who is good with his hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character, Dalton !!!! Say what????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So for Dalton to have a child of almost 20 years (maybe 30) in 2006 ... well, you got it. They give a corny explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". Oh, please. That was almost justified in turning off this movie. But I digress. Schaech is completely out of his element. Of course he can throw some kicks, but he has nothing going on as an actor. In addition, he is referred to in the movie by the bad guys as "handsome boy". I've never looked at men so closely, but I do not think this guy is very handsome. He looks sick. His face is very thin and his sunken eyes make it look like he will faint at any moment. I had never heard of him before, but I think he should give up acting and get back to his day job. Jake Busey plays local drug agent Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at stellar troops, and even made a menacing villain on Hitcher 2. But here, he only chews the scene in standard villain mode. Even his "threatening" dialogue is worthy of yawning. We should buy it as the man who has the whole city in his pocket. But why? What he does? Why does he want to buy a patton bar "by any means necessary"? Ellen Hollman has the role of symbolic girlfriend. A woman with a secret. Too bad the secret is as hard to figure out as 2 + 2. She is the local elementary school teacher who happens to be a former Army soldier. Guess what that means? This means that although she may tremble with fear over most of the film, she will be ready to smash the heads when the skin begins to fly. Well, at least she's hot. In fact, the fight between her and the girl of Wild Bill is the best one of the film. It's fast, brutal and fun. Which brings me to my next problem with the movie ... the fights. Like I said, Schaech knows how to punch. The same can not be said of anyone he faces in the film. Obviously, the film will come to Schaech versus Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He does not possess the pulling skills of a movie fight. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to perform well choreographed fights. He also faced some valuable opponents and had a killer (literally) on the move. None of this here. With some exceptions, the struggles are forced, poorly organized and routine. The punches sound as if someone is hitting a 2X4 on the concrete, and there are even parts where the sound does not match the punch. It's embarrassing. There is not even the good southern / country music of the original. Road House had the Jeff Healy Band, which was a somewhat popular band at the time. This film features a singer named John Otto, whose music is tepid and his acting even worse. He gave a line in the movie, which was probably inserted to appease any fans he might have out there. Either that, or someone owed him a favor. My final complaint about the film is one that goes from being demanding ... to continuity. Movies are filmed out of sequence and then it is the publisher's task to put them together. Well somebody should give a little to the editor of this movie. The problems range from small things like people who do not look in the same direction when a shot changes, even RE-USED scenes at the end of the movie. At first we are introduced to The Black Pellican bar. As the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, the security guards and the people dancing. At the end of the movie, when the bandits were defeated, we took another dose from the same bar, with pictures of our hero sitting in the bar with his girl. The problem is that the filming of the people in the bar are the SAME filming of the beginning of the movie !!! I'm not kidding with you. They are the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You see security guards on the scene who were MATURED at the beginning of the movie. Do yourself a favor, do not watch this movie unless you feel the urge to go out and punch someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do this.
