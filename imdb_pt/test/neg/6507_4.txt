This (supposedly) based-on-a-true TV movie story concerns a woman on the run from the FBI and a seriously * stupid guy. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a kind of "common guy" with a numbing job, an ex-wife, a boy he rarely sees, and some cats. <br /> <br /> Then there's "Elaine-Lisa-you name it" (Tracy Pollan), a smart, sexy, and beautiful woman whose tongue would burst into flames if she told the truth. Roger and Lisa meet when she responds to a lonely heart ad. Roger is one of those poor poor people who seem to be unable to live alone, so after his wife dumped him, he places his ad. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for Roger to find out that Lisa is not a good person but he has no idea how to get rid of her. He does not even have enough sense to change the locks on the apartment door after he expels her. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and watch if you have nothing else to do. <br /> <br />
