Here is example number 87.358 of Hollywood's anti-biblical bias, so typical of them. <br /> <br /> Early on, Ray Liotta's wife did so and the women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned one (dress, mannerism, speech) who immediately sets rigid rules here, stating that "there will be two hours of Bible study each day." <br /> <br /> This is said, of course, that it feels like reading the Bible is the worst punishment you could inflict on anyone, especially a child. Again, the Bible is equated with boring and petty people. This woman, of course, is dismissed immediately. <br /> <br /> Of course, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the contractor and, voila, saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawning.
