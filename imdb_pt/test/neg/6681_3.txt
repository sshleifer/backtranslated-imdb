I was interested in this movie because someone did a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips of him. So I watched the movie. And it's really unbelievably beautiful. An animation masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story does not follow. It starts well, with interesting plots about the people surrounding the Bride of the Rose, but suddenly the elevators fill with water and lose the walls, people float and, finally for no reason, Utena is transformed into a car, and a high-speed chase follows. <br /> <br /> I really like Anime for its ability to make alternate universes, but this universe is just plain stupid. If you are going to watch this movie, in turn, it is better this way.
