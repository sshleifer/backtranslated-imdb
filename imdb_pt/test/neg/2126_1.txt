What could go wrong with a movie that includes a bunch of Italians pretending to be flordians, and something from the lava-octopus-crustacean like the infernal demon fish?!?! <br /> /> Everything is what goes wrong, I tell you! <br /> <br /> This is a very good episode of MST3K because complaints on the right of the ball, which without fault, are easy to do, considering that this movie is a piece of crap with a terrible and annoying plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for the MSTied version. 1/10 for the version without MSTied. <br /> <br />
