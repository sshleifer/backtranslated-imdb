My mother and I went to see this movie because my brother is serving in the US Peace Corps in the same region where he is mounted. In the middle of the film, I decided that given his inability to get what he wanted, the title is pretentious. The subject he deals with might have contributed to an excellent documentary, but because of his poor execution he left me much less educated on the subject than I expected to be. I agree with laura-jane from Canada ("Powerful Message but has no focus"). I also agree with the user who commented that the free narration style of this filmmaker is the opposite of that of Michael Moore, but I do not agree that he presents various points of view and invites the viewer to decide for himself. I agree with a user's comment that "a lesson is best learned when we draw conclusions"; however, our conclusions can only be ill-founded if we are given little relevant information to extract them. <br /> <br /> The main points of the documentary seem to be that 1) The African people who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer a lot. 2) The introduction of the perch on Lake Victoria, inflicted by the Europeans, ruined its ecosystem. 3) The communities around Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy. The best things I can say about the film is that it has tried to relate the perspectives of ordinary people in sub-Saharan Africa, which unfortunately is an anomaly between the films, and which has attempted to portray poverty as a result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal and unavoidable phenomenon. I liked the irony that captured the huge amount of fish that leave the country in the face of a hunger. I appreciated the picture of how out of touch the UN staff assigned to the region was with the people. Like almost all documentaries that do not have the word "women" in the title, this movie can not do a good job representing women's voices - most of the conversations in interviews are from men. <br /> <br /> Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time in order to pick up some key points that I might have missed but I failed to detect Sauper's theory of the relationship between introducing perch to Lake Victoria and unjust living conditions for Africans living near the lake. Also, I might be wrong, but it occurred to me that Sauper could improve his interview skills. Not only the questions he asked and the answers he included appeared to be arbitrary, but he seemed to have a special way of making the interviewees uncomfortable and embarrassed. <br /> <br /> The most attractive development of the film is the suggestion. that the export of perches now works to mask the import of weapons, and that the real economy bypassing the Tanzanians is war, not fishing. Unfortunately, Sauper shies away from conducting a full exposition of the idea (or at least extending the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in relation to the import of weapons) and evacuates the police with a "decide by yourself". If Darwin's Nightmare was created to dispel the myth that the world's first world-wide exploitation gives them "a chance for a better life," he did not do a good job. If it was to describe how the arms manufacturing industry in the US and Europe is responsible for many armed conflicts around the world, it did not do a good job. If it was designed to portray what drives people into prostitution, it did not do a good job. If that meant clarifying the UN's inability to fulfill its mission, it did not do a good job. If it was meant that the meager income that Tanzanians earn from the perch is not worth the human cost of fiddling with Mother Nature to create a profitable product, it did not do a good job. If that meant implying that Tanzania would be much better if Europeans had never come, it did not do a good job.
