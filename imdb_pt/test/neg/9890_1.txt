This movie was supposed to happen in Milford NJ. I know the house she is based on, just like the person. As you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the World Trade Center incident. I know that, because I was one of the cops who helped identify her remains. She was the only one in our lost area. The nudity in the movie was a bit far. I'm not a prude, but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two women without really showing the whole thing. This movie is in bad taste and I can not see how her family would give her the blessing. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
