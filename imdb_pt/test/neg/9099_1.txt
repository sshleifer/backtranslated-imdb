Looking at the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and it's certainly * a * parody, but I'm not sure what (a fairy tale, an opera, a Hollywood movie, if there was something like that), and I can guarantee which is not worth watching. It is simply a meaningless film (cf. a good parody is all but meaningless), with pretentious and superficial speeches of extremely schematic characters. It's like a commedia dell'arte. Or rather, it's like an unsuccessful commedia dell'arte. And the score ... sung in an intentionally incompetent way (something that Greenaway will use much more efficiently), is painful to listen to (unless someone uses the latest headphones, haha). Choose quality movies (eg, A. Mitta, like Tsar Peter the Great, married his Moor, 1976) and avoid this mistake.
