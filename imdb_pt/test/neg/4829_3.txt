The speed I believe to be direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I did not watch this) gives an impression of a test match that is very exciting in the first four days but then comes to a very annoying draw in the end. I watched this movie today on January 12, 2008 on the rented VCD. It's release date is October 19, 2007. But still well, fortunately for me I did not know or heard much of this movie before, except that it is a failure at the box office. So in that situation, when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie might have been a very good movie, but the director again falls into the trap of Bollywood traditions and wasted a good chance. <br /> <br /> Of course like a Bhatt movie, it should be copied from somewhere else. But now it does not matter to me if I have not seen the original movie. I just found the main theme very much like 'Nick of Time' and 'Badshah'. In the film Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks he is a chef. That brings back the memory of 'True-Lies'. The only new part was the use, if the phone. But this I also discovered now is taken from the movie Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mix of so many other movies, the future is quite clear. <br /> <br /> The things I like about the movie is the rhythm. As the name suggests, things really happen quickly, and there is not much time to think between scenes. But that breaks in the last 20 minutes of then where the movie goes in the traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is also quite interesting. Three stories going parallel, one after the other. One of Urmila's kidnappings, the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the prime minister's assassination plan. These three stories blend naturally as the film continues. <br /> <br /> But the very ordinary acting and the unnecessary extra style killed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri, no one else makes any impression. That goes for Urmila, who always promises films in RGVs. Due to this normal acting, some scenes do not really convey the feelings the director wanted. For example. the scene at the end, where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. But instead, we just waited for the end of that scene. <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, some unnecessary love for the style demoralizes the film. Showing such cool villains is good for Hollywood movies, not for Bollywood. The background of London is also just to make the style and one can not take much advantage of the intelligent advantage of that background. Especially in the end, all those dhishhumdhishhum were totally unnecessary. May be director has the impression that the climax of Hindi movies must have such fights. They seem unrealistic, increase the length of the film and ensure that people are leaving the theater before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Above all, I find the film once watchable. Whether it is coming on TV or you can get it on renting your OK. But again, make sure you have the remote and advanced button on hand. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can watch other channels safely.
