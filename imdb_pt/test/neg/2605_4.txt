That could have been great. The voice-overs are exactly right and set the characters to a T. A small problem; the appearance of the characters, especially the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same look bored on all faces only with minor changes such as hair or size of weight. It seems kinda strange to see the voice of a big guest star coming out in a lifeless way like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a narration for this show and it seemed too strange to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, one of them being the plot of the family. The Simpsons did a lot better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got into. Here we have a lot of annoying distractions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we should find this funny, but for some reason the delivery is a little wrong. As you can probably say it's hard for me to put a finger exactly on what's wrong with this show because basically it's nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "Married with Children." <br /> <br /> If I should point a finger at what's totally wrong with it, it's probably repeatability. Peter Griffin is not really a brilliant character, but neither is he. Lois should have been called Lois Lame because she is half-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and this is the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> So what else can I say. There's exactly nothing wrong with this show, but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons did for almost two decades.
