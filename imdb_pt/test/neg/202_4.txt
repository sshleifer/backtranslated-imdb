That looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, right legal? And a $ 42 million robbery - it looks like a cop. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment - I think the stars have made all the money because the production values ​​of this are terrible. <br /> But more than that, the pseudo-reservoir atmosphere of dogs when easy crime goes awry. It is very made for TV material. <br /> <br /> All in all extremely disappointing - score points for being what it is - but misses them massively for being, bluntly, not very interesting at all ...
