This is one of those movies you find when you stay up late and only have one basic cable. It's hard to believe that this movie was made in '95, considering it looks like something from the late '80s. Brave young men with varying problems at home face a demented ice cream man who is on a mission to make the best taste ever: Soylent Cream! !! <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely insane and just scary at how scary and absolutely, ridiculously gross it is. In fact, the most scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home. The fact that these children have not escaped their silent sufferings in the suburbs makes any random madness in the neighborhood feel like a walk in the park. The most laughable part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypes The "fat boy" is so obviously a skinny preteen with a mountain of quilts under his wide pants. I think either a) they had not invented / could not afford a fat suit, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a chubby child star or c) we honestly supposedly believe this child is starving and has a belly hugely distended. <br /> <br /> So if you're up at 2 in the morning and need something ridiculous and disgusting to fool your intoxicated friends, go ahead and take a look. Personally, I'd rather be sleeping.
