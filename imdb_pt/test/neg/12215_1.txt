Negative numbers are not available to show how bad this movie is! Wood acting along with a plot that has been rewritten dozens of times. Everyone in this movie must attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think that an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young people at a preparatory school are preparing to face the shelling of Pearl Harbor. This raises interesting questions, but the way they are conveyed makes it more of a joke. The typical characters were present, including the zealous and nerdy athlete (glasses included). I could not be more disinterested in the dialogue of wood and clich√© characters. Upon completion of the movie, I had to play the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this failure! You will not have the 90 minutes of your life back!
