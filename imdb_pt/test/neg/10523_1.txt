OK, we were going along with the stereotypical experience of the bad orphanage and explaining to our son, adopted from Russia, that this was exaggeration and dramatization, so that we could get to the dog playing football (since he plays football). But the last scene, in which the dog returns to its original owner, put my son on the edge and he cried for 15-20 minutes, "he was replaced !!!!" That of an elementary child. I do not recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child; He shows the adoption, orphanages and adults bad - and in the end, despite winning the game - the dog the boy relates needs to leave - and that's too much. Please be cautious if you have adopted children, and watch out for families with biological children, because the impression of adopted children is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and unpleasant. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's reaction to this movie ...)
