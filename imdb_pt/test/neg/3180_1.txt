I am shocked and amazed to find miserable short comments for this horrible movie. I rented this "movie" or feces, whatever you want to call it, with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching. Just listening to the dialogue, I left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. This movie was as clever as an ass. I hope I never see that Anne without a similar bra and rag (Julianne Nicholson) again. It was like watching the putrid pilot of a sitcom that will never hit the television, but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes (all I could find out) this was an excruciating 90 minutes.
