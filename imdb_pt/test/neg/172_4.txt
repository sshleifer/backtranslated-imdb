As noted in other reviews here, the camera work is ridiculously bad. I'm tempted to say that the director of photography is 7, but that would be bad - for 7-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Ok, but what's the point? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry around the world, you know, Mondovino. What the film deals with is a very narrow vision of an intrigue in this world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that puts the whole context in context, so we get the director's selective process and interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There is no shortage of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. There is a lack of impartiality, however. <br /> <br /> Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera plunged, swerved, widened a chaotic flourish. Small producer in France: good. Huge producer in the USA: very, very bad. Forget the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America, Australia and South America. There is a dead horse to hit here for over two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about intrigue, it is best to read about it elsewhere. And you will be able to taste your favorite wine without feeling bad while doing it. <br /> <br /> I suggest a new prize in Cannes for the Diatribe of Best America.
