Critters 3 begins on the road as Clifford (John Calvin) her teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and her young son Johnny (the cast list of two actors Christian & Josephh Cousins, identical twins, perhaps?) Are returning home on vacation. Suddenly, the tire in your van blows and they have to stop in a public resting area to fix it. While there Annie & Johnny meet a boy named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes that one) who, in turn, meets Charlie McFadden (the co-producer of films Don Keith Opper) of the two previous films of Critter. Charlie tells the story of Critters and the town of Grovers Bend, but they do not believe him. Meanwhile, in the van, Critter puts some eggs on the bottom, out of sight of everyone. Once Clifford repaired the tire, the trio set off for their home, a run-down urban building in Los Angeles, somewhere full of Critter eggs for the ride. Upon arrival, the eggs hatch and the Critters head straight into the block of tenements, quickly leaving Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the janitor. While the evening attracts the few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repairwoman, Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple (Bill Zuckert) and Ms. Menges (Frances Bay) get together. with Clifford and his sons to fight against the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance as his stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the group be able to defeat the Critters and prevent them from becoming dinners? <br /> <br /> Directed by Kristine Peterson I think Critters 3 was an incredibly indistinct movie, but at least she can say that she made a movie looking at Leonardo. DiCaprio and many people can not say that! The budget for Critters 3 probably was not exactly a fortune, since all production seems cheap everywhere, there are very few characters, very few Critters and I think only 3 appear in the same scene at once and it ends with any kind of angle of space so there is no expensive ship or special alien planet far away to pay. David J. Schow's screenplay is strictly by-the-numbers and very predictable. A group of humans are trapped in an isolated situation with the Critters and have no way of contacting the outside world for help, this plot scenario seems very familiar, right? Well, it's the same as the previous Critters (1986) and Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror films, so it should. Critters 3 does not do anything with the premise, never tries to add anything to an already old, tired and well used storyline. Critters 3 is also very tame for a horror movie with only two people being really dead, the comedy elements are seriously lacking, as well as the best Critters 3 joke can heal being a Critter eating some beans and then farting, very funny if the its about 5 years. The characters are mostly cliches of horror films and quickly became annoying. There is virtually no blood or blood in Critters 3, just a few bloodstains and disappointingly Critters 3 actually seems to go out of their way to not show any kind of violence. The special effects on the Critters are OK, but they still look like static and simplistic puppets that have very little movement. The acting is not so good and Critters 3 is Leonardo DiCaprio's first feature film, to be fair to the boy, he's fine, and I wonder if any other cast or crew had an idea of ​​what he would become. . Why the hell does that Charlie guy have to keep showing up in those Critter movies? To give Critters 3 some credit, it moves at a good pace and is not annoying, it is usually done well with good production values ​​and is a little harmless if you are with the right kind of humor and fortunately it lasts only about of an odd 80 minutes. Overall 3 critters is a waste of time OK, but do not expect anything deep or meaningful. There is nothing really wrong with this as cheap horror movie, but I could not help but feel that I had seen this before. An average time waster that is not as good as the previous two Critter movies. Critters 3 ends with a "be continued ..." as it was filmed back with Critters 4 (1991) which, unsurprisingly, went straight to the video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch on TV for free, otherwise do not bother.
