First, when does this plot take place? It has to happen after the first film because Kuzco knows that Pacha and Chicha have their third child, but it can not happen after the second movie because Kronk can not get a girlfriend or wife or something? You never see her on the show. <br /> <br /> In addition, why is Kuzco going to school? The whole plot of the show is that Kuzco is going to school so he can be emperor. But was not he an emperor before that? And who is the emperor while learning to be emperor? Should not it be Yzma? Or has Yzma already been fired on this timeline? And if that's true, why are you hoping he will not become empress? Also, you know in the first movie that he said he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private tutors. Then he must know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He is about 25 they claimed in the first film. He's an adult going to high school. Does everyone think he's an idiot? I really like Kronk, but I think because of his age and because everyone knows he's working for Yzma, he should have been a teacher. Being a Home Ec teacher would soon be in your alley. <br /> <br /> Malina, it's very unpleasant. She supposes to be Kuzco's love interest / moral compass. But a long time, she leaves bossy and knows everything. She often says that I like "I should be proud because I'm beautiful and smart." <br /> <br /> She has ESP when it comes to Kuzco and always knows he is in trouble when he is cheating, or even when he sings the Hot Hot Hottie song on his head even though she applauds leader , school newspaper and keeps A + straight in all its classes. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in using her beauty to make Kuzco do the right thing and get on well in school then going out with him. In fact, she seems more maternal to Kuzco than with a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. As I bought before Yzma is trying to get Kuzco to fail, she becomes Empress. I'm not sure how it's supposed to work with being fired and everything. Yzma seems to be reliving the first film in each episode. In almost every concert in which she appears, she turns Kuzco into an animal in the hope that he will fail a class. (There are only 3 times I can think this did not happen.) The jokes about being old Yzma are not as smart on the show as they were the movie. And classic jokes about Yzma are used to death on the show (like "Pull the Level, Krunk!", Roller Coaster and Lab). <br /> <br /> Also, some other points that do not make sense in this series. The fact that every time Kuzco is assigned to something that everyone acts like this task, will cause him to pass or fail in class, but he seems to go through all the tasks that were given to him. So why is a task so important? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who rules the kingdom as it happens? Do they have a consul or a butler? You never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless Kuzco has lost his powers or Yzma is empress. <br /> <br /> Why is Kuzco going to a normal peasant school? He should not learn about leading a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I could see some normal classes on how to cultivate (so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that), but tie it up? How useful is this? <br /> <br /> Now I know someone's going to say "But it should not make sense, it's supposed to be funny." So they should have more funny things there. All the funny things about the show have already been made in the movie. Also, if they notice some of these huge plot holes, why do not they mock them like in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk arrive at the secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can not explain how they got the first one.) There are a few good points, it's good to see some of the characters in the first film in the series as Bucky and Monkey with the bug. Pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good sense of land. I feel this series would be fun for the younger kids. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the series is not as good as the movie it is based on, but may be good for younger children.
