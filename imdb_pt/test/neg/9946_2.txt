As Jennifer Denuccio used to say in Square Pegs: "Love me through the door." I would definitely vote for this movie on IMDB's worst movie list. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a Chicago guy who goes to California selling his brother's jazz records. He should be a barney placed in the local surfing community. But he acts more like he's new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). There are also the ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. That of Duke (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to get TT to act like a normal human being, the obnoxious drunken surfers who betray their girlfriends, and the guy who bets with another that he can live in the car for six months. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just a big old mess. It starts out as a typical romp of the '70s, complete with bad songs from the 70s (although this movie was released a year before the 80s). And Dennis Christopher comes out as the most annoying loser, makes the movie difficult to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Even though this movie was about the culture of surfers, the surf scenes are almost totally junk. The people in the surfing contest seem like they can not help falling asleep. <br /> <br /> I think the only cool thing is to see Tanya Roberts out of her role as Midge in the comedy "That's 70's show." And Cassell was not bad, he was just in a bad movie.
