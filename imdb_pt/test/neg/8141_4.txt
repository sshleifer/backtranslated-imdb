Certainly not a low budget film, this "Bride of the Gorilla", but nothing special, not even memorable enough to be ranked among the significant Sci-Fi efforts of its time. Director Curt Siodmak was an eminent screenwriter during the 1930s and 1940s and delivered stories to some classics of the genre ("I've ridden with a zombie", "The Wolf Man"), but as a director he obviously did not have the necessary skills . "Bride of the Gorilla" is similar to the aforementioned "The Wolf Man" in the story and the atmosphere, but the film seems much more amateur and pitiful. Both deal with cursed men who turn into great animals at night, but the titular gorilla does not look as threatening as the werewolf, although the film was released a decade later. During a tacky opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a sinister place and hides many mysteries, but in fact there is no real mystery in the plot. Just deal with a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague for having a beautiful young wife and he kills him. A native woman witnesses her crime and puts a spell on Barney that makes him turn out to be a horribly big gorilla at night ... Or maybe she just wants him to believe that he's turning into a horribly big gorilla? Lon Chaney himself is the police commissioner in charge of investigating the murder, while Raymond Burr (who has starred in about 1,000 Perry Mason films) portrays the greedy plantation administrator / nightly gorilla. Does Siodmak try to make the film look like a supernatural thriller? is or is not it all just happening in Barney's head? ??? fail miserably and this causes a lot of talk and very little action in the jungle. Several of the jungle settings are well portrayed, but the rest of the "special" effects are cheesy and poorly made. Still the acting is very good, Barbara Payton looks beautiful and ?? although very predictable ?? the story is strangely convincing until the end. Weird movie, probably voodoo-damn me ??
