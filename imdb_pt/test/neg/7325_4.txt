I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays a victim of cerebral palsy who is aided by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging into China, flying in a balloon, and so on are her way of dealing with a dark existence. I admit that I made a quick advance in one of the scenes in which the two share friendship and simple pleasures, while the piano soul music plays in the background. Okay, three or four of those scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, it was fourteen. But I sat down and watched most of them.
