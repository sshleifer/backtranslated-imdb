OK, it's watchable if you're sick in bed or have nothing else to do. The suspension of the disbelief required to pass through this film is significant. First of all, in today's modern society, do you believe that college students are able to commit to someone in that short space of time, even if you are a "virtuous" Habitat volunteer who likes autistic children? And the 2-week romance flourishes in an exchange of letters that leads to John's "conflict" about rejoining soon after 9/11/01 ... REALLY? He asks her what to do? All the guys we know will not be sitting behind the scenes after the Towers fall (my husband was one of them and I love him and I'm proud of him for going). John's character is so flat. He's almost deadpan the whole movie. He looks good, but not Spec Ops ... he seems insecure, not confident, quiet instead of creating a hell, without tattoos, gets into a "fight" with the little boys who is nothing more than a little shove .. walk around without a cover on your head almost the whole movie ... and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulets upside down?). The war scenes are idiots ... John and another guy going out on his own ... huh? Then another guy gets shot and John drags him 10 feet and starts giving help before securing the area or the arrival of support or even having your backs against the cover ... it's a shooting for the love of God, you do not stop fighting until it's over ... I wanted to shoot John from behind. Back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine ... we hate her for taking off her shirt in his presence ... WTH? Break your heart and then provoke you into adultery? She's a prostitute from the main box. The best part of the movie is when he gets away from her ... at least he had some respect and honor there. Overall unbelievable story and we generally do not care about these characters or their love. Discouragement!
