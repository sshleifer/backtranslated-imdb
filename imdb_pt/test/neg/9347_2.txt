After missing several times at TCM UK, I decided to take a look at their science fiction / adventure / camping pedigree: I knew it would be a completely silly ride - but it was also incredibly bad! Anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the screenplay rips many science fiction titles from the recent crop - SOYLENT GREEN (1973), ZARDOZ (1974), LOGAN'S RUN (1976; to the extent that it was filmed in some of the self- same sets!), STAR WARS (1977), ALIEN (1979) and MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR (1981)! The plot is simple but not exactly engaging: from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all this happens - then our disorderly buccaneering heroes are stealing ice. blocks of tyrannical Templar rulers (!). Also involved is a beautiful princess (Mary Crosby, daughter of Bing!) In search of his father, the deposed king; By the way, the cast includes another famous daughter: Anjelica Huston (daughter of John) as one of the pirate bands - fortunately, the actress's mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten, following her Oscar achievement. the guidance of his father, not less) to PRONZI'S HONOR (1985). Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the "Supreme Commander," the filmmakers have chosen to have their own screen legend - 78-year-old John Carradine (who is seen stuck to a sort of operating table during his brief scene!) The bits most notable (for all the wrong reasons) are: the alien using the bathroom; the castration machine; the awkward pranks (including fighting the karate style!) of the inevitable robot companions; the goofy slave / eunuch used at one point by the heroes; the recurring attacks of "space herpies" (whatever that may be); the climax in which the characters are made to age when they pass through a period of time (Crosby gets pregnant, gives birth and sees his son to grow in the space of 30 seconds, while the own leader Robert Urich is replaced by John Ford. for this scene!) - indeed, the jumping cuts adopted here (intended to denote the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating.
