Take a clich√© story and insert Steve Guttenberg. Need I say more? This really is as bad as you'd expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery try to turn a group of useless and useless children into a winning football team. Missing originality and direction from the offset, it is a difficult struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenberg's ability to play, I can safely say that the performance of the coach of the rival teams is actually worse than Guttenberg's. Previously unimaginable, I thought. This kind of story of underdogs struggling to the top was done before and better every time this so called 'movie'
