"Opposing Force [1986]" was not as good as "Dr. Strangelove" and was not as good as "The Bridge on the River Kwai". Wow, it was not as good as "GI Jane", which is very sad. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around a basic ethical problem: in a simulated prisoner-of-war situation, how far do you go before you start breaking the law? What exactly is the law in such a situation? How can you simulate someone's torture without actually torturing someone? Can you intentionally inflict pain? How about breaking bones? Simulated executions? Sexual abuse? Severe blood loss? Real weapons with bullets? Death? Somewhere between these is a really diffuse line dividing "acceptable" from "atrocious". <br /> <br /> Now, what could you do if you were in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality began to disappear? ? What could you do? This movie tries to portray this dilemma. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in "resistance training." I have a brother who went through the USAF POW training program. According to him, he was very close to the target technically. <br /> <br /> The film has a good premise, but it does not have a particularly good story. I wondered if it could be based on some real event, but it became quite apparent that it was not when the explosions began. They must have swapped three-quarters writers for the movie because it takes a real extreme turn and turns into a rather pointless shoot-em-up with lots of blasts that distract. <br /> <br /> I thought it had a pretty unsatisfying ending; again, half-senseless. I wonder what the whole thing was - I'm beginning to suspect that it just did not exist. It could have been so much better with just a little more history to keep up with the fireworks.
