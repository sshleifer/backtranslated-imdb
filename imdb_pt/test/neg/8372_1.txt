This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (I'm turning 47)! The description on the back of the cover was the same as the scroll text at the beginning of the movie. The additional plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their "acting". I saw the full length and was really relieved when the death of the final character signaled the end of my suffering! The place was some sort of dome or a dirty beach. I suppose the home video equipment served as a camera and the lighting was below standard. The dialogues were uninspired and meaningless. As were the faces of the actors. Which brings me to the topic "make-up": by their looks, they got tricks in some teen magazines "my first make-up" or something similar. What made me buy the DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection to the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon," which was erroneously translated as "Book of Light." The 4.70 EURO I paid for this DVD was a complete loss as the DVD entered the recycling box without further ado.
