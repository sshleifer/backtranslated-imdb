Excellent example of disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two chosen actors for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be aware of the performance during the first screening of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the review for the second screening. In the case of "Full Ride", the performance was so weak that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was very busy (during the first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea. Fortunately for most individual cast members, virtually everyone in the group is weak, the limitations of individual talent do not contrast with any real competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least physically well matched, finding a common basis in appearing too old for their characters' credible age. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script requires particularly intense and compelling performances to portray its characters, which only exposes Smith's incredible lack of talent and Monroe. On the plus side, they know enough not to look directly at the camera and not stutter. <br /> <br /> It is better to have used a less attractive pair that could physically pass through the proper age. The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation of "An Officer and a Gentleman," but would have provided a good showcase for a talented pair of "teen" actors. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a child
