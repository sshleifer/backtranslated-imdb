I received this movie in a package called "50 All-Star Movies" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good. This was terrible. It was a banal retreading done 1000 times before and getting better. A crippled former athlete is challenged to train a team of juvenile delinquents. They learn from it that they can do it if they follow the rules. I'm sure the kids and locals were thrilled to be included in a "real TV movie," but I can not imagine what the people who launched and produced this project figured out they could bring to that already overdue subject. I've been waiting to see that 'new twist' or 'new angle', but honestly, that's not coming. Avoid this movie. Forget the 45 cents, I want the 96 minutes of my life back.
