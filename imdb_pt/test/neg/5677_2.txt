This show was an incredible, fresh and innovative idea in the 70's, when it aired for the first time. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things fell after that. In 1990, the show was no funnier, and continued its decline further to the total waste of time it is today. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully poor, the performances are almost as bad - if it were not for the moderately entertaining guest rest, this show probably would not be up yet. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who chose the original cast also chose the band that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then find it convenient to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I should give 2 stars out of respect to the original cast that made this show a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can not believe it's still in the air.
