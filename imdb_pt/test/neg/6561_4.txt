The weaker of the 'old' films in the Star Trek series, this movie suffers from a horrible script and obvious budget constraints, particularly in the abused end. The bones of a good movie are here, and Shatner's direction is not as bad as it is commonly made, but the characters end up talking and acting differently from the style that the previous three films had carefully established. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the renegade Vulcan with mysterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, particularly for Deforest Kelley who shines like McCoy 'Bones' in his second film. However, however good these scenes are, they do not advance the plot and end up feeling more like a distraction. A great score of the always reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite among the top three are not enough to cover the gulfs of the plot, and the frankly embarrassing attempts at humor only serve to alienate even the difficult trekkies. All in all, a wealth of possibilities that, although it does not fulfill, has its moments. Watch out for the pool table in the bar brawl scene ...
