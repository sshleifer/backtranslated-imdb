I went with some friends and one of my mom's friends, thinking it would be a good way to start spring break, but the movie turned out horrible. We all agreed that it should not have been PG-13. More like material R. Much sexual dialogue, cursing and referring to parts of boys and girls (below the waist). Not worth the time or money. Encourage him strongly not to go or rent it when you leave. If you end up going, do not take smaller children. Not the kind of movie to watch with the family! If you're curious about the content, check out the content consulting section on the IMDb page of the Superhero movie. Most of the content that should have been funny was extremely gross. Especially when they mock Steven Hawking.
