Apparently, this was a prize winner. Apparently someone had a gun against his head and was forced to point out Maize: the Movie. <br /> <br /> Or it must have been a mistake. <br /> <br /> This is the most incontestable film. always done. The showing and editing is the biggest horror of this movie. Two girls get lost in a cornfield and are chased by someone who can be heard laughing under their rubber mask. The girls run to the hero-father and run away from him, W.T.F. The father-hero of the movie continues to lose control of them in the few minutes watching this. <br /> <br /> The girls were obviously not trained actors, and they had no sense for them. They were so annoying and so childish in the movie that they were not even remotely comic. Hearing them scream again and again like a broken record was the reason why I got up and left. You can not even hear this movie without almost getting into convulsions. <br /> <br /> I can throw up a better prize than this crap.
