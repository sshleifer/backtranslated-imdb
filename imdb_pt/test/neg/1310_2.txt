I really do not joke when I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable for Sunday night on ITV4. <br /> <br /> The underground scenes are terrible when London is supposedly under 30 feet of water, Robert Carlyles is a monotonous character. The clothes of the police commissioners reminds me of something that Kate Moss created and Nigel Planer looks VERY OLD, in fact, I'm worried that he might have suffered a stroke while filming. Robert Carlyle's dad who was 'right all the time' was obviously testing a lot of Ketamin and while he has a major part in this awkward journey, he deserved to be killed long before he was caught pretending to be Kate Winslett (Titanic) as he swung over the Thames Barrier. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry movie lovers, but avoid at all costs.
