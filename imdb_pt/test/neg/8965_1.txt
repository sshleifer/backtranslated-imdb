This film is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. I could not believe what I was seeing and hearing, and I did not believe in any of it. Hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but that was ridiculous. Being a jerk, I know how it should be, and it's not Kate's accent in Back Bay. The only thing I found most funny was the fact that the guy who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was cast as another countrymen, with an accent to combine. Maybe it was a joke, think about it. I can think of no other reason for this kind of peculiar cast. Well, maybe that. I noticed that Natalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on Gilligan Island, appeared in this play on Broadway. Can you imagine what part she could have played?
