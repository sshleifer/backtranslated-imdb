I'm also a fan of House Party ... House Party I'm my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a shame for all HP's and Kid n Play ... This should be part of a series really.there is nothing about the kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea The kid n play was probably very old to release a House Party movie b / c, your kind of focus on teenagers ... but the kid n play could have made at least one apparition ... you can tell how good it was b / c nor did it come to movie theaters. Imaturo was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to continue the legacy ... but they should have represented it right ... they should have left it in House Party 3. I'm 27 and I've been attending House Party I since I was 11 when he left in 1990 (16 years ago) and I have been a fan since then. When I first saw House Party 4, I was like what they are really thinking ... There was nothing familiar about this movie that compares to the previous 3 movies .. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller off.
