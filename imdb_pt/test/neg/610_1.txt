This program uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat fat idiot with the pretty (and sometimes look-alike grumpy) wife and in-laws. With this show, he is unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman, who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a beautiful wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in the basement of his daughter and son-in-law. Kevin James's Doug is his typical beer drinker, sports lover, a comedy man who prefers watching the subway rather than dealing with his marital problems. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by the couple in this show. In addition to the few laughter provided by Jerry Still's crazy character, this show was generally not funny. Imbecile behavior of Kevin James generally caused problems of the show that usually solved by his wife. This show continued a series of sitcoms with the fat stupid father / husband and their beautiful wives who all seemed to run on ABC for some reason.
