Dr. Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum. He takes a different approach to the insane. He performs unorthodox methods of treatment. He treats everyone like family, there are no locks on the doors of patients and he lets some of the prisoners stage their distorted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) get dressed and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) be the mother of a doll, including letting her put him to bed in a crib. Dr. Stevens is standing outside leaving Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) to cut a log with an ax, and that ends up being a bad move, since Dr. Stevens is back, the Judge plants the ax on his shoulder. Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium, arranging an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is greeted by Chief Nurse Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a position on the trail. She knows and becomes well liked among patients. However, things start to sour, the phone lines are cut off, a lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut off and she begins to have a strange feeling that things are not right somehow. Then one night, all the dark secrets of the Sanitariums are violently revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this film has a great central idea that turns into a cool ending, but ultimately it's a bit difficult to be solved because of its low budget constraints and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are many long, boring snippets of dialogue on the part of the prisoners, which does not happen until the final twenty minutes. The film does not have a real visual quality, since it is fully installed in the Sanitarium and its terrain is basically a big insipid house in the middle of nowhere. There is no coarse blood in it, a few bloodspots here and there and that's it. There's a bit of nudity, but it's not that much. The acting is very strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photograph is flat and uninteresting and I can not even remember what the music was like. The end of the twist is great, but it takes too long to get to it. A movie that had so much potential that was probably held back by its budget. OK, I guess, but I think it would have worked out much better if the story had been turned into a half-hour episode of 'Tales form the Crypt'.
