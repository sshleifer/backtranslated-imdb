I read the book 'Scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time I saw it. I'm afraid to say I was disappointed. The movie did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. <br /> <br /> One of the changes I did not like the way Lord Fenton was portrayed. It made no sense to make him a bad man. The way things ended between Lord Fenton and Scarlett was very different and their whole relationship was too intimate. There was also much less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett in the film than was originally written in the book. The film sent the two in two completely opposite paths and they did not seem to cross each other often enough to make it seem like there could still be love between the two. A good movie, but I believe it certainly could have been better than it was if it were more faithful to Alexandra Rippley's book.
