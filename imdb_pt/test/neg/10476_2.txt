John Knowles' modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, is one of the many subtle, and subtly is the word of the clock, themes of love, hate, envy, denial, and repentance. The 1972 version attempts to address this style and what the book is - a love story with war appearing in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use subtly, but is evident in the portrait of the story. What you're looking in the face when you read the novel - it's a love story, and yes, maybe it's debatable, a gay love story. In the novel and film version of 1972, there are sexual tones everywhere in texts and dialogues. In the 2004 film version, these tensions were omitted and the actors were there in the late 1920s playing teenagers, which provoked the mature acting out of any tenderness or hesitation. of innocence in youth. <br /> <br /> I did not like this remake for more reasons. The hair that broke the backs of the camels was that Phineas received a surname in the letters he received from the lead planks! Finny is a character who does not even need a surname. John Knowles did this intentionally. <br /> <br /> Although I accept the 1972 version, the acting was sometimes a bit amateurish, so what, tried to be sincere for the novel, filming on location at the Phillips Exeter Academy that The Devon Acedemy was based in; which also writer John Knowles attended as a student. Directors and producers took all of the teenage students of Exeter, with the exception of Parker Stevenson, who attended The Brooks School, to play in a Paramount movie! Class class by preppies compared to this Canadian college shooting, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - Vetar in this sham try again. The 1972 film version, with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson, was the real deal of A Separate Peace on the screen. The movie Showtime 2004 made for the cable version was not.
