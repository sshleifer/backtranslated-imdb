ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin off and not much of the original Nickalodeon RUGRATS that featured the babies Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi (Chuckies' sister) and Dill Tommy)). I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. He had great humor, good stories and the creators of the show, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of babies' adventures. The new show ALL GROWN UP attempts to recapture the magic of the original design. I was disappointed when I saw this. I found the "all adult" annoying Chuckie and all the "pre-teen-mature-of-action / trying-to-be-popular" that applied to (sadly) * all * bland and faded characters. There are still some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the entire RUGRATS baby gang appear ten years their age in the original show. Overall, this show is 'fair' and only watchable if a) you're a diehard fan of RUGRATS, b) you've never seen the original show, c) you're a preteen that has nothing to do, or d) you is so bored that somehow you're forced to watch this show. This show is not so good. It does not compare to the older episodes of RUGRATS in quality, humor and everything.
