Interconnected views may be a good idea in some films. Here's a total mess. <br /> <br /> But the total mess starts with the story: a bummy video-clip wants to film a light comedy with a pernicious female character noir. She is beautiful and no man could resist dipping and crawling and sucking her toes. She is even more materialistic, looking like the butter would not melt in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The movie dissipates in its own pretense: to be clever / funny / handsome. Phalocretinism at its best. White trash just, please.
