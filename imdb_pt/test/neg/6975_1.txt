and in general, you will eventually have to research this little gem. When describing I Changed My Sex, or Glen Or Glenda as he is best known, I must repeat the thoughts of Andrew Smith, who hit so hard in the head when he wrote "If you have not seen any of Ed Wood's other films yet, this is a If you've watched some Ed Wood movie, it's still completely disconcerting. " The film is both hilarious and tragic, but moves with a strange rhythm itself that leaves no doubt that its author knows and means every word he is saying during the duration of his execution. Wood, bless him, had some of the highest ambitions as a director, wanting to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s of all time. When Tim Burton recreated Glen Or Glenda's vision of studio executives for his biopic, he showed the executives laughing and telling each other that this had to be a trick. More than fifty years later, there are still people struggling just to receive the kind of respect that "normal" takes for granted, so I say it certainly is not. No, the real comedy in Glen Or Glenda is the sheer ineptness that Wood exhibits in the composition of his message. Directors often use footage when they can find some that fit their purpose and can be edited to fit their own footage. Ed Wood used a film indiscriminately, and the biopic of Tim Burton celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood, interpreted by Johnny Depp, bets that he could make a whole film out of the stock. Unfortunately, the real Ed Wood died before he had a chance, but Glen Or Glenda is the closest he got. IMDb says that twenty percent of this sixty-minute movie is a movie, and it's never difficult to guess which movie. Images of busy highways, overhead planes, poor lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing, are all used randomly, sometimes over and over, and often have only a loose connection to the story Wood is trying to tell. If Wood had been able to sit down and think about what he's been trying to do for a while, there's no telling what kind of height he could have attained. <br /> <br /> Wood himself appears in the film as the headline. character, a confused transvestite who imagines herself as a woman named Glenda. In addition to the bold way he tries to explain, Wood makes a hideous woman. Having found myself on the fringe of a society that thinks I am "disabled" and needs to be "healed," I honestly found myself expecting the best result for Wood's character. To emphasize, however, Wood weaves stories of two other transvestites. One takes the extreme step of undergoing a sex change in order to become a woman, the other finds himself so deprived of rights that he fears being arrested again so much that he commits suicide. The scary thing about this movie is that if you edited transvestism and replaced such deprivations as my position on the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little of the film would even have to be changed. This is how little society has learned since Ed Wood was a boy. <br /> <br /> The other significant personality in Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, whom Wood bought in the film. Speculation varies according to Wood's motives, but the theory accepted is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career, and would do anything to achieve that. Except for taking the time to carefully build a good movie, that is. In Glen Or Glenda, Wood makes use of Lugosi who was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as "bizarre." Lugosi plays a character called The Scientist, but leaves more like an omnipotent puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood movies before the biopic will think Tim Burton made the speech "Be careful of the big green dragon at your door." If anything, Burton was being restrained about which bizarre speech to use in portraying Wood's dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the speeches in their original context, not even Criswell's hilarious claim during Plan 9 From Outer Space. <br /> <br /> Observers will also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend at the time. Again, Burton shows his reaction to seeing the script for the first time, while the film shows it as receptive and visionary. I can not help but feel that Burton's portrait is more accurate, since Fuller seems extremely uncomfortable in his role. She only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her delivery seems so mechanical, so lifeless, that she somehow manages to look less talented than her castmates, if that's possible. If Wood's direction was better focused on this case than usual is difficult to determine, but if the cast's ability to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is a guide, then it should come as no surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role within another Wood movie. The fact that she has written several hit songs tells her that she made the right decision to stay behind the cameras. Although Wood appeared before the camera again, it was never more than a cameo, a walk-on or a part. <br /> <br /> I gave Glen Or Glenda one in ten. I usually only give this rating to movies that are so bad that they become fun as a result. Bold and well-intentioned as it was, Glen Or Glenda fits that description for a T.
