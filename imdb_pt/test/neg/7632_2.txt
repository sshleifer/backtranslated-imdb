Sorry I could not be more expressive in my summary, but those two words seemed to describe the film perfectly. This is not just a bad movie but a bad movie with bad acting and a plot that will be irrelevant to most observers. Just look at a Rebecca De Mornay naked tied to a wire fence and groaning in ecstasy; supposedly "erotic" but actually hilarious. <br /> <br />
