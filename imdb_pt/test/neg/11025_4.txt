I decided to watch this movie because I had not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry, it had to be this because, frankly, is this dog? and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both great actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put very, very fast, in a story about a young lawyer. (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour after meeting her. What is this cliché? Marrying in a hurry, repenting at leisure ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the worsening financial status of couples, their problems with John's mother, their struggles to pay bills, John's diminished status in the office, the arrival of his baby son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with his mother), marital distress over marriage, worsening baby illness, thus necessitating a heroic flight by a solitary pilot (in a violent storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner in the law firm. <br /> <br /> How many more cliche situations do writers include? Maybe the mother dies soon after? There was not much comedy; the drama was dull, at best; the dialogue was painful to hear. Only the performance of the four main players was adequate. <br /> <br /> Was this the period at the end of the Great Depression with the US coming out of its long crisis? during which many people experienced all the events portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> So, did it make sense for Selznick to reaffirm the good old American values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative? ? all against the backdrop of the "average" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> And, it should be noted that the film was released early in 1939; so it was planned in 1938 ?? soon after the United States began to produce the next world war. So this type of film was a great booster for the general public at the time, many of those who would soon have to join Britain in the war. As many here know, Hollywood and Washington formed an alliance before, during, and after the war. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad I saw this ?? as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. But, I'll have to see other Lombard movies to gain a better appreciation of their acting range. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted: see this just to say that you have seen all of Stewart's films; otherwise, do not bother.
