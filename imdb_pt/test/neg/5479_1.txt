This could have been the best game of all time !! But the creators of the game were only hurt after 3 murders and the final !! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hit Man, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered one of the biggest games ever made. <br /> You combine the four and win this game !! It has all the good aspects of the four games like acrobatic skills, sneaky killings, open world and HISTORY !! For the first 3 murders you feel that this game is the greatest !! But after the third, things seem so repetitive, you just wait for the GAME to end. <br /> <br /> I played this on a PC and the PC version is horrible with glitches and stupid missions are meaningless. <br /> <br /> My advice to all. This is a good game, but get it for the XBOX360 or PS3. Do not get it for the PC. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game came from the creators of Prince Of Persia. Surely the producer is hot, but the game is not hot and is not better than the four games mentioned above !!
