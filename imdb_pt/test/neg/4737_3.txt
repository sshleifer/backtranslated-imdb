Anyone who has watched "Alien vs Predator" must have known that the conventions of "Alien Quadrilogy" were not exactly adapted for the film. Among some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the aliens is apparently a matter of minutes, Aliens with extremely long tails and so on. However, the idea that the Predator species provided the impetus for building the city and temple to create a hunt would be such a handsome warrior that I could not resist. <br /> <br /> I hoped the end of the movie would not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately, I was wrong. For those who forgot how the first movie ended, the Dead Predator had an Alien in his chest that carried the traits of both species. <br /> <br /> For this movie, I'll just go through a list of "good" and "bad" traits. <br /> <br /> The Good: Many wonderful people, especially men. <br /> <br /> The Bad: Many wonderful people are chewed by both the Predator / Alien mutant and the Predator. <br /> <br /> The Good: An interesting idea from the planet Predator. <br /> <br /> The Bad: An inconsistent scale of a city. It is a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated sewer system (read: big city) and no roof. Is it a small town or a city? The police force is a sheriff and three deputies, or at least I counted. <br /> <br /> The Good: Hum .... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why do these mutant Aliens / Predators grow? so fast? In a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to life size. I mean, come on ... what are these things ... Aliens Pet Chia ??? And while we're on this subject, why is it that an Alien inside the body of a Predator mutates, but an Alien in the body of a human does not? That makes sense? <br /> <br /> The Good: Still thinking ... <br /> <br /> The Bad: Why would only a Predator come? And why pour acid on all the remnants of the "aliens," but decide to kill a cute little cop, and then stab him and hang him upside down. I mean, so much for being incognito! <br /> <br /> The Good: Ah ... I'm stuck. I think there are many loud sounds! <br /> <br /> The bad: how do these mutants / predator aliens breed? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kind of kissing move, they lay several cubs on the woman's body. Yes, just what you would like to see, right? Pregnant women with their bodies explode on mutant aliens - as if the previous path was not coarse enough !!! I mean, there's not even an Alien Queen. <br /> <br /> The Good: I said that the guys in this movie are beautiful? <br /> <br /> The Bad: When a nuclear device explodes buildings, how can a helicopter survive the explosion? And how cheesy for one of the passengers to ridicule the pilot "I told you not to fall!" I mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he will not have hair left !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think you got the message. Mutated Alien / Predator explodes through the dead Predator's body, grows on the subject for a couple of minutes, kills all predators and manages to land. More mutant Alien / Predators are created, while a despicable Predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills humans. Alien Mutants / Predators kill humans. Humans kill humans. It sucks to be a human in this movie, huh? <br /> <br /> If you are impressed by many bumps and bumps, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked First, I suggest you skip this sequence.
