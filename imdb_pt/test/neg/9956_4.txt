First of all, I have to say that I'm not usually a big fan of werewolf movies in general. It's not that I do not like them, but I do not like them very much. There are some that I liked ... London Werewolf (1935, Stuart Walker), An American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some that I thought were ok but nothing special ... The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but overall the werewolf subgenre is not my favorite. But I had this on one of those 50 sets of footage so I thought I'd give it a watch and see how it went. Mad Monster is a werewolf tale, but the werewolf is mainly used as a vehicle of revenge by a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron discovered a way to turn humans into beasts, specifically wolves, but was ridiculed and banished by the larger scientific community. Forced to leave a prestigious position, he goes mad and plans to take revenge on those who ridiculed him in an old country mansion, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (the lovely Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) with limited mental abilities. Using his serum, Dr. Cameron turns Petro into a werewolf and sends him to kill his former rivals. Eventually, however, the werewolf Petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are dead. <br /> <br /> The film also features as a crime / crime drama with the claiming Lenora (Johnny Downs) journalist. investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the outbreak of murders. The story seems to borrow many elements from other great figures who came before it. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in the creation of a monster that runs loose and the creature killing an innocent child. Visions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, version of Victor Fleming) and The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner) also come to mind. And that's one of the problems with this movie, in my opinion - it sounds like a mediocre fusion of great movies. It does not add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> It is true that there are some redeeming qualities. George Zucco's performance was compelling, and the scene showing Dr. Lorenzo talking to his visions / hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me by showing his insanity. There is some reasonable character, at least in the case of your character. But the character of Glenn Strange is not at all convincing, and seems to have this comical quality - whether intentional or not, not sure - that simply does not fit the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I seemed to enjoy more than most IMDb users based on my rating of 4/10, but it was still a below average movie. It might be worth it if you're a fan of werewolf movies or a big fan of horror movies from the 1930s and 1940s, but it's unlikely to appeal to you if you're not.
