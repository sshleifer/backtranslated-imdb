Yes, I realize a half-dozen other reviewers have called this movie "Copying Amadeus," but it can not be said enough. Scenes seemed to have been drawn directly from Milos Forman's script with only superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> -The arrogant scene of the conductor ("I am the voice of God, everything else is meaningless!") <br /> <br /> -The teacher making fun of the work of a mediocre composer (complete with raspberries and simulated flatulence, as in Amadeus). <br /> <br /> -The mediocre dialogue of the composer with God ("Why do you instigate me with music but deny me the ability to compose? ") <br /> <br /> The musical dictation of the deathbed scene (" Common Time. Start with the violins ... cough ") <br /> <br /> The list goes on .. .The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes copied without shame, they were not very well done. Jeepers, if you're going to rip an original, at least you should try to perfect it in a creative way. <br /> <br /> No, wait, there's something even worse than that. It is the fact that the director tried to overcome the history of Mozart in the history of Beethoven. Guys, Beethoven was not a vulgar and vulgar rascal as the film portrays him. In addition, Beethoven was not a chatty idiot who gets tips from his copyist, a 23-year-old music student. Unfortunately, movies like this are responsible for the massacring story. <br /> <br /> And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) has never called him the "Moonlight Sonata" as he does in the movie. This name was given by a confused critic some years AFTER BEETHOVEN DIE, and unfortunately got stuck. But the original title of Beethoven was "Quasi una Fantasia". <br /> <br /> And another thing, when Beethoven (in the film) screams "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" and hit the note on the piano, it's hitting a white button! <br /> <br /> AND ANOTHER THING !!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th Symphony. This movie shows you as having only a small deficiency (saying "what?", All other lines, just enough to be annoying). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! The American accents ...! Oh never mind. It just does not matter. I've wasted enough time on that. Go see Amadeus again. So if you want to see an interesting biopic about Beethoven's life, see "Beloved Immortal," which takes poetic liberties, but at least they are interesting ideas. Lastly, if you want to see something on the lighter side, check out "Impromptu," a movie about Chopin. But beyond those three, I've never seen a good tribute to a classical composer.
