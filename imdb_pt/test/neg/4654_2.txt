Very bad. This movie about an old gray-haired (and frankly stupid) prospector and his dog 'Shesh', namely Lassie, as well as a boring kid whose name I can not remember at the moment. At the beginning of the film, the old gold digger was buried DELIBERATELY in some sand, so the poor dog had to dig it up. Because? Did he hate the dog? Anyhoo, somehow or other this idiot managed to strike gold, and will tell his partner. But the man died, and his other despicable partner is happy to help old Jonathan dig up the gold. The old man tries to leave, he's a dog with the son of the dead, but not even the retard wants to stay with this boy. There is a quaint preacher (for a weird reading), and the greasy guy broke the old man (surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. In addition, he poisons the dog and tries to kill the boy too. So I suppose it's alright that a Lassie..and she's diabolical and crazy ... SHEP does it with the guy at the end, although it's quite disturbing in what's basically a children's movie. There are extremely stereotyped (to the point of racial insult) "Native Americans" who speak without using verbs (as in "Make Me Camp Fire"). And that's basically casting, because apparently Lassie's salary was too great for them to hire anyone else. Kind of bland. not very interesting, and a little too dark. Not a great movie anyway.
