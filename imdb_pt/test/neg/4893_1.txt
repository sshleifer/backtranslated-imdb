This movie was ridiculous from the start. Let me spare you all the time watching this movie. A woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes her cousin or nephew and he persuades her to open a coffee shop downstairs. She does and she and her cousin come close. There's a scene after, where she's licking her lips with him. Later, the woman discovers that an old boyfriend is coming back from prison and is tense between them, leading to a fight in the cafe. The cousin / nephew of the woman is in love with the man. The ending was horrible, the story was horrible, and if I could turn back the time wasted on this movie, I would appreciate it. A definite leap.
