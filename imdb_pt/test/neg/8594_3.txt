The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so big that it has become the theme song for the IRON CHEF TV show (although it is too much used and too intrusive in the movie). So how did this movie turn out so weak?!?! Well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were as one-dimensional as possible. And the dialogue?! What person really would allow himself to receive credit for inventing the STUPID machista bullshit that pretends to be a dialogue? You get a lot more realism in most cartoons! The bottom line is that this movie has some good points but it is so spoiled by banal cliches and rotten dialogue that it quickly becomes tiring. And that's a pity, because the firemen deserve a better homage than this mess! If you do not believe me, look at the number of errors listed in IMDb for this movie - way above what you'd expect to find. They just did not care enough to solve all problems and problems. So as a result, the movie seems rushed and needs to rewrite and re-edit.
