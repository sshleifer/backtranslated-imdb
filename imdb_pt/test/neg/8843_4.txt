Although this starts promising, a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard! This gave me the impression that we would see something special, something almost like David Lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately the film starts going anywhere, without a central center, just a kind of winding story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. The study of the character takes place all over the place, and I really could not care less about any of the characters, especially when part of the story suddenly goes into flashback mode. I had some hopes for this movie, but after all, it was a little disappointing.
