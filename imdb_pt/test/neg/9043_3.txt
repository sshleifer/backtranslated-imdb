I recently saw a copy of this (under the heading 'Eaten Alive') Talk about terrible! Any movie that Ed Wood has released seems an Oscar material compared to this laughable laugh. To be fair, some lines in the script will live long in the memory, like "These people (cannibals) do not buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they buy it everyday from people like you or me" Classic! The jungle-mad 'Jonesville' leader was the best character in the movie, he really looked like a nutcase. I think he was the only actor not to be dubbed (badly) if these Italians should have American characters in their films, why they can not get Americans to settle in the dialogue, rather than English people struggling to sound like Annie Oakley. I'm going to give this 3 out of 10, I'm going to give three because it's funnier than most comedies nowadays.
