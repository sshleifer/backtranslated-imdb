I've seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day, but that's the best of them all! The bizarrely uninteresting cast diminishes the story, which is itself false to the book. Mr. Tilney is not handsome; as for Catherine Morland, a rat-like appearance makes this heroine difficult to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is nothing like the Aphrodite that reads in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film very little to leave the viewer any understanding of his important role in the story. In addition, as others have pointed out before, this novel was intended to satirize the gothic mania prevalent in Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft terror" film was conceived and intended to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen shows up in her grave every time one of her fans is disappointed with this awful interpretation of what should be a joke.
