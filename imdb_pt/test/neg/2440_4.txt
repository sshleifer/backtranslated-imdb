Justine can not find the perfect partner to make her the perfect first time. With friend geek in tow, she goes into a virtual machine to improve her appearance. When she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to her imagination. The problem is, how many obvious sex jokes are left over? How predictable can this type of movie be? Some funny moments here and there, but nothing very scandalous or different from the jokes of other movies or even normal life. If you liked WEIRD SCIENCE or jokes about 'fish out of water' combined with 'gender identity crisis' then by all these means these 90 min you will enjoy.
