A great gangster movie, with brilliant performances from well-known actors with great action scenes? Well, not this one. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see such a wide cast of well-known actors, who have many good films in their filmographies in such a film, no doubt that this may be one of the biggest hits. It was worse than they could appear. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is as you would expect from your ordinary gangster biography, nothing new, nothing fancy about it. The way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is (when I thought the two hours should be almost over, I was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed). <br /> <br /> The action scenes look a lot like those from the TV series 80ies - the A-Team, for example. It's just that in the 80's (especially with A-Team) these scenes were much more sophisticated than those of "The Godfather". It's especially fun to see the guys aiming their guns into the air and still hit something (not to talk about people hiding behind car doors that later seem to have been hit). <br /> <br /> Acting fits very well with action. Or you get the same reaction to everything that happens (Dolph Lundgren style), or it's so exaggerated that you may think it's a parody (but unfortunately it's not). <br /> <br /> My advice is to stay away from this movie, any other gangster movie is better than this.
