The film takes place in Newcastle, Tyne, in the north-east of England, the city where I was born and raised. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it presents the city, children, but above all the men of the city. In this movie they are all stupid, violent, thieves, thugs. <br /> <br /> I suppose I could comment on the plot (predictable), the performances (competently uninteresting), the direction (lazy and unimaginative), but to me this is irrelevant compared to the director's insult to the city and his people. <br /> <br /> So, the invitation in my resume to the director and writer, Mark Herman, to leave the northeast.
