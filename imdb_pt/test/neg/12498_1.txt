Oh gosh! This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is incredibly repetitive; each scene seems to consist of people being shot, running in circles, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very annoying. I would not mind if the fight was good, but it's not; the main character Phillips pushes the various henchmen with ridiculous ease, and no matter how many times he is in full view of the Tracker, he is never hit even though extras and minor characters are being fired and exploded around him. I rarely saw a worse cast of actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can even call him "actor"), but this is not really surprising given the dialogue with which they have to work (example: "Computers killed my brother! "). The plot is a sub-par tear of the excellent Terminator; the special effects are laughable. Overall, this movie is absolutely terrible. And why does everything explode?
