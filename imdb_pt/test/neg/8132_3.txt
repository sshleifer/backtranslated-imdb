I really wanted to like this movie, but it barely got 3. It's amazing that equal amounts of votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were fun and even talented, but as a whole, the movie did not yield. . Sebastian Hernandez is attractive; charismatic and sympathetic (he even looks physically with Marc Anthony in a more accessible, but even conscious way) ... but even he could not save this mess of a movie. Scenes dragged on for too long and the spots were finally beaten to death. The banana scene permeated self-absorption, apparently showing how much movement there was in his boxer. But in his defense, it was his first film as a director (which I know) and I appreciate his love work. It just left me empty despite what I was trying to be told. Ultimately, I think the story would have been best handled by a seasoned director. From what I've seen of the 'extras', there's a real story behind it and, maybe when I'm done watching them, I'll appreciate that attempt.
