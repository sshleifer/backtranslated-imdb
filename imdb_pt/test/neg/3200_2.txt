I'm a big fan of Critters' first movie. The second episode is good, but not as good as the first Critters. The third episode is a bit annoying but lovely. And what is this?? More sucks! It's stupid and very, very annoying. It's the worst of the show. I can not watch it again, because I felt asleep on the first watch. And the evil side of Ug ... eeewww ... this is one of the most horrible moments in the movie. In the first 50 minutes, we can not see the little furry monsters, which is why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better. <Br /> <br /> 2/10
