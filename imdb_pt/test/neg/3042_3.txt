While babysitting in a secluded Colorado home, a teenager is terrified by an indescribable killer on the phone. <br /> <br /> The remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the first 20 minutes of the original movie and excerpts to fit a time period of 87 minutes! So it goes without saying that the plot of this remake is too thin. There is little in terms of originality or interest in this film. There are a lot of Camilla Belle wondering around a dark house asking who is calling her and finding all kinds of fake scares. Everything gets repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and can never get up much in terms of suspense or chills. Certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since the wimps-out and changes an important plot point of the original. I think we have the PG-13 rating to thank for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side there is an impressive design and a dark atmosphere, unfortunately there is not much happening around to save this remake from being sub-par. Belle's performance is also pretty mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another blank remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
