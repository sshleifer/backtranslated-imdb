Do all parody movies require sheer stupidity and lack of ANY kind of intelligence for humor? Is there only one genuinely FUNNY parody movie? All I see are zero quality movies that look like a couple of high school students getting bored one day with a video camera. These movies are not funny, they are not intelligent, they are not fun, they are useless in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> The Comebacks were a movie that tried to hide its heinous level of crap. for not being called "Sports Movie". It's the same thing, though. There are a few different writers for these films, the Wayans did some, Freidberg and Seltzer did a few others, and I'm sure there are another couple. I can not even tell the difference in direction or mood to be honest, it all seems like the same people wrote and drove. I can not tell if the Comebacks were made by people who did Scary Movie or the guys who made Epic Movie, or somebody else, are just the same jokes as everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you have Any taste fragment or humor value, do not watch this movie. If you have self-esteem, do not bother to see it. If you have ANY respect for the movies, do not even think about watching it. Do not see it in any abandoned and abandoned theater that can still carry it, do not rent it, do not do it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, not Redbox and do not even watch the OD for free. Avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> The only possible reasons to see this movie are as follows. <br /> <br /> A. Masochism. If you like to torture yourself, there are very few better ways. B. Seeing a great example of why avoid ANYTHING that says "Atomic Fox". C. You are getting considerably high amounts of money. <br /> <br /> I would not really watch the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100 to do it. It's just crumbling mental torment. <br /> <br /> You can also watch Zohan.
