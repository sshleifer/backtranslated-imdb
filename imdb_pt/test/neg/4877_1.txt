Where do I start. Let's list the good things about this movie first. <br /> <br /> 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as the Gangster Thomas. This is the only character you'll really care about, and he's a bad guy! (he never does anything bad, and he's usually a very nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. He's a little weak here, but he's still pretty funny 3. The movie looked pretty good by Swedish standards, good use of depth of field and lights. <br /> <br /> Now, the bad. This is by far the worst roadmap to reach the big screen ever. The acting of all the others was very bad and exaggerated. The direction was awful. A totally meaningless story, characters and events totally unreal and 1.5 hours long. During emotional scenes almost everyone in the theater laughed. People started dating during the course of screening. <br /> <br /> There is no way to really summarize the story into something coherent, so I will not even try. Every clich√© ever conceived is there and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Watch for a good laugh, but try not to pay for it;) <br /> <br />
