You would have more excitement to cut your testicles than watch this, clearly a trick for you to rent "Descent" instead of "The Descent" which is a much better movie. <br /> <br /> This is a total theft of "The Core" and much, much worse with regard to special effects, I could do better with a box of corn flakes and a roll of foil, I want say, come on ... that "Mole" thing, had more resemblance to a vibrating dildo than an underground vehicle. <br /> <br /> Do not watch - if you find the room, your scent will smell strange the next few days and you will have that uncomfortable feeling in the back of your head, you should kill yourself or something.
