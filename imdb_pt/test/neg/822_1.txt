Do not tell me this movie was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is just funny on Channel G's Ali G Show. After watching his performance, all I can say is he's not made for movies. With a Daft script, or more like no plot, there is nothing to keep you entertained. Full of annoying and unrealistic character this movie is a complete trash all the way. At the end of the film Ali G gives a speech. He mentions, if you hated this movie, tell people it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie, he probably knew it was going to be a stinker. I would give a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. Overall, do not waste your time with this crap.
