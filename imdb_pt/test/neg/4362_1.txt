Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2 stunk, but the first was better. The special effects in this film were nothing special. Even though the murders were better in this issue, they were nothing to boast about. One thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters. They suddenly changed their emotions, and some of their lines were just idiots. For example, a character quoted, "You'd better have some R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or you'll find out what it means to me." Once I heard that phrase, I realized it was the worst I've ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was the fact that it was too short. A hit movie has to last over an hour and twenty minutes, as Killjoy 2. If Full Moon is part 3 of Killjoy, that would be leaning to the lowest possible level. Overall, 1 out of 10. <br /> <br />
