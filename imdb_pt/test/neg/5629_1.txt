SPOILERS FOLLOW - and I did not even see it. <br /> <br /> Let me guess ... the murder is related to the evil property developer wanting to develop the river, and Dickens was murdered because he was trying to discover a similar cowardly plot. If anyone who has seen this warns me that if you have the right half, you will have spared me the time it would take to watch something worthwhile and the rest of us will know to avoid this movie and its enthusiastic critics. On the other hand, it sounds intriguing; but if it were any good, would it really be given with a Sunday cloth? And what kind of Foley record does it anyway? <br /> <br /> So, as a public service, I got through it. It's worse than Swept Away. Same. I read stories of eight-year-olds with more drama than that. Really awful. And I was kind of right.
