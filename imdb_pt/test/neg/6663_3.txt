While traveling by train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​erroneously leaves at a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. The sooner you find out that a strange lonely man (Jim van der Woude) who does not speak your language is the only person in this area and that this was the last train on that track. The man lodges her in their home and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them. "De Wisselwachter" is an overestimated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that leads nowhere. I like movies out of Hollywood, but this story is very absurd and has no message at the end. The sexual tension between the two main characters is funny at a time, but very repetitive. I saw this movie on an old VHS and the image is too dark; I do not know if on DVD the image would be of better quality. In the end, I was absolutely disappointed with this feature. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Man of the Line"
