Dear Film Director: <br /> <br /> In the future, when trying to create a sense of urgency, it may be best for your hero to 'run' instead of running / shuffling. Especially if you are trying to reinforce a timeline. For example, if you're trying to convince the public that the villain is actually going to kill the hostage if the hero does not find it, it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes this can actually happen ... Let's face it, it. Making a movie * good * obviously was not your goal. His goal was to pump some junk that would generate more money than it would cost. Otherwise, you may have hired some actors. <br /> <br /> Regards, bored viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can not say it's the worst of them all, because I managed to finish. It was bad, bad, bad though. Dude, where's my refund?
