Reluctantly, he gave 3 - a point for each to Fonda, Stanwyck, and the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this one before - I'm watching now and it's just got to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs to the threshold. If I keep watching, it will be only to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to take this one out of the dumper. <br /> <br /> But after reading the comments of the other viewer, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The first skiing scenes were enough to get me out of my lunch. The narratives were obviously made in a sound studio, and the issue between the outlets and the closes was horrendous. I do not know much about the technology of that time - but I can not believe there was something they could do to make it more believable. <br /> <br /> My second sigh of disbelief was when Fonda cleared and (I imagine that due to the extreme speed of the trip) he is buried headlong in the snow to the torso - Stanwyck pulls him out with obvious staged difficulty - and , (I wonder why she is such an experienced doctor) does not react at all to her seemingly unconscious state and flabby posture. <br /> <br /> Look, I am quite capable of suspending my disbelief, but I could not get over the fact that she had just pushed a man with a possible head injury and that he could be paralyzed all over life. Not my idea of ​​big yuks. <br /> <br /> So when I finish this comment, we have just seen Kirk's first envy, and Dr. Hunt is going to have an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate the most - the script, the background music or the story !! Argghhhh! I finished. End of the game. Click.
