I saw this movie a few years ago, and man, I never want to play golf again. I mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or how it evolved. And I'm not talking about "victimless" things like forging a scorecard. No, no ... Based on what I've seen here, they blatantly massacre cops and golfers on sacred grounds of country clubs. Judge Smailes would be spinning in his grave. And do they repent of their sins? No, no, based on what I've seen here, the typical answer from a dead ninja is to take over the body of a female phone repairer and seek revenge. I find that morally reprehensible, and needless to say, after seeing this absurd, I not only stopped playing golf and talking on the phone, but also decided to stop feeding the homeless.
