My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting Thanksgiving. I rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low budget horror film with stupid special effects, a worse plot and even worse acting. But are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley gets the highest billing? I thought not. <br /> <br /> Since this movie has some entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
