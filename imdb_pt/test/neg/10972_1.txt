I can only think of one reason why this movie was released. To capitalize on Guy Pearce's next fame. This film has no merit and, unnecessarily, it destroys the memory of Errol Flynn. The homosexual encounter was pure speculation. The disdain shown by Flynn in this film is palpable. An easy way to defame an actor who died years ago. Horrible and embarrassing. Very disappointing. Do not waste your time on this total junk. Watch My Wicked Wicked Ways if you want to learn about this great actor or read his autobiography. This movie is not the way.
