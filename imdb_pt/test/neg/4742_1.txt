My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies and I read and read almost every book I can find related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say, this movie is a Stinker. Save your money and do not waste your time. If you like foolish action, pointless gore, no plot to speak of & as being taken over by Hollywood, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a serious fan of the Alien series, send a message to the most stuffed, over-paid suits in Hollywood and 20th Century Fox and not give them a penny. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many holes that you can sift through noodles through it. Read the other negative reviews to get an overview, everything has been said accurately, so I do not need to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And the film does not disappoint, almost all of them die. Even the hot girl was bubbling blond. Do you feel sorry for her? No. No plot, no character development ... who cares. Predators are now idiots too. They examine everything except the dead warrior himself. They must be a high tech society, right? In the movie Predator, they examined the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy kills. At AvP, they examined Charles Weyland and let him go because he had Cancer. Main Conspiracy Hole! <br /> <br /> In addition, the R rating is because they have children in the film who receive a facial hug, a lot of violence and violence and there is a hospital scene in which a very large pregnant woman is injected with breast bags . It is implanted by the Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a love-by-mouth scene and they are all born, say, 30 seconds. Sensational gore much, nothing more. These scenes are laughable, not serious. It's almost as if the violence happened and the Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumb up or a nod of some kind. <br /> <br /> The Aliens in this movie are all on performance-enhancing drugs. They develop rapidly and spread rapidly throughout the city, many of them, everywhere in the spawn time. Pathetic why not stick to the story line of the series and adds nothing to the continuity of Aliens, Predator Aliens. <br /> <br /> I've noticed that positive reviews are written by people who love blood. Laughable. As a movie, as a sequel to the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs. Predator franchise, this movie is a cliché of cheesecake at best. If you faithfully followed this series, all rules have been broken and the Aliens and Predators have been reduced to comic book characters. <br /> <br /> There is not a fantastic and memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects that are worth remembering. There are no brand actors. The plot is as thin as the onion paper that ends with a "We have two choices to get out of this mess ... The Hospital or Downtown!". I almost got wet. The city center means that everyone will be attacked by Big Brother who somehow knows that the city has been infested because it has an AWAC in the air that can see infestation on a radar screen in special effects Red Spots. I almost fell out of my chair. The red dot alien radar of special effects in an AWAC about Middle America. I'm cracking my laughter. <br /> <br /> Having to get to the heliport made me choke on my popcorn. Has anyone ever played a game called ZOMBIES? You have to get your pieces on the Helicopter Pad to win. I almost got wet laughing. <br /> <br /> The end is enough to make you shake your head in amazement. Who did 20th Century Fox hire to write this screenplay? Oh, oh, just ask me ... a 5th grader. There really can not be another answer. Ah, yes, there may be another answer ... Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi. <br /> <br /> The end? "Colonel Stevens takes the Predator wrist rifle to Mrs. Yutani (Françoise Yip) and tells him that Earth is not ready for the technology it represents. Colonel Stevens knows that Yutani does not want the technology to be used in the Earth." You're kidding me, right? Ms. Yutani? Who is Mrs. Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She's in the movie for exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite wisdom from the Far East, she says the world is not ready for technology. Seriously??!! The Dweebs brothers (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for this hemorrhagic abortion of a movie? They are Doug and Bob McKenzie's directors and yet Fox has entrusted the Alien franchise to them. They are presented as special effects experts and yet the film is all special low budget effects. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Laughable. <br /> <br /> This movie is made just to empty your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no plot. There are no major characters worth mentioning. It is disjointed. It does not adhere to any of the principles of character established in previous films. It does nothing to advance the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low budgets. And he has no end to speak. It is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Just it. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Or watch it on TV, where it will end quickly. Buy a bootleg or lose this bleeding ulcer completely. There is a reason why Fox has not viewed this movie for critics. The critics would have eaten this living mess and no one would have gone to the movies to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is at this very moment, leaning over a toilet pouring his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie sucks. It's as bad as it's worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Free now ...
