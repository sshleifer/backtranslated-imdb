I did not even watch the whole movie. Now, I like science fiction movies from the 50s, even when they are very inaccurate, but this just bothered me. On the one hand, a member of the crew on the spacecraft speaks and acts as if they have reached the tenth year. It looks like it should be in a bowling league, not in a spaceship. Outside the spacecraft's window the crew is marveling at Earth and this idiot says, "Can you see Brooklyn?" and another guy says "Sure." And the idiot says, "Wow, I wonder who's throwing?" Forgive me a moment, I think my sides are dividing. <br /> <br /> When they rise in orbit, the chest says: 'The moon is just to look! Take me back down! Watching the team making stretched out mouths and screaming with G-accelerating forces during takeoff is also not one of the best moments in the movie. (Perhaps the best moment of the film can be identified by a big "THE END" on the screen). <br /> <br /> We also discovered that they can not open the hatch because 'the busty' shined before they took off. Of course, a spacecraft will be "greased" by a crew member, which we later learned, never had a space suit before and knows nothing about zero gravity. Like Baby Huey, the old fat cartoon duck once said, "That sounds logical!" The non-gravity-in-space effects are so bad that it's painful to watch. (Everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to rise.) <br /> <br /> Since this movie earns 6.3 out of 10, when other, much higher movies do not have a higher rate, it's a mystery to me . I really like old science fiction movies, but this is not realistic, and futile attempts to play with a character's humor in a gas station mouth do not work - they just spoil the movie. I think in retrospect it's not the whole movie that I hate so much as the fact that 'The Busty' is so obviously not someone who would be in a spaceship - not even to 'grease the hatch'. OMG. I wonder if he checked the fan belts as well. Maybe if they'd let the boob off the trip, it might not have been so painful. Even so, it is only medium. What everyone is talking about, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Do you want to watch a 1950s space movie? 'Rocketship X-M' beats everything to hell. Maybe not so much "realism" but a more serious story and less foolish characters.
