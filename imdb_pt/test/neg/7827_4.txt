Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run naked which is not a bad thing in itself, but when her character talks about all the guys she meets, and see her with Michael Madsen and an Asian guy in the present movie, it made me feel like I needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, as if a disease was going through me or something. <br /> <br /> The movie looked like it was going for a love triangle / drama / action / ??? plot, seemed to just go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The acting was great, the plot, not so good. The director needs to at least choose a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this again, because they are not very good at it, obviously.
