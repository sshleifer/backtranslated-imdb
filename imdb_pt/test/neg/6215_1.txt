The supposed writer and director Mr. Dhawan copied almost the entire plot of Hollywood blockbuster "HITCH," starring Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was just copied and some low-grade humor (probably the creation of the dhawan itself) and frequent dancing were added to increase the film time by local standards. While the acting of Salman Khan and Govinda has given us a few smiles, however, it does not suit legendary artists like them to be part of plagiarism, especially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buy pirate discs!
