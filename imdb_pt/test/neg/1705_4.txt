Except for the appearance of the Austin Powers talented impersonator, Richard Halpern, this picture was taken from the film. References to dated films will not help the public who may come across this effort in the future. Watch for "Groovy" Austin Powers in the hot tub. It's a joke and a half. <br /> <br /> Bad special effects are overcome by the appearance of numerous stars in tiny clothes, so at least this should keep a person entertained (if that's what makes him excited). <br /> <br /> For my money, I rented the DVD of classics like "Airplane" or "Lobster Man from Mars".
