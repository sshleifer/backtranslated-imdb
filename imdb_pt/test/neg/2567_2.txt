Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly outbreak of viruses. This movie seems to me foolish madness that has turned into an unintentional camping classic (the best kind). Memorable lines include "Knowledge is like a deer, chase after him and he will flee from you" and "Drink this, it will make you feel better." It's so sublimely bad - they could not have gotten worse if they tried. <br /> <br /> Segal tries to convince him that he is sensitive - saving a wounded pony; 2. a good father - for a scene of saccharine cooking for his daughter; 3. a man of science - looking at a false specter; 4. in tune with nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural - by having Indian friends; 6. an iconoclast - opening a rural practice after an old life in a national research laboratory; and 7. an action hero - being really fat, but still can fight. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's good to see it as a Saturday night movie, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) Inebriados.
