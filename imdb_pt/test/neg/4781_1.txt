This movie was really awful. It was not at all scary, not even surprising. I went to see him with a lot of friends and by the end of the night we were saying "The Ruins Ruined My Night". <br /> <br /> I would not recommend watching this movie in theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident. It's an absolute waste of an hour and a half. The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and they gave no story to anything that was happening, and then left it completely open at the end as if it were preparing for a sequel. .
