Okay, I'll make this short, direct review for those people whose mental ability is perfect to watch this movie. Everyone knows the ratings of the Motion Picture Association of America: G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17. For the purposes of this film, I think the MPA should create a new rating standard: IQ-20.
