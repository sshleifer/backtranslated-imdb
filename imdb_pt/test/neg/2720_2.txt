I seem to be in the minority, but I thought "Radio" was pretty awful. It seemed to contain almost all cliches in these types of "comforting" films. <br /> <br /> The motivation for the characters to fall in love with the radio was never really explained. We should only accept that everyone liked radio except for a few rotten apples. <br /> <br /> You can see almost every great moment in history 100 yards away. When the movie wanted you to be "Awww" or pull out your tissue, I was rolling my eyes and wished I was watching "Rudy" instead. <br /> <br /> There were some good performances from the cast. Too bad they did not get a better movie to show up.
