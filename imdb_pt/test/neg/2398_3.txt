The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing more and no one else in this movie deserves even a little bit of a star. Well, okay, Amy Adams deserves a little bit, but the method does not seem to be working, so I'm staying with 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you see a trend yet? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, not a chance. <br /> <br /> I could comment on several paragraphs about how the Charlie Wilson War goes over history, morality, legitimacy and so on, but I do not think such a speech could outweigh the fans' gush by Aaron Sorkin. The rest of you, watch out. Use your movie money somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Even so, if you're looking for a comment, here's mine. You can put hot chocolate sauce in a pile of garbage, but that does not change anything. Garbage is rubbish and Charlie Wilson's war too.
