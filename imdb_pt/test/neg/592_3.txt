All those in the PC culture are appalled by the dogmatic Christian view of this film, claiming that it contains racist ideation and / or religious intolerance. <br /> <br /> Those who do not care about this, but are oriented In the sense of smooth production values ​​and competent performance are appalled by the lack of such here. <br /> <br /> Those who condemn both are apoplectic that this production has been released to the general public, as evidenced in the comments here. What is an interesting premise, which is not original, but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is treated in a rather immature way in this film, but made with enthusiasm. What the crew and the actors lacked in sensitivity, professional skills and technical knowledge is somewhat offset by the intensity they exhibit. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as many think, and would be right in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and is enough beneath mediocrity to provoke laughter and moaning. However, it unfolds intensely enough to hold interest everywhere, and is close to an entry produced by Corman in his earliest period of work, or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you can get it for $ 2 (or less) like me, you will not feel disappointed, but wish you could have an opinion on how it was done.
