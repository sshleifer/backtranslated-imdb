I can tell from the other comments that NOBODY could ever really appreciate this insignificant piece of crap, which is the same way I felt. <br /> <br /> The whole time I was watching I was horrified that anyone could make such a stupid movie! What is the world coming to? I think it's my fault for sitting around all over the movie (ugh!) But it was like a bad car accident, I could not look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a boy under 8 years old, you may like this movie. Otherwise, stay away from her at all costs. It's the dumbest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid - the story, the script, and especially the acting, everything! While watching the movie, you can turn off the TV and think "how a movie can be so sadly stupid", or continue watching out of curiosity, to see if things can get more stupid than that (they can not). These filmmakers (if you can call them that) need to go back to their daily jobs, none of them have a talent drop, and I doubt you can make a living doing it. horrible and useless junk that no one in their right minds would want to see! <br /> <br /> Just quit BS Do not waste your time.
