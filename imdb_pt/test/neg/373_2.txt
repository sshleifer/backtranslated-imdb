I just watched Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were fake with more than a few implausibilities. The acting was not so bad and the plot was not bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details. <br /> <br /> Some examples: 1) The bleeding on the Charlie Falon (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown would be coming from the back of your hand while the knuckles were bleeding . <br /> <br /> 2) Would a detective have to eliminate his murder victim from a well-lit area? That seemed silly to me. <br /> <br /> I'm not uncommonly picky about a movie, but in my modest opinion, this is definitely NOT recommended by me.
