Talk about scary. If you really want to sit back and watch this episode where the girl who was on Firefly is later abducted, there is entertainment for you, but only if you like that sort of thing. I do not think so, to be blunt, this episode was terrible. Luckily it's one of the few duff episodes in Season Three, and the only episode from Charles Grant Craig, so you do not get much of that sort of thing in Season 3. So the general verdict? Just read the summary at the top. This is a strong candidate (Hell Money says hi!) For the worst episode of the third season. To be honest, I did not expect too much. I wish I could publish this episode completely. That's one thing they got right: the title.
