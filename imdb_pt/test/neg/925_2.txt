this film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to a younger demographic group of 14 to 24 years and an insult to all of them. I refuse to believe that this age group is as insipid as being entertained by this unnecessary remake. At the beginning of the movie, one of the characters proclaims, "I'm surrounded by idiots." This is the defining moment of the film, which descends from there. replete with cliches, "scare" hay bales and unexplainable events, the film is also full of characters that are not exactly brainiacs, a formula very familiar in idiot horror movies. and that crap of "it's so dark I can not see" scenes stolen from the Saw Massacre, but merely annoying, not building any tension or horror. it's difficult to shoot in the dark and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a movie that supposedly has tension. but my feeling was that the less you see, the better. maybe he did not want to wait until morning because he did not mind unless it cost him more money to do nightly scenes, or he does not know how. who knows? Unless you have never seen a horror movie in your life, or are two or three years old, every aspect of this movie is predictable and done before. Warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. in short, a blas√© slasher movie that begs the question, where h * ll is the wax - was treated as a lost leader. if you're bored as much as possible and all the other rents are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror movie, which is not really scary, or would you like to see Paris have a pole smash in your head, go ahead and take chances. it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but if that's what the producers in this movie think a younger audience wants, I pray they're deluded. a for-profit film, with no attempt to achieve any kind of art or respect for the genre. you know, clever characters make a scary movie. I believe that this is the debut of Collet-Serra as director, in addition to commercials and video clips. he has another in 2006 called Goal 2. I hope your goal is to make a better movie.
