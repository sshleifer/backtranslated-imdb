After 30 minutes ... mostly fast forward, I deleted it from my recorder. The first Critters movie was self-consciously entertaining. The "talk" between the creatures just before Grandma pushes them off the porch, for example. This movie just limps, waiting for someone to film and put you out of their misery. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine anyone who worked in this turkey being proud of it. <br /> <br /> One was fun, four was just awful. Do not worry, even if the alternative is to watch reruns from a TBS "700 Club" fundraiser, you'll have at least a few good laughs there (and the "alien" make-up is more believable ... great).
