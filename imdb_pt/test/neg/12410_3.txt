Recap: A solitary swordsman, living in the wilderness and acting as an agent for other swordsmen, recalls how his life turned out to be as it is. It all started with the woman he loved chose to marry his brother, causing him to leave his hometown. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is in the midst of a complicated love story where a woman wants him to be killed for running away from a promise to marry his younger sister. But the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have Huang protected, and everything is put to advantage when the woman and her sister are actually the same person. <br /> <br /> Comments: I saw the Redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994. As the two versions differ I can not say but the Redux is very heavily stylized on the path of the Chinese action of Wuxia . This is unfortunate how this style to me seems to have overlooked one of the most important elements of a successful movie and entertainment. An understandable story. But true to its stage style and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director Kar Wai Wong. So there are many colorful and very beautiful scenes that have no relation to history. <br /> <br /> The issue and timeline of the story are also battered. Much is left out in the scenes, the timeline is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated struggles, only for themselves to be relieved by something more and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the film is put into the action genre. The poster and the photographs also imply this, but they could almost be considered as false marketing. Only a few minutes of the 90 could be considered something like action, the other could not be further from it. The film in its entirety is very slow, bland and therefore very annoying. Not even the rare action filled the scenes of help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I can say that I am not a fan of this Chinese style, since they often seem to be afflicted. Of these same issues, the most important thing is that the look is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 3/10
