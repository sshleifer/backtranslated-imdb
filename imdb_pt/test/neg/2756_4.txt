I've seen the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but it's not as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently, 1.8 out of 10). At least the movie has some production values ​​and apparently has a competent editor (unlike movies that really are horrible). The main problem with this movie is that it had no attractive characters. The main character, Marv, is so pathetically grumpy that he practically asks for all the bad things that happen to him. And he's not very smart either, or he'd have figured out he'd be far from the conniving girl Betty. And even more pathetic than Marv is his father, who is nothing but a drunken loser. The highlight of the film is the sequel to robberies at the end, but even this is so faintly executed, whatever excitement it may have added to the film is completely absent. At least this movie made a very funny episode for MST3K, since Mike and the Bots do a great job making fun of him.
