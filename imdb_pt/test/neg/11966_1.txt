Getting started with the local sports team involves getting the newcomers to the cornfields and guess what? There's a scarecrow killing people there. Only one newcomer survives but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow begins to kill all the people involved, one by one. What are the secret scarecrows? Will they figure it out before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and it shows. The sound is OK, but the picture is really tacky. The plot / script really sucks and it's quite pathetic and not logical. The acting is very bad and sometimes just laughable. I can not say much about the special effects because there are not many, but the few that there are ranges from bad to OK (for a low budget that is). There is some nudity and this is probably the only thing worth watching in the movie (that is, if you are a horny teenager, if not, skip the movie all together). Another complete waste of time and money, so I do not see it. It goes to hack'n'slash fans too.
