Sorry, Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case you actually put a 'Golden Turkey' egg. <br /> <br /> The plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin, acting more wood than a Giant Redwood and I think it certainly looked like there were pathetic attempts at takeoff from other films, Jaws and European Vacation, to name just two. If memory serves me Eric Idle played the same type of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo were approached to do this sequence. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they lowered their positions. <br /> <br /> In my opinion no one better than Chevy and Beverley in their roles as Griswolds and Randy Quaid complemented them admirably in the beginning. movies. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid should have left the National Lampoon while he was ahead.
