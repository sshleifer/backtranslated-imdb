"San Francisco, O thou wondrously desolate city, Thank God for destroying it, and making bricks fall on our collective heads, and by punishing in the forgetfulness tens of thousands of innocent and obedient sheep, O Lord, who is so merciful in your Celestial ways ... "These should have been the lyrics of the title song of this film so inspiring and totally meaningless. <br /> <br /> The film begins well enough, with Gable discovering a Cinderella with a highly boring but highly prized operatic voice, and she soon shoots for stardom. One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that she is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if she "takes time" to look through all that makeup and facade of glamor of the thirties, realizes that she is kind of ugly. Too ugly to be playing this role, anyway. Yet Gable and everyone glitters around here like she's some bloody beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so humble, healthy, innocent, loving, kind and generous - enough to make you vomit for an entire hour. MacDonald plays his (admittedly one-dimensional) role with the kind of "ahhh," "oh," and "ooh" that serves to annoy rather than make her understanding. <br /> <br /> Tracy has been better, and had better roles than playing this clich√©d priest, heart of gold, who loves God, is not child molester (which he puts in his "free time" - as if the priests had something to do - how cute). Even the ever-reliable Gable does not measure up to its usual standard; he is very excited, and his character is very unselfish for someone who is supposed to be an ambitious western "scoundrel" (although this is obviously the script's fault). <br /> <br /> The plot is basically this: Gable and his rival Holt play ping pong with Cinderella - using it as the ball. As? Well, first she's working (singing) for Gable, then works for Holt Square, then returns to Gable, only to return very soon to Holt. (And, of course, they both want to have her as their girlfriend / wife.) And if the earthquake had not interrupted the table tennis scenario, it's safe to bet she'd be coming and going ten more times, the little princess she is. <br /> <br /> There are many, indeed, musical numbers. It's almost like they're trying to make the first "disaster movie musical" ever. How silly. The things she sings in Gable's "articulation" does not have a problem, but when she starts letting out the irritating and raucous barking during the operatic segments, it was when I felt my ears being provoked and unjustly attacked by the enemy's sound fire. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES. 6 may seem little to those who have had no experience with Vietoperanam firsthand with such horrors of auditory torture, but it is as with dog years; the year of one dog equals seven humans. One minute of opera is tantamount to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or a dog urinating acid in his leg). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but it's more like a near-disaster movie. (I read that part of the dialogue in this film was written by a film director SILENT-ERA ... Jesus ...) The melodramatic process, and only occasionally entertaining, is interrupted by the true star of the film (namely the earthquake), alone after more than an hour and a half. When Joe's earthquake finally shakes the city and our characters cliches, I almost felt like saying "Thank God, death and destruction are finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe arrives too late in the film to save him from his growing mediocrity; the scenes of devastation are very good, but even the earthquake part of the movie is ruined (pun) by a highly annoying religious ending. You see, Gable, who professes to be an atheist all the time (without really using his own word), finally finds MacDonald alive - after he has searched for days - and suddenly he is converted into a believer because Cinderella is alive? !! How stupid! All he tells me is that Gable's character is a weak-minded idiot. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a very stupid note indeed. Gable, having said "thank you" to God for "saving" his girl (and he gets on his knees) "finds" God (sees the light), and the little devil in the movie Gable becomes a believer. How American God fearing an end ... <br /> <br /> Of course no one thought to ask this "God" why the hell did an earthquake happen in the first place! The sad and unintended irony is that Gable eventually becomes a "sucker"; all the while he mocked "suckers" who fall in love with the most sacred scheme of all of them - namely religion - and in the end he himself becomes one. This is what I call a triumph of the human spirit! Another irony is that the end should have improved Gable as a person, but I see it quite differently; on the contrary: it took only one great Joe to turn Gable into an obedient, God-fearing believer - joining the world's sheep family. And as if this intellectual fall of Gable was not pathetic and disappointing enough, this first "musical earthquake" ends with a truly breathtaking chorus of Masses (take this word however you wish), noble and hopefully beautiful. scene: dozens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud and proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or "God," perhaps arranging it?) sing together the title song in the hope of a brighter future without Joe. Hallelujah! If you're a "sucker" for Hollywood sentimentality, do not skip this movie.
