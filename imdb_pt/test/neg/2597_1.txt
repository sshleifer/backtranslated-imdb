It's literally the Three Stooges once again, without the charm. This show is nothing more than the worst pie. I'm surprised they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random, and "controversial" for no other point than trying very (very) difficult to be controversial. And do people think this is 'nervous'? Get a clue: this show takes absolutely no thought, time, effort, money or creativity / originality to produce. Any references present are aimed at anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who would occasionally consult People magazine. But I suppose that's just what all kids want, like and need today.
