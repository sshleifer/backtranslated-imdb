It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay, have a good dinner and watch this movie at TCM instead of leaving. We are in our 40's - 50's, love romance, and are both "softies", but this movie just bombed for us (it's hard to imagine who was nominated for an Oscar, etc, but I guess it was then). The cinematography was beautiful, but for the most part the film as a whole is terribly dated. The character of Jennifer Jones made as many references to her as Eurasion we started to tell and after a while we were laughing every time she said it. Add to that the "theme song" played unceasingly throughout the film and we could not expect it to end so we could watch the evening news.
