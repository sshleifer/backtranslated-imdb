At times like this, I really would like to be a more avid reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, since very few things seem worse than not being able to fully understand a film of this incredibly "visual" caliber. Based on the novel "Cabal," the story of "Nightbreed" involves a behemoth amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic ghouls. A normal guy becomes attached to the strange world called Midian through his dreams and his psychiatrist forces him to believe that he is responsible for a series of family killings in recent months ... Thinking this to be true, he withdraws to Midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. The psychiatrist, however, is right about the Homeboy cures with a diabolical scheme to get the community out of Nightbreeds ... <br /> <br /> Wanting so much to love this movie, I was very disappointed in the long run. I unfortunately did not read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters were horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. I understand how the final cut was stung to hell and even the Barker show's moderate dislike of the product as a whole, but I just did not "get it." Even if it is crucial to read the story, I feel it should at least be translated into the film in a way that is still understandable to those unfamiliar with literature. If "Cabal" is as complicated as this movie, Barker really did order a dead concept. I could not help but feel a bit bored after a while, especially when things started getting more and more ridiculous (like in a police department not afraid to go to war with Midian like every week! The idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I liked the visual effects and all the madness that went on in Midian, especially that porcupine lady and that big-headed SOB ... Definitely an epic movie when considers the huge amount of effects and a convincingly morbid decor. David Cronenberg fills his position as well as the shrink loony with his cool potato sack-head zipper mask, but we all wish he had done some work behind the camera to help to save this heap ... <br /> <br /> So if you have a horny by Clive Barker and understand exactly what exactly Midian is, why do they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (terrible idea!), and why these creatures reside there and as a punk boy shares a telekinetic link for it, you should probably check out Nightbreed. I'm going to look for "Cabal" one of these days and hopefully have some perspective ... Or maybe I just forget this farce completely ... Until then, this is a poorly constructed and reasonably tedious mess of a movie. Watch "Hellraiser" instead.
