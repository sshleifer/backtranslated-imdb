A Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are falsely accused of killing their daughter. People are starting to wonder if they did it. Police investigate and find suspicious evidence. The couple is vilified by the public and accused in the press. Police officers speculate that they are Satanists and ritually murder their own daughter. They are charged and brought to trial. They are represented by lawyers who seek publicity, who give them bad advice and charge $ 100,000. The evidence against them is distorted or hidden by the police. Intimations made of sexual abuse are presented. His other son is taken from them and placed in a foster home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed. Verdict, she did not do this, but he did. He goes for the beats with a sentence of 45 years. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the movie, with Dillon in jail and Dougherty wondering what to do next, we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the defense of the couple. Witnesses admit to lying. Other facts are brought to light that ultimately result in the release of Dillon. The killer is never found, although the movie gives us a complete whacko as a plausible criminal. <br /> <br /> This is a cry from beginning to end. Nothing seems to work for the couple. Oh, there is a happy time, maybe a party where everyone is happy to be together and tearing up for joy, or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people embrace. But it is never before someone walks through the door with bad news and all faces are frozen in tragic disbelief. (Usually a fade to lock follows). There is not necessarily anything wrong with the tragedies on the move, though I can not imagine how pleased we are to see people suffering. There is a lot of tragedy in Shakespeare too. I suppose what we find interesting about tragic stories is in the way they are told. "Oh, but I'm a fool of fortune!" Romeo cries after killing Juliet's brother. Here we have Dougherty running in his robe down a hospital hallway, shouting, "Where's my baby?" There is no ambiguity or irony in the story - as I'm sure there must have been in the real-life events on which it is based. People are good or bad here. Or else they are bad, so they become good. <br /> <br /> The film is not meant to explore human strangeness, or the way things work. It is meant to tear tears from the audience. The actors provide exemplary first-line models. I do not remember the last movie I saw so many tears. There are streams of tears. Rain of them. Their waterfalls. A real Niagara of them. A lake Lacrymose them. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll give you an example of the efficiency with which the film is worked. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago cop who works alongside as a private investigator (Ed Asner). Asner is sympathetic to them, but he does not accomplish much. He seems to be in the movie not because of its importance to the case, but because he can provide the victim couple with a kind of philosophy - "Learn to live with it", which is good - and why he suffers from colorectal cancer, to that we may see him take his medicine, bend in pain and finally die. <br /> <br /> What is frustrating about the film is that by concentrating so intensely on the couple's suffering, they shy away from one of the most important issues it raises - the role of gossip in regulating private life . <br /> <br /> Gossip is really a strange thing. If we call "gossip" is bad, but if we call "public opinion" sounds acceptable at the least. Of course, we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified. (As I write, Michael Jackson is once again brought to court charged with molesting a boy, and I wonder how many of us were enthusiastic about the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) But the gossip is not all that bad. It's like water. When properly controlled, it is a community asset. We need gossip to keep us in line. This helps us maintain public order. But like water in a flood or a tsunami, it is a ruin to a village when it rages. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is fine if you are not looking much on the way. of insights on human nature. He's so smart that given his purpose, it's hard to argue with that.
