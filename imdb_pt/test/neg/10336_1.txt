I will not go into detail as to why this movie deserves a horrible rating, many other people have already done it. Suffice it to say that of the more than 400 films I owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one I got rid of - it was so worthless that I could not see ever wanting to see ANYBODY again. <br /> However, I have a comment about the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). While going through the 4 pages of reviews, I did not see any ratings higher than 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less. It seems to me that some people are filling the polls to keep this movie off the "100 final" list of IMDb. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of whom wrote a movie review) are actual active users. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is not worth your time.
