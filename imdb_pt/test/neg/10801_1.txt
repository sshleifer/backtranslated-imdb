It's Sooooouullltakaaaa! <br /> <br /> Wow. What a skin peeling bad film. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K .... Just a few things to point out ... 1) The incestuous exchange of lesbian mother and daughter was strange. I need advice now. <br /> <br /> 2) There is no God, there is only Man. I love that quote from Crow. <br /> <br /> 3) Whatever happened to the Nuns? who took the bus home, let's know? I have a horrible emptiness in my stomach. <br /> <br /> 4) Lastly, do not watch this movie without MSTied ... Has Joe Estevez as the main star .. Yikes .. <br /> 1/10 for un-MSTied 8/10 for MSTied .
