I finally got to see this movie last week. What a disappointment .. barely reaches the level "made for TV". Given the list of actors, I would have expected something substantially more sophisticated. The movie does not have a good story, well, actually, any story for that matter. It has no credibility, but a lot of predictability. Save money and time.
