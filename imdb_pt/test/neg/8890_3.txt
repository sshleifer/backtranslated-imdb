"The Quickie" tells of a decadent Russian mafia family living in Malibu and ... well, frankly, this terrible attempt at drama is not worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> Jason Leigh introduces Mr. Mob-guy as "Pacific Exterminators" with huge letters on the back that say "West Coast Terminators". Eventually the mafia guys are suspicious because she was exterminating in a room. (duh). <br /> <br /> In another scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette giving a $ 4,000 prostitute to bet if he will live or die. She has a 5 to 6 chance of keeping the money if she bets "live." Well, she bets she'll die. (double duh) Later she complains that she was not fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh). <br /> <br /> The list of flaws only continues as this movie of insults of intelligence stinks and sinks into a swamp of bad music, mediocre camera work, bad direction, boring story, etc. in this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The barebones DVD I rented had no English subtitles or captions.
