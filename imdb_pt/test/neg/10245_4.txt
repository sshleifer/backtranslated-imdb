I've seen worse movies. This is bad, but at least it does not try to be good, so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rests firmly on the realms of the low-budget low-budget sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> It's a trash movie, but in a nice way and certainly worth buying if it's in the local supermarket box. Very charming, and not simply awful. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover is going to rescue her. When she arrives, she exclaims "Bunnyfluff!" who draws sniggers from his co-pilot. <br /> <br /> Sit down, get drunk, have fun!
