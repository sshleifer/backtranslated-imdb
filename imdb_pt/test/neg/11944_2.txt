I hesitated to see this movie, having really liked the original, "Mostly Martha". What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but this was not her movie. The original had pungent moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. No reservation seemed to ever have been connected. The food, the characters - nothing seemed enamored. In Mostly Martha, the food was alive - every scene was filmed in such a way that you could prove with your eyes - the smells, the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - we rarely received a close-up of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. It was difficult to finish the movie - many of the scenes seemed strange. See the original - it's a really nice movie; the incredible soundtrack.
