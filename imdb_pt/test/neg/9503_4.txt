I thought this is an unbelievable boring movie! I heard that the director does not speak French and so he let his actors say what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is great, as usual, but I can not say the same of other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems very tired, this being one of the film's plots: tired of being together, living abroad, living in general; so they spend half of the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while I felt sleepy ... I gave 4, because of some very beautiful scenes, including the last.
