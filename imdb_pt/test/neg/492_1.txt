Well ........ how and where do I start to describe this total nonsense? Imagine the morality of an extravagant Hollywood western, play on a generous helping of the most banal soap opera storyline, and try to trick kids into thinking it's cool to dress up as something "contemporary." This film is an entire package and absolutely no substance. <br /> <br /> It begins with the promise ...... young people dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive worship of heroes that everyone can laugh at. After that, everything goes down ... faster than a bobsleigh without brakes. The scene that involved the first show with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of cine kitsch that I have seen for a long time. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs ..... will he stand up and sing ??? ...... or he will stand there on the floor and not sing ...... who cares for now? It gets worse, but I do not want to be bored of having to remember it in all its excruciating details. If you watch after this review, your own fault!
