A very delicate topic - a 15-year-old girl abandoned by her mother as a baby and visiting her, is still ignored, raped by her mother's boyfriend, becomes pregnant. Not enough depth was shown for this situation. Much time is spent chasing the truckers carrying the baby. (Interestingly, this baby with asthma - you never see him cry - except once -, be fed, have a diaper changed throughout the ordeal of trucking.) I wish I had seen more interrelations, more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor - this should have been raised in court immediately. <br /> <br /> And that was a true story! He deserved better information than that! <br /> <br /> If it were not for the subject, I would have given it closer to a rating of 0. I rented this in the library. Only later did I find out that it was a TV movie. oh well
