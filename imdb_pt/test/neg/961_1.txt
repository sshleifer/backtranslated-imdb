Great story and great lead actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from bad direction, bad script and bad script. The main actors play their part but could not save the movie. Too bad because this could have been a good start to the 80's. Hitchcock suspense / mystery / thriller.Ryan style looked so young and cool on this one. A good look at big Ryan fans .....
