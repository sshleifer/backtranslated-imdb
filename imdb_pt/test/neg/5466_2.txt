Of course, I like some indie movies. Very, actually. I do not always understand them and that's okay. Not all of them were meant to be understood, especially by mainly mainstream people like me. I'm probably showing my ignorance, but I'm still intrigued because the "book of Revelation" is called that. I love these end-of-the-world stories and the only thing I could see was similar to the end of the world and this movie was the torture it took to get through it. I'm not talking about it; maybe I have been subjugated of all the other tortures / pornography I've seen. It was just the incredibly slow story, a 15 minute material stretched for almost two hours. (The biggest spoilers are ahead) The heterosexual dancer is kidnapped, seduced and raped in six ways, starting Sunday, or in this case 12 days, by three hooded women. After her release, after her somewhat disturbed dancer / girlfriend barely stepped back (besides dropping a glass) after wondering what she missed most: him or the cigarettes for which she had originally sent him after the abduction. Still in a state of reasonable shock, he refuses to speak, and she continues to work without as much embrace as if nothing had happened and he took a very necessary shower. Problem. As much as he is plagued by the flashbacks of his "attacks," he is equally aroused. Sure enough, I was not tied up and used as a toy, but I doubt if he really "is in a good mood." Oh, I forgot, and how does he try to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as you can to try to identify the birthmarks or tattoos that criminals had. Do I see where they are going with this? shows a collective rape of the male POV. Well, twist, nevertheless, you could never feel for this guy. Only saving grace was LifetimeTV Dancer / Cancer Instructor good acting. But even she could not save the movie.
