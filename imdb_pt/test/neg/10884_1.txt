I've seen a lot of movies. Actually I love B horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. However, this "garbage" (I refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of movie) was the worst crap I've ever had the torture of watching. In fact, I signed up for IMDb just because I needed a way to at least express how "Garbage" was horrible. I watched "Films" (They Deserve Honor) done in high school students' cellars that were better written and directed. I got nothing but pity from the poor actors in this "Trash" because they were just trying to win a paycheck. They will now and forever have this stain on their records, like a virgin who was raped and received Herpes! If writer / director John Shiban has any dignity, after having obviously spoken to countless people to do this, he should never again allow himself to approach a camera and try to apply his so-called "gifts" to something more appropriate for him. .. How to clean the floor of a Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
