Apparently, a massive head wound is the cure for homicidal tendencies, turning a homicidal sociopath into a lovable and despicable dog. Also (this for women), it looks like the front gate of a psychiatric hospital is a forgotten hot spot to find potential partners. These are just two of the roughly 23 absurdities that we must accept in order for this film to have some meaning. I love movies and I believed, as I'm guessing many Americans do (forgive me if I'm wrong), that Hollywood turned out to be the best product. I came to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed I was and 2) how much more sophisticated European / Asian Cinema is compared to its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I watched this supposedly disturbing "suspense" psychological night after viewing a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. As the camera faded into Walter Sparrow's small, happy family enjoying quality time around a prison visit table (not to mention the paternalistic voice extolling the virtue of "doing the right thing"), I suddenly had an epiphany . I had just watched a movie that left me feeling like I had just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was quenched, but it was strictly utilitarian. The premise was slightly interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable "coincidences" (How do we explain it finding the book? Let's just say something like "... Or did the book find it?"). wide-screen plot (why did wifey take the skeleton?), predictability and happy ending mandatory, turned out to be just another job of hacking Hollywood. Also, Jim Carrey's cast was wrong. At any moment, I felt that he was capable of breaking something of one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed and tough police detective who likes slavery and violent sex? Did not buy for a second. <br /> <br /> Do you want to upset? Deeply disturbing? Watch the Suicide Club. The story involves the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls. The film begins with a group of high school students laughing on the subway train platform. We watch then, horrified, as they line up, clap their hands together and launch joyfully at a rapidly moving train. Needless to say, much chaos happens. This is as far as I go with the plot, because I encourage the reader to see the movie. In fact, I'm not sure I could outline the plot, even if I wanted to. What begins as a direct mystery quickly descends into a hospice of grotesque images. I understood the movie? No, not initially, like many of the foreign films that my girlfriend introduced me to. So, of course, I thought it was "bad." But this one stayed in my mind. I went to sleep thinking about the movie and woke up the next morning and went to the IMDb. I read some of the comments from the viewers and was amazed by: 1) the insights that others had drawn from the film and 2) the fact that I had completely lost the purpose of the film. I realized that I was so accustomed to receiving the "message" of Hollywood that when confronted with a film that really required the viewer to participate to really think for themselves, I was totally unprepared. It's as if I've been conditioned to "check my brain at the door" of the theater. <br /> <br /> Am I saying that the Suicide Club is the biggest movie ever made? Of course not. It has its flaws, many of which have been expertly reported by IMDb reviewers. Am I saying that all American movies are bad and all foreign films are good? Again, of course not. My point is that there is a whole world of filming outside of Hollywood - a body of work that involves the viewer; compels them to think and question films that do not telegraph twists, follow a strict linear sequence, and, above all, do not insult the intelligence of the person they are watching. I look forward to expanding my mind by exploring this new world of cinema that does not "make the thought to me".
