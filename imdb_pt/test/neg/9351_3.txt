A long time ago, in a galaxy far away (familiar sound), water became the most precious thing (this must sound familiar) and a small minority controls its distribution (what a surprise, just having a heart attack and dying of that surprise). A group of ice pirates (renegades for water? Wet bandits ... wait, the latter of them was used) tries to figure out the route to an unlimited supply of water with an adorable but spoiled princess (Druish?) And a group of idiots ??? despicable villains in pursuit. This movie has the potential to really be a great comedy parody ("Star Wars", "Dune" by David Lynch), but it was just not treated properly. Go for, I believe the term is, "low brow" humor. He can not be really funny, which is a shame, since there are Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence the three stars) who are not exactly lazy in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rental and definitely have a drink up.
