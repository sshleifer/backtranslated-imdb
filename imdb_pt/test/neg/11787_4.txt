Irwin Allen, the former master of the film schlock, took all the stops of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. A poorly aged Walter Pidgeon, who may actually have died when he played that role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that should be the size of the Empire State Building. Each room is gigantic and some even seem to have no ceilings. You could wrap and hold a formal ball simultaneously in some of these rooms. The submarine, called the Seaview, is in its maiden when all hell breaks loose: Van Allen's radiation belt catches fire and Seaview must launch a missile in the belt for a while or the world will fall into flames of global warming! Along the way, there are a lot of really terrible character actors, many of them borrowed from TV. This makes them TV hackers. Worst of all, poor Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, as naval secretary, squeezed into tight clothes, sporting high heels and acting as if she were appearing at a beach party movie. Maybe it's because Frankie Avalon is also along for the ride. An aging Joan Fontaine, almost unrecognizable here, plays a visiting doctor with a big bad secret, but who really cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie obviously made for small children but that kid will be quiet for endless filming of a miniature model of the Seaview moving back and forth from right to left across the screen in what is obviously a studio tank? There is no scene where we believe these people are actually aboard a submarine. When the Seaview shakes, the actors hurl themselves, sometimes in opposite directions to each other. Just like in the good old TV series STAR TREK, when the bridge shakes. If I remember correctly, not a fish or a sea creature is seen - except for an octopus that momentarily clings to the submarine, a nod to 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. The octopus, if it were real, was probably about thirty centimeters long and shows. Worse, when people are standing on the glass nose of the Seaview, the ocean they are supposed to be watching is obviously a close-up of an invisible air hose spouting bubbles, probably shot in a fish tank. You've never seen bigger bubbles in your life. You'd think those bubbles by themselves would crush the fucking sub into pieces. Unfortunately, Peter Lorre, an aging man, is also in the running. Towards the end, when the missile is entering the fire belt, Lorre is seen enthusiastically congratulating Pidgeon while everyone is still waiting for his cue to start shaking hands and hugging each other in victory. A unique scene if I ever saw one. How stinky. It's no good neither to laugh. Stay with SILENT RUNNING.
