The only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available. This show has gone from informative news to sensational claptrap. I tried to support this show on its decline because I like human interest stories and Primetime used to have some very good ones. Unfortunately, April 21st forever changed my mind about this show and about the unethical news presenters who participate in it. ABC actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations was exhausted and parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced. What worsened was how ABC swept the whole incident under the rug; instead of taking control and seeking real professional help for these troubled individuals, some pop psychologists have issued stern warnings to the audience about how they should not judge these poor angels too harshly. I was really sick. I hope this review will prevent a person from seeing this investigative junk in the future. If that happens, I'll be happy. Nowadays, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the staff at Primetime Live are sessions of butt-kissing with top-notch celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised by the stars. Do not waste the time of your life; it would be best to watch an old show on Nick on Nite.
