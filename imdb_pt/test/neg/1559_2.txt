Aliens let loose a giant monster named Zarkorr, then send a hologram that looks like a stupid teenager to tell the postman, Tommy Ward (Rhys Pugh, in the only movie you saw him) who was chosen to fight. Also, if he loses the plan it will hurt, so he will fight Zarkorr the Invader! This movie is bad, really bad. So bad you need negative numbers just to give a rattan. Horrible writing, bad direction, far below the Power Rangers, an exaggerated wood action that you're just waiting for a horde of lumberjacks to get out of and knock them out! And do not make me start the theme song in the end. People who made this S $ @ # shroud should not be out loud near a camera or anything related to movies. Zarkorr is a cool monster who should be in a movie a million times better than this one. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie, it's 80 minutes or more to live. The actors who are in it have never worked again. <br /> <br /> 3/10
