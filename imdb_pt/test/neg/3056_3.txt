It's hard to decide whether this movie suffers from dialogs or whether it's only made to appear by bad actors. In any case, he suffers from a story that is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Although made in the late 80's, the first part of the movie is like a teenage comedy from the 60's (with the absence of any real humor). ), especially the "good girl" part, which is as boring as a Doris Day figure as you might expect, including the slightly lugubrious opposition to whatever "fun" your friends want to make. The end effect is that, after a while, you start waiting for her to bite so you do not have to hear her voice anymore. <br /> <br /> Some swearing and free nudity, plus some 80's style clothes. It's your only clue that this movie was made in the 80's. Oh, and some pretty passable songs too. <br /> <br /> Storywise, it's a pretty stereotypical thing. A bunch of horny teens (plus, of course, 'cool girl') decide to celebrate Halloween night by partying in a haunted house. Partying and fornication follows, along with an ill-advised 'session' that initiates the wave of demonic possession that is the subject of the film. After that, the only suspense part will be trying to guess in what order the characters will expire. You're sure not to care. The actors are so bad that becoming demons / zombies / dinners really does improve their performance, and the ridiculously clich√©d dialogue is so annoying that you squirm in its place. <br /> <br /> Gorewise, this movie is nothing special, unless you think cheese is kind of 'special'. For example, the demon head that occasionally appears is so grossly false that you wonder if it's a 5-year-old trick or treat. <br /> <br /> That's not to say there's nothing nice about the movie. Some of the songs are not at all bad, and the first of our Scooby gang insipid to be owned does a wonderful and sexy choreography at one point, before becoming unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Also, and I do not know why, at the end of the movie, I really got involved a bit. The suspense that was lacking in most of the movie made a late appearance, and I began to squirm out of discomfort instead of annoyance. Which is what a horror movie supposedly does. <br /> <br /> I can not give this movie a rating at the bottom of the pit, since by some unexplainable miracle (I do not rule out being possessed by demons) I was really a little scared. <br /> <br /> Do not pay money to see this, though. Not worth your time, but alone in cash. Watch YouTube while you're there.
