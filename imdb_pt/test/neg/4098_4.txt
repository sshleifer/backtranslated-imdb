Although I enjoy the work of Steve Carrell, Evan the Almighty, like so many other exaggerated films turned out to be much worse than I expected. <br /> <br /> This turned out to be an extravagant family movie, kind that employs famous comedian to improve his image, but in the end can not deliver. <br /> <br /> The usual Carell's idiot mood is almost absent from the movie, and although he made me laugh a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in Evan the Almighty. Their 3 children, though probably somehow important to a biblical character, were really useless in the movie and terrible actors. Even his wife was a third part of such a simple plot. <br /> <br /> Spending so much money making a comedy was a big mistake. Although Carell's career may benefit from this film, there is no real reason to go see it. <br /> <br /> If only there was a little less of his family, a little more of Carell, Molly Shannon and perhaps some other SNL cast, could have actually been a lot more fun. <br /> 4/10 for a few laughs here and there.
