A rather mild horror film; if it was not for some sex scenes, it could easily have been a TV movie. The holes abound (an example: why would there be a secret passage from the eighteenth century that led from the upper floor of a house that was burned to the ground and a new building 200 years later?), Cardboard action, characters doing things that anyone with an IQ greater than the size of his footwear would not do ... <br /> <br /> There are a few fun times, but overall it's an understated movie that got Roy Scheider because his bills were due. If you are looking for an extremely predictable film that can provide some laughs, it is worth watching. If not then this is not for you.
