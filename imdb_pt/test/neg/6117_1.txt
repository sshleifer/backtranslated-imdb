UGH! ... this is the worst Wrestlemania hands down .... there are no good games ..... Hulk Hogan lifts his tan most bald once again in the main event, the hoggin light slag spot! ... not something worthy of this tape, oh ... I'll take it back ... this is Jim Ross's first WM ... but besides ... there's nothing worthwhile ... a great failure ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars WOOF !!!
