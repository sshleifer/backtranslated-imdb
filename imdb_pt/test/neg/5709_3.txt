I really can not see how anyone can have any interest in watching this movie. A woman knows a man, he wants to play, so does she, but only until she realizes what is missing. She leaves and that's it. It took 9 1/2 weeks before Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) to leave John (Mickey Rourke). She should have left him after 30 minutes and put an end to our misery.
