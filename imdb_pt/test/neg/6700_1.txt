Badland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time this is good and I can go on with my life, but I feel the need to alert others in this case. As a veteran of the Iraq war, I find it necessary to say that the history, the plot, the acting and the representation of what the soldiers do on their return home were pure junk. It was as if the director / writer / anyone would cling to any clich√© about the return of soldiers and run with her and run with her and run with her. Not to mention that I would have imagined that there was absolutely no research put into this film. The "Navy" uniform appeared to have just come off a store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first Iraq war. I will not go on forever, this is a horrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers, there are much better alternatives. I recommend going to your local library.
