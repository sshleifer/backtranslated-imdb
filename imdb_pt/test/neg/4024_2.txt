I've always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies. I've also always enjoyed such good movies, that's fine, you're looking at someone who's really liked children's films like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> So I watched this, and it turns out that all the critics are right about this. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike many flops, it's not even nice on any level, not even for fun. It's just one boring party after another until the end. <br /> <br /> I had been warned. I did not listen. I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Do not be silly, waste no time and money on that pile of crap.
