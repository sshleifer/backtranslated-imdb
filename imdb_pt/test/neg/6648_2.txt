This is a movie that should have been a mini-series as it tries to get a lot of information in a very small space. The whole story is constantly bombarded with sub-plots, character introductions, and nonsensical piece information that leads to nothing. There is an underlying plot where the boy meets a girl, she has doubts, but marries anyway and then her doubts appear and she will see if they are real. They end up not being, but the husband does not believe she was not unfaithful and her boyfriend almost did not want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband. With that said, there are no less than 1000 sub-plots and introductions of characters that make this plot almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you simply stop caring. You do not care about any of the confused and wounded people who come in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. Each enters and takes some interest from the viewer. After half an hour and completely uninterested, I stayed and observed the remaining two and a half hours of pure morbid curiosity. I could not imagine where I was going, but how to look at a fire I just could not get up and hang up. The production values ​​are excellent, but the resulting film is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
