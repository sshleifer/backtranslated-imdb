I got a discount copy of it. I had seen this for several years. My only recent experience had been "Mystery Science Theater" where it was very fake. You never get a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay. I love the beginning of the horror movies of the fifties. They give us a pompous talk about defense systems near the Arctic. They were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should be useful given the threat of very large insects. <br /> <br /> This particular flies. For some reason, despite their exoskeleton made of material that locusts are made of, they can still fend off air-to-air missiles and disable combat aircraft. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's more fun - first, the compulsory turmoil that saw the thing fly, cooling your heels in a hospital (just teach one - see an insect as big as a house - keep his mouth shut). I wonder if the poor boy went home after finding the insect. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a very common endeavor. It follows the usual efforts to come up with a way to dissuade the stubborn bug - and leaves us open to other possibilities - the Russians next time. I still get a kick out of these movies and this one is useful.
