First off ... I have to say that acting is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the main character, but she's not such a good actress, frankly. Spencer, your brother is a much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly, on the other hand, tries to act with her heart, but ... sorry, that's not good. Sam does not even get credit, I mean, come on ... ICARLY ... very egocentric huh? Freddy is not bad, I do not have a comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam change their attitudes whenever they are filming a web cast, they shout all their lines. It is in some ways a bad influence because Carly has a web show and if the kids copy it, they may be giving out their own information and that is not very safe. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that it has some funny parts of the program, which makes it fun. At least this show is not boring, has good scenarios, very strong. Many kids will like this because they do not look for flaws. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a bad show, but it's not boring.
