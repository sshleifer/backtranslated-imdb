I feel conflicted about this movie - it's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, and it provides insightful insight into a lost culture. There was an initial scene of men with caps and mustaches sitting around a table, with a serving woman and an accordion playing, which brought tears to my eyes, just because of the way they captured a lifestyle that must be incomprehensible to many . today. It presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably linked to village life, another concept lost in the world today. Symbolism is always fun, but it seemed a bit dated. The film's fatal flaws to me were the lack of any dramatic momentum and a total lack of humor. I never felt like I knew any of the characters beyond the basic universal things like mourning the loss of a loved one, etc. The people were figures in the director's frame involving natural disasters, war, etc. The movie was just a beautiful movie. tragic scene after another, without the involvement of narrative thread and without humanity. As a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. In the end, I was too bored to finish watching.
