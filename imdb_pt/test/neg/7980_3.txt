Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it looks like it was filmed in a dollhouse. Everyone is a liar, everything is like a dream, like a toy, for no good reason. I'm not saying that everything in every movie should be totally realistic, but unbelievable fantasy things and situations in a movie are too much. How did they get these great actors - especially actresses - for this movie? It's good to see Mia again; if we were to understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does well. It's not funny, it does not move, just fake. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, perhaps for a play, less for a movie, but not for measuring things. Terrible.
