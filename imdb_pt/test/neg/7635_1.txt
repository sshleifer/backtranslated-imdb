This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a thriller with a ridiculous ending. I watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something really bad. The film starred two actors that I really like, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Of course they had decent chemistry together, but for what? The premise of the film was bad to begin with and the execution only got worse. <br /> <br /> Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist who attempts to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense relies on multiple personality disorder. This will practically give you a hint as to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. At the beginning of the film, she receives an unexpected visit from her father. This being done in the 1990s when the bad father was the thing in Hollywood is another clue to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who enters Sarah's life. The whole first encounter and first encounter between Tony and Sarah is so poorly done and so unconvincing that it makes you wonder how it was filmed. And there's a sequence in which the two of you should be getting to know each other and it's so melancholic that it does not seem to belong here. One thing I admit is that there was a very hot sex scene. Anyway, frightening things begin to happen after he arrives, strange packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill Sarah, incidents that say things are no longer normal. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was poorly designed, the editing sometimes looks nervous, and the conclusion was laughable. Another thing that bothered me about this movie was all the orchestral music playing in the background. A more subtle musical score would have been better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence. It's sad that she has never had first-class material in her career. She is that rare combination of talent and beauty.
