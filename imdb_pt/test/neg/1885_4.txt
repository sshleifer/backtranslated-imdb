Although inevitably tied to the 1970s, the concept of "movie theater" is almost as old as cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios pretty much invented the term with its long-running monsters Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and The Mummy. Each original classic generated a couple of sequels, at least, and after a while they even thought of the idea of ​​making a real wet monster! "House of Frankenstein," released a year earlier and also directed by Erle C. Kenton, was a fairly successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiastic performances, but "House of Dracula" is a bit crazy for me to recommend it. Does the plot suffer much from extremely annoying 'coinciding' situations, twists and forced dialogues, and ?? Above all ?? a very short time to craft the monsters' personalities as they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive top marks but plays the most fundamental role as a doctor miracle who is challenged to cure Count Dracula (Carradine) of his uncontrollable blood thirst and correct Lawrence Talbot's illness from turning into a hairy Wolf Man ever The moon is full. During a night walk in some caves, they also take the remains of the Frankenstein monster and the good doctor ends up suffering a metamorphosis of Jekyll / Hyde due to a bad blood transfusion. The last invitation to the messy party is a female hump (though not from Notre Dame). Something is very wrong when you are watching a movie that is literally full of horror icons, but the only character in any movie that is capable of frightening you is an ordinary villager named Siegfried. The real monsters are monotonous and their fabulous backgrounds are totally drained. Count Dracula is a weeping novelist, Talbot is a pitiful and pitiful martyr and the creation of Frankenstein? well, its part in the plot is not even worth mentioning. There is a serious lack of atmospheric settings and cool pics in this Universal movie, especially in comparison to all your other efforts, and the abrupt climax is a disaster.
