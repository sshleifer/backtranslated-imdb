I was hoping to learn something from this movie, but I was disappointed. It's all about Rommel and drives him crazy like a great general, but at no point in this movie have we ever had an idea of ​​why he's great. What made you so successful? Was it your will, your reluctance to accept defeat, your discipline with your men? I was looking for a version similar to Patton's that actually got into the character, but that did not happen. Most of the dialogue is fabricated and sensationalist, and it seems obsolete and artificial. There is good action here and there, but not much. The end of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler, was the most informative and probably the most interesting part. But as a history lesson about Germany's greatest general, this was a failure.
