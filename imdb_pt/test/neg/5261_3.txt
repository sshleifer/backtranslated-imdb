My age: 13 Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are best friends and have been for a year. What Moses does not know is that Keats is actually Jack Carter, a disguised police officer, who is waiting for the right time to bust Moses and Frank Colton, a big criminal with whom Moses is involved. When Colton and Moses discover that Keats is a police officer, Colton wants to kill Moses, but he flees after shooting Carter in the head, which does not kill Carter. Moses is found by the police and is taken to proof of Colton's error. But when the police, including Carter, are about to escort him across the country on a plane, all the other cops are killed and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter has to stay alive as well as take Moses. <br /> <br /> A fairly average action comedy, Bulletproof has a fair plot, but a lot of the movie is just plain stupid. For a comedy, I found most of the jokes entirely bland. But as an action movie, it has some pretty good action scenes. Not being a good fan of Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found the acting and therefore the characters well below par. The climax is not very good, and the film is so unrealistic. It's not totally bad, but it's not too good either, and it's too short. Running under 85 minutes, I thought it was another 15 minutes to finish, but there was not, and the movie looked very short. Overall, it is not a complete waste of time, but I still would not recommend Bulletproof. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: Middle Level Violence, Sex Reference, Thick Middle Language <br /> <br /> Rating: 56 of 100
