We came too late to the theater to see Rendition, which was our intention, and 'The Comebacks' was the only film that had not yet begun. I had a sense of how bad a movie was after reading the brief synopsis on the counter. The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people walked in before the movie started. <br /> <br /> The screenwriters and director played all the sporting clich√©s imaginable in the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the whole movie. . Think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars that schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how mature it is to be parodyed or satirized. If you add Texas to the mix, you should create the sports version of 'Little Miss Sunshine', not a big yawn. The first movie that came to mind when we left the theater was 'Can not Stop the Music' By comparison, this was 'Can not Stop the Music' without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine or Village People. <br /> <br /> If the film had a single note of grace, he watched Matthew Lawrence grow up.
