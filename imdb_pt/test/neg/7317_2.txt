This is a typical college comedy and it is very common. The story is good but not much fun. It's about an unlucky guy named Reno who loses his job, rips the car off and then his uncle dies on a strip bar. Your girlfriend has a girlfriend (a good btw. :-). Anyway this guy gives him his mansion in Los Angeles and Mercedes as inheritance and soon Reno and his girlfriend move to Los Angeles for this new house. The problem is that they would need some roommates to pay the high rent of this house and so the movie unfolds ... The movie starts well and has some funny jokes here and there but suddenly the movie makes a turn to hell ... The end is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything about the movie. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
