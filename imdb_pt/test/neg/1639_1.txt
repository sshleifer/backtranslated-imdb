This is about one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not the worst - Hands the hands of fate holds that honor. <br /> <br /> This movie has many problems. For starters, this whole movie is a cheap copy of Conan's movies. There is the cat in a tiny dress wearing a cape, the quiet Asian warrior, the cracker cutter villain, the single bachelor soldiers, and so on. There are many continuity errors in this movie. Some of the dumbest mistakes I've ever seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the bots make the film watchable, otherwise I would probably have turned off five minutes in the movie.
