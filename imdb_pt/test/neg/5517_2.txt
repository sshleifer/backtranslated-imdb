If there was an EPA for the movie, this movie would have its most sincere approval. If we all recycle our "things" to that degree, we would never end up with anything. Funny how I remembered this movie when I first saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace. At least Lucas does not recycle his old images. <br /> <br /> This is a failure. But it is a good failure. Pretty in stitches (I liked it when the kid said "damn rocks"). And, if you like explosions (even recycled), you will satisfy yourself. <br /> <br /> In fact, for an obviously "budget-less" film, it does reasonably well. Acting is weak, but there is a small characterization here and there. The story is predictable, but it will take you along anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of film "everyone chases the child", which will likely attract mostly younger audiences. I gave this one a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug up my old VHS copy of this movie. I do not think it's on DVD.
