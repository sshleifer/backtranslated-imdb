Honestly, I can not understand why people love this program so much. A friend of mine watches this and since I like science fiction, I've tried to watch it together since the plot of the show looked promising, but it's actually a really annoying show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the CGI effects of the video game and the overuse of muppets. Note that I call this muppets because they really look like muppets, not like the aliens they should be. <br /> <br /> Speaking of it; the effects of make-up and make-up are horribly overused in this show. You have this guy who could be best described as a hybrid dwarf / alien, you have a pale girl who looks like an extravagant vampire, you have an alien alien floating in the mouth ... It is very unnecessary and, moreover, even to the point of you feeling distracted from the whole story about a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also very autonomous. The creators of this program have driven it in such a way that each episode almost looks like a totally different show. At least to the point where you see the main characters / muppets again, that is. The whole plot about the main character returning to Earth is very pushed to the bottom at some points. The acting is also very bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you want good science fiction, just look elsewhere. This is not even science fiction to begin with, in my opinion, since the show is more geared towards fantasy elements with all the strange puppets and dreams going on. And if you just want to see the muppets then I suggest you watch the Muppet Show and be glad that this abomination of a show has come to an end. <br /> <br /> By the way; Does anyone have dejavu with the concept of a live ship? Oh yeah, that's right; Doctor Who started this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of leftovers from 'sci-fi'. Scripts and events that were abandoned for good reason, just to get caught up in this horrible show.
