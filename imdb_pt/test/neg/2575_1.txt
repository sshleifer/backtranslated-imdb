Forget the fact that most people expect an action movie from Seagal. This movie simply had no substance. Very long, prolonged and annoying. The scenes were much longer than they should be - the camera used to focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening. Cure for insomnia. Worst Seagal movie by far (I like some of his other movies). 1/10
