I agree with the comments on the spin down. The last view shows to have been a bit better, but certainly the writers need a little more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, although sometimes they spin a little too much for the "white trash" stuff. The subtlety and the nuances go a lot in shows like "Office". I think the target audience is a bit similar, being both on the same night and schedule. One might think that Karma and the entire Eastern religion is a topic big enough to bring in some different and interesting shows, but they just scratch the surface of the subject. In my opinion, this shows the contempt that many people have in Hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more heady content. It has been proven in many other shows.
