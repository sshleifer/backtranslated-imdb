Paranoid Park is about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death, even if accidentally from a security guard. As the film continues, Alex deals with minor issues like his parents' divorce and the sexual warmth of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen, whom you can see now in Gossip Girl) while he's consumed with guilt. I had seen only one film by Gus Van Sant so far, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this. Once again he crosses the lines of time. Again he uses strange footage techniques like the endless. photos of people walking ... maybe you like these shooting techniques, I know not. The plot seems unsatisfactory to me ... it's almost simple to be exploited for a long time. The feeling I have (even with Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant tries a lot to make an "artistic" movie, which causes the film to come loose. Also Gabe Nevins was very bad as Alex, there is a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr.Van Sant, then watch this, otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
