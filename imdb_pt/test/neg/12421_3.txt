Wild Rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating due to the actual, or at least feasible, elements of the story. It is a race car driver (Steve Alaimo) who gets involved in a group of motorcyclists named Satan's Angels, who spend a lot of time deciding to rob a bank. Meanwhile Alaimo is also recruited by the police to report to them what the Angels are doing and where they will steal next. It's not even that the film really is very 'dated', although it carries the song pretty rude and stupid in the film (from the band on stage in a scene, to Alaimo 'performing' if you could call that drek that, for the regular generic score). <br /> <br /> It's just that there is more care of the filmmaker in putting a little more logic, direction and better actors for the parties. As I did not have much displeasure about the film, as I did with the Hellcats, but it almost made me a little indifferent to all this as well. What can happen by being unpredictable only happens with stupid things like the name of the city of Florida ('Citrusville' ho-ho). So it's not completely worthless, then, from the status Mystery Science Theater 3000. The comment is good in the movie, even if once or twice I almost wanted to hear what the characters on the screen were saying if it could be worth it. Wild Rebels might be better if you have an expectation of six or less, but as it is, I would not watch again.
