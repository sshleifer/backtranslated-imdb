I just saw this at the Castro Theater in San Francisco, and I had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive and unintelligent little film. It's a 75-minute movie that looks like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly interesting material. Not bad offensive, just repeats things that have been said many, many times and in a more interesting and provocative way. With only a few exceptions, the interviews continue, making little emotional contact or context for the whole affair. It's more like a "how-to" guide to something that can no longer be done. I was alive during the season but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
