I only saw this movie once, when I was about 14 years old, but I was really happy they made a movie about the 45th Division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that my two sons are members of the 45th, I would like to see it released on a DVD. I may seem a bit biased, but the 45th Division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about World War II and Korea, but you rarely hear of the 45th. One of the scenes that really stood out for me was when the Indians of the Indian Code were working and the puzzled look on the German soldiers came across when they could not understand that language. I'm glad that all Native American Code Talkers are getting the recognition they deserve.
