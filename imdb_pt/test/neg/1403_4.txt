This miserable psychodrama uses every device in the book to attract attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, are not worthy of note, let alone two precious hours of shooting time. As in Robert Redford's "Ordinary People" (a superb film that, in contrast, clearly shows the emptiness of "Heroes"), a late teenager died, leaving his family at the height of mourning. In this case, death was a suicide, an event that almost always poisons the survivors' emotional good in a particularly corrosive way. We follow these people in the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a withdrawn, virtually dumb, usually drunk who secretly sacks his work for months, sits instead on a park bench all day, and insists on setting a plate full of food in place of the deceased child for each meal. He treats all other family members with infallible wickedness. He sees his doctor regularly, but the question of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never arises. <br /> <br /> The mother (Sigourney Weaver) yells at her neighbor, among others, gets caught up when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) at a headwear shop (which, in fact, would try such a stupid scene?) and, in the end, get into coma with a lung disease that everyone in the theater supposed to be a heavy smoker's cancer). Weaver has a few lines, but usually behaves in a less than intelligent way to earn a lot of empathy. <br /> <br /> It's not that there are not people around who behave in this silly way when stressful circumstances arise. But why make such a movie? What can one learn from the conduct of this pair? <br /> <br /> The older sister of the late (Michelle Williams) is in college and very happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is genuine, his causes are manifold, and his conduct is consistent within circumstances. But Hirsch's character is too talked-about, too morose and dejected to carry the film. The other actors, subtexts and futile and unreal dialogues do not help. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is echoed almost indifferently in the case of two other minor characters. So what is the director and screenwriter, Dan Harris, trying to say on this subject? That is not a serious matter? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to play the sap of a father as it is written in this script is something only his therapist could possibly answer. Avoid this dog. Instead, rent the Redford classic. My rating: 4/10 (C-). (Seen 2/17/05). If you want to read more about my comments, send me a message about routes to my websites.
