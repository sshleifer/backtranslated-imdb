(HR is what Himesh is called in the movie, I think he also likes it.) It's amazing how intelligent, talented people even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he did. No one in recent years has come back from the jungle and made a mark for himself. <br /> <br /> And I really was expecting a great movie (with 50Cr's budget and the cute actress). As intense as Reshamiya is, I thought, he would stand out in a sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, it is described in the same way, but why beware? Absolute incompetence, carelessness, horrible acting, banal background music, and insensitive direction make it a real pain. <br /> <br /> The rule of mistakes. (Eg How can the German police issue public instructions on an English speaker? They communicate with each other in English!) Unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in the main line of Bollywood. There are some excellent directors, but many bad ones as well. The worst part is that most just do not care. <br /> <br /> The songs are the only saving grace ... <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat this RH and find a good director (low budget .. No problem). <br /> <br /> The villain must have shaved his head instead of the wig you know ... after all it's a 50 Cr movie.
