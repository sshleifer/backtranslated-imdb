The costumes are outrageous and the Australian scenery is fun to watch, but there is a margin for this story - an average advantage - over drag queens. I particularly noticed it in Terrence Stamp's character, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger." Perhaps this was appropriate, since there is nothing "good-natured" about Ralph-Bernadette and her "queens" group. <br /> <br /> Once again we have the strong liberal inclination that says it's worth everything and if you're not "with it" - or, in this case, pro-homosexual, then you're a homophobe. (Gasp!) <br /> <br /> What is really disturbing is the end when a young boy goes out with his father to "alternative lifestyle" and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because it fits into the story, but because it fits into the schedule of the people who wrote the screenplay. Unfortunate.
