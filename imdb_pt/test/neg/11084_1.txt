The movie goes something like this: run around, run around, somebody killed, many freak out and then one of the group's screams shouts "Pull together" or "Just calm down!" Repeat this as many times as the remaining characters. Among these things, you can enjoy a black screen in white. These are not fast, but are several seconds long. I kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened - yes, it happens more than once if you can believe it. <br /> <br /> I notice another one mentioned "Blair Witch: and it reminded me of this In the way the camera was animated, however, this film takes this to the extreme. Every time the characters move, the camera is jumping.Too often so much that you can not make heads or tales about what you are looking at.It leads us to illumination, too dark in some areas, I understand that they are trying to make us feel as if we were in a cave but Helllloo ... I'm watching a movie here, it would be nice to be able to see. So there's the ending, I really let out loud, "Are you kidding me?!" I think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us after so much time of boredom with the so-called "twist" At this point in the movie you could have seen the "monster" poking his nose had a "twist." Truly horrible. was warned.
