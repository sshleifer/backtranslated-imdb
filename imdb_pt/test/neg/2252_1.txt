I deliberately did not read any criticism of this movie to IMDb before watching it because I really wanted to see and decide. I've been a huge QT fan in the past, I think we can all agree that he made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared on his own foundation. This "movie" proves that. It consists of some scenes of the bastards in action. Instead, it consists of long and tedious conversations between people who, after a while, realize that it does not give much importance. He is longwinded and does not have any of the great twinkling dialogues that QT was responsible in the past. The whole movie is anticlimactic. There is no tension - what will happen in every scene is wired so clearly that by the time it happens, you just do not care. Honestly, do not believe in hype. This is a very annoying movie and you will not miss anything if you do not see it.
