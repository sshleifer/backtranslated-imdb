I was very disappointed with this series. He had lots of cool graphics and that's about it. The level of detail he entered was minimal, and I always had the feeling that the public was being sponsored - there was a lot of what seemed to me like "This is extremely cool but we will not explain it in more detail." because you will not succeed anyway. Let's just show some beautiful photos to entertain you. "The host released words that sounded interesting, such as" sparticles "and" super-symmetry, "without any attempt to explain what it was. We had to look at Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> In addition, I know a little (for a layman), and I thought their explanations were complicated and could have been much better. They could have chosen MUCH better examples to explain concepts, but instead the examples they used were confusing and obscured even more the subject. <br /> <br /> In addition, I was so tired of repeatability They could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut through the whole repetition They should have shown the clips of the Quantum Café about 8 times I can not remember how many times he said, "The universe is made up of vibrating little strings." It's as if they're trying to brainwash in just ace itar "superstrings are the best thing since sliced ​​bread". <br /> <br /> Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant sense of "competition" between Fermilab and CERN, clearly leaning toward Fermilab. This is an educational program on quantum physics, not about whether the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt that I was part of the paternalist - "The audience needs to see some conflict to remain interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than that. <br /> <br /> Overall, 2 thumbs down :-(
