Paul Muni and Bette Davis improvise monstrously while the dull studio Archie Mayo seems distracted and distracted in this racially provocative movie that derives from its "bittersweet finale" by tolerating segregationist attitudes. Heavy-handed and poorly built, the movie collapses under its own weight in the first fifteen minutes with an out-of-control court scene that never recovers, while Mr. Muni begins to chew up landscapes on the patio screaming and howling in an almost incoherent way . Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American on the other side of the track who, by determination and claw, graduated in Law from a night school. In his first major case involving a car accident, he shows only ineptitude and is quickly made to appear foolish by his well-placed adversaries and an impatient judge who recommends that he be expelled. Devastated with the setback, an annoyed Johnny takes a job at a casino where he is helped by owner Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette) who likes his style. The owner cuts it off on the spot, but problems arise with Mrs. Roark (Davis) who also wants a piece of Johnny. She kills Charlie, implicates Johnny and slowly goes crazy before he is acquitted and free to be with a high society Wasp who coldly explains to him that they are from "different, wild tribes" and this will never work. When she flees to escape the rage, she is run over and killed by a car. Ramirez sells the casino and returns to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that it is best to stick with your own. <br /> <br /> In addition to this terrible bleakness, Bordertown has a number of bad performances to commend the general ugliness of the story. . As unfair as his situation is, Ramirez de Muni is so abrasive and arrogant that it is difficult to show sympathy for such a mistake. Davis is no better than the less-than-loyal wife, matching the same teenage emotions as Muni. Her crazy scenes Lady Macbeth did not indicate she was about to become the best film actress of her time. Margaret Lindsay as Muni's American Dream is cold, remote and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad as Bordertown is (and is a lot) remains an interesting indicator of acceptable times and attitudes. The rest is just a mix of poor acting and uninspired direction.
