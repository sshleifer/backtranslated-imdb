The Mummy Curse is the latest in the Kharis mummy series, and it seems that creativity had gotten a bit dry by the time they made it. Kharis and his companion, Ananka, end up in Louisiana Bay and, in his resurrection, he seeks out his beloved princess. As they end up in Louisiana it is not made entirely clear, but with several people trying to find them, the viewer can be sure of some mummy murders. <br /> <br /> The Mummy Curse was watchable, but it really was nothing special. I had the feeling throughout the movie that I saw before. Frankly, in addition to the original The Mummy with Boris Karloff, Mama's movies are not my favorites among the horrors of Universal. They are not bad, but they get a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some big scenes in the film (the scene with Ananka coming to life in the swamp, for example), but overall that did not happen. do much for me. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you want to be fuller and see all the mummy movies but otherwise you might want to pass on this one.
