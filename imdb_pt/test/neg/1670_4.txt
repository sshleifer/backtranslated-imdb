This movie seems a little clumsy around the edges, as not enough zaniness was played when it should have been. But I really liked it. <br /> <br /> The plot is more than a little absurd, so no expectation of "something real" should be included in your viewing experience. Check your brain at the door. It will not be necessary and may be an impediment to the contrary. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Clennon's performance as the real Dr. Baird. His role was in place to give character of Aykroyd a protagonist. What a real Dr. Baird putz was. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was very good as the companion of the main character. Annoying at first, but finally kind. Kind of. More or less. Or at least something like using a bar of soap and lots of water would have been more than helpful. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth watching? If you're in the mood for a parody of the psychiatric profession, of course, why not.
