I'm not going to lie, I rented this movie because it was an "artistic" movie with some explicit sex possible. I bought this scene and Catherine Deneuve's breasts (briefly shown), but the rest of the film is just the long pretentious and long European art films, with phrases like "I had mom or dad, I do not know" (paraphrased). Usually delivered in long soliloquies. <br /> <br /> If you're curious about the transition from "art" to pornography, it might be interesting, with the use of the fast forward button (I was still very slow!)
