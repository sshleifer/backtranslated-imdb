Seen this on a sneak preview yesterday and I must say it was terrible. After the credits I thought, "Hey with this cast it's probably going to be pretty good." This is not how it happened. predictable and lethal grunts, characters drawn in an extremely simple way (perhaps with the exception of a bit of Mrs. Lara's), and an end that can be predicted 10 minutes after the movie. Worst of all, he misused a delicate subject (people with disabilities) for low-level, tasteless jokes, never touching anything beyond the surface of the matter. The disabled person that the movie is more sympathetic to is the one who is just pretending. What kind of message is this? And the film does not have a thought of ending at all, it basically comes down to: "I love you no matter you acted like an idiot." <br /> <br /> In short: Great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible movie.
