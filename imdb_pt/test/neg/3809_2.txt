This movie is one of the worst examples of hype. People who read the comments of the IMDb may be tempted to see this complete waste of time, as I was, by false speeches like "A Return to the Eighties Horrific" and things like "No". This movie sucks from the acting to the direction of the story. Horrible, the whole board. And I really like horror movies GOOD, I'm not at all a snob. That sucks. For reference, I loved The Grudge 1 and 2, Black Sheep, Planet Terror, Texas Chaisaw Massacre The Beginning, The Others, The Ring, Jason X, Slither, Planet Terror, and I really hated The Ring 2, Texas Chainsaw Massacre do) Wolf Creek, The Hills Have Eyes (re-do) Hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. Gore does not overcome fun or originality.
