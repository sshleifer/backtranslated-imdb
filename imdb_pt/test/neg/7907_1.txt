Frankly, I did not think there was anything funny about this movie. It was really lame and badly done without any plot. Surprisingly, I had some laughs from myself at the beginning with the Malcolm X terminal and that was about it. Seriously Soul Plane made even the worst movies like Gigli look like an Emmy winner. This movie really is not worth seeing unless you were blind like Johnny Witherspoon, who played the blind man in the movie (another sad character). I cringed at most of the stereotypical jokes and ruining Tom Arnold and D.L Hughley by putting them in this movie. This movie can be summarized in just one sentence. Nashawn earns $ 100,000,000 and creates his own airline, sex, drugs, homosexuality, more sex, drugs, did I mention sex? If I could rate this film in the negative integers, however, the beginning was fun, which leads this film to 1/10. Doing "t bag" pfft!
