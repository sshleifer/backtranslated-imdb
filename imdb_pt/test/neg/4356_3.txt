It's extremely rare to see a 1955 film that I do not love. Noir, JDs, Sci-fi, Drive-Ins; I like it more. Robert Aldrich is a director who did an excellent job, and most of this cast has good performances. So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I used to work in the world of Independent Cinema, we used to talk about something called "actor films." Actor films are films that are unattainable to anyone except to other actors. Actors like "actor films" because they can see ACTing - which means a completely exaggerated melodrama. The actors love having the chance to get free "give them all they have" and they are very pleased watching other actors do that. In many interviews with actors, they say that "he was a great director, he never interfered in me at all." In fact, this is the opposite of good direction, because the whole point of having a director on the set is to prevent actors from cheating (which, given the chance, they will always do). <br /> <br /> Apparently Robert Aldrich forgot about this in this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script in the first place, so what the hell? Whatever the case, here is an example of a lesser known movie that is best forgotten. The characters gesticulate, pontificate and usually torment him to the end. One thing I can say is realistic: it's set in Hollywood and everyone acts as if their petty problems are the most important thing in the world. It's not fun to watch, but it's realistic. What is unrealistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract will go out of his way to antagonize him in almost every conceivable way - including requiring him to engage in illegal activities. But this and other plot contradictions merely carry the melodrama, increasing the opportunity to complain and shout accusations. <br /> <br /> I managed to get to the end of this movie, which does not make it worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But, why test your own resistance when there is much more available to rent?
