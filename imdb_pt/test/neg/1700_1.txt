Jason Connery is not an actor; he is the son of an actor. Your Macbeth is the worst I've ever seen. Ah yes, he kills King Duncan, but he also kills William Shakespeare. Your wife is even worse. Please give me the Polanski version on DVD, so I can forget this monster. Jon Finch, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, there you have ACTORS!
