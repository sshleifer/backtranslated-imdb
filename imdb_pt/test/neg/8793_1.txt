I only realized why the colors and scenery in "Sakuran" were so flashy and flashy, and painful to look at. The story is about a high-class prostitute known as Japanese oiran. Their kimono was always more gaudy and thicker than the other kimono, so the oiran stood out. But the director, Mika Ninagawa, had to make sure the director stood out even more than the main character, or even the story. <br /> <br /> What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie made me shiver. You could not call it acting. It was nothing more than attending to his excited and collegial fan base. Hey, Anna, good luck on this as you get older. Yes, right, an oiran like a rude and vulgar motorbike painter, prone to violence. Have not we seen you portray this character in a more appropriate film? <br /> <br /> The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? A nasty little bitch remains true to herself, which is just that: an unpleasant bitch. She discovers that, inexplicably, men are attracted to her and that she has an inexplicable ability to manipulate men and becomes a high-class prostitute, even though she speaks and behaves as if she were a member of a biker gang. This spoken seductive ability of her is spoken, but we never see her in action, probably due to the ineptitude of the main girl, pretend-fake-biker, I mean "actress." The main character in the film makes a rich and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she meets a much humbler client. It's not much like Oiran, is it? How could this woman become an oiran? Oh, because the old Oiran was killed and the house needed a prostitute who could demand a high price. Who would pay a high price for such a cheap whore? Rumors spread. How could there be no repercussions on what she did to the mighty guy? Because writers are idiots. They ended up making up a lot of crap. <br /> <br /> So an even richer and more powerful guy falls in love with her (why?) And she throws him to a cashless guy who is usually cold and distant from her, but respects who she really is It is (which does not make sense. How can someone respect such a worthless person?). <br /> <br /> Speaking of crap, it's as if the director crouched down and took a huge garbage of psychedelic color. in the aesthetics, culture and society of the Edo Period. What are the things like sabi, monkey without consciousness, wabi, subtlety, elegance, a rigidly hierarchical society? All broken by a director who presents himself as a nonsense parvenu nonsense. The incredible thing is that so many other Japanese, watching this movie, crouched around the director and took stinking spoonfuls of that stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was. <br /> <br /> Argentine tango music with violin and bandoneon as the background for the Edo Period, when Japan was totally isolated from the international world (except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima)? Why not just have Anna, the honest oiran, answering her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character driving herself in a buzz in her red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was shocking and anachronistic (the same as the art design). <br /> <br /> Near the end, I liked that there were only two or three small flowers in the sanctuary cherry tree. But earlier, the second she said she'd leave the rooms when they bloomed, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring, telegraph the ending so clearly. But what is the point of the old tree blooming? That rich and powerful face has already made the pleasure spaces bloom in cherry blossoms like the Yoshino mountains in the spring. Did not that impress you? No of course not. I already know that about prostitutes. The guys who treat them well are kicked in the balls. It may be a mistake for prostitutes to make people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are: just cheap and worthless. Considering the director's obsession with the goldfish, the second to last scene should have been from a bowl of goldfish on an accidentally knocked down balcony. Two fish fall into a stream that transports them to escape from the walls of the pleasure chambers, disowning how the goldfish are trapped in the bowl and can not survive outside (as well as the relationship of the inhabitants to the neighborhoods of pleasure). Otherwise, the conversation about the fate of the goldfish makes no sense. <br /> <br /> In the final scene, the cherry trees were full of blossom, but the brevity of the flowers is a special thing about cherry blossoms. I could not help but think that twilight would soon erase all the pink color and the heat of the scene. The sky would quickly pass from hints of shadow into ever deeper darkness, and night would fall. It would be cold, very cold. It is dark. This really was not a happy ending, was it? Romantic love (in the Edo Period?) Could survive in the face of terrible poverty and be banished for about as long as the cherry blossoms. Maybe a few days, unless it rained before. But the unfulfilled romantic love we see here? Its existence in this period is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Anna Tsuchiya walking in the place of an oiran? She could not do that. Literally. Check out the scene of her promenade where she seems to have the correct footwear but she has to hold a guy's shoulder so she does not fall on her butt. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie two stars to the art direction, but then I realized what it was all about: unhealthy domain on the part of the director. These colors and scenarios are exactly the way the director has to shout, "I'm the most important here! Me! It's all about me !!!!"
