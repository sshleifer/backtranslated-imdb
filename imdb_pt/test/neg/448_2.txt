Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckole, in every way possible. He laughs at all his guest jokes, he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them. He beats me as the kind of person who wants to be loved by ... everyone. Friendly, boring, ol'predictable Harry. He probably owes his success to being an interviewer of dreams for celebrities because they are not bombarded with what we, the people, want to know and have the right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews like he's in a red country. 02/10, 2 for guests entering the program, but it seems that everything does not make sense when Larry starts asking questions in his mind, such as "How is it to be a mother?" followed by the usual response, along the lines of "Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me: it's wonderful but tiring."
