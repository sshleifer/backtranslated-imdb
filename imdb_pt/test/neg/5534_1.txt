I was very excited when I saw this movie in competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Together with Elephant and a few others, I felt that the issue of American armed violence / culture would be treated intelligently and attractively to film goers. The press release promised (in a nutshell) a "Red Violin" to the gang of gun violence, something to make us reflect on our NRA backstage mentality in this country. <br /> <br /> After waiting until after 9:15 to sit down for a session at 9 in the morning (what technical difficulties they would find is beyond me), we finally went to the place to see the film in DV ( where it was printed at 35MM?). I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is an abominable mess. We took the "gun" in a vignette with the most unrealistic "cyclist" I've ever seen (and I know more than a few). The film then falls into "character development" irrelevant just because the characters are either. stereotyped, losers, c) stereotyped losers and / or d) racial caricatures It takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we want empty conversations between couples and / or bikers and pedestrian brokers. <br /> <br /> The movie thinks it's a conclusion, but not without leaving no clich√© without trial, I do not care for the white trash characters who came in contact with the weapon, and the representation of the minority characters should have the NAACP screaming right away. All of these people would chase a gun because they are at the bottom of the social trash pile, and they would look for an opportunity wherever it was found. would at least provide some soul searching on the part of the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the unfulfilled promise. The outline of the plot was great. In the hands of a P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt, could have been a powerful piece. But due to a bad script, direction or both, the thing is a mess that needs to be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My biggest question is who, at MFF, thought it was competition material. It's best to bury it on Showtime at 3 AM. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
