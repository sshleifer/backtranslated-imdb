Consider "I know everything" action hero is lighting a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / look for the bad guys. (Probably to give a light signal to say here I'm coming) <br /> <br /> This is one of 100 scenes that you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the Comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Terrible guideline, horrible script, bad acting, cheap special effects. (They used a tunnel to hide themselves acting in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (this also for making me laugh seeing these pathetic mistakes)
