Critics love this movie. I personally found it tasteless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I've fallen into the trap of "critics love" and left wanting someone to throw hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning for animal lovers: Do not watch this movie if you do not want to see dead and molested sheep. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, check out Afrika. If you want to see a movie about convicted fugitives, see the Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor classic, Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 souls like the plague.
