The movie starts well, it has something to do with it. About 1/3 in the movie things go down. Carrey gets obsessed with the number 23 because he sees it everywhere. And? This is no reason to go mad and start writing things all over the body and on the walls. <br /> <br /> The acting of whoever is playing your child is bad. From the outset, as soon as he hears his father's obsession, he jumps on the tide and is hysterical about it. Totally unbelievable. I hope I never see this kid again in another movie. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time watching this movie. Get another one. Boring piece of ... well. Is the number killing him? Give me some time. I'm not going to ruin the ending for you, but let's just say it's equally disappointing. 3/10.
