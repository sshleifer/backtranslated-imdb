A dark but humorous tale involving a policeman who has first-hand experience with vampires and decides that he must quit his job to chase after these evil beings. Most of the film contained questionable scenes, plot footage, props and footage. The fight scenes were as cheesy as the version of a WWII battle. The speeches delivered were said as if the actors had no motivation to be there. The props were bad because they did not seem to work in lesser quantity. most of the film seemed to be filmed in someone's basement (in some scenes you could see the beams over a scene that should not look like a basement). The plot had no motivation to advance or retreat, it seemed to just stand still sometimes with no motive for actions by some characters. I sometimes felt the sound effects were out of place for this kind of horror type and more than a cartoon series. It's similar to the Blade movie, in which he is an African American vampire hunter. However, that's where all the similarities end, and the film seems closer to a parody of Saturday Night Live.
