My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance must have been desperate to work to lend their talents to this turkey. A terribly confused story about Satanism in modern Greece, Land Of The Minotaur (aka The Devil's Men) is a glitch in more or less every imaginable level. It has precious few scares (always a small flaw for a "horror" movie, do not you think?); weak performances; innumerable scenes in which the characters foolishly lose themselves or refuse the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group; and some pretty annoying editing techniques that add nothing to the process. I was prematurely excited by the prospect of Cushing and Pleasance working together 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends - but this movie is not worth getting remotely excited about; is a huge disappointment and a bit embarrassing for its much more dignified tracks. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, strangers as tourists and archaeologists remain missing, and local priest Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something sinister is under way. He writes for his friend, New York Private Detective Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), asking him to fly to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, three more visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), all personal friends of Father Roche - disappear while gossiping the nearby Greek ruins. Milo finally arrives in Greece, but initially doubts the beliefs of Father Roche that the missing were taken to satanic sacrifices. Milo and Father Roche also join Laurie (Luan Peters), the girlfriend of the late Tom. Together, they discover the activities of a cult of worship of the Minoan devil led by Carpathian exile Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazed cultists are busy sacrificing their victims to a minotaur statue. In addition, they apparently can not be killed by normal means, so Father Roche has to use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against them. <br /> <br /> The Land of the Minotaur should have been much better than it really is. The plot is so wacky and unlikely that it has all the hallmarks of a goofy cult / camp favorite. But the manipulation is simply awful. The director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to connect the narrative in a cohesive way, so that everything progresses as if it were being elaborated in the day-to-day. He also has no idea how to convince convincing performances of his cast, so they get embarrassed in horrible performances (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateur (Skouras, Peters). The worst is that the narrative does not make sense. Why would Father Roche seek help from a private detective who is absolutely irreverent with his beliefs? How does Roche know that sacrifices only occur during the full moon? How can the statue of the minotaur speak? Why is one of the victims of the sacrifice instructed during a vision to stab Fr. Roche, only to be stabbed some scenes later before having the chance to perform it? And - most disconcerting of all - why did Father Roche drag Milo to the other side of the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and holy water to get rid of the bad guys? These questions - and more - will pop into your mind during the Land of the Minotaur ... but, unfortunately, there are no answers to be given. Frustrating, dumb and disappointing!
