Let me break this movie for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes are a display of terrible special effects. I do not have the slightest need for special effects, but what you have to understand is that if you can not afford good special effects, you should not anchor your movie around special effects. Spacecrafts flash color bubbles at each other, bursting with explosions of stock and advancing through moons with polygon counts low enough to count on their fingers. You will have no idea what is happening. It will not make sense. <br /> <br /> The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point, you will be treated to a monotonous landscape and boring and boring fighting scenes. No one talks. Nothing interesting happens. The goals of the protagonist are not clear and are not very convincing. This lasts about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, in a five-minute montage, she enters an enemy base, throws herself on a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails and dies. None of this has any influence on the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, basically the girl's memories are transferred to her daughter, who enters a very large number of years, learning the secrets of humanity. After that, we see the first and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, so the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the stuff that causes the big bang or not. Do you know. Because when the universe collapses, you decide whether you want to be a part of it. <br /> <br /> She chooses yes. BUT MAN'S MEMORIES SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we will not make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters then this is not a good movie for you. The main roles could have been fulfilled with good taste by any old toy able to stay on the right side while walking the sand. The whole story is told through painfully dull narration. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to look deep, joining a bunch of undeveloped science fiction ideas. There are enough concepts here to feed a number of films, but, as it stands, it's swollen with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45 second set. Instead, the narrator fills the story of a novel without ever giving us a reason to care about what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas here, but no one watches movies to see ideas explained improperly. People watched movies for fun. This movie does not amuse.
