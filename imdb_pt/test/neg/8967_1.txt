This is a really silly job of confusion - as bad as Hepburn playing a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The main part that Hepburn plays is a combination of Granny from Beverly Hillbillies and a faith healer! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart was not a hick-he was surrounded by them. And the dialog box sounds like it came from a Li'l Abner track! The problems do not really end the scandal, as the plot is completely confused and the "love story" can make your head hurt. For no reason, married to Robert Young falls for this Ozark Lynx. Was it your lovely personality that conquered your heart? I doubt as she like the fiery "spitfire" that the movie got the name and she really seemed to enjoy fighting, sucking and screaming! Were you her feminine charms? Without makeup and fashions that seemed to have been designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt that this was also the case. To top it all off, in the end, somehow Ralph Bellamy also fell in love with her, though, once again, it really does not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> So, here we have two city fellers falling. by a sullen, moody beast played by Mrs. Hepburn - is now a recipe for a good movie!
