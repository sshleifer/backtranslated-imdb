Hitchcock is a great director. Ironically, I mostly find your movies a total waste of time to watch. I admire Hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level. <br /> <br /> First the good points. Hitchcock invented the notion of the proof camera. The curious eye that is able to retain or seek information. It's not exactly a new visual grammar, but it was revolutionary at the time. <br /> <br /> Second, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie. He has an economic style and is always thinking of the public. It gives them regular emotions, regular mood swings and regular shocks. In short, he anticipates the basic needs of the audience and plays them like a violin. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic needs of a human being are almost all stupid. Food, sex, the thrill of danger and a bit of comedy. Hithcock meets all those needs on screen, with the exception of food, which, judging by its size, it catches the screen. <br /> <br /> It's this applause for the public that sabotages most of their films. A second drawback is that most of Hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar is now commonplace. What keeps his films watchable is the simple economy of his tales, the intelligence of his camera work, and his ability to craft strained scenes. <br /> <br /> So, let's go to "Saboteur". This is a joyful joke in the vein of "The 39 Steps". He jumps from one sequence to another, until he completes the typical Hitchcock final piece. <br /> <br /> On an emotional level, the relationship between leaders does not agree with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in "The 39 Steps." Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy. The plot simply resonates like a machine, depending desperately on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes are only drawing to a close, as it is not clear whether the hook is the escape of the police hero, the villains or their action to prevent planned sabotage. <br /> <br /> There is the usual Hitchcock. logical failures. For example, a guy with handcuffs is released using a car fan belt etc. <br /> <br /> If you want a better Hitchcock war propaganda flick of the 1940's, then you're going to be able to swim in it, I advise you to watch "Foreign Correspondant". Both are stupid prank movies with a catchy ending, but "Foreign Correspondent" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something that Spielberg rips well in "Minority Report." <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 - A good set pieces. In addition, however, there is nothing much to sink your teeth.
