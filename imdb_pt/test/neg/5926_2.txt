I have to say, not very good. Polly Bergen is well in this movie. The rest is so. I'm gay and honestly, there are so many cliches for this time in history that it's just sad. We started watching it and then hung up, so we decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. But all told, the basic idea of ​​the movie is good. If it were rewritten with less-planned lines and better performance, it could have been really good. Above all, I would not recommend it. Also, this is the line of reasoning as coo is so lame. Also, fighting at the hairdresser is funny because it's so bad. The lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to get it is so strange that it is sad.
