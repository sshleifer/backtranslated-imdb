Son of the Mask is a terrible movie. I do not like the baby and I do not like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but they can not rescue sitting through this crap. Even with just 88 minutes (or so it says), the movie could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughter comes at first with a brief appearance by Ben Stain. That's it. The rest is just a replay of the first movie. In fact, this is just an insult to rehashes. Why was this sequel made? This movie cost millions of dollars to make. Why would I sit in a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to make Dad crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented, but he has nothing to do with this movie. I'm not bothering to be cool with this movie. 1/10
