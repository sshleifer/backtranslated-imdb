Tyrone Power was cast in the lead as Solomon. However, in the middle of the movie he died unexpectedly. The studio chose to launch Yul Brynner in the lead and re-shoot the scenes that Power had made. In retrospect, considering how horrible this movie was, Power was lucky - since this would be a horrible way to end his lovely film career !!! <br /> <br /> Of all the biblical epics I've seen, this is by far the worst - and this is a lot because Hollywood has made many tedious Bible stories - many wonder if the creation of these movies was an atheist conspiracy! In fact, the film was so monotonous that it was deservedly included in Harry Medved's brilliant book, "The 50 Worst Movies of All Time." There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst thing is that the whole thing was incredibly heavy! Of course, climbing people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents to play Egyptians and Israelis was very bad - but at least that made the film strangely funny. Having the orgy Gina Lollobrigida playing the role of a woman who had a reputation for coming from somewhere around Ethiopia was horrible, but at least she was beautiful even if she could not act. Having a George Overers with overweight and post-middle age playing such a young role was also very bad, but at least he had a beautiful voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and disgustingly monotonous was pretty bad, but at least you can see in the credits a mention of a person as the "choreographer orgy"! No, the worst thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it looked like nine was so poorly paced and tasteless! Considering that the only mention of this Queen of Sheba and Solomon is only in a few verses of the Old Testament, it is incredible that the film went on and on. The biggest story ever told was a little longer, but the movie was based on four gospels - not a dozen verses! <br /> <br /> The result is that the film is unhappy in almost every aspect (except for Gina's cleavage). Even for devout Christians and Jews, this is a movie that should be avoided because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as it injects an incredible amount of sex into a biblical movie !!! Terrible in almost every way, it really is a boon to Tyrone Power that he is not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey.
