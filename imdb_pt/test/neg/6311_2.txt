It's really terrible. Quaid outnumbers Shatner. The part where Elvis walks in and says "You can have it all" just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that is bad enough already. Drug use was completely covered with snow, the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the fact that he married his cousin. Quaid also looks nothing like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish this could be redone in the future with someone who does not try so hard. A bigger budget would not hurt and maybe more about your real life. I was very, very disappointed with Quaid. Do not watch this movie or you will too.
