I was so disappointed with this movie. The slogan was something like "The story of girls' sexual awakening." You can only imagine how disappointed I was. I was seventeen at the time and took my girlfriend to see. I thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would make my girlfriend choked by it. Unfortunately this was not the case. I think we were not ready for a deep and meaningful film that required an element of sophistication that we did not have at the time. I'm not so sure I own it now, and I've long since parted from that particular girlfriend (really pity ... my first love). We left the movie theater in the middle of the movie, my friend, who should have known better, stayed for the whole thing. I still have the desired result with my girlfriend, the movie did not help much. It would be interesting to see him again so that I can make a more informed criticism, although I think the experience has left me marked for a lifetime.
