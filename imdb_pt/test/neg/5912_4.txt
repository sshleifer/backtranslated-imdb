1989 was already a year when Eddie Murphy was no longer so hot and began making films that would soon be forgotten. Interestingly, it was also the year that Murphy directed his first film, but it would also be the first and last experiment. "Harlem Nights" was not exactly what you call success, even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together, Murphy and Richard Pryor. Do not blame the actors as they all played their roles as you hoped, even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy-laughter. The worst thing about "Harlem nights" is both the scenery and its terrible decorations. Everything happens in the crazy twenties and everyone profits from forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son, Quickie (Murphy) are easily putting together $ 10,000 a day, but of course soon the mob and corrupt police arrive at the corner to claim their share of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can watch "Harlem Nights" for sure, but if you vomit from the moment you hear the name Murphy, it's best to avoid it, since after all this movie is just a tattered excuse to see some good jokes.
