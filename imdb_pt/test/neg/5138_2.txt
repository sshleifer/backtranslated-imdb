An unforgettable pilot who never really explains why Nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie, but Rob Estes plays a handsome cop who happens to be Nostradamus for some reason and who fights medieval monks who travel in time and race around with guns. fire to start the apocalypse. Oh yeah, there's also a sexy FBI agent who's a pyschic and is trying to convince Rob to believe everything before it's too late. Too bad they could not predict a better plot. Yawn. <br /> <br />
