This movie was horrible, clear and simple! The animated scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was VERY clear to see what this movie had on the budget of my grocery bill !! The acting was so bad .. I've seen better acting in pornographic films. I seriously like the twenty minute time of my life back. In fact, I signed up for IMDb just for other people not to be absorbed, as I did. Do not get me wrong, I love science fiction movies! That seemed more like the introduction of a videogame :( I'm glad I spent only a dollar to see this! The plot reminded me of the black movie, A prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes. I would not even let it play in the back of my house while I was cleaning! Bottom line here, you can do better.
