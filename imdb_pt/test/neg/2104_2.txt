Oh. Good. Mourning. <br /> <br /> I saw the title of the movie on TV shows and thought, "I need to watch this movie, stealing Snakes On A Plane, it's going to be terrible, but I hope it's laughable too. Well, I was kind of right. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrifying and, unfortunately, not even intentionally hilarious. Is bad. Even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to anything that looks like action. For the first half of the film, we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and a terrible performance, as some women vomit live snakes for reasons we only discovered later. So we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find that those foreign-language grunts could speak English anyway, as the snakes finally get off the train and things change from serene to ridiculous. <br /> <Low budget does not always mean "bad", but, in this case, it means. What we have here is a movie with no thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense of taking advantage of the few strengths. I give two marks to some decent special effects and a crazy ending, but that still seems a bit too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Stagknight, The Wicker Man remake, Terrible CGI.
