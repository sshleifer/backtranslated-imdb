I like bad movies, but this thing is a steaming hill. From the cameraman shaken to the horrible sound and devastating performance, do not waste a second on that pile. Fifth graders could have made a better film and the first-graders could have written a better script. Want a real synopsis? Ugly girls in neon bikinis dancing for a long time. A disjointed plot aggravated by the hideous performance. The sets on the premises were not even passable. The church scenes happen in a dance studio, and oh yeah - what about the two tap dance numbers coming out of nowhere? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the total number of naked breasts, who could not even save this movie - 0. Add this to the bin heap.
