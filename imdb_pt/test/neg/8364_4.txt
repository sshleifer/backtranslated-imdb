Last night I watched a Prozac Nation preview. Because I love everything Christina Ricci does, I was very excited at first, but as the movie continued, I began to wonder where I was going. Based on a true story, it is simply about the character of Christina Ricci and her fight against depression, drugs, friends and family, as you can probably tell from the title. In my opinion, this film changed very fast and it was too dramatic. I'd say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie went through her extremely fast life, and that left no room for us to connect with Christina Ricci's character. Christina Ricci's performance was fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange excelled throughout the film, and I believe the success of this film will be because of her and Christina Ricci. I would rate this 4 out of 10 and would suggest you rent this or read Elizabeth Wurtzel's books are good and definitely worth checking out.
