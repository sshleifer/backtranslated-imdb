What on Earth? How to watch an episode of Neighbors after drinking two vials of cough medicine - a nightmare and no sense. I was waiting for the smart part where everything fits and saves the movie. Maybe it was there and I just lost, or it's lost in me. <br /> <br /> My biggest suspicion is that it is a veiled attempt to market a new drug that is about to hit the streets. I would not say "I do not watch," but I will say that it is very bad on all levels - as am dram in high definition. Whack Unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. So it's just dandy.
