It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of the time hidden under the shadow of his successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. Joe spends most of his time dressed in black and looking rather moody. He gets orders from an angel of death, which you can recognize as the villain of Tango & Cash and as the cyborg of Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job to do and that involves taking some souls from some kids in a big car being driven by a wacky fool questioning Led Zeppelin. Well, the car crashes and the chase is on. The lucky boys who escape from Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are chased by the city, they break things and Tonya is shocked with her mother while she is undressing for a shower. The action ends up in a hospital where we learned that paradise is an elevator ride. At the end, some green lights blink, Joe screams and Puffy disappears without a trace. I wish I could say the same for this movie. Watch the relative safety of the MST.
