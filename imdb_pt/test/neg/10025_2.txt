Oh yeah, this is definitely a strong candidate to win the questionable award of "worst slasher of the 80's ever made." The Prey has everything you normally want to avoid in a horror movie: a spin-and-derivative plot you've seen thousands of times before (and better), unbearable characters and bad performances, a complete lack of blood and suspense , fuzzy photography and non-original locations and ?? most annoying of all? the most unnecessary fill-in scenes you've ever encountered in your life (and that's not an exaggeration, but a guarantee!). In addition to the seemingly endless amount of material from National Geographic, which I'll expand later on, this movie is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) And two occasions when the characters tell jokes that are not even remotely funny! The setup is as rudimentary as possible, with the introduction showing images of a devastating forest fire with human voice shouting over OTT. Advancing almost forty years later, when an elderly couple camping in that same area is hit by something that breathes heavily off the canvas. That should be enough information for you to deduce that someone survived the fire all those years ago and has been hovering ever since. Enter three intolerable couples of twenty who head into the danger zone with sex exclusively in their minds, oblivious, of course, that they are sitting ducks for the killer who lurks and gasps. "The Prey" is an irremediable boring movie. Apparently it was filmed in 1978, but no one wanted to distribute it until 1984 and it is not very difficult to see why. In case you filter all relevant content, this would only be a short movie lasting 30 minutes; possibly even less. There is an unimaginably large nature and footage of wildlife, sometimes animals that I do not think even live in that kind of area, and they seem to last forever. The only thing missing, in fact, is the typical National Geographic narration that provides educational information about animal habits. Animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably cool to see, but not in a supposedly vile and tacky horror movie of the '80s, for crying out loud. The last fifteen minutes are finally a little priceless, with some potent kill sequences and makeup effects on the monster (which turns out to be Lurch from "The Addams Family" movies), but still fool overrules ?? Is the scene with the vultures very stupid? and the final shot is just a slow laugh. As mentioned above, "The Prey" easily makes my own personal list of the worst slashers of the 80s, alongside "Appointment with Fear", "Berserker", "Deadly Games", "Do not Go in the Woods", "Hollow Gate", "The Stay Awake" and "Curfew".
