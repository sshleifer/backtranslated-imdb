Jerry Lewis was marginally funny when he did not write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he began writing and directing his own films, the little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. Whenever his films failed (and deservedly) in the American market (they made money in France), Lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself; for example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was, according to Lewis, released in a double account with the feature film "Deep Throat." If anyone should have complained about this situation, it should have been the producers of "Deep Throat." This is an absolutely stupid "comedy" about the world's richest man (Lewis), who is turned down for military service during World War II and decides to equip a special "squad" to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many flaws that this film has (the script is absurdly unbelievable, Lewis's "direction" is non-existent, the film has the appearance of a cheap home movie), Lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with talent The Borscht Belt , like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller, were a good idea; he must have imagined it would be so bad it would make him look good. He was half right; they are embarrassingly bad, but it comes out even worse than them. For a "comedy," Lewis's character is grumpy, angry, and aggressive; the way he abuses his subordinates makes you wonder why they would ever follow an idiot like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture Hitler. The fact that this movie has received some money is impressive. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen - I've heard that "Slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can not see if that's true or not - and should be avoided at all costs.
