I can not believe! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim Bears in the movie has a baby, but instead is a movie with bad actors, stupid plot and idiot scenes. That should be in 'crappest of sh * t in earth' movies. Thank goodness the same director did not do it because this is so stupid with some caricature pieces as the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dance! I laughed at this because of how stupid the person did it like Homer Simpson making a movie about a donut! I wish someone would do a mask son remake with a plot like that! The face of the mask (Jim carries) and his wife has a son who is a normal baby. When the baby finds another mask, it also becomes the mask and the face of the mask tries to recover the mask! That sucks a lot, so I'll give it a 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
