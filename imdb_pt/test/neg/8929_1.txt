It's been 3 months and you know what that means ... A new Seagal movie. Seagal has really been in the role of making horrible movies after a horrible movie. Every time every movie is getting worse and worse, it's really amazing! I really do not know what to say about TYD, first it sucks, the story does not make any sense, secondly it uses stuntmen in every fight scene, and last but not least, many scenes are taken from others movies! As this guy continues to find work, he comes late to the set and leaves early and because of that his films are full of holes and stunts. Why do we continue to buy his films, why do we still hope that maybe he makes a great movie?
