This movie has absolutely no redeeming features. It's not even worthy to be in the category 'so bad it's good' - it's just bad. Badly acted, badly filmed, poorly written, misdirected, bad sound record and the whole thing is incredibly amateurish. How this has a release is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Oh, and someone could PLEASE tell the lead actress that if you're playing 'crazy' that does not mean you should constantly mess with your hair - in a movie that was generally annoying, this was probably one of the most annoying things of all. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I think this is the only movie that has ever had a Nazi car thief ...
