It is a sin as these things are done, but again, we could not see the best "dummy scene" ever filmed. Ahhh, the beauty of the low budget Bigfoot movies, you lean to see the beauty the more you watch them, this if your brain does not melt first. Like I said before, this one has the best dummy scene ever! Words can not express this, you have to see for yourself. Wonderful lines like "Smell the flesh", "They are human ..." (You will know this when you see) The creature makes a blah, blah! the sound and scene where the baby is shot will make you cry (with laughter) you will be rewinding. It has a car chase, a snowmobile chase, a folk song by Bigfoot and also a Disco song. He does not end there, while watching the credits that a friend noticed "Wardrobe provided by K-Mart." You ask, how could you even get to the credits and then watch them? I could only explain this as a kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you can not move and also think you have to know who was behind the mess. All that has been said, this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. He's a guardian!
