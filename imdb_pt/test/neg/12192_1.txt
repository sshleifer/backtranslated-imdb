I love to dissing this movie. My colleagues always do their best to defend him, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that it should be valued. Here are some great reasons: A: The plot goes from a kidnapping movie to a strip-vamp-inhabited bar slasher movie, with no set-up. Suddenly, something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience at a Thanksgiving banquet and blowing it up with dynamite. B: That lack of talent Juliette Lewis is in it. C: Absurd ideas are plentiful, such as torso and leg guitars, siblings with the surname "Gecko", bad makeup work for vampires, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?) And a groin-based weapon that only fires when "erect "and belongs to a guy who goes through" Sex Machine ". If Robert Rodriguez did not pathetically try to be so groundbreaking with his violence, I could have had fun with this obvious popcorn movie. The whole project is as if he had ideas playing with action figures. The only thing that is close to being considered my favorite scene is the tacky monologue of George Clooney, after he kills his brother with horrible blood, horny for kids and terrible acting. I swear I think they thought of it then. This film is offensive, and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible movie.
