Calling a boring movie is not something I would normally consider a valid criticism. However, when a movie is made from spare parts from other movies that were not good to start, and is slow as molasses with no real return, I think it's fair to call a spade of spades. And The Ghost is a very annoying movie. <br /> <br /> A movie that is as original as its name, The Ghost tells the story of a young woman with amnesia being haunted by a ghost who holds the secret to her past. Only, it's much more complicated and less interesting than you might think. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost incomprehensible to most of the image and the hook, the element of amnesia, only makes things worse. It seems that no one, including the writer and the director, has any clue as to what is happening at any moment. Instead, they chose to do what amounts to the film equivalent of a series of sitcom clips. There are scenes taken directly from the series Ringu, Dark Water, Shutter, The Grudge, and a handful of wrist for good measure. To make matters worse, the half-dozen women take the whole dress and read their lines, making them impossible to distinguish. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to get along with this movie. The story is not so well thought out. The artifice of amnesia is lazy. The mysterious element is unfathomable and treated with little grace. Characters never infer anything, all information is distributed only by leadership, remembering their past whenever convenient for the plot. The cinematography, full of reflections and images of water, at least tries to add to the subtext, a thematic link with amnesia and the final twist (which I will not reveal) is good, but often exhausted . Even the score seems borrowed and clich√©d. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is that the instigating action of the curse is not very interesting and the final twist is predictable and idiotic. "Wait, you mean a character who has 15 minutes of on-screen time but seems to have nothing to do with the plot, back in the end?" The public is very experienced for that kind of crap. Anyone who has seen any of the movies that rips it will find it very little even to keep them awake with this feature. I used to think Shimizu was the end of the barrel for that kind of crap (redoing his spiteful film no less than 5 times), but even his second-rate work as Reincarnation, a movie I could not even finish, is miles ahead of that . <br /> <br /> For more comments, visit www.collider.com
