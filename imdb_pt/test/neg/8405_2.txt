I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror movie ever. It's not scary, interesting or much of anything. It's reasonably well run and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but that's about it. But this sequel makes it look like "Gone With the Wind"! <br /> <br /> I caught this on TV when I was 14 years old. Unfortunately, I still remember that. As I recall, Rosemary's baby, Andrew, is now grown and coven wants him to start taking over (the world he is). But there are forces trying to stop him ... and Andrew is having doubts ... <br /> <br /> I am giving a 2 for some reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually quite good as Andrew and there is a scary time at the beginning with Rosemary (Patty Duke) being "hijacked" by a bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's bland. , silly and unnecessary. The original did not need a sequel! The continuation of Ira Levin's book in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Tune to the start with Duke ... and then hang up. Not worth the effort.
