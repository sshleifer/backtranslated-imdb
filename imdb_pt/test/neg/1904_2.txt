If you need a clue as to whether the Playmaker is decent or not, look at your star, Colin Firth, who refers to him in an interview as "absolute rubbish - I sincerely hope no one ever sees you." <br /> <br /> The script and plot are ridiculous, the female lead is not convincing. The only thing worth it is Colin Firth, and he seems a bit embarrassed. <br /> <br /> For fans of Firth alone - the shower scene is worth the $ 3.99 you may have to shell out in case you find it a video clipping like I did. <br /> <br /> I am happy for Mr. Firth that his days of leading projects like this are over!
