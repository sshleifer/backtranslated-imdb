Ahem .. I guess I'll be the one who's saying this, but yeah, I was a bit bored during the movie. Not to say that this is a bad movie, it really is a good attempt to portray the most intimate emotions - dilemma, sadness, love ..., especially when it comes to the director's debut (read from somewhere, is it true?). . I felt that something is not right, maybe it's just me, I'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse myself in their world. This is a simple story, about ordinary people, ordinary lives. Through simple and short dialogues, the director tries to relate the life of a simple guy, and how he deals with the news of his illness, laughing every time. Oh ya her laugh was kind of cute at first, but little by little she came to me, a roar so deep for a gentle man! I must say, I did not feel the impact that most readers felt, in fact I was more attracted to the trivial scenarios like spitting watermelon seeds with his sister that clearly shows that they are comfortable with each other, Grandma who came back for another shot - this is kind of melancholy, the thoughtful gesture of writing the proceedings to his father - hmm, but this is predictable. I did not misunderstand that I am an action lover, independent films are my cup of tea! Maybe I have a very high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger images. Some Asian movies are worth it: Tony Takitani (portrays loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialogue) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness too) 15 (gangsters live in local environment) Before sunrise and before sunset (I just have to mention it, even if it's not Asian movies.) The fans will understand!
