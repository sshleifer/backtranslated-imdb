Seeing the cover of it before watching it, my expectations were not high, especially since it was among those other bad horror films in the blockbuster (along with films like Junior). Okay, not only does this movie have stereotyped brainless characters (the rich idiot, the bitch, the sheriff, the announcer who knows what's wrong in the city, and so on), but it has such terrible effects of dialogue, acting, direction and cg. The Jeremiah Stone guy was hilarious. (* SPOILER *) I'll never understand why he bit his finger out of nothing when he was holding the girl hostage. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is as atrocious as other flaws. As far as I could manage, Jeremiah Stone was a gold prospector during the Gold Rush and a notorious Outlaw. He had a lot of gold (* SPOILER *) and put a curse on anyone who was behind his gold before being killed by the villagers after he killed a girl, but not only did he survive, he bit his own finger and ran away. So nowadays, a group of idiots discovers this gold mine, and of course, they are alerted by the locals about "The Curse of the Forties and Ninjas." And what do they do? As expected, he ignored the warnings and eagerly sought the gold. They get the gold, and all kinds of things go on. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) the bitch has her head cut off. <br /> <br /> That's about it. Looking at the movie cover, you can tell what kind of movie it will be. It's so terrible that it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
