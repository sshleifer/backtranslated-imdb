Potential viewers should be warned, the "Tomorrow at 7" viewer's current rating is an anomaly of low voters. It has an interesting premise, a killer leaves an Ace of Spades card at the location of his crimes while alerting the victim in advance. The execution falls to the ground, however, and to say that the film has its share of holes would be implied that there really is a plot. Chester Morris portrays mystery writer Neil Broderick, weaving elements of actual murders by the Ace of Spades killer in his latest novel. Broderick plans to interview a wealthy businessman for his book, but first he has to go through the man's eccentric secretary - "If you align your relatives, you'd have enough to keep a Ford together." This phrase, unceremoniously, takes him to the daughter of "nut" Martha (Vivienne Osborne), who offers to make the presentations. Broderick meets Thornton Drake (Henry Stephenson) as soon as the latter is about to complete a jigsaw puzzle delivered by a messenger that morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learned in the next scene, form the bold black form of the Ace of Spade containing the words "At Seven Tomorrow Night." Now, the person who assembles a puzzle does not use the pieces with contrasting colors FIRST! Initially, I was intrigued by the appearance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in their roles as a pair of police detectives called in for Drake's residence. Generally, their characters are colorful enough to offer genuine comic relief, but here they are simply annoying. McHugh's Clancy in particular ends up shouting objections to futile comments made by his partner Dugan, and both usually go in the opposite direction when a real problem may arise. <br /> <br /> Now, here's a question - in the light of identity. of Ace's killer, why would he have invited a novelist and a pair of cops he just met on a flight to his Louisiana plantation? Especially when at seven o'clock, all parties would be a captive public aboard the plane when the first murder was committed. It is not Drake however who is dead but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). The initial suspicion falls on pilot Henderson (Cornelius Keefe) after a scene of dim lights, but Henderson has not yet reported the murder to his supervisor until well after he arrives at Drake's plantation with everyone else. Can you imagine anyone trying to get away with it today unless your name was Ted Kennedy? <br /> <br /> With the cause of death still to be determined, the local coroner is called, but the first one that shows up (an accomplice Broderick) is a fake. However, when the actual coroner appears, he simply disappears immediately afterwards! In a second dark scene, a letter from the murder victim Austin Winters is about to be read. It ends up losing when the lights return, and because it can point to the killer, it becomes a clue that must be recovered. So where was the letter? Winters' daughter, Martha, took it and put it on the robe of the living room! How much thought was put into it? <br /> <br /> Obviously, the whole affair is so insane that Morris's character solves the case quite easily. Even if the movie arrives in just an hour, it becomes almost a chore to watch with all the nonsense going on. There is really only one funny moment that is worth repeating; while on board the plane, the detectives have this exchange: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how many times do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" <br /> <br /> Except for McHugh and Jenkins, I can not say that I saw any of the other players in films of the era, although I was a fan of most of the mystery films in the "B" series of the time. '30's through the' 50's. Fortunately, the couple do much better by supporting Humphrey Bogart in a 1938 jewel - "Swing Your Lady," where laughter is intentional. The best I can offer about "Tomorrow at Seven" is a quotation from Martha Winters about the middle ground, though this turkey - "This is just a silly waste of time."
