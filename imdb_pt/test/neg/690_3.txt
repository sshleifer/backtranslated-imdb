Although Humphrey Bogart got a star in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he did not thank Jack Warner for it. In fact, this movie was a hollow crown. King of the Underworld was supposed to be a remake of Paul Muni's film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer in the person of James Stephenson. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are married doctors and Eldredge performs a complicated surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey is a man who appreciates the good work done in his name and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and there's more where that came from if he threw his cards correctly. Eldredge, who has a gambling problem, sees a good way to get some undeclared income. <br /> <br /> But when he is killed in an attack on the gang hideout, Francis is also believed to be involved with the law and the American Medical Association, no matter how much she protests her innocence. Not good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to escape the notoriety. <br /> <br /> It is clear that notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard as a writer in Stephenson, all meet up with her. again. But Kay is brave and resourceful to say the least. <br /> <br /> Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor boy was screaming for better pieces. He is a gangster who attacks people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He is worried about his image and therefore kidnaps the writer Stephenson to the ghost, writes his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn it in all 48 states. And then Kay Francis overcame him completely, hard to believe that he was the king of anything. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the smaller jobs for any of the stars.
