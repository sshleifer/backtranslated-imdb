"The Sad Cafe Ballad" worked hard in his image, but when the time came for the crisis, he stood in his own dust. <br /> <br /> You can not imagine saying that loudly, but if Vanessa Redgrave's Amelia fought John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, my sweaty dollars would have to go to Redgrave. Her interpretation of Amelia was so close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to anyone hired for millions of dollars. Redgrave gave Amelia that slurred speech that was a blend of her own unique voice and a sweaty southern woman. To the average viewer, this could be interpreted as annoying, but as the movie progressed, did it become? Miss Amelia turning that stage beauty into a brute. Was it Redgrave's performance, as well as her interaction with the other characters, that made this movie stand tall? but not the highest. The others following their performance were necessary, but not stellar. As we passed the obscure cliché image conveyed by all the stylists hired for post-South Depression jobs, the secondary characters looked like poster paper. The image was necessary to define the scene, but the characters of the city had no other purpose. Take, for example, Rod Steiger's vision of some old and spoken preacher. Only his scenes will make any onlooker question the validity of this city off the beaten path. The two main players who surrounded Amelia fought with charm for the admirable moment of stealing the scene, but due to the lack of direction? it looked just faded. The most absurd of the two (although both have a high ranking among the questionable sanity line) is Cork Hubbard, who plays Amelia's cousin, who appears randomly one night. His character is never well defined, he has no real reason and his loyalties remain uncertain. He plays no vital role in this film out of forcing us, the viewers, to question his sanity and honesty. Can you create a character by simply stretching your tongue, shaking your ears and punching your chest and head? Finally, is there another extreme of absurdity? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this tormented man build character, but our lack of understanding between him and Amelia makes his purpose fumble. These were the characters, as Southern cliché as they were ?? some came forward and tried to create a piece of the absurd period, and I can not argue that they failed. <br /> <br /> Where "Ballad of the Sad Café" failed to overcome mediocrity was in cinematography and narrative. This movie was about Amelia, and her need for other souls in her life. Was the level of public comfort with the arrival of your dwarf cousin fun? No one could stop wondering if he was honest or only a man of confidence would try to steal a warm heart. The character of Cork Hubbard is never well understood, but we accept him with brief shots of him and Amelia doing little things together. It's his idea that he turns from a reclusive businesswoman into a legitimate coffee owner. The problem is that director Callow never takes us to that dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave ?? Is the man crazy or does he represent Amelia's entire family? I needed something from Callow to get these two out of David Lynch-esquire's relationship they had. Then our pool becomes even deeper with the addition of Carradine as Amelia's "love interest." Using the technique of a flashback inside a flashback, we see the two wed, but never consummate their love ?? that Amelia's anger against their love drew him into the world of madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was that even in the movie? With the lack of focus for the connection of these characters, the possible scenes between the two did not make sense ?? Play in Cork's choice and you're completely taken aback. While there were some beautiful choreographed scenes that Callow created, the inability to transfer their characters from point A to point B. I lost focus, interest and my care with the characters plummeted when I did not understand the final question? "because"? In general, "The Sad Cafe Ballad" began with a bang, but it ended with a small crack of fireworks. My emotional feel for this film flickered up and down, up and down and eventually stayed more down, mostly due to the lack of understanding of the characters' motives. Redgrave did a phenomenal job as Amelia, and while the other characters (out of the random Steiger) tried their best, I did not quite understand who they were. Her motives were so confusing that when the emotional ending finally occurred, I was apathetic. Director Callow did not seem to have imported connection scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our top players. Callow created some beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap the scenery, which allowed us to focus on Amelia ?? or Carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. The film unfolded with anger, discover, happiness, flashback, anger, anger, anger, disappear. Without the comparative connectors, this changed from distinct period film into actors playing parts in front of the camera. It was a shame, because "Sad Cafe" had the promise, simply could not deliver. <br /> <br /> Grade: ** ½ out of *****
