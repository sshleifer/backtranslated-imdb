That's exactly what we need, a program about people no one likes in high school or university. Man or woman. People objectifying others and congratulating themselves for doing so is the exact opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is disgusting to do just that. <br /> <br /> So four men sit in chairs and watch the other two guys try to get women to have sex with them. And in the end one of two wins, great ... just f-n great. I must also accept these four bibs as "judges" of the "Game" of people. The term "game" has to be the dumbest thing to get out of modern English, since the term "Bling Bling" added to the fact that these men are called "experts" only makes me want to vomit what's left of my respect for modern culture. These are not God's models, they are the result of MTV's culture coming to bite us. If you like the bullshit that spills the sides of this monstrosity, you probably think Paris Hilton and Britany Spears have talent. It is not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking like this. <br /> <br /> And to all those people who will say that I would like it better if I had sex, or that I was just jealous. Fuck you, because it's obvious a REAL girl is not going to.
