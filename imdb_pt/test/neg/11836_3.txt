A baby T-Rex is on the loose in a small western town, leading Sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who walks with her role in a very disinterested way) to get to the bottom of things. They discover that a wacky scientist (Corbin Bernsen) is, unbeknownst to government sponsorship, continue with a long-abandoned US research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (ha!), Creating an Army of Dinosaurs in a Clandestine Lab isolated. Before long, our heroes get trapped inside, the Marines are called, the power goes out and the dinosaurs are released to make a quick lunch from everyone in which they can put their claws and jaws. <br /> <br /> An often annoying script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this direct copy of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is a reasonably digestible waste, thanks to good production values, passable FX, occasional laughter and a lot of brainless action. Someone pointed out that an opening scene in this movie was stolen from CARNOSAUR, but anyone accustomed to watching Roger Corman's productions knows that it allows directors to reopen clips of their first films liberally to save time and money. . <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
