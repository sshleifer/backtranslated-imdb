I just watched the National Lampoon Christmas movie on DVD, hoping to see something at least close to the original, great holiday comedy, "Christmas Vacation." I did not see anything like that. You can say from the beginning that this movie would not measure up. It's a shame that it has a title that links it to the original Christmas Vacation. Is very sad. The movie does not support its own merits. I think many people will see this movie with the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy. In addition to the title, there is very little connection between the film and the original "Christmas Holidays" and even less connection with Christmas. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot is poor. Children may find some humor here, but most adults would just have a chuckle here and there. This movie is a failure. Do not waste your time on this.
