In what attempts to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so the men who hired their team can mine it for ... bird droppings. In fact, the nitrogen gas that emanates from the mud on this island is what they are behind. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing about this movie - the location of the island it was filmed on was beautiful. Otherwise, the story drowns leaving the actors with nothing to work on. Result: A lot of violence, lots of language, lots of blood and some pictures of topless women. If you want senseless violence (sorry, history can not even point to violence, though try), then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Parents: Tell them this movie is full of violence and blood, driving the R rating.
