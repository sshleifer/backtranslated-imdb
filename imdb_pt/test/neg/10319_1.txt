I watched 5% of this movie tonight and you can tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly I do not think so. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this story? movie? I've seen lots of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? Okay. <br /> <br /> 1) They were shooting around the place like it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill. The whole place is made of metal, but not a single bullet lit on metal surfaces. <br /> <br /> 2) No ricochet. Metal vs. metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one was hit by a stray bullet. <br /> <br /> 3) Magic bullets? In one scene, a bad guy is right in front of a nice guy when another good guy appears behind the bad guy and pumps him full of metal. You see the bullets coming out of his chest as he explodes in a bloody haze, but the good guy right in front of him is not hurt at all! 4) After having just spread a human being all over the wall, the two good guys tell each other a few jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with light weapons. <br /> <br /> 5) Sound? At one point, good guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who, by any chance, cuts a wire just to trigger an alarm?). The lady shouts "Alarm in the blah blah blah" and the evil boss says "All right .. that .. is .. no .. a .. blah blah blah" in a very, very amateurish way. Ooh, we're being ambushed by terrorists, this is not a drill, but I'm going to sound like I do not give a shit. <br /> <br /> 6) Focus !! First you see the bad guys carrying guns. For some reason, the same guy gets the same Uzi twice. Leave vu or loop scenes? You literally see every villain receive the same type of weapon and they catch and charge the same way. The weapons dealer appears in the clip and the extra villain does not. XX locks and loads. When they started to open fire you had to see the barrel blink. Boooring !! 7) actors or mannequins? One of the presumed good guys throws a smoke grenade for some reason and, of course, the bad guys are suddenly in the smoke because they are blind to the smoke or something, and they do not see that happening. They cough and moan like an anthrax on the grenade. Then there comes an evil chieftain and he does not even cough when he enters the smoke, he simply pushes the other thugs away and suddenly they realize that the smoke is not the Anthrax anyway. <br /> <br /> 8) B flick? I guess so! A guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding an Uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone at his eye level, apparently. I'd like to see a guy shoot an Uzi with one hand and I'd like to see him take his hand afterwards. Extra bloody gore mess in a move B kinda half. Little * pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicate that this guy is dead. Although the first bullet has hit his heart, the good guy who is a super-trained green beret still feels the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy. <br /> <br /> 9) One of these trained soldiers mentioned jump their skin with an empty clip! How stupid can you be? Always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) boring scenes. Like the flash scenes of the barrel and the scenes of lock and load, the film is filled with time wasting scenes of people running in a seemingly empty building. Cut to action, if you're going to a flick B movie, please. <br /> <br /> My two cents in this movie.
