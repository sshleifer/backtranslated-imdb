This is a WC Pictures movie. If the producer's name is an indication of how stinky the film is, then that would be it. I do not think I'm a fan of horror movies, not that I'm a chicken, but just this year, I have not been genuinely scared of what's to come by now, whether it's from the West or from Asia. 9:56 is no different, big premise, but poor execution, relying on clich√©d techniques (think these are the only tools available to trade?) To try to provoke a few moments of heart beat. <br /> <br /> -jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman who one day realizes that some apartments in the apartment block in front of her go through blackouts at the same time, precisely at 9:56 pm, all the days. No, she's not a voyeur, but a series of unexplained deaths in the neighborhood, including one she meets on a subway, begins to lure her ever more into the mystery surrounding those deaths. With horror movies, there is always a pseudo-logical explanation within the movie about how ghosts happen. This is just about the most interesting thing that happens in the movie, the revelation of the "Truth", though it does not take experienced moviegoers to guess the plot in the middle of the road. Which, of course, makes it a very unsatisfactory experience to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> There are a myriad of characters like the wheelchair girl and the neighbors who take turns taking care of her, as well as a schoolgirl, detective. , a boy with mental problems and a creepy train traveler. But following the gender formula, these people are often used as food for deaths, or in this case useless characters of red herring whose sole purpose for filmmakers is to deceive the audience, no matter if they convolve, or add little to convey the plot . And do not tell me about the techniques employed here. Quick cuts, sudden appearances, long-haired ghouls (ahhhhhhh, so out of fashion!) That can not move properly, a copious amount of blood as it flows through a mountain of grace, and the list goes on. But credit for sound engineers by creating some sounds of crunching the bones used every time the ghosts move, though it sounds like a pony of a trick. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this, even though you're a fan of terror. It is a complete waste of a promising premise and in the end you feel as if you have just been taken on a tour. A very long and painful to bear. It's time for some breakthrough in this genre, otherwise a movie will easily look like another, with ugly long-haired monsters moving funny, but with the ability to make sudden appearances accompanied by loud sounds. Oh, and somebody can power those doors while they are too.
