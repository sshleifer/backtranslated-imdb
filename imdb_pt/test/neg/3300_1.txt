There are shows and movies I've seen, and later I've read reviews of that I disagree with, and I was happy to accept that there was only one difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Reading positive comments of this mess merely reminds me of a sinister conspiracy involving TV network officials being ordered to surf the internet, posting unconvincing comments to programs for which they themselves are responsible. <br /> <br /> How else could anyone explain review opining that this show is "sure to become a phenomenon" a full year after it became clear that it will not be anything like it? <br /> <br /> I will not waste words describing this mess, but enough to tell you if you like, wives who emasculate their husbands, husbands who emasculate their children, children who are disrespectful to their parents and absolutely no other kind of behavior or subtext to legitimize characters who are basically speakers of vomiting from a single line, so watch this sh I, on the other hand, have a few Seinfeld DVDs to go through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - canceled. Development Prison - Canceled. The war at home - renewed. <br /> <br /> No justice.
