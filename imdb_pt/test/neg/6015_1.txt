What is the point? This has not been done before, the better? And again? Why is Werner Herzog wasting his good talents and his time with this garbage? He should not be filming a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> Everything seemed false from the start. Werner Herzog would never have attempted to make a movie about the Loch Ness myth - at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers - then the plot was not credible from the beginning. The actors who were supposed to act like they were not acting were obviously acting. The story was not interesting, the requirement of "ordinary people" in all documentaries was invisible, the personalities were obsolete, the jokes were not funny, the effects were not convincing and the end was nowhere. <br /> <br /> I just do not see the point. It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah Maybe if those who thought of such a movie tried to make one that ridiculed the people who were really looking for a real Nessie, now that could have some potential. But Herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be. A mockumentary on the cryptozoologist crowd would have much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a fault.
