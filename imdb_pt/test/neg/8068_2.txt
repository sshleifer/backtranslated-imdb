So if a guy knows you and he says "I want you to look at my erection!" do not be scared, maybe he wants you to look at the movie he made about how his house would be built. yea! This is the only thing that happens in this movie! It's like the worst BEEP Warholian I've ever seen! it's like filming the inside of your bathroom before you wash it, it's actually less interesting to look at than that. <br /> <br /> But if you watch Lennon's erection, be warned he's put a lot of knowledge noise too. I mean, it's like the building was being attacked by space-hell mutants or something! Meanwhile, the building in progress is growing as an erection can do (in almost 20 minutes, which is an achievement). <br /> <br /> So if someone asks you to watch your erection, make sure he wants to film it all.
