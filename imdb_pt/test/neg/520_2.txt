This is a terrible movie that only worsens and never seems to end. The acting was poor, the plot was worse, and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th year science class. Dennis Weaver is a great actor and should never have participated of that kind. My advice, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
