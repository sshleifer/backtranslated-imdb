How are such bad stories made? This is not an issue. It's a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Much of the development of the story was predictable and boring. My emotions ran practically on a flat line everywhere. There was not much to attract the viewer to the film. <br /> <br /> 2) The characters were decidedly uncharismatic. One was crazy, another was confused and the third was very annoying. There was absolutely no reason to be attracted to these people. Even though I knew this would not happen, I kept waiting for them to meet someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was uncomfortable for me. A trailer ??? In the desert??? The desert is a place that most people would rather not visit. How do these three people end up in the desert? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on Earth could find themselves in a few weeks' time in that desert? <br /> <br /> 5) Would it really be necessary for Mrs. Ryan to be in two scenes that required a swimsuit? Hey, she looks great, but it was pretty free. <br /> <br /> Okay, so if I thought so bad, why did I give 3? I'm trying to be as objective as possible. Even though I find Alan annoying, I have to say that David Arnott did a very reliable job portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of some of Albert Brooks' most annoying roles). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it was not written very well. Okay, so she should be a confused and dysfunctional woman. But why? What did that add to the story? Your mood made me feel like I was being pushed (hard!) One way and then another and then another. <br /> <br /> I do not usually go out in movies, but this made me contemplate several times. Stiff, predictable, annoying. Proceed at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
