As embarrassing as it is to admit, I was listed as a production manager on this film ... my first! In fact, it was the first feature film of almost everyone who participated. Watch closely, and you can even see me in one of the opening scenes, like an asylum attendant about to be murdered called ... "Cely" (my own surname). Originally titled "Hostages," this image was changed to "Another Son of Sam" by the director-producer, who wanted to profit from the serial killer in the news of the time. Nothing could have helped. I do not even think this photo was good enough to be displayed on "MST 3K!" The film was filmed mainly with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and Arriflex portable cameras. In fact, the helicopter shot during the hostage siege was filmed with my own World War II era Arri. The photo was filmed entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina, in the mid-seventies. Most of the "stars" were local TV presenters, and the rest of the crew were either inexperienced enough or naive enough to believe in former stuntman and producer director Dave A, Adams' raves of propriety. <br /> <br /> If you like to see this kind of photo, you can love the work of another North-Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
