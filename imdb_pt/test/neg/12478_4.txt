Lucius Fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, misrepresents black humor in Touch of Death, a TV movie about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psychopath who seduces and kills rich widows to pay their gambling debts. <br /> <br /> Beginning with a wonderfully bloody scene in which the lethal lothario discards his latest victim via a chainsaw, grinder, and hungry pigs, Touch of Death gets promising enough, but Fulci soon loses control of the procedures, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copy killer and some heavy-handed comedy scenes. There are several other graphic murders that are, in fact, extremely violent and horrifying, but even the high level of bloodshed does not prevent this from being one of Fulci's poorest efforts. <br /> <br /> As I have found with many of his other films, an understandable plot is not exactly at the top of the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities that left me little perplexed: why did Lester not rule out all the victims using the method of dismemberment seen in the beginning? Why are all your victims hairy or disfigured? What the hell is this end? <br /> <br /> Fulci is considered by many to be one of the "greats" of horror movies; I do not understand his popularity, finding most of his films that I have seen so far, usually lacking decent narratives and technical proficiency. The touch of death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.
