I was not impressed with the Graffiti Artist, despite the artistic appeal (aka low budget improvisation). There is little dialogue and, at least for me, I was disappointed not to give more credit or to promote the work of guerrilla artists like these. Instead, it was a story that covers family territory. Two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends, marking partners and eventually experience a relationship. They look opposite, quite uncomfortable together. Little is explained about their origins and things between the two young people happen at high speed (although this I can understand because they are only 70 minutes or so). There have been countless numbers of similar plots and productions in recent years to the point where the sphere of independent cinema is beginning to get so saturated with this specific narrative as the mainstream has become saturated with it and more. /> Much of the film can annoy the viewer who needs immediate dialogue and purpose. The main figure of this story (at least extensively), performs its routines with almost no dialogue, no insight, and nothing else to convey the viewer. And for a short film, I wish they'd gotten to the point a lot faster. This, in addition to the typical plot, bothered me. However, there was something about a momentary glimpse of the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even if most of the time was quite unoccupied. <br /> <br /> Recommended if you're tired of the crap of the mainstream and do not mind an indie picture and have some interest in this underground urban art form. But, you really have to watch for yourself because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste. For latest indie films focusing on graffiti artists, check out Transit.
