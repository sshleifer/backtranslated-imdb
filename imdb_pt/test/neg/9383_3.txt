When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. You are in dark and distressing movies like "Alice" and "Little Otik", or short stones like "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky". All of these are excellent films that represent disturbing and surrealistic movies at their best level. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmajer tries to make a political statement of any kind, you are advised to leave the film. Room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this sense tend to be teenagers and preachers, presenting man-straw caricatures repeatedly to express their pseudo-bright insights. <br /> "Lunacy", unfortunately, is very the latter type of film. Caricature ideas and characters are stretched like paper thin for two terrible hours. There are some moments that briefly hold interest, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of annoyance. <br /> <br /> If you have found the brilliant and monotonous short film Etkkojer "Et Cetera" bright and hilarious, you'll probably love "Lunacy". If you've never seen a Svankmajer movie before, please start somewhere else.
