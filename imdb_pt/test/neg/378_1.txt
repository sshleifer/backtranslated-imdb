I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this was an abomination. It was almost as awful as "The Never Ending Story 3," for the same reasons. They led a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, farming villages, witches, supernatural creatures, and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid; and I thought it would be fun to mix our materialist world of rock & roll pop culture, sushi (I think that was so), and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I do not want to see a bunch of old barbarians watching people dancing on some rock music on the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but this is just stupid. This is what Hollywood does with good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Do not give up, however, the Eye of Braxus is much, much better. The one I gave a 10. This, Portal of Time, I give a 1. Believe me, I do not always give such high or low ratings. I only tend to comment only on these movies.
