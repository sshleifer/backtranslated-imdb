It's a shame that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to succumb to bad stories and scripts for the money alone. But, hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> This is just one more of a long list of murderous thrillers that use all the usual twisting narratives to try to make it seem more attractive than it is. Of course, he has great locations, is a good production, there is a good job of camera and editing, and it is very rhythmic overall. <br /> <br /> So, what's the real problem? Quite simply, the whole premise is totally unbelievable. However, instead of ruining a rotten story for you, I'll let you figure out what it is if you can get through it. I did it, but only because I like Baldwin and kept hoping it would get better. <br /> <br /> It did not happen. And it had one of the most anti-climatic finals I've seen for a long time. Actually, maybe never ... <br /> <br /> But, it's harmless, I suppose, if you have nothing better to do.
