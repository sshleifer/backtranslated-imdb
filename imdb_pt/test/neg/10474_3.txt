I rented this movie courtesy of Netflix, thinking about receiving the 1972 version. I was out of the blue, seeing this new version, thinking: Wow, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack had a faint 70s sound. I was even more convinced that this was a 1970s movie, when it occurred to me (almost every five seconds) that the only thing missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug, a loaded look, a passionate kiss. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship, it's painfully obvious that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually teenagers) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that the yearnings for love, togetherness, desire to express themselves sexually are overflowing. These guys needed to connect, but they were never allowed to. <br /> <br /> In addition, despite Toby Moore's spirited acting, I never felt that any of the emotions were real. I never connected with any of the boys, for the simple reason that their relationship was not really honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in a fantasy and think that it happened in the 1940's when these boys could not. I did not have those sexual feelings for each other. But I say yes - at least in the book they did, and in this movie, Finney had them, almost painfully, for Gene. The "intensity" that John Knowles suggests existed between them was a secret homosexuality, a cult of the hero, an idolatry - which, under normal circumstances, would be expressed in a sexual way. Even if these boys were suppressing, it should have been clear, but this movie does not even suggest that. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney, who broke his leg, is touched by all the other boys during a football game. Unless they were just a bunch of nincompoops, they would know that they could not throw their bodies against him. Obviously, this devastating moment was lost in both the director and the producer.
