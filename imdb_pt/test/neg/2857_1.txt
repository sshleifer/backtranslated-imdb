I've never seen a B movie like this ... from the part that nanny Sofia is being killed ... a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the bat ... how bad is that ??? LOL, I seriously laughed and wanted to stop watching the movie, but I kept watching to see if this movie could get worse ... lol ... it's bad for itself ... poor Pinocchio ... the only cool piece is the first time you see some special effects of the face of Pinocchio moving ... in addition, the whole movie is horrible ... not worth much if you do not have much to lose! But if you have nothing to do ... go ahead ... treat yourself to some "Z" movie because movie B is still too good for this ... LOL
