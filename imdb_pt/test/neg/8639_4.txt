Once Theresa Russell made some decent movies, then I keep hoping that one of her efforts of the last decade or two deserves a rating of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is just the latest in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very difficult to watch. The lines are delivered by the main actors as if they were being read in a first rehearsal or even in a casting session (in which the actors are doing this because of their agents but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading ). Sets and accessories seem "somehow" (what kind of police department would allow a detective to have a whole wall in the living room full of dumps)? The screen is constantly filled with time and meaningless data, which appear without rhyme or reason. Now, if the screenwriter were standing here after the lights went up from a movie festival show, they no doubt talked about how all those flaws are REALLY clever clues to the plot turning upside down in the final five minutes of failure . Well, for those audience members whose only other film experiences are TV: THE MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; they may be persuaded to nod their heads. But it's hard to believe that ANYONE who has seen 10 or more movies in their life - and not an intimate friend or relative of a cast or crew member of DARK WORLD - could fall in love with such a dumb bastard. Despite what the d.v.d. box can lead you to believe, this movie has almost as much resemblance to SUNSET BOULEVARD (dead narrator device) or Hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) as a bottle of Jim Beam drained recharged with urine have to drink!
