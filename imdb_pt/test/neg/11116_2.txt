I did not like this movie for so many reasons that I can not even say then. I thought it was poorly done just because of the whole story. I mean, who's going to believe they caught the chupacabra and got loose on a cruise ship. LAME !!! It was all right for a direct lame for a video movie, but it's not worth spending money on it. I can not believe that anyone really gave this movie a ten. But I think there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and had the guy out of the Lord of the Rings. If you want to see this movie I would stay home and wait until it reaches the science fiction channel. Do not waste your money watching this movie. Believe me.
