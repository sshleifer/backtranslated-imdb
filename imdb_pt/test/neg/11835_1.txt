Why is not this movie in the bottom 100? Raptor is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in all my fifteen years of life. I've never witnessed such a catastrophic mess like this before. Absolutely everything is strange and cheap. <br /> <br /> Nobody in the cast gives a decent performance. The dialogue is totally incoherent and humor is anything but comical. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can not help shivering when I remember some of your lines, like "In or Out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your friend is not a good poker player, she has just revealed her hand." <br /> <br /> The kidnappers are a joke. Even I could make dinosaur effects more realistic than these filmmakers did blatantly. It is an insult to true velociraptors or to any dinosaur. Not only that, but the murder scenes are too horrible for me. I do not think seriously that these animals would tear their victim to pieces and throw pieces all over the floor just to make everything look dirtier. Also, blood and guts are useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Jurassic Park and dinosaur movies. Maybe the filmmakers did not anticipate anyone with an ounce of intelligence or a sense of disregarding the bad movies to come across this movie on HBO late at night like I did. If I could say one thing to anyone involved in this film, I would have to quote Dr. Alan Grant from the first Jurassic Park ... "Just try to show a little respect."
