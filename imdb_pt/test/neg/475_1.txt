I just saw this movie last night at a pre-premiere preview (I work for an independent theater chain in Colorado - it's one of the perks) ... I'm sorry, but this is one of the WORST films I I've already seen it! I know there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there who (like Star Wars) will tie you up in the nearest tree if you DARE speak ill of your beloved movie icon ... however, Campbell-teers in this particular The Work of The Chin is a black celluloid hole. Before making any assumption that I'm a movie fan who only watches "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways", think again - I'm a big fan of B movies and Bruce Campbell in particular. His character character, Ash, is one of my favorites, and his portrait of Elvis aging in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. <br /> <br /> But, hey, B movies still have the potential to be re-really, reeeeally bad (and not in that "good" way that we all love ... and that's how I watched that particular for me and my workmates.Without the one track where Bruce runs around the square and scares the kids, there was no laughter.We generally thought the story was numbing, the rhythm akin to a mole, and the so-called dumbest humor (I'm sorry, but Ted Raimi's character "Pavel" was not a comic relief ... he was just a retard!) Believe me, we all like this, but we were incredibly disappointed and stolen from two If you really loved this movie, plan on seeing it several times, getting married and having children with it, etc., this is fantastic - we all like what we like, so you have no judgment on me. sense of humor or the loyalty of the fans of those who are not having org asmos on the latest Campbell movie coupe. This movie was a steamy sandwich in my humble opinion ... and as a true fan of Campbell, I can say that!
