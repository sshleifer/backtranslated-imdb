I'm surprised that so many people find this movie still close to good. Let me make it clear that I'm a big fan of Hitchcock and I've done my best to own as many of your video movies as possible, but this one I felt was below expectations, not just for Hitchcock films - yes, I'm being very cool here. This photo really sucked. I do not mind that Hitch did a favor for the talented Carole Lombard, but I saw 50's series with more intelligence and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? I like mashed potatoes and ice cream, but I would not want to savor them together. I've seen better chemistry on chemical spills on the road than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, skip this movie and see any of your best. By crying aloud, the chunks Hitch did on the old TV show were funnier than anything this movie failed miserably to deliver.
