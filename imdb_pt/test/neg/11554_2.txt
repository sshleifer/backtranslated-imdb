Having lived in the Upper Michigan Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to see this movie. It starts very promising, with some superficial understanding of the values ​​and peculiarities of the U.P. life. But, apparently, Jeff Daniels was not happy with a discreet approach that would have been appropriate given the place and the people. Instead, it introduces an extremely raw mood and some unnaturally inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie about this region virtually unknown to the US, it is NOT that.
