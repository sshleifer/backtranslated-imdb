This movie might be great, but it's a complete imitation of Bill Forsythe's Comfort and Joy. c & j is one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen without becoming diabetic. <br /> <br /> It's okay if you like but realize that EVERYTHING in this movie is a direct scam. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 I can recommend almost anything for forsythe - Local Hero, Gregory's Girl, That feeling of sinking. I better go and rent it tonight. Location There is a young Peter Capaldi and an old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he gave up making movies after a very bad Hollywood treatment. Sad.
