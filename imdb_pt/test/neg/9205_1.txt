Now, I love old and bad movies as much as most people. And I understand that a budget is a budget. That said, Planet of the Dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can be. The thing has no actors, and only an attractive female that they kill two minutes after swimming ashore. There are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this wasted celluloid pile. The only thing that was not wasted was the paper ... the script should have a maximum of four pages. Certainly no one actually WROTE dialogues this pointless. I am constantly amazed that these films have been made, much less liberated. I'm glad I did not pay to see this loss of time. It's 75 minutes of my life that I will never go back.
