Dennis Quaid is trying to prove Jerry Lee Lewis was a dumb face. And he's doing a lot to prove it. The TV sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old recordings in black and white. The music is also good because Mr. Lewis himself is singing. But the rest is just Hollywood B-Movie style, with the Happy Days complex of the fifties. I think the only good thing in this movie is seeing young Winona Ryder.
