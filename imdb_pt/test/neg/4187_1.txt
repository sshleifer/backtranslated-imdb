Well, cast me aside. I have not seen such a bad home movie since the 13 SECONDS abysmal or HALF. Someone should get Sony Handycam out of this guy! This movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for $ 20 does not necessarily mean you should. <br /> <br /> I remember one of the things that Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a Crew", is that when you start making a resource without a budget, you need to use all the resources you have for your disposition. Rodriguez says you should make an inventory of all the locations and props you can crave, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was a friend of the mayor of some city in Mexico, so the mayor let him shoot for free. What you got in EL MARIACHI was a movie that seemed to cost a lot more than the real budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of the film has a copy of this book, and he took it. advice to the heart. In that case, he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put a haunted house every year. It looks like a good location for a horror movie, but it's hard to keep an interesting cornfield for 90 minutes. Not a single installment of the CORN CHILDREN series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield. Hitchcock only spent about ten minutes on one in NORTHWEST NORTHWEST. Give a hint, fella ... corn fields are not for the fascinating movie. It would have been nice if the director had more friends with more locations, because this thing gets boring after the first 15 minutes. This movie seems to cost about $ 30. (Or what it costs in admission to the cornfield maze). <br /> <br /> Apparently, he could not find anyone to play in his movie, so he launched. Big mistake. Here's a thought, if you really want to make a movie, ask for an actor. So, as far as the assets are concerned, it seems the cornfield labyrinth is the only thing the poor man had. Maybe he thought that was enough. In fact, I'm going to hang out on a limb and say I know he thought it was enough because the film, before capturing the coveted honor of being the sequel to DARK HARVEST, was simply called THE CORN: THE MOVIE. Maybe this is already planning THE CORN: THE MUSICAL or even THE CORN: THE MINI-SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our Jack-Of-All-Trades (and yes, the Nothing Master's part is definitely appropriate here) plays a psychic parent who can tell when bad things will happen. Think of the DEAD ZONE character, but not as close to an actor as good as Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. The psychic father has a premonition that his two daughters, who are in the corn maze with his mother, will be killed. He runs to save them. From that point on, the whole movie is spent watching Father Pyschic run into a cornfield, looking for his two daughters. He finds the two little ghosts of THE SHINING, and he helps solve the mystery of his murder. <br /> <br /> Shot on a $ 200 Handycam. The director jumped. Edited in iMovie. Improvised history. If that is not enough to keep you away from this home-made catastrophe, consider this as a final warning ... THE WHOLE MOVIE happens in a cornfield, boils and ghouls. Here's Ghoulie Guru's hint on how to save money and still feel like you've seen this movie. The next time you see a cornfield, stop the car. Take a flashlight and run around for about 90 minutes.
