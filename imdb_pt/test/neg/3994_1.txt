Let me see if I understand ... "The Church" has a "locking" mechanism of security to prevent the spirits from leaving, but the ultimate solution is to bring it to the ground! LOFL! Maybe I'm losing the plot. Maybe this guy's from Ed Wood's film school or something. This movie is as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe that's the point. The whole Rosemary Baby-esq segment was hilarious. I can go to my corner shop for Halloween costumes and get better hauling than that. The whole movie needs to be redone. Duly. There were so many things that were thrown down ... so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling. I'm not sure if the flaw is in writing or editing, but what I saw should not have such a high rating.
