<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a wonderful "feeling" for the pre-WWII in Italy. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you can not get memorable performances from this 'A List' then the problem with that film should be blamed for an unfortunate direction and an inappropriate script. I rented this on DVD after having enjoyed "Angels and Bugs" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can hardly believe how dull this thing was. He just crawled and could not save the poor man. This is not even a good movie of intriguing girls - guys and foreign girls - in beautiful clothes! <br /> <br /> "Tea With Mussolini" Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
