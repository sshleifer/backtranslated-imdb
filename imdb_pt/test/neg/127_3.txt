I love science fiction and I'm willing to put up with it. Science fiction / TV movies are often under-funded, under-estimated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it's for a good TV science fiction like Babylon 5 is for Star Trek (the original). Silly prostheses, cheap cardboard sets, flamboyant dialogues, CGs that do not fit the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters can not be overcome with a 'science fiction' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you who think Babylon 5 is good science fiction TV, it's not, it's clich√© and uninspired.) While American viewers like emotion and character development, science fiction is a genre who does not take themselves seriously (see Star Trek). It can address important issues, but not as a serious philosophy. It's very hard to care about the characters here, for they are not just fools, they just lose a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The creators of Earth KNOW that it is bullshit, for they have to always say "The Land of Gene Roddenberry ...", otherwise people would not continue to watch. The ashes of Roddenberry must be spinning in their orbit, for that is boring, cheap, poorly edited (watch it without advertising breaks actually bring this house) march to Trabant of a spectacle in space. Spoiler. So kill a main character. And then bring him back like another actor. Jeez! Dallas all over again.
