I rented this movie for the first time on the infamous September 11, 2001. Since then, I have seen it several times. My only complaint is that it is very short. "Strangeland" would be a complete piece of horror art in two hours. Thus, the execution time is only an hour and a half. Dee Snider, a former Twisted Sister member, wrote, produced and starred in this 1998 crash festival in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks, a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies about human evolution and a love of near-death experiences. Hendricks is not easy, he is a "modern primitive" of nearly two meters. Someone who has tattooed and pierced his body to the extreme. When he makes his first full appearance in the film, it's a truly terrifying sight. Hendricks' main pastime in life is to share his "spiritual awakenings" with his abducted victims. He visits chat rooms on the Internet under the name "Capt. Howdy" and then invites people to his house. They think they're going to a party. Instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks sows his eyes and mouths and tortures sticking blades and hooks on various parts of his body. If it looks sick, it is because it is. <br /> <br /> One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve, the teenage daughter of Detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her, but also arrest Hendricks. Four years later, Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated for community disapproval. A group of hipsters led by Freddy Krueger himself, the actor Robert Englund, decides to kill him. They fail and Hendricks returns to his former self. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie I'll leave to you, only to say that the conclusion is satisfactory and will leave you in shivers. With the exception of Snider, the acting is not very good, but it's repairable. The steering is fine too. There are some funny parts in "Strangeland" and they are a lot of fun. I also loved the soundtrack, it's amazing and worth buying if you like rock. Overall, this is a movie worth seeing. If you like low budget horror movies with a sense of humor, check it out. You'll probably like it.
