A dull, horrible piece of European trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time drinking beer (that's what makes him American, right?) Our scientists spend most of their academic lives away from their minds, of course. the big theories come from who is studying something (dolphins, fish migration patterns, who knows). He hears a strange sound through his headphones, proving that his radio is picking up a station in Jamaica. Jack Skellington's girl with one of the worst and most bleached bad hair hairs of the 80's I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing is trying to calm the dolphins at the Seaquarium where she works, since they seemingly annoyed at how much fish she has The beginning of the film was a very badly colored story about two annoying and very Italian people whose boat is attacked by something invisible under water. is seen (the best part of the story), and the corpse of the guys is found without legs. The obscure alcoholic scientist (who has an inexplicable English-Italian-Italian accent) and the little girl with hay hair begin to theorize that there is some sort of giant monster peeping beneath the seas off the coast of Italy ... er. Florida. <br /> <br /> They rely on the help of an electrician to mount an underwater microphone so that the monster can sing karaoke. This guy has a beautiful girlfriend, which is the only downside is that she pronounces Peter "Pey-tah", but for some reason he is sexually attracted to the anatomical skeleton with beaded hair, a situation that leaves a blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> The dubbing is horrible, the editor is a spaz, and the plot is usually a yawn. There's a little bit about how this strange scientific corporation genetically engineered this giant shark-barracuda monster for some reason that does not make sense, and a really nasty oily-haired guy goes out there and kills women, again for no apparent reason. A stupid sheriff and his helper joined in for the ride, along with a female scientist (who we know to be smart because she wears huge glasses). There was a time when the scientist clung to the huge, terrible monster (yes, right, Ed Wood's giant octopus was more believable) with just a little hatchet, and she won the contest. Hooray for skinny little women, who obviously make the best monster hunters! <br /> <br /> The solution to the giant's problem is to blow up half the Everglades, leaving a dead zone for several miles in all directions. . To hell with ecology and the environment, right? We have to kill this giant monster! In the end, the electrician and his broom love to walk at sunset on his Vespa which is o.k. since she overcame the death of her peers and he is not too upset that his girlfriend was struck by the crazy guy with oily hair. Live the true love! Wait a minute, there's something suspicious about it all ...
