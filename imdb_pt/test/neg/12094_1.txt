I have not seen anything around here for quite some time, but after having had the misfortune to sit through this garbage masking as entertainment I had to present my thoughts. Normally, however bad a thing is, there is a redemptive part, whether it is an actor who was well, a scene that was passable, an attractive cast member, or a pleasant general moment. Unfortunately, this is not true here, as the movie starts out atrociously, with a ridiculous shooting, which was so bad, I thought it was a practice, and two half-dumb, also known as the boys in blue talking next to a school. one of those idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only starred in this, but also actually directed this garbage, and unlike his brothers can not act for toffee. Not that he was alone here, since they all seemed to belong to the training school of a trained chimpanzee. Luckily, certainly for me, I only watched an hour of this masterpiece, as the DVD would not work, and was probably done by the same idiots who produced it. So if you have nothing to do but watch the paint dry, see this as it is so annoying, and ideal to get rid of unwanted guests.
