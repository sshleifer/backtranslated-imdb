Disaster mishmash misery has a team of scavengers who come across the upset S.S. Poseidon, hoping to loot before they go down for good. Irwin Allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "The Poseidon Adventure" hit theaters SEVEN YEARS LATER! No matter that no one cares anymore, why give us such a poor production, full of obscure characters and miscast actors, only to destroy the memory of your greatest success? You could end up feeling sorry for Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones, were it not for their expressions lost at sea (good for a few laughs). There is a time when holy Jones is tempted to take some treasures just for himself and she timidly starts to fill her pockets which is an unintentional hoot. The film was a career satire for all concerned, especially Allen, who has never recovered from it. * in ****
