I really enjoyed the game Far Cry, good graphics, good level-design, interesting and intelligent enemies, above-average length and even a somewhat decent plot. I'm not, by default, against the spin-offs of games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was hilarious. But what Uwe Boll did here, is to pick up the game and modify each of its positive aspects and turn them into something horrible (well, not the length, the movie runs only 90 minutes) Characters are even more stereotyped than in the game, which is a great achievement. The whole plot is told without any twists or mysteries. Several ridiculously ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story. And come "Genetically Modified Soldiers"? they could have a better name. <br /> <br /> However, this movie should receive some prize for the most idiotic love scene. I've never seen anything like it. I could not believe they were trying to be serious "we have to get out of the wet clothes" "I think I'm going to have hypothermia" (although everyone is wearing T-shirts) "we need to hold ourselves to the warmth of the body" There must have been a screenwriter, a director, actors, a gaffer, an electrician, a foodie! Why did not anyone get into this scene to prevent this one? I'm not going to start complaining about how many logical mistakes, inconsistencies, and script failures there were, but even for the action fanatic, this can not be anything but insulting . <br /> <br /> This movie actually asked to be rated 2 out of 10, so I'll do it in favor. to the game? You want to wait! they used the game source for the title and credits. It was cool. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for a bad movie night, go to "2012 - Supernova", this is just - sad.
