The Alien is a Steven Seagal movie straight to the video that was originally planned to be released as a play in March 2003, an intention that would have been reversed when the previous Seagal movie (Half Past Dead) was leaked at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a budget of $ 20 million, including filming in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the studio's obligation to negotiate after the relative success of Exit Wounds. that Seagal still had solid followers. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of its investment, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move by filing this movie. It is almost incomprehensible. What am I saying? It is incomprehensible. I do not think I understood what was happening except in the broadest terms. <br /> <br /> Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious pack to another mysterious face. Other mysterious faces try to stop him. Other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him. Other really mysterious guys do especially mysterious things, all of which, in fact, were very mysterious for me to discover. The mysterious wife of the recipient tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Because he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" who was hired to deliver the package only into the hands of her husband, Seagal defies his wife, and then engages in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious faces with inexplicable agendas as well of her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious and cryptic conversations. Many people explode each other's brains. Some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes the shootings end without a clear view of the outcome, so the audience sees someone dying but is not sure which of the gunmen is heading. The rings change often, adding more mystery. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I do not know who was on whose side, or what someone really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfactory as the exposure. At the end of the movie, I just sat there thinking, "Is this the end? What the ...?" <br /> <br /> I could not even figure out the credits. IMDb says Australian actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this movie, but I'll be damned if I know where. Either she was left on the cutting room floor or wisely gave up the project. She could have found some more beneficial activities for her career, such as having unnecessary surgery, ripping out foolish magazine cards, or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry. <br /> <br /> Seagal used to be a handsome fighter, but the action scenes could not rescue this movie. Seagal is in his 50s now and is a very big man so he is reduced to a minimum level of physical effort and even during this he is contained in a knee length coat to hide his soft budding circumference. He may even be a bit out of breath, removing the wrappers from the chocolate bars, although it is understandable if you estimate how many of them he needs to eat to maintain his current circumference. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last film was already dead, this one should be pretty close to filling the other half.
