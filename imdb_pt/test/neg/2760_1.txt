I was forced to read this sappy love story between a 24-year-old German prisoner of war and a 12-year-old Jew. This is "politically correct" written all over. It's like the movie "SPIRIT," in which a horse wants to be free, but the "bad guys" do not leave it because they need it. Well, I have good news that Americans are "bad" in the German soldier and his summer book. Because!!! The horses were given to us by God, and if the Americans needed a horse, they could use it well. In the same vein, the German was trying to kill Americans, but this book / movie makes it sound like it's okay! The cast is absolutely awful !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white, the father is probably of predominantly white descent and the younger sister is "shirley templish." The acting is very bad too, the serious parts become comedy! Conclusion-Bad movie, bad book, but both have different endings, do not read or see anyone!
