With "No Dead Heroes," you get stupid lines like this because this terribly abysmal action movie needs to be seen to be believed. William Sanders is saved by his friend Harry Cotter during an extraction in Vietnam, but is captured by the enemy. Advancing ten years and Harry is now a Russian brainwashed worker with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. His new Russian superior is Ivan played to the obscene fist by Nick Nicholson, who I may add not only did not once try to speak with Russian accent, but resembles more to a gas station attendant in Kentucky with his stained teeth. What is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialogue coach for this movie. Soon William is recruited by the CIA to hunt Harry. He joins Barbara, a freedom fighter who infiltrated the El Salvador camp and soon the two are blowing up half of South America. Some scenes are so impressive that it's a wonder because this movie has no followers. One such scene is William and Barbara's sudden lovemaking in the jungle, accompanied by the most inappropriate background music I've ever heard. Who would strip naked completely in the middle of a South American jungle? There is a rape scene that uses the final theme of Blood in the Claw of Satan as well. In Dead Heroes is the champion of magic bullets of all time, because a shot leads to several deaths. In one scene, Harry throws his rifle behind a rock and kills seven men. I had to go back and tell. Hard to find movie that recently received full HD treatment by MGM. Follow this movie and see it by the sheer nonsense that follows.
