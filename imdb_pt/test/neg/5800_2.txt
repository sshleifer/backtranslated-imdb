This movie has no plot. A guy was supposed to live with his grandmother, and everyone thinks he's a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big party at Grandma's house. the film's climax did not even relate to the rest. this entire plot was introduced within minutes of the end of the film. I can see how this might have related to the supposed story - that Grandma's VG abilities redeem it - but that was simply not there. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was funny as hell and clearly depended a lot on the jokes. <br /> <br /> "Your vagina smells great depression" "He just sucked his first nipple ... yeah for 13 hours" "It's for you ... I think it's the Devil"
