I've been a fan of Star Trek since 1966. I still am. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that special effects are secondary to the characters. Farpoint meeting fails on his mission. <br /> <br /> Superbly produced. <br /> <br /> POORLY directed, written, acted. D.C. Fontana really spoiled this. This episode is so embarrassing that the master tape should be burnt. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season did not go much better.
