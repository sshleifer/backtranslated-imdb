Yes, it has long since become a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. More or less. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with a high school, but there are a lot of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits, so I guess that way it's like a jail. Not really though. When Sasha, the character of Steven Seagal, is being admitted to jail, he is stuck on the line and wanders to a different line so he can talk to his friend, as if he were queuing for security control at the airport. Then, in a short time, he and his friend are punching, hitting security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. You rob a correctional officer in a federal prison, they will shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before giving the second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing hats and bandanas and everything. In prision. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> You can not dress like that in most high schools in America. Speaking of Ja Rule, I have to say that the person who probably liked his performance more than anyone else on Earth, including Ja Rule himself, should have been 50 Cent. Just before watching this movie, I watched one of those TV shows about the biggest celebrity fevers of all time and, like the number 7 or 8, this rivalry between 50 Cent, who lived the life of a real bad guy, and Ja Rule. Who did not. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could imagine was 50 Cent laughing. Ja Rule looks like a nine-year-old child every time he appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the plot. It is funny. Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to allow himself to be sentenced to prison in order to support the criminal organization. He is doomed to five years and the old line between determination and stupidity instantly disappears. Nothing else in the movie matters after that, it becomes a meaningless sequence of action sequences, most of which are not even well choreographed. <br /> <br /> Oh how about this, a helicopter falls on the roof of "New Alcatraz" at one point, accidentally releasing all prisoners. And what do they do? They all leave their cells and play basketball in the middle of the block of cells. Without as much as a basket. They had a ball, but that does not matter. The scene is so stupid they could very well be playing hopscotch. <br /> <br /> So a guy is being condemned to be the first person to be executed in the Alcatraz execution chamber, evidently not by stealing. $ 200 million dollars in gold, but not to say where he was hiding once he got caught. <br /> <br /> Hey, good thinking, people. If you can not get information from someone, kill them. This is a great way to learn the truth! Then a gang invades the prison planning to stop execution and get the $ 200 million location for them. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the $ 200 million are in gold bricks. I doubt they have thought of how difficult it would be to turn that into currency. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of the prison director. He's a tough guy who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the neighborhood, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talked to everyone, calling each other and houses and all sorts of other nonsense. These people go to Mexico, says the comedian, and they say, "My God, people live there, it's like a total hut!" <br /> <br /> The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that his men can not carry their guns inside their prison, "I do not care if she's a judge of Supreme Court of the United States! " <br /> <br /> This woman could crush him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge. There is. <br /> <br /> And by the way, the Supreme Court that is taken hostage in the film tells the villain that she is 53 years old. This is a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> The only good scene in the movie is the one in prison where Ja Rule is being slapped by the prison like a bag of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a very, very long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I work for the company that produced this movie (which I watched), and I still do not have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that scene with Ja Rule being beaten by that Asian woman. So read my review on Malena and you see how I sometimes strongly disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of that film Ebert wrote something that I agreed with all that he already wrote: <br /> "I imagine the flyers in the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated 'Half Past Dead' PG-13 after giving the anti-gun movie 'Bowling for Columbine' a R. "Way to go, boys.
