I love documentaries. The Andy Goldsworthy doc was great.I looked forward to this - but was very disappointed. I knew Kahn and was intrigued by the idea of ​​his solitary death in the men's room at Penn Station. There must be a story here, I mistakenly believed. The only story here is of sadly deluded women who have had affairs with a little-famous and ugly married man. In the absence of anything as an explanation for this horrible behavior of this guy, we are given endlessly repeated clips of Kahn walking and painfully long - supposedly contemplative - photos of his soulless buildings. In fact, some of the buildings are interesting but the momentum of the film asks us to think about the guy himself. The exaggerated soundtrack makes reference to an emotional pull that is totally absent from the film. Kahn's apparent gifts do not justify his behavior or martyr his lovers. This movie seems to want to give way free Kahn the great artist and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures - I did not buy it.
