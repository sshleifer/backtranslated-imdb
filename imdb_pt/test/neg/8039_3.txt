The Great War breaks out and Daddy is a brave pilot who engages in some nasty business to put Jerry in his place. Mom is doing her part as a nurse, so the five children are evacuated to their noisy uncle in the country, where a secret passage leads them to a mischievous sand fairy and the beginning of a magical adventure. <br /> <br /> Based on a book written the best part of a century ago, they do not make stories like this anymore. And there's a reason. Men fly planes and author books; the women exchange bandages and clean the house. The boys lead the way with their compasses and nighttime slots; girls do what they tell them and play the violin - evil. Fat boys who use specs are nasty. All children speak of those sharp, vowel-flattened accents, which are sentimental and cruel, but which a certain economic class of Englishmen cultivate. Besides the snobbery and craving for Imperial Albion, there are plot holes that a five-year-old would not tolerate. I mean literally - my son was asking why his father disappeared before sundown, because the compass did not just fall out of his hand when he disappeared. The film at least tries to strictly target children, until a completely inappropriate and unsightly monologue of Eddie Izzard (what a waste of genuine comedic talent) touches the final credits. <br /> <br /> No doubt the five percent of British schoolchildren attending overpriced public schools in the UK will find it all a joyful hiss. For the other 95% of British families who no longer live in the 19th century, the good news is Wall-E, Ratatouille and Wallace and Gromit are on DVD.
