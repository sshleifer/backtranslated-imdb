This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. "Epic movie about Russian culture," "Great saga of the Russian spirit," articles and endless interviews. For me this movie was the biggest disappointment. The protagonist played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid and immature boy ready to assemble his comrades because of a woman who does not even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the movie, the story does not develop. Popular festival scenes seem to boast of Russian audacity. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous work, both as an actor and a director, but this film only demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "Tzar" of Russian cinema. .
