Apparently in the eyes of some - there are not enough horror movies these days involving young people being chased in a desert by a mysterious and bloodthirsty madman in a truck. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP may well be the worst of them. It's about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind together to start together in California. Along the way, they stop in a dirty bathroom so the girl can relieve herself, but when she returns - she discovers that her boyfriend and her car are gone. From there, she discovers that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup truck that continues to chase her and terrify her while she hides in the bathrooms. This movie is so unoriginal that it's boring. The acting is annoying, the blood is light and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the film, is anything but memorable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
