When I say worse, I mean less fun. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some stupid tricks with the camera since Zombie's last bloodbath, which makes the film even less tolerable. In the last film there were no special camera effects, where in this, we are treated with shaky camera, and constant change to black and white. Also, this is called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that zombies are evil in this. The film begins in 1945, where some Satanists kill a violent thief and put him like a scarecrow. In modern times, some children have a problem with the car and go to a house, the same house where the satanic murder happened. Some evil people try to rape the kids (or something), and they bring the scarecrow thief back to life, who comes back with some zombies and now talks like Darth Vader. Sheets thrilled the language and lessened the violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, check it out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 min. Not classified, contains violence and language.
