An inexpensive, uninteresting, low-character assault film, many stoic underbite styles (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some extravagant cliches thrown in an abandoned factory, ready for some badly executed John Woo judos. Even the squibs look horrible. At no point in the process does it seem remotely to America. Three old cars do not make a country. The Mustang even has an unstable right front wheel. The plot, as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a death by mercy. Could not come soon. Even the robbery jewelry looks like the cheapest jewelry available. The horrible dialogue and the hopeless overcoming of all who are hit by a real waste of space and time. Worth watching if you want to know how not to make a low budget movie full of clich√©s.
