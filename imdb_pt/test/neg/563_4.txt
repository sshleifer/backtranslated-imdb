This movie should have been called "The Eyes of Alexander", and they should have ended Bogart's concept. The film began with a laid-back approach to Bogart's legacy and some comedic moments with his surgery-oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes it turns into a more serious thriller where two palm-sized sapphires supposedly placed like eyes on a marble the helmet of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, just before his death. Thus precious stones are of great value, not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the bond with the greatest conqueror the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is completely and completely a fiction, but makes a good movie anyway. So the film revolves around some initial nonsense and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in the foreground (which I really liked), ending with a dated shark attack (you could not go to a movie in 1979 ). 80 without some shark appearing to threaten the public). There is a yacht named Euridice (the young wife of Alexander's father), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus? (It's been about 5 years since I've seen the movie so I can not remember all the details), Olympias, some street names and many others. It was fun watching the movie just to try to capture all the background details that the director (obviously Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done, the eyes are recovered and the camera puts them in a bed the credits roll by. Kind of a legal ending. What would have been more fun would be if they were from Indiana Jones and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make it more interesting, or instance, the handwritten version (by Aristotle) ​​of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many trips to Asia (would be invaluable if found today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite B-movie actress) is killed very early, and should have been the lead actress, not the mommy and daddy's girl ... though she was easy on the eyes. If you can find this movie, it might be worth checking out the historical stuff and seeing Olivia Hussey in a bit of an extremely funny mood, but besides that, I would move on to something more fun. <Br /> Yours, Nick
