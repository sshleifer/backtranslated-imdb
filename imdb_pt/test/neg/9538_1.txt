OK - let's say some college in Southern California has a movie class. And some guys were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or just stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned that into their grade. E FAILED. <br /> <br /> That's my only explanation for this, this thing. Good God, they left the date and time against some parts. The image began in a new scene before the sound and forgets a storyline. Well apparently there was one and they had to say all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was completed. But I'm glad they did because I would never have achieved it by watching this. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY from it.
