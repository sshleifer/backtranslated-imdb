First of all, the nature of the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked like Mongols and the camels, but that was all that was Mongol in it. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongol actress, although it's a poor performance. But she is beautiful, which redeems a little the lack of performance on her part. <br /> <br /> But I could not understand what was the purpose of this painful play of watching a 1.30 hour costume created by Mr. Bodrov. The plot had no sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was practically no story, just a few scenes loosely tied up with a bunch of guys in "Mongolian" outfits, talking a bit of pidgin that should sound like Mongol. Most of the actors were Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were filmed in China, Kazakhstan or Russia, and there were a lot of disturbances about what it's like to be a "mongol." The dialogue is primitive and the dialogue scenes are slow. The battle scenes are laughable. The whole pathetic supernatural is lame and it is obvious that it exists only to compensate for the lack of history. The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him he had no idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. He looked drowsy, soft, hard and pitiful for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> And I do not even want to start with the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic junk. See Chinggis-khan half the film as a slave, see his first two sons born of other men, see his wife selling himself to the Tangut merchant ... my blood starts to boil. And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? You can make a great movie with that. Where is the story of Temujin's rise? From your childhood, your relationship with your family, your siblings, how he fought to survive among your family's powerful enemies? where is Van khan, who helped you a lot? where is the representation of life in the steppe, the life of the nomads, their traditions, their relations with the other nations around them? <br /> <br /> Where is the character development? We totally failed to see what Temujin brought along with Jamukha and what separated them and most importantly, as Temujin became Chinggis-khan, as he, a pariah without wealth and military power managed to unite the Mongol tribes and create such a machine organization effective war that crushed one nation after another and created the greatest land empire in history. All of this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we have not seen any of this in Bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.
