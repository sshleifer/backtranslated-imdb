A remake of a hit movie can be a tricky business at best; remake a true classic, especially one that is definitely the definitive film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else again. And after watching this version of 'Psycho', directed by Gus Van Sant, two things come to mind immediately: What's the point, and what the hell were they thinking? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (by Joseph Stefano, taken from Robert Bloch's novel) that Hitchcock used. The end result here highlights some of the subtler points of cinematic art: first, that a "remake" should be just that; a reorganization of the original rather than a copy using new players; second, that shooting in color, using more blood and being a bit more graphic does little more than lessen the impact of the film. Although this was a noble endeavor of Van Sant, ironically, in the end, he suffers from the same flaw with which Norma Bates was affected: the "mind" of the film was divided; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. And the two, though known, will never be bound. Van Sant, even working from the original script, would have been better off making his own film - all the time - instead of trying to duplicate exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. The opening scene of the film, for example, and especially the scene of the 'shower', undoubtedly one of the most famous scenes in film history. Copying Hitchcock, from the shots looking directly into the showerhead up to the drain, and using the same 'skree'! skree! skree! sound effects - even as a tribute to Hitchcock - again, just distracted from the story. And, if you consider the performance of William H. Macy (as Private Eye Arbogast), you will have another division in the psyche of the film. Macy is a great actor - one of the best character actors in the business - and his performance here is great; but as good as it is, attitude and delivery are pure, David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times) and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant is doing. So the film ends with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I was watching 'House Of Good Will Psycho Games'. Macy's was as solid as they were, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character, escaping the trap of trying to imitate Janet Leigh. The weak links were Viggo Mortensen (Sam), who made Marion's boyfriend so stupid and nasty that made you wonder why she had something to do with him in the first place; and Vince Vaughn, who - to put it mildly - was simply awful as Norman Bates. His entire performance was of an actor playing a role (and not very convincingly); affecting effeminate mannerisms and punctuating his speech with spontaneous outbursts of maniacal laughter made his Norman more caricatured than a character, unbelievable and pretentious. It gave the film the feeling of a reenactment of a "True Incident" that you would see on a television show; It would have been entirely in keeping with the sensibility of the Norman film slicing sitting alone in his living room within a shot of a sober Peter Graves, chanting, "That was Norman Bates's mentality in that fateful, one rainy night when Marion Crane left of the car and entered his life ... - The supporting cast includes Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers).), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard (Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer.) At a minimum, Van Sant's Psycho is a curiosity that shows that having a good director, a predominantly excellent cast and a script that is a proven commodity does not necessarily guarantee a success.It's true that the psychopath's era, "American Psycho" and Hannibal Lecter has effectively taken the edge off a character like Norman Bates, but there is still a singular in the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims, which will remain forever inherently disturbing and terrifying; but Van Sant is unable to convey that sense of dread, that fear that squeaks in the throat with this movie. If ever there was a movie made that should have been aimed directly at the video, that's it. Better yet, he had never been born. I rate this a 2/10
