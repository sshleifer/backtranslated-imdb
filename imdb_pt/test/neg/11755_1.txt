I know curiosity killed the cat, but I simply had to watch Psycho's remake, especially after being on one of those Hitchcock days recently and getting to know his work. I watched the original Psycho since I was a kid, I knew how to respect it and not just that, it was a great movie! One of the best, actually! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was "How do you remake perfection?". I also insisted on it, but I think I have a more open mind now and figured it might be a way to introduce Psycho to a new generation. <br /> <br /> But this turned into a total insult and a slap the face of the original Psycho. I know this has already been said, but I watched the production of this movie, and the director was like, "Oh, I just want to update it and shoot every scene taken per shot like the original" ... what's the end point? ! OK, but I want to judge this movie on its own, despite insulting the original. I mean, the acting was not even, but honestly, it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines there and did their own crap. Watching the shot In this movie, I wanted to slap Anne Hasche, she said "I've never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, that made me angry, because, frankly, not only that, she really swallowed that role as Marian, she was not convincing, not to mention that her shower scene really was awful. Vince Vaughn did not ... let's put it this way, the movie was horribly misused. This was a sin against the film and by itself, this was really a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could have been a new introduction for a new generation. But for Gus, leave the movie making those who know what they are doing! <br /> 1/10
