Although I'm sure the idea seems good on paper, and it caught my attention when I first heard about it, this movie often goes unnoticed and falls, and when I watch it, I just want it to end. The beginning and the end of the movie about Lou having to deal with a troublemaker are invented at best, though I think the top of the cops are good-humored. However, I found little to laugh with the background of the barrel script that was played together for these two great comedians. I thought it was a mistake to put them in a musical, and it smells like "Wizard of Oz" (with the songs and the black and white to the colored format). I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than A & C fanatics. Anyone else will be disappointed and will have many better movies.
