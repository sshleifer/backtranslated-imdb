Defined in the near future, a dark stranger enters a city in southern America plagued by zombies. Establishing ourselves with a group of friendly inhabitants, our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life. There are two groups of people; the upper classes who live safely behind the concrete walls of the city being provided, for the right price, by the state police. Then there are our friendly inhabitants. These low-class people live alongside the zombies. There is only a means of survival to exchange goods, which they buy during the day, with the police in exchange for cans of food. Our stranger discovers why his world is a zombie plague. A new diet pill that suppressed craving for carbohydrates was the foundation. The human race's desire to lose fat caused the downfall of society as we know it. These pills have increased the desire for protein, that is, meat, even the pet poodle. However, there was one more serious side effect; after death people became reanimated with an even stronger desire for protein, that is, human flesh. <br /> <br /> With what I feel is an imaginative introduction I felt that this film many perceive some inventive material. What better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of ​​people's desire to make any sacrifice to change their bodies without the hard work of the academy? However, the imagination of this film soon stopped after this exhibition. This film falls into the old trap of "I can not imagine what the world will be like when society collapses." When watching this movie, you do not escape to a different world, like when you see Planet of the Apes (original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw (original). In this movie the alternative society is defined by people with hair dyed orange and green. Face painting and leather jackets from charity store. There is no hardness about life in this alternative society, only healthy faces and invented zombies. Movies should allow you to run away and do not remind you that you need to clean your wardrobe and take your old cloths to the charity store. <br /> <br /> Forget some of the deplorable acts, or invented zombies. . This film fails because it is very polished, very nice and predictable. I've been watching movies like this since the early eighties. If you're going to make such a movie, I suggest you need to watch movies like Dawn of the Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci's Zombie again to see and experience that feeling of despair in a devastated society.
