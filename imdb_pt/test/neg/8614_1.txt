The plot is simple: an American couple is on vacation in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by the "all-powerful" Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the great vampire boss. It's okay so far. The girl's partner is left to look for her. And now the horror begins. He comes across a strange bunch of semi-vampires or something (they only drank animal blood). These vampires have been in conflict with the villain for about 800 years. However, with the help of the 'good vampires', the guy begins to search his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now the fight scenes begin, what is a karate movie without fighting? Another thing I noticed is that vampires are very ugly guys. I mean .... a vampire is an old fashioned guy (he's been alive since ... forever), he's got style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie, vampires are ... strangers. Like, come on, they ride their bikes, they're all dressed in leather and they wreck everything in their path. <br /> <br /> The worst is that you can clearly see that this movie is low budget. The script is boring and the actors are not very talented. The music is very good, but the effects are not so good. <br /> <br /> To sum up the movie, it's not so good, but if you have a free afternoon, watch and tell me if I'm right or not.
