This movie suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no idea how to pack Jackie Chan for the masses. His low budget movies in Hong Kong were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his incredible gymnastics skills and light comedy talent. His early Hollywood films put him in the same movies that were being packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There's nothing about Chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian, except for him being the star. In his films in Hong Kong, Chan is never boring, with movies being a fast martial arts sequel after another, but "The Protector" is lifeless everywhere. Danny Aiello does not have much to work on and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got together. Both were better at worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the shocking way that Jackie Chan comes out so colorless and monotonous. It would not be until the Canadian "Rumble in the Bronx" that the West would finally find out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
