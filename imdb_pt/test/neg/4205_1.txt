I've always wanted to see a movie where Chuck Norris takes the bad guys aside and quietly discusses with them the mistakes of their ways until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, shake hands, hit the world's mistakes together in peace. and harmony and forever end the kingdom of evil in the world? <br /> <br /> Well, forget it, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" instead goes straight into the fall chute as our man driving trucks, Chuck directs his great equipment to the small backwoods town where his younger brother is being held by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt lawmen. chuck karate kicks, chops, slices, juliennes and wrinkle cuts every baddie in sight until neither a malefactor dares raise his head. Many fights are in slow motion for the purpose of excitement, but only help fill the film to fill 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> And there are many fights here that leave only 15 minutes to plot. development ... and it's about the whole plot you get. But what did you expect: calm discussion? <br /> <br /> A star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and that's a small 10-4, good friend.
