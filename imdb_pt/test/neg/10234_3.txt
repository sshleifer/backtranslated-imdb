Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to watch! While none of the other comments mentioned this, the public domain version I watched was seriously flawed. The soundtrack was off in about 10 seconds - which meant that the dialogue and action never came close to matching. So, you would hear something happen well before you see - a very confusing proposal! The worst is where you hear a shot and only later the guy is hit and falls to death in a taxi. <br /> <br /> Although this seriously messed up the film, it also made it easier to focus on dialogue. -and showed the serious shortcomings of that as well. The dialogue was simply awful - often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. As one reviewer said, it was like watching a high school play. Part of this is understandable, since the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue in that movie was poor, even compared to other 1929 films - very bad. And, as in many of these early sound films, the film was very complex - with melodramatic and overly melodic language and little action. And you'd think with a title like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action !! However, it's really a sappy romance - with very little action. <br /> <br /> The film finds Carol Lombard riding with an alcoholic musician. She herself steals to try to take care of him - and the thug, Robert Armstrong, comes to your aid. When Armstrong catches it, he covers it and then helps his drunken brother get up - and of course he falls in love with her in the process. The problem is that once the drunk gets sober, he also wants Lombard and she needs to choose between them. Wow ... a recovering drunk or a mafioso ... talk about a couple great prospects! Overall, it's a bit difficult to gauge considering the bad print I saw. However, even if you ignore this, the film has many problems due to its inappropriate use of dialogue and overly talky nature. And ... it was sappy too boot.
