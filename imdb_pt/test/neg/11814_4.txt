If you find that acting hopelessly amateur, uninteresting story, fake blood and all bearish irrational endurable, then you can really have a good time watching this cheap and cheap exploitation movie. You may also want to take a look at a good sequence of fights that is offered, though not good enough to assert the rest of the movie. (**)
