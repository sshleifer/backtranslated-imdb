Predictable, clich√©, unbelievable, boring ... what more can I say? It's just the caliber of the cast that saves all the redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yeah, and the fun antics in the final zone. <br /> <br /> But wait for the eleven o'clock highlights because the result is as predictable as who will win the battle between Globetrotters and Washington Generals. <br /> <br /> I was fine in the second act before I discovered that these were the PRO teams we were watching (all dressed up with the vintage Brown Fathers). And the imitation of the character Cameron Diaz of a young Georgia Frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (It's not your fault, Cameron. Would you like to go to dinner?) Enough of this - I'm just in a rush because I was looking forward to this movie. Rent the yard longer instead. <br /> <br />
