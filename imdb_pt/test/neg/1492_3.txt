I am very disappointed with this work. It's quiet, it keeps repeating itself, it's no longer accurate, and sometimes it's on the verge of being wrong. I think it's made for elementary school, especially since it keeps repeating itself over and over again leaving big gaps. A kid might really like it and learn from it, but a better way to make a child enjoy theoretical physics is books like "A Brief History of Time" or "The Tao of Physics." If you are familiar with the topic at a very basic level, you will not get new information or views from this series. Do not waste your time on this. Good eye candy though.
