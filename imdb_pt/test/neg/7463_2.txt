The attic starts well. The somewhat sad story is greatly aided by the two main actors and there is a semblance of a character study going on here, but the movie descends fast when the character of Carrie Snodgress buys a monkey. Not one of those cute monkeys. She buys a big chimp !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot device basically kills the movie. It simply is not conceivable for a woman like Snodgress who plays, who finds it difficult to do anything because of her domineering father, so that she unexpectedly buys a chimpanzee. I mean, come on! Forget it!
