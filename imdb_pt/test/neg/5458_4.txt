I'm shocked that all the "hated" ratings are six and seven, still above average. For me, this seems like a case of "the emperor has no clothes". I understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's ... Regardless, it has become a struggle to sit back and watch. The DVD I saw had some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech has no subtitles. Some of them are difficult to understand. The Jamaican pato√° was nice to hear, but you struggle not to "hang up" after a while. Some of the scenes were cool, and the realism was there, even though some of the performances were not great (Jimmy Cliff did a good job). The plot is not bad, but rather predictable. In the 1:43 movie, the highlights are Jimmy Cliff (Ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shootings and a fight. Probably 15 minutes or more. The rest is very annoying. BTW, near the beginning of the movie, there are some strange cuts with the character Ivan that look like an editing bug, which made me laugh a little. One critic said that this movie was cut so many times that there are few copies of the original 1972 version of the theater out there. The ending was interesting, showing how the media, from a young age, influences people, could also be a general commentary on the influence of white man / colonialism in Jamaica. Other major themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition ... In closing, the soundtrack is definitely worth it, much less film.
