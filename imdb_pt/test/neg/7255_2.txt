Thirty percent of this movie seems to be the prototype of the Map Channel. You see a gigantic map for about ten minutes, so they release the big stuff while droning (droning, understand?) On the radar. Apparently there are many radar stations in the far north, protecting the borders of North America against attacks by deadly polar bears. Bears never show up, but a giant Mantis does. It was frozen on ice for over a million years, until it was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world (yes, right. For my money, it was liberated by global warming). It is a huge prehistoric insect and needs a lot of food. Since there are no cows in the frozen north, he decides to feast on the most cattle-like creatures he can find up there. I.E., human beings. It begins to attack the radar stations, probably because the hum of the radar antennas was getting on their nerves. <br /> <br /> Join Colonel Joe Parkman, the film's sarcastic face. He is investigating a plane that has crashed and is confused because there are no bodies in the wreckage. The only thing he finds is one of Mantis' claws. Apparently he decided to cut his nails while he was eating the crew of the plane. Parkman takes the claw back with him to be analyzed by a thousand-year-old scientist. <br /> <br /> The scientist grandpa can not make a face or crown of the claw, mainly because he lost his naps so that his mind is not seen. t working very well. So he calls a presumptuous paleontologist interpreted by the guy who was the P.I. in Perry Mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, fly north because he decided that the claw must have come from a Praying Mantis. Only one the size of a passenger train. <br /> <br /> It's Luke's warmhearted at first glance when Col. Parkman first looks at the male photographer. The base men, obviously having been deprived for many years, think it's the hottest thing since Grandma Clampett. A smug science-fiction guy and a smarmy soldier face begin to work together to track down the path of the Mantis, which devastated some images of an Eskimo village. He arrives at the base for an after-dinner snack and smashes some cheap outfits fairly efficiently. Then it flies south and disappears. <br /> <br /> Now comes the tense hours when the core of the civilian ground observer is called to sweep the skies in search of anything large flying above. I doubt that in reality they would have been informed that they were looking for a giant flying mantis who eats humans, since this would have caused a panic. Probably they were told to look for a 727 giant that was painted green and buzzing because its engine was out of tune. Parkman climbs on a plane to try to overthrow the Mantis, and spoils the mission. Mantis arrives in New York, probably because he wanted to watch a Broadway show or visit the sex world in Times Square. The army corners him in the Tunnel, and Parkman and his men wear stupid suits borrowed from the Orkin Man to come in and try to blow up the Mantis. Success! Well, almost, since Mantis is still squirming enough to almost kill Eve Arden's male photographer. There is a tepid love scene at the end, and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Ms. Gender Unspecified are busy kissing. So kind of a nauseating ending.
