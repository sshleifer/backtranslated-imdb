There seems to be a movie spectrum. To the left, there are films made primarily for commercial and / or entertainment purposes. In between, there are movies that are fun and artistic. On the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are more focused on film as art than on film as a product. <br /> <br /> I'm not here to say that any part of the spectrum is better than any other. , but when a movie goes too far to one side, it's rarely good. Such is the case of Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what to expect when I saw it announced. Some friends would come and ask if I wanted to go with them. Neither of us knew what to expect and in the end neither of us was pleased. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are breathtaking images. Yes, I'm impressed by how long the filmmakers have been looking for filming. Yes, the soundtrack is pleasant to hear, and probably the best part of the experience. The point is that this goes so far on the right side of the spectrum that I mentioned that I can not say anything good about the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> It's a plague. It is a confusion of symbolism and obvious morality. It is not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way. It's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even figure out what it is saying). <br /> <br /> This film is simply art for the art. An attempt to say "See how we can be profound and thought-provoking using the montage!" When a film becomes smarter or cleverer than its creators than it is about its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self-gratification.
