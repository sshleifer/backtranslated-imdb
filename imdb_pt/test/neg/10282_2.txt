The show is at least partially counterfeit (So it's not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe that at least any faceless person with a foggy face is a fake episode. <br /> <br /> Proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There is already a crew on the boat, before he gets there, can be seen as his boat approaches. <br /> <br /> The actors who play "ambulance officers" did not take off the shirt or expose the shirt. Either way, they work on it, which would never happen in reality. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not drive to the Emergency entrance (which does not make sense unless it's fake and they would not be allowed to go there)
