This is a bit slow for a horror movie, but the quality is better than you would expect for the sole effort of a director on IMDb. The camera work and the lighting were both surprisingly good, and the acting? though variable ?? is better than it is often found in Indie genre films. As protagonist, Robert Field is a bit harsh, which is especially regrettable, since his character, Claude, is the narrator of the film, as well as the center of his action. However, was it Christopher's entry (Brandon deSpain) that I considered the turning point of this movie? and not in a good way. A twist is introduced awkwardly, and slowness is prolonged and excessively prolix. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Pete Barker is consistently fun like Father William. It is the easy highlight in what is a fairly common offer. While the first half hour caught my interest, I ended up feeling rather disappointed at the way things unfolded.
