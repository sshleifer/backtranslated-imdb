The central issues at stake (God & Satan / Good & Evil) can be and should be tremendously convincing (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art / music / literature / film). End of Days, unfortunately, is nothing more than a 2D Drawing. Byrne's acting ability is so clearly at odds with Arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The only compelling scene occurs at the beginning with the transformation of Gabriel Byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? friend? It is erotically charged and repellent - modernizing vampiric themes, the seductive power of evil.
