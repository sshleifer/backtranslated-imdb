I saw the preview on Femalien and thought it might be a cool movie. It turns out it's horrible crap. There is not much nudity in the movie, not to mention not having too much sex either. There were just a few stupid and tacky dialogues along with some uninteresting dances that you normally expect to see during the audition. In our case, you can even see in the real movies. Conclusion: I have nothing for that. Just leave it alone.
