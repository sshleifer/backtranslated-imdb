I thrive on the movies ... but there is a limit. One name is not enough to make a movie! The beginning of the movie leaves us wanting to wait for what is not seen yet. But we are still hungry (or angry ..) to the end. Things are getting so confusing that I admit I DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE END, or that there was an end to this nonsense. The opportunity to make a great movie was there, but the target was totally forgotten. Next...
