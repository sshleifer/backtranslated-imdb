This may have been an excellent film. However, like many other people think me too. It is poorly done due to language transfer. If the whole movie has to be read, then it kind of takes the movie and turns it into something else. It has an excellent rating as far as I'm concerned and I could not wait to rent it. But once I did, it was a real disappointment. Here in Boardman, Ohio, I could not find an English version for something similar. This movie has also been compared to Dark Hours and we will not be able to watch it in Boardman, Ohio. Not Available. So I guess we'll never know how good the movie really was.
