Jerk hazer Mike (David Zelina playing this college man as a big bastard you want to see die right away) and his college mates let the hypoglycemic diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) hang on a wooden cross along with that scarecrow that's a legendary ghost story They get PO on Sam, who essentially goes into shock and punches Mike who lands on his girlfriend Patty (Kristina Sheldon) instead, leaving the poor guy hanging on is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul "emerges" with the inanimate scarecrow that comes from the cross to destroy all who have left the poor boy to rot. Mike and his gang send the uninitiated idiots back to overthrow Sam, but they are the first to get a blade in their throats. Mike and his pack head to the beach to swallow drinks, play volleyball and fight until the scarecrow arrives to finish his little soiree. Sam's surrogate brother, Jack (Matthew Linhardt), must take care of him, but decides to fall asleep with the new love interest Beth (Samantha Aisling). So when he gets a cell phone message from Mike about how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were on the beach sunbathing and sand, Jack is scared. Beth's estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to take care of Sam's condition after they cut off the near-dead young man to take him to the emergency hospital. Returning to the beach to confront Mike because of his negligence (..not to mention Jack's promise to train Ramsey, played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, with respect to no trot), Jack and Beth will face the same killer the others. Coach Ramsey, who was part of a trotting incident in the past that went awry causing a murderous astonishment, faced some demons while informing the group's survivors of what they would face. <br /> <br /> Babes, breasts and blood ... this movie follows the basic guidelines of slasher. However, this film also carries the typical slasher traits of tacky characters, acting, dialogue and general plot. The film shows signs of its low budget, particularly in violence, since most of the actual action takes place off-screen, rather than showing it happening up close, close and personal. What appears on the screen is mainly the aftermath of the killer's revenge: a guy holding his guts, another with a stake (holding the group's volleyball net) dipped in his chest, blood splatters after a woman is hit in the head presumably with a big rock, a puppy lying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the SUV, etc. There are also some dubbing problems where it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not match the movements of their lips ... particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where Ed (Travis Parker), aspiring rock star, is singing to his friends a horrible song with which everyone seems quite impressed.
