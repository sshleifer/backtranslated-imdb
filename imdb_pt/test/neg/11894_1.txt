This must be the most annoying movie I've ever seen. The only good thing I can say is that, fortunately, I did not pay to see. We introduced ourselves for free at school and everyone in the audience sat embarrassed, wondering when the fun would begin. This piece of junk is a very long and filmed movie. The real idea about why the movie took about 10 seconds to be presented. The only ones who might be interested in this movie are those who have lost their jobs and want to know why. They might find some of the interviews interesting. A different edition might have made an interesting documentary about this, but I doubt the interviews shown were not at all. As it is, it's just a tragedy, both to contemplate and to be a part of. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ANY COST!
