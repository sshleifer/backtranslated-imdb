Overall, it was an assistive film. I did not stop or stop to go back to this - a clear sign of a boring movie - so he passed the first test. Best of all is that it came into the story quickly, without telling unnecessary stories to the characters. <br /> <br /> It will never be a great movie. Not like a great B movie. I highly recommend this movie to horror fans who do not care about video releases. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, there is no nudity, just moderate language and gore. There is violence though. The deaths were quite dry and unimaginative, unfortunately. The special effects of the computer were actually very good. The way the 'creature' wielded its chains in some scenes reminded me of the 'Spawn' and 'Ghost Rider' comics. <br /> <br /> A little twist ... It's set in Lousinia, but no one seems to speak with an accent. I had to watch the credits until to realize that it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, there are little nonsense on filming. Lack of time and money would be the main factors for the freaks. For example, in one scene, she moved from mid-afternoon to black in seconds ... for a short car ride. The other example was the stuntman for the 'creature' not having on the 'creature' makeup when he fell off the winch ... it also looks like he's wearing a shirt on the scene. <br /> <br /> In short, I did not hate this movie, but I did not like it either. I'll probably never rent it again, but if a friend owned it, I could watch it again in a few years.
