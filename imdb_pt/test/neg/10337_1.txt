I have to watch crap like that all the time to see if there is any redeemable quality to justify including it in my clients' video libraries. You do not watch it, not even a minute, unless someone has a gun in your head. You go, as I did, moan and groan at least 500 times, and pray that one of the one-dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, turn and kill you. <br /> <br /> Even if you're Sandra Bullock's biggest fan in the world, it's not worth watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears. <br /> <br /> I want to kick the butts of the marketing staff that puts Sandra huge picture on the face of this DVD box and have them thrown in jail for robbing me or something like that. I really wish I had the chance to read a review of this movie before buying it. <br /> <br /> Please call me, and I'll pay $ 10 to remove that movie right away from my inventory before it stinks all over the place! (Kidding - please do not call)
