Well, I saw Wrath of the Ninja. <br /> <br /> It's not something I would recommend to people who are not seriously involved in Japanese fighting movies. This is a kind of Japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot. It is about these 3 former ninja schools that had these 3 "Swords of Sorcery". I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and I did not really follow it all. Had some good tough scenes, but overall, it was not much to my liking.
