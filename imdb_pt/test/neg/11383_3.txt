I started to interest myself a bit in the movie. It seemed like it could be a serious drama, dealing with death, grief and healing, with some realistic human conflict. Unfortunately, he did not resist. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with some consistency and believable characters. Many characters in this film have been portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. Look, I know this should not be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in script and characterization. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, the writing not so much. At one point, the character of James Brolin is reprimanded for appearing on a poorly dressed picnic. He says ordering it will not work. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes, she will tear her clothes up later. This is a howler monkey. This movie had some unintentionally funny lines. <br /> <br /> It was hard to care about Brame de Jame's character. When he promptly gave the things of his first wife to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be snubby, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him? I must confess that I have not finished the film. If you made a 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable that I felt there was no need to finish it.
