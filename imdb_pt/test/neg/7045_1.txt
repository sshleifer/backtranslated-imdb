Can you believe a college professor made this movie ????? <br /> <br /> The same man who made DHOOP <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible and has some of the weird scenes that already existed <br /> <br /> The main message is good but badly presented <br /> <br /> The film looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and bad performances <br /> <br /> Direction and everything is poor <br /> <br /> The song is well <br /> <br /> <br /> Emraan's scrawny trait works and he does well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh bothers when he looks in the mirror
