As far as I remember seeing this movie, it was not good. I always say that if a movie is good and can keep their attention at the toughest times (eg a Tylenol Cold & Sinus war) than a movie that did their job. The fact that I was asleep for most of the movie only proves the fact that I could not keep my attention and therefore did not complete his work. Why did I fall victim to Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a movie in my arsenal? Committed made no sense to begin with. The acting was poor and the general story left more doors open that simply could not be closed. I'm thinking the moment I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. It did not make any sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them, almost separating a perfect lesbian couple. I suppose this is to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as Graham, but to me it was nothing more than fulfillment. I have this suspicious feeling that the director of that movie was sleeping with Affleck. His acting in this film was atrocious. I mean, I never saw him do a "good" performance, but that was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment during the battle coming through my mind and I confirmed with the ... what was John Stewart doing in this movie? This was once again another moment when my eyes opened only for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> And frankly, it's Heather Graham - we could care less about her after a while. She just is not interesting - she's just bland, boring and basically stops acting after a while. While they desperately start playing crazy characters in the mix to revive the movie, it just does not work and instead of just shutting it down - they start playing more characters in the mix so now it's just weird, boring, boring and really, really long Luke Wilson's slow acting style messes up a movie already crawling - why exactly did those two get married? Committed is a truly terrible movie - the kind of "hip comedy" that leaves you reeling depressed and bored. <br /> <br /> Grade: * out of *****
