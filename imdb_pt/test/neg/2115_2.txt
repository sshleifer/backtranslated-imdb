Will Spanner comes across another bizarre affair, this time involving vampires instead of witches, warlocks and demons (he's in the hospital to check on the son of his friend who got hurt ). in a hit and run when they run a girl that was attacked by a vamp in). It brings Lutz's Detectve to help with the case that revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business meltdown to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some absurdity. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film practically gets in the background for nudity and simulated sex scenes. (As might be expected from this series, I think). So I suspect that complaining about the lack of good acting, or convincing plot, or even persuasive characters, would fall on deaf ears. If you're watching this movie, you do not care about these 'frivolities' and just want some 'action'. Unfortunately on that front the film also fails. Every woman is attractive enough, but the way the scenes are filmed is simply appalling. Making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show it all; Ashlie Rhey shows full frontal; Aline Kassman & Mai-Lis Holmes only shows her breasts <br /> <br /> My Note: D
