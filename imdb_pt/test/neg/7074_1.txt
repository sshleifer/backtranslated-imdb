"Tamara" just felt like another teen-oriented knock-off of the trend "I know what you did last summer" and it is painfully dull. A high school pariah, who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel joke by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, promising not to tell anyone. The next day, Tamara, supposedly "dead", arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft" and all another straight-to-video bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely atrocious and seem about ten years older to be considered collegiate. There are some gore, which is not really interesting, since the movie is so annoying and I could not wait for it to end. If you like modern junk than I insist you look for this, otherwise do not bother ...
