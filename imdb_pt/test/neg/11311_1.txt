I left the theater and was only 10 years old. That's how bad it sucked. The plot was horrible and the acting was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself and the person who made this film. I was only 10 when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young and innocent age, did not laugh once in the movie. We (me and my friend) still laughed about how bad the movie was. We ended up going to the movie 'R' where my parents were. Bottom line - this movie was going wrong. Mr. Magoo - More like Mr. Ma-Who? This movie could have marked me for life if I had seen the popular cartoon on television as a child, but fortunately I had never seen it, so I was spared the agony, but I will never get back the precious minutes of my life that I I wasted
