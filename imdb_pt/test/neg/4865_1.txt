I still wonder why I sat for this whole thing. It only had about 3 minutes of real entertainment, the rest was just a total bore. The acting is not so good and the action scenes are sooo cheesy, it's not even funny. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can not think of anything right now. There was probably something that some might like, but the end of it must be the dumbest idea of ​​all. What kind of person would get a small remote control helicopter with a machine gun to assassinate the president? This idea could never have been made in the first place let alone have someone dumb enough to try, I think the writer must have become obsessed with the scene of the toy car in The Dead Pool, but actually tried to make it look serious.
