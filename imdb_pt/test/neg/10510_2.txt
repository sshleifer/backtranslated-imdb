I really do not know where to start here. Just imagine a movie that is so bad in every way, from acting to the props, to the story that makes you angry. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and that's saying a lot because I've seen some bad ones. When I saw this movie, I knew it was a blade, but I thought he had kung fu and vampires, a combination that I thought could not fail. That's until I put this on my DVD player. How Ron Hall managed to mess up something as cool as vampires and martial arts is beyond me. first the performance. I did not expect too much here to start because it's an action movie and a B, but the acting here is so bad I could not help but bother with it. expressions and vocal tones were out of place, there was absolutely no emotion in almost the whole movie and when there was it was so laughable I thought I was watching Mad TV.for example that woman scream that Derek lets loose when he has to kill kao master who never should have been born first. All in all, I've seen better acting in elementary school games. Then there is action. not even sub par compared to the things that have been made in action movies lately. but still the action was not a total disappointment, since Ron seems to have some martial arts skills. but even the skill he has is shadowed by the stupid things he does, for example the part of the movie where he starts spinning and then the camera changes. I almost tore a pillow in half. And the fight scene where your prison friend fights vampires by swinging their arms at them. WOW.OR how about the part of the chain where Derek suddenly knows the magic and can make corners that make tap water running. and as far as the props go. the guns look like Walmart toys, the teeth have been stolen from Halloween costumes, and words can not describe how bad CG graphics are. I could go on for hours about all the wrong things with this movie and trust me, this is just the tip of the iceberg. just get a 2 because it made me laugh. Even though I was laughing at how badly the movie was made, a laugh is a laugh. I'd say avoid the vampire killer, unless you want to laugh at a horrible movie or are planning to be tortured for long periods of time and want to practice
