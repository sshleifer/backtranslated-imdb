'You're in the Navy Now' is painfully bad: most likely the worst movie that Gary Cooper ever made. It's supposedly based on a true story, but the incident that inspired this movie does not seem to have enough plot to sustain a feature film script. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on local television while I was at home. -Sitting for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. There was a furious blizzard outside and I was literally with snow. If I had been able to walk out the door, I would definitely have stopped watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting names in the supporting cast, notably Charles Bronson (with his original name), Lee. Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget. Everyone stinks at this movie. Even the normally trustworthy Millard Mitchell is awful. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are on the screen so briefly, it's no use seeing them. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship that is powered by a new experimental steam. turbine: basically, the whole ship is a giant kettle. Cooper realizes that the task is not prestige: if it were, he would have gone to a better officer. Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply had no comedic ability. He did several bad comedies, and this is the worst. Jane Greer always bored me, and she bored me more than usual here. This ship sank with both hands and sank without trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I'll evaluate 'You're in the Navy Now' a point at 10. Toot! Toot!
