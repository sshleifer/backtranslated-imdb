I had heard of Ali G in Madonna's "Music" music video. I always think he's funny. (In fact, it really is.) Last year I always thought of buying a VCD from "Ali G Indahouse". That's why a few months later, I bought cheap and started to watch it. <br /> <br /> But the film surprised me. My big brother and I were hoping it would be a great comedy of laughter. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of crap. It was really bad. It also contains sexually explicit content and very raw humor. It also did not make me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate this movie. Oh, by the way, I have plans to sell it. <br /> <br /> Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows - in such a negative way. Maybe he was not really focused and serious enough to make this movie. Just because there are some sex scenes does not mean it's hilarious (because sometimes, a lot is no longer laughable). For the first time, I was disappointed with it. It really made me sad and happy. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 1 over 10. In fact, I really want to give it a 0. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I would not recommend anyone who wants to watch good comedies that are not very explicit or horrible.
