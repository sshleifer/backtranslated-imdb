I could not believe how bad this movie was, and believe me, I was not expecting a masterpiece from a movie made out. I recorded it just because I liked Jane Seymour. I've seen her enough to know that she's certainly a talented actress, so I do not know what happened here. The characters were superficial, the dialogue flushed, the acting poor, and yes, that includes Seymour. It was good to see her play against the guy, but not something that bad. I noticed that she had a credit to the executive producer, so she can not escape the guilt for the sheer evil of this movie. And oh, yes, they had Barry Bostwick in the lead role. Nuff said.
