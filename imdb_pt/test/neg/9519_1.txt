What I can say about this movie is one of the worst gay theme films ever to come out of the UK. I can only imagine the likes of Diana Quick and Georgina Hale, I needed the money. What a story there is, it's such a mess that you lose interest quickly. It's supposed to be based on real-life events. Well, all I can say about that is that it's an insult to real-life characters. The DVD is currently in the UK. It's available in split-screen format, which should make even worse the full-screen version I watch. Gay movies can be so much better than that and we deserve more.
