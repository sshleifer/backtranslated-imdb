I mean I went to this movie with my expectations very high. I thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to Bruce Almighty, which was very funny and starring Steve Carell, who is an excellent comedy actor, but boy, it sucked. The film is announced as a sequel, but it really has nothing to do with the original, since the only people reprizing their roles are Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, but Steve's character is completely different, he's no longer the idiot he was at first here he's a cool guy. The story is different and the actors are different and not funny. <br /> <br /> All the actors involved (Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Ed Helms and even Jon Stewart in a very low-quality cameo) have talent, but none of them seems to use it and it seems to exist in the movie just for the money. <br /> <br /> Now, the plot is obviously shaped after the story of Noah, but there are so many things wrong with it. , I do not know where to start. I think the big problem is that all over the world Evan thinks he's crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all over the world, he builds a giant bow in a few weeks, in real life people would not be mocking these guys after that, they'd be saying he's the new Noah. Also the special effects are good, but what the heck is the biggest flood of movies ever filmed on Evan Almighty? Did they really have to waste special effects as good as stuffing for this fucking movie? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey seems to be a smart guy, since he's far from the three worst sequels ever, Son of the Mask, Dumb and Dumbered and now Evan Almighty. <br /> <br /> This was a giant disappointment and Tom Shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
