This movie was not very good in my opinion. Although not a complete waste of an hour and a half (fortunately I did not have to pay $ for it), it just was not too scary. There were parts where I jumped and some minimally violent / bloody scenes, but overall only someone easily scared would consider this movie scary. <br /> <br /> The general writing and acting were very weak. Characters never evolved or grew as people. Even in the end, the front guy, whatever his name, did not get up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute. The plot also had inconsistencies. The dead cop was not murdered the way he died in the game. The October girl mentioned that in order to kill the evil demonic lady, you had to read something from the correct text. Funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape. The boy Malcolm-in-the-Middle died in the game, but did not die "in real life". Also, making the game by itself was very weak. It would be all right for his brother's death, just to get them to play again. But you must play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again ... why do you need the game? If you like movies like The Ring and it's scary and fun, watch this movie. If you know someone like that, you can watch it with laughter, do it. If you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do so. Otherwise, stay away.
