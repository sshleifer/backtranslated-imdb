This is the worst of the toxie series by far. The acting in Tokyo is awful and you can understand them in half the time. The main problem with this movie is all the sudden changes from the original. Like if there was a girlfriend different from toxie on this one or it could be the same character with just a different name and interpreted by a different girl. Why is this movie made like a Disney movie? After about fifteen minutes it starts to look good with blood and everything. There are two incredible murders, so the movie goes straight to the poop. After the movies end 20 minutes, the movie is major entertainment. H * LL is notoriously vigilant. Well, unless you're drunk, do not watch this movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
