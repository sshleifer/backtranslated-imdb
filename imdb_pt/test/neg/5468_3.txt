Here are a couple of paragraphs from an essay I wrote to the university about TBOR. "The Book of Revelation is an erotic thriller about sex, power, and a talented dancer's struggle to regain her sense of self after being sadly raped by three camouflaged women. The three women who rape him have different marks on the bodies, one has a giant birthmark on the buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on his belly and the ring leader has a small circle on it. So he lives his new life in search of those marks, and to find them in those intimate places he does what any sensible man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, he has sex with them An hour and ten minutes in the movie and you feel he almost had a piece of every woman in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> The film is a giant piece of pretentious celluloid, it's like the grandiloquence drips from each In just one point towards the final climax of the movies, Kok Kinos give a scene with the same energy and strength that his debut work, Head On, had in bulk. Just as many films funded by government agencies, the film takes seriously, the script and its execution seem to be chores and then gifts and, unfortunately, to the talented actors, their brilliant performances (particularly Tom Long as the fractured protagonist ) are trapped within the confines of a pompous wan k party.
