What annoys me with so-called "science" programs, like these, is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live "millions" of years ago. In the first place, no one can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the Earth is millions of billions of years old. It is a superficial theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot. <br /> <br /> Secondly, no one can prove that evolution has already happened. All Darwin's Lost Links Are Still MISSING! If you look at all fossils anywhere on Earth, they are complete animals of a certain type, for example: a dog or a cat. No one has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or the example featured in this series, a dinosaur turning into a bird. <br /> <br /> This is absolute bullshit. There is more evidence that Santa Claus exists than any animal turning into another type of animal. <br /> <br /> All the ideas presented in this series are an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and everything in it were created. . <br /> <br /> This series is not science. It is a religious worldview that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you are seeing here is SCIENTIFIC FICTION. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it is a science fiction show, then watch Star Trek or Star Wars.
