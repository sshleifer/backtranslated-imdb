I'm from Texas so I thought I knew big hair, but the female villain in that movie had huge hair. Whenever she was on the screen I could not focus on anything but her hair. Take on the stage presence! There seemed to be a lot of hearing impaired people in this movie as well. There was a traffic cop writing a parking ticket that somehow did not notice the owner plunging toward the car screaming at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a guy in a phone booth who could not hear a huge tractor coming until he was five feet away. All the hitmen in this movie seemed a bit deaf, no one had to approach them. The only "hero" in this movie was so boring and inefficient that it was funny. The bar fight was pretty funny. There is an invaluable scene where the hero and his girlfriend have just had sex and judging by their expressions, it was not good for any of them. It makes me laugh out loud. This movie is on the set of 50 Martial Arts Movie Pack if you want to see many bad movies (with some decent ones).
