Having seen Carlo Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti, I was connected to higher expectations before watching this movie made three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer how I was dissatisfied ... I faced a need for critical opinion, which I usually do not like to give, because there are no documentaries that satisfy all viewers. There are also no documentaries that fully examine a theme. But when I read the comments already written on this title, I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes do not know what to criticize. So to be clear, I'm going to divide this movie into two main parts that differ considerably: the first about Visconti before his director's career and the last about Visconti the director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that the young Luchino has experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. Her effort at horse racing is mentioned as well as her relationship with the mother is very disturbed after the divorce of her parents. We also have a very precise idea of ​​where Luchino was created as a real count of Milan: in abundance, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. For example, the splendid villa of his father in Grazzano and other wonderful villages prove this. There is also an emphasis on Visconti's crucial visit to Paris in the 1930s, where he met eminent people ("leftists") who later had an impact on his style and message in art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist with aristocratic education (a contrast at first sight). <br /> <br /> However, the part about the career of its director, who began with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE shortly before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. His films are not well discussed. Because? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works in LA TERRA TREMA and everything is well. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, films such as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are discussed mainly by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor as Ludwig, I did not like his interviews. In addition, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to engage in such a documentary ... There is no mention of significant works of Visconti as part of the CONVERSATION, there are no interviews with the eminent cast Burt Lancaster. A mention of Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made. There's an interview with Maria Callas that sounds interesting, but that's just a little bit. Franco Zeffirelli, although I like him as a director, mocks everything rather than saying something really precious. For example, he mentions the event as Visconti separated from him after years of service. So I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find a strong point here are interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we can get their own opinion about their work. For example, I highly appreciate the words he says about death about him as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I believe it is better to see Carlo Lizzani's LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) than this doc. Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will have a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious at this and his fury would generally turn people's emotions and points of view into stone ... 4/10
