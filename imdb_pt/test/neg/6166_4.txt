Based on Elmore Leonard's novel of the same name, does Killshot suffer from lack of focus, direction and creativity? all the elements that the original story probably had, and negative evidence forced to severe editions (including the complete extinction of a character) resulting in a film that seems almost nothing like a Leonard story. Many characters fill a very simplistic and straightforward plot (not a typical feature of the author's work) and the focus continually alternates between two hard-to-please killers and a troublesome couple who do not command our sympathy. While the story itself provides precious twists and turns, unfortunately until the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery. Armand "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently rots his latest mission. <br /> <br /> Now, running away from his former employer, he joins forces with misfit incompetent criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to earn some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor. When the charismatic couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are caught up in the thieving gang, they are forced to hide, while the mad murderers do not stop to silence the two witnesses. <br /> <br /> Killshot proves that relying on a novel by Elmore Leonard is no cause for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters, situations and even resolutions in the movie are all tired and unoriginal and just very randomly suggest something else. Was not there not potential, especially when Rourke's quiet, collected, black killer performs a hit during the opening scene? purpose and principles are continually abandoned every minute. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is most intriguing; visually the roles of Bird and even of Wayne are conducted properly, giving immediate interest and depth to people who normally end up in a creative impasse. The combination of the cool and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is a compelling combination (comparisons with Fargo would be too extravagant) except for the fact that each character seems to slowly lose sight of the traits that initially kept them interesting. As Richie begins to pick up the habits of the more experienced killer, Bird looses his grip on his own murder methods. Regardless of what he sees in his momentous and carefree adventure with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine that his final confrontation with Carmen in panic would provoke a confession of her true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects her outcome. Probably or not, this is the unfortunate fall of Killshot ?? and little entertainment can be obtained from those characters who lose their originality continuously, contradicting the habits that once intrigued them. <br /> <br /> - The Massie Twins
