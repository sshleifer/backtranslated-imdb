I recently saw this at the 2007 International Film Festival in Palm Springs and I can not believe this is Sweden's official submission to the 79th Oscars to be considered the best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony last year also made the official Sweden presentation for the best foreign film with Zozo. I was not personally a Zozo fan, but at least it had some production value. This could have been filmed as a high school movie project. As a short film, it may have worked, but as a feature film, it is as lost as the characters. This is a story about friends who live in a small Swedish town and have no goals, hopes or ambitions for the future and enjoy living in the past of their childhood. In fact, Falkenberg is not like a remote village in northern Sweden. It is a popular holiday resort with a population of towns and villages of almost 40,000 inhabitants, situated between two important Swedish cities on the south coast of Gothenburg and Malmo. The characters are pretty friendly guys, but if they were schoolchildren with a dark or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives I undoubtedly care more about them. However, they are past the point where they should be planning to deal with adulthood. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, there must certainly be some jobs in the tourism or fishing industry instead of just cycling, drinking, smoking marijuana and occasionally painting a house. Maybe if they walked around with a girl or two in their circle of friends, of which girls are missing from that movie, which does not make sense. Jesper Ganslandt makes his directorial debut and co-wrote the film along with the director of photography, from which I vaguely use the term, Fredrik Wenzel. the acting is not so bad. I would give this a 4.5 out of 10, but despite its submission to Oscar consideration I would not recommend it.
