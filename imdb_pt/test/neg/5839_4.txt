I am not sloppy in finding "redeeming social value". Whatever book or movie people want to suppress, Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness, I do not know, Deep Throat or the latest hostage beheading, I honestly wish they did not. I am not a lover of pornography or violence as entertainment, but on what I have the chance to see camera angles, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, almost to the exclusion of fear or excitement, sometimes even losing the intention of the filmmakers or actors. Even with images that reasonable people can argue should never have existed, I always imagine there is something to learn. I wonder more about how a movie does than about what it does. Maybe this is wrong with me. It is wiser, but more difficult than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, it may be to see cuts, pans, etc., inseparable from any content. I wonder what horror filmmakers and church architects have in common. Add political filmmakers, fascists and not. All manipulate with light, space, and sound to alter perception and mood. How different are your goals? How different are the goals of those who film actual atrocities for use as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it for almost a year. Curiosity made me buy. I experienced a few minutes of "1" the day he arrived, to the corner of the corner awkwardly affected by the sound that really looks like an attack on the viewers' sensitivity of the film, which was considered inept but effective. I would have to go back to that, of course, but I did not like the prospect. Clearly, this was not the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the raw but traditional horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, the overtly political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant crudeness of Cronenberg's early days. <br /> Perhaps this word "attack" is fundamental. Matsumura does not attack his characters, but his spectators. I can not watch this at this point in history without thinking so much about Abu Garib (some of whom I think I remember being videotaped) as well as the hostage videos, but also about Godard's torturers (at Le Petit Soldat? ) For whom atrocity is just a job, a fraction of a person's day job. And then there's the lingering news from Northern California whose details I barely remember, but I can not completely forget it because it also involves "cinema," a duo of notorious serial killers, if the suggestion is not playing with my memory, for filming torturing the victims. <br /> <br /> All three entries in ANL are revenge films, vigilante exercises, but I am attaching these notes to ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and can be a turning point for director Matsumura. (I did not see the entries that followed ANL3.) Through the first two offers, I imagined a camera falling into the hands of one of those marginal middle school or secondary school children who obsessively draws scenes of war or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura's mad revenge characters had become a writer-director. Anyone watching those who had not seen Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see that.) But ANL3 seems to aspire to the mainstream . The protagonist of Matsumura grows carnivorous plants, allowing for some typically Japanese close-up legal nature shots. There is also, for the first time, a movie by Matsumura, a traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's wife sneaks up and starts caressing him while peering at the motel's customers. Kikou finds himself unhappy between them. He is an intermediary voyeur. The brief emotion comes from the layers of voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic litter of trash, a voyeur of garbage that somehow makes me think of the poem repeated in Wakamatsu's not-all-that-sounds-like Go, Go, Secondtime Virgin. <br /> <br /> I'm getting nowhere with this, and it's ruining my comments in other movies. I can not escape the suspicion that a few years later I will enter a retrospective of Matsumura in my local movie archive, perhaps presented by some learned person who has captured something I am missing. <br /> <br /> How much does it cost? Does not it matter if the director is or simply "catches" his lethal protagonists? Does he need to understand them? Maybe the job of a director is just to vent, then let critics, sociologists, and the rest of us spread the word. Perhaps directional or artistic responsibility is a false notion. <br /> <br /> My last fight with this thing made me wonder what a woman thinks by witnessing these overwhelmingly masculine exercises. We put women over and over again, from Star Wars to et cetera and et cetera and so on, but is it as masculine as All Night Longs?
