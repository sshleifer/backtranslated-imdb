This TVM seems to have polarized opinions among the commentators on this page, so maybe I can sort it all out by saying that this is a very stupid and not very well done television movie. How bad is it? It's a teleplay that can not even decide what its name is because while everyone in America calls LINDA, it's known in England as LUST FOR MURDER and is usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name. And I can also point out that it's not a fake-tongue prank as someone claimed. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest and say that the plot is quite sound. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple named Jeffries with whom they get along. They get along so well that they go on vacation together (Make up your own mind if there's any wife swap going on) and Paul watches his wife kill the Jeffries. After that, the plot gives a turnaround in the crash. Writing the above paragraph, I suddenly realized the great amount of potential that history had and will not say anything to push it away from the premise. It's just that when the story continues after the events I've described, things become increasingly unlikely and bizarre. Not only that, but production figures are rather unimpressive with the actor playing Paul Cowley making a very wooden voice over what annoys while most of the scenes - Exterior and Interior - looks like they were filmed on a cloudy day
