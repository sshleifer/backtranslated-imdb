This movie is totally unbelievable. The only way for a girl to perform this act on a dog is if she had serious mental health problems or if she had a long history of sexual abuse or if she was under duress. However, we are asked to believe that a healthy "normal" woman could get a little bored and "made a small mistake" and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. What's more, it has never had any negative effect on her except when she tells someone. <br /> <br /> She was not raped by a dog or the dog did something she could not resist - she actively started oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her own choosing. She was not drugged or anything she just 'felt like'. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie seeks to put this action in a light of 'hey this could happen to anyone who is just being honest' But really for this to be believed, we have to believe that this is a woman who is capable of doing absolutely anything, if she 'just feels that way'. Think about it - could she have considered the mistakes and correctness of this action before realizing it? If she had, she would have stopped in her tracks. Humans have instinctive limits for reasons. If we are now beginning to consider bestiality as a "cute" freak, what's next? Child abuse? However, the "heroine" is portrayed as something difficult, good girl who had a moment of freak. If she had been forced to perform this act by an abuser - the story could have made more sense and I would have been able to accept the plot. But there is no way for one to carry out the required prolonged activity and mention it once - if there is no deep disturbance requiring a great deal of psychiatric help. This IS NOT A SINGLE ONE to happen in an otherwise perfect life. <br /> <br /> I know this is just a movie but it is through normalizing behavior like this through the media that the society becomes desensitized and increasingly terrible realities become possible. <br /> <br /> I could imagine an abuser showing this to a child to persuade them that it is not such a big problem and then move on with their schedule. It can also be used by an abuser to underline that a child does not tell about abuse - because they look at how people will react to you if you do. <br /> <br /> It's not really about. The director wants people to think it's true. It is the degradation and ease with which people (the viewing public) can be manipulated to accept the most shocking concepts if they are filled in the right way. The audience you watch is being manipulated, degraded and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which actors and spectators are being humiliated and ridiculed in a very sophisticated way by an intelligent film, but extremely disturbed. writer. <br /> <br /> This film seems to me used as a vehicle for the creator of the movie to get out of the thrill of playing with your mind in an abusive way. I do not know if you're aware of them - but it's the most classic example of Mind Fuck I've ever encountered. <br /> <br /> I hope this does not offend anyone too much. But if you watched this movie - I do not think there's more room to be offended by anything else.
