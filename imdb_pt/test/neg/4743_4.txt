When I saw Alien Vs. Predator a few years ago, I have to say that, stupid though it was, it was still something nice. Now, unfortunately, there is a dearth of good movies in the movies lately, so my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and see what AVPR was: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem. So we saw this a few nights ago and I have to say that there was absolutely nothing exciting about this horror sequel. It was a completely different change from the first AVP movie, it's not a bad idea that they caught Alien and Predator and put them in the upper-class suburbs, but from the idea of ​​the first explaining their reasons for existing, this was just a sequel to average and predictable horror. Not to mention a story that continues to introduce new characters into every scene where I was not sure who to keep in mind who the main character was and why, so I could not keep up with the story. <br /> <br /> From what I've learned, of course the Predator and the Alien are in space having to deal with the typical neighbors, they're just beating each other's lights and they decide why not? Go ahead and take out some Terrans. So they fall and Alien is taking over the utopia of the suburbs. But teenagers, including a troubled couple who looks like Ken and Barbie, a female marines and her daughter, among others, are sure to kick in a little space, that is, if the predator does not get there first. Because he's angry at the Alien, I think to start the party without him, lol, just kidding, actually for killing some of his friends. <br /> <br /> AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie of all standards, it's still pretty cool with lots of visual effects and the fight sequences between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch. Like the first sequel to Alien Vs. Predator, the cast is what spoils the movie and it looks like they were not well developed, I know it's horror, but the original Alien and Predator movies had characters that you cared about and wanted to win. But it was a semi-decent sequence that I would say it's worth a look, especially for the sake of Ken and Barbie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
