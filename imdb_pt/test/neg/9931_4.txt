I read the 28 most recent comments from several people about this movie and I was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown in bed with the "eyelids missing" as the camera moves up and away from his face , blink! Yes, blink! I recorded how it happened on HBO last weekend and when I saw it I literally had to repeat it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure I was not seeing things! Of course, after that, it was difficult to take the film seriously, although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give a 4 mainly due to the fact that the 1st victim flashes in one of the last frames as the camera moves away from the body / face. What a pity.
