There was no 0 in the voting option, so I was forced to use the next available figure. <br /> <br /> It's a sad day for Bollywood, when that kind of movie that has star cast actors is nothing but a bunch of juvenile actors and a horrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is far from being called the clone of Hitch. Salman Khan with his usual theme of taking off his shirt and Govinda with his funny laughs. If anyone had said two decades ago that I would be writing a comment about Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I would have written for him / her.
