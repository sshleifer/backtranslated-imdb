As the father of two girls (14 and 11), I have serious doubts about this program and all programs that target the previous ones. Firstly, I am always surprised that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanna, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. always make most of the houses look small and tight. Most people work hard all day to pay for rooms less than half the size, but in these presentations no one goes or leaves work, paying bills for services, renting, mortgaging or insurance, cleaning, sweeping, changing lamps, tidying up toilets , etc. Just in and out (and down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on TV sets) making jokes (mostly involving lying and hilarious results) and avoiding work. I think children watching these will have unrealistic expectations about how difficult they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Secondly, there is never an intact family, always a mother or a father, but never both, who are always dating without sex, but never seem to have any of the disadvantages of divorce (alimony, support, arguments). Again, children may get the impression that if the parent divorces, there will be fun fun (in fact, the mother or father are usually not around if that helps the plot). Needless to say, there is no mention of spirituality (forget specific religion). Finally, there is a theme that bothers me. There are "nerds" who are good at school, good "jocks" in sports, "goody two shoes" as well. The protagonists are not good at school, sports or charity, but they make jokes about those who are. The message is: do not be good at anything, just be one of the "nothingness" that jumbled into jokes. Needless to say, I give all of these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and I'm just banning them at my house.
