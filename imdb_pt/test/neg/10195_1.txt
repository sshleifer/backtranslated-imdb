How horrible is that? Let me tell you the ways: 1) It's a bait-and-switch movie that starts being about a UFO investigation, so it turns into a high-pressure sales job for Christianity. Come on! If the creators of this film felt so strongly about their message, why disguise it? This bothers the unbelievers and pushes the fence observers in the opposite direction. 2) It's not even a good sales pitch! If the characters in this movie asked me to go to church with them, I would run like hell in the opposite direction. They are scary! 3) The acting is terrible. Everyone behaves as if they were in an educational etiquette film in the workplace. 4) Cinematography is bad in home movies. Wait, it's not even really that good. 5) Script bad, bad, bad. All dialogue, without action. Like a tennis match, they jump back and forth between the "talking head" closes. 6) Direction ... which direction? Oh, there must have been a director somewhere. I challenge you to find out where. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have some positive comments about this movie. The edition looked professional, but it could not make any difference. A good edition of bad material is still a bad movie. The opening theme song was actually very good! Very scary and UFO-ish. Too bad the movie was not about UFOs. <br /> <br /> If you can not tell, here's the bottom line. I lost my money watching this movie, and it made me angry. If they had not disguised themselves as to what this movie really was, I could say it was my fault.
