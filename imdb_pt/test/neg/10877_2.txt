Quentin Tarantino once said that to succeed in the film industry, you had to create your own Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. Writer / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken this advice literally too much with Hell Ride and has invented a confusing tribute that lends much more in his visuals, music, camera work and time-altering narrative. But to properly imitate a Tarantino movie, you need to have a way of building creative conversations; unfortunately the main element of derailment of the Hell Ride are its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that only work to anger and confuse the public while simultaneously invoking pity for the actors just for being involved. The motorcycle gang protagonists anti-hero, The Victors, consists of several weathered vigilantes who bring their own brand of bloodthirsty justice to the roads without law. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is determined to avenge itself and put out fires. Gent (Michael Madsen) just tries to balance his chaotic psychotic symphony of life by putting the lead on anyone who crosses his boss, and the Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with ferocious loyalty and a mysterious past. In the villain's head, Deuce (David Carradine) is the mentor who orchestrates by far but not enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and lascivious explanations for his tattoos while carrying a harpoon and a general contempt for life. Although these characters seem interesting on paper, once they are forced to discourse horrendously poorly designed dialogues, all traces of cool disappear faster than the funding should for the next Bishop movie. <br /> <br /> While Hell Ride is full of flawed imperfections and missed opportunities, the main facet of its ruin lies in badly planned conversations. And because Bishop's main influences are Tarantino's films, there are many of them. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost unintelligible and would probably leave the same meaning silenced. By the time Pistolero's main grip is introduced and certain phrases are used in excess to the point of nausea, you pray for both death and the ability to turn off the sound. Even Dennis Hopper finds it difficult to remain cool while citing this silly dialogue. <br /> <br /> Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so often that it does not sound right or make more sense? Bishop starts there and then keeps the madness until you envy the characters on the screen by cutting their heads. And when the dialogue finally pauses, we are treated with shots interspersed with women's oil nudity and throats being cut. I'm not sure what effect Bishop was hoping to achieve, but I doubt he found it. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride wants to pay homage to Quentin Tarantino's films, Robert Rodriguez's films, and all the films that idolize violent and violent films. Devil-can-care attitudes of motorcyclists. But while his intentions may be noble, the horrendously convoluted dialogue and the hyper-stylized editing of the timeline prevent the public from getting involved with the generic characters of the tough. By the time we discover the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may take a while for you to realize that there is a mystery to be solved), it is very difficult to care anymore. And while everyone on the screen is clearly enjoying themselves, they have neglected to completely translate any of this entertainment into the public. <br /> <br /> Joel Massie
