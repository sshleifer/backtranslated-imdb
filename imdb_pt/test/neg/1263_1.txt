I wanted to like this movie, but there is very little to like it. It starts with Jean Stapleton and a song by Randy Newman in Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I think), reminiscent of Norman Lear's Cold Turkey, which was one of the best movies ever made, according to people in IMDb. So far, so good. And the idea of ​​the archangel Michael living in Pansy Milbank's motel on Earth? Well, take a chance, it's supposed to be a comedy. Okay, so far so good. But Michael does things that an angel that never fell will never do, and that ends up with whatever credibility the movie may have. The other characters in the movie also have little appeal. Michael brings a dog back to life and we should marvel at it. People make up cheesy country music. In the end, Stapleton dances with Travolta. Great deal. If she was smart, she would not even be in that movie. When it was over, I thought, "Wow, what a stupid, insipid, boring, mushy, sacrilegious movie!" It is not suitable to be seen by children or anyone else.
