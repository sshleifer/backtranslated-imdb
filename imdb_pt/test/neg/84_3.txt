Seeing the title of this movie "Stupid Teenagers Must Die" made me believe this was some kind of parody. I later discovered in the original title was "Blood and Guts". Both titles are misleading, however. This is not a spoof, nor a serious splatter movie. This is something intermediate, failing in both areas. A group of teenagers are attending a spiritist session in a scary house and then the murder begins. Sounds more familiar, does not it? Well, this movie adds nothing to the endless stream of similar movies. And it's badly done. Because of the lack of light, the whole film is grainy. Now this effect can be highly effective, but it is not in that case. The young cast is not acting so bad, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In numerous scenes, the actors are clearly waiting for directions, but these are given too late. It could also be an editor's mistake, of course. The characters are not realistic and the plot just stinks. The sound is terrible at times: the conversations are indecipherable, but when you speak loudly or shout the actors are really very loud. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still bad 1. For me a 3 out of 10.
