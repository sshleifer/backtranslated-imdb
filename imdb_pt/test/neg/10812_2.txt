Grab your video camera, erase all the lights from your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you'll get the basic idea of ​​how this movie looks like. It's very annoying watching this kind of movie. To be fair, there are daylight scenes at the beginning and end of the movie. I like horror movies and creature features, but this did not do anything for me. I'm sorry. I really tried to like it. There did not seem to be much plot, other than finding a way out. I did not learn much about any of the characters, so it did not matter if we lost one or two along the way. This is not the worst movie in the world. "Open Water" holds that title for now.
