I took this thing off the science fiction shelf because I remembered seeing the first one in the series when I was a kid. I rented the second and it was a decent "B" sci-fi. This was out of the way, unpleasant. The "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4-year-old cousin could have done. The two female assistant cyborgs were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they appeared on the screen. The plot left much to be desired that made me sick. I do not know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure they would have done better in two movies. The films in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. I just hope that no terrorist group has access to this movie, as it is an excellent torture device.
