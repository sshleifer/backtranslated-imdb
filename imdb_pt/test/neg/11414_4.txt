I am very surprised to see all these positive comments for this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not that I do not like this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Although I might as well take advantage of a Hollywood action blockbuster like Die Hard 4.0, I like the 'dogma' type of movies, or 'real-life-is-is' movies alike, if they are well made. <br /> <br /> A good example is Festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Is Nine Lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx, and extravagant locations? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is excited about acting performances. I'm terribly sorry, but you can act as you wish, but if history and dialogue are not credible, acting is left behind immediately. And that's exactly the case with Nine Lives. <br /> <br /> Not once did I have the feeling while watching 'Nine Lives' that I was watching real people having a real conversation. I had the feeling that I was watching actors trying to get through 'real characters' while they were saying things that a 'real person' would never say under the circumstances. <br /> <br /> You can hardly call this SPOILER. , but there are some excerpts from the dialog below. If you think reading ten lines of dialogue (ridiculous) will ruin your movie experience, STOP READING HERE. If you want a good laugh, keep reading. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Do you want examples? Many of those in 'Nine Lives'. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: Imagine this. Couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion. The woman sees this castle from a house and tells her husband: Woman: I could get used to it (ie, the expensive house). Man: no. Woman: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of it - we are who we are. <br /> <br /> Does she like the sound of it? Her man is acting like an idiot, but she likes the sound of it. Then an elderly couple passes by hand in hand. This is what the woman invents: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived long. Shared everything. I love you. <br /> <br /> Are they like children after school? And then the most used clich√© lines you've ever heard? Ending with 'I love you'? Does she say that while her man is being an idiot to her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NO. If anything, this kind of dialogue made me want to strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying those horrible horrible things. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 2: Elderly mother, father, and youngest daughter at a funeral. Dad: I did not know Andrew was religious. Mom: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's by force. Mom: Life is fleeting. Daddy and Daughter STAND OUT RI. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-liner makes me laugh anytime, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> How about the camera work? Do not go there. 'Boring' would be a compliment. It should look "realistic"; instead, you lose half of the actors' facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in that movie), while half the time the camera is facing the back or sides of someone instead of the face. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Well, do not say I did not warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to stay with your date or something during the movie because you do not even care if the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> Overrated and more boring than watching grass grow half that sums it all up.
