I watched part of the first part of this movie and small pieces from other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I do not think this movie really worth watching. Strange characters and events catch your eye and are quite interesting, but there are also some bad things and some rude things. The magical and mythical side of it discouraged me, and for most Christians this movie would not be very appropriate or worth watching.
