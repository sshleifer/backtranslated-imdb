Jason Lee does well to give this canine film a passing promise, but it is not enough to distinguish him from any other soft-hearted comedy. <br /> <br /> This live-action adventure, enhanced by CG, sees a police dog embarrassed (Jason Lee) transformed into a super-dog through an accident in the laboratory of the intriguing scientist Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog thinks about saving the city while trying to keep his identity a secret - a challenge since he can talk and fly. <br /> <br /> The strange gag gives a smile, but Underdog's human partners (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as dull as the predictable plot. One for very young kids to have seen Superman. Or the Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog?
