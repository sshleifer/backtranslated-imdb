Eh. This is a popcorn movie, that's all. I watched this with a lot of friends (and though that's not the best way to see a horror movie ...) and most of the dialogue and action was laughable. <br /> <br /> This made me anxious for a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It continues to blink back to 'explain' scenes, which dispels any discernible tension. <br /> <br /> And the relationship of the character 'twist'? Yeah, they suck. I will not say what they are, but they just do not add anything to the movie / storyline. <br /> <br /> (By relationship, I mean the two main characters.) <br /> <br/> Eek My recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can not think of something better. Mediocre at best ... Maybe not even that.
