This movie is horrible, I'm sorry. I bought this to get Star Worms, and I really hoped it would be better after how disappointed I was at Star Worms. Oh, I'm just joking, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is rubbish, not that there really is any, and the main character is a big stupid box that is attacked by things, things or something. I can not really say. The special effects are so bad that you can not even see the dinosaurs at war, which by the way do not war, but only get up and move their mouths, or whatever those things are. The movie is a headache. It is very obvious that the director is trying to establish a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Actually, this movie is simply disgusting, even by Troma standards. The only good thing I can say is that it has an introduction to Lloyd Kaufman while he cheats us once more to watch something that is not suitable for consumption.
