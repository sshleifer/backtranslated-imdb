this movie is sooooo bad that forced me to create a IMDb account just to alert others about it. <br /> <br /> I've been using IMDb for a long time, and many movies came close to making me want to register to praise or harass them, but none of them was worthy. So far! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Matt Dillon. all I could do to myself over this movie is "how Dillon chose this script"? really. I mean, there are holes bigger than the Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I mean it's a modern-day assault movie, not a set in the seventies. By crying aloud, even a child knows that armored trucks have GPS tracking and type. makes you wonder what it takes to get a screenplay produced in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could go on for years, but I will not. Believe me when I say that. Save your time and take a jump. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie sucks.
