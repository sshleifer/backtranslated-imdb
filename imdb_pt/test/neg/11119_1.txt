I found this movie a big disappointment, especially considering the cast. The characters are not credible, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they meet. The only part of the movie that I liked was when the most annoying characters were finally killed. Special effects consist mainly of scenes of dead or dying bloody bodies. A typical unimaginative horror movie. It is hard to believe, to make it impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that infiltrates goats in the middle of the night can be captured by a group of clumsy and loud idiots. . Equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly who was to find it, despite the fact that the creature had avoided capturing or even photographing. <br /> <br /> The man who takes the impossible to capture the Chupacabra is alive our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr. Pena is more obsessed with than the creature is his darts weapon. A dart weapon that functions as a mere bullet has failed. <br /> <br /> The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is presented as a "war veteran." He employs his military prowess by having his men shoot the creature, regardless of whether they are on the ship. Navy Seals that appear out of nowhere repeat the pattern of tossing at all. <br /> Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator brought aboard the cruise ship to catch a thief. He spends most of the film marking along with whoever is trying to kill the creature at the moment. <br /> <br /> The creature does not even look like a Chupacabra. It also does not behave like one. Instead of a small, shy, secret animal that sneaks into the night, we get a bullet-proof Freddy Kruger, killing everything in sight. A simple Google search would have been very helpful to editors and the special effects team.
