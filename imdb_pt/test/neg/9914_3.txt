If you thought the day after tomorrow was implausible, wait until you see it. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the premise of most disaster movies is usually an event of one billion occurrences, combined with other circumstances. In this case, the pair is the union of two huge storm systems. Fair enough so far. Ah, but wait, no, the "event" is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid. <br /> <br /> Next, we will launch a lot of elements of human interest - in this case, a traitor husband, an armed psycho. wielding a boyfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, a senator trying to push an agenda, a reporter trying to stand up against "the man," and a pregnant woman stuck in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a handful of proof events to add excitement. If the director tried to fit into other meaningless lines, there would be no time for the actual disaster, which, given the deplorable state of computer graphics, was almost certainly the intention. <br /> <br /> Eita, if you can not even model a truck convincingly, you really should not be picking up twisters, blowing up power stations, Las Vegas being destroyed, or destroying gas stations. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet understood how horrible this movie is, let me add that three bandits are killed in separate and utterly inelegant, implausible ways that hurt the morality of good cinema. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with film students the first month writing tired, banal, scripts soaked in clich√©, but for God's sake that does not mean that someone has to turn them into movies! <br /> <br /> Can make the incredibly implausible 10.0 Apocalypse does not seem so terrible. Avoid both.
