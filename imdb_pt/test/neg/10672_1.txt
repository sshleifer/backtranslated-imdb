Ego It seems that's the only reason this movie was made. This movie is so wrong in so many ways that it falls short of the dignity of someone writing a lot about it. Each character was only good at self praise and major actors (I use this term liberally as the director) emits the resemblance of stone. the small story, if this, fails on the basics such as logic, feeling and drama. Direction leaves much to be desired. glaring flaws are everywhere (the characters' motives are not defined, prospective husbands are found overnight, windows of broken cars are fixed among other things) Let's be honest, Himesh can not Act. nor, it seems, can Hansika Motwani. In her defense, she is still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tons of makeup. Raj Babbar Overacts and makes your small presence as fake as possible. Darshan Jariwala laughs a little too much. The actor who plays Himesh's friend is the only natural. <br /> <br /> Some questions come to mind: How can a movie like this cost Rs.500 million? Where did the money go ??? It was ensured that a chase sequence was moderately well filmed and Mallika Sherawat received an obscene $ 15,000,000 for her 15-minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the movie confuses the mind. (including 3 Mumbai auto rickshaws that pop up and jump in a police car) <br /> <br /> Good: Himesh shows courage by allowing the movie to mock his trademark "topi" nasal voice. Let's give the devil his due: Himesh, as usual gives good music. <br /> <br /> The bad: Direction, History, the singing of Himesh is still hard to ignore <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Dialogs and everything else !!! <br /> <br /> Final Word: Painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved "Yaadein" by Subhash Ghai
