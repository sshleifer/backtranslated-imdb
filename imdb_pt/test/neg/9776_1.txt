*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Some Afrikkaner-Hillbilly types are in the wilderness looking for Diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. Spoilers: The idiot starts hitting the hill with a pickaxe and opens it. Then he looks at the hole and pokes his head inside and SURPRISE! something eats it. The other two idiots are not seen alive again. Scott Bairstow looks like a pizza delivery man, but he plays some sort of medical scientist (which means he must be about 35 at least). Bairstow must join Camp C and help them find diamonds. The truck that catches Bairstow to take him to Camp C has a handful of the kind of weirdos who normally populate movies like "PITCH BLACK", "THE THING" etc. The truck goes through the first truck and they decide to investigate (how did that truck not see the other truck when they were driving to get Bairstow, since they were traveling on the same road ??). Then they find the bodies eaten, and there are some decent special effects related to bones with small pieces of meat in them. The group's main lunatic, Karl, decides they must find the killer. Thus, the truck drives through the desert following some trails, and eventually has a short circuit and the crew is trapped in the desert. The stupidest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones wearing his jacket to carry them. When he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs and sticks his arm in the goo and that mannequin also loses his arm. It sounds exciting so far except that a few minutes later Dr. Bairstow realizes that the creature is actually hundreds of thousands of ants that are using the bones to unite to be able to travel to a new hive (because the miners have opened) the hive old). Now, the last time I checked, the ants could move on their own, without having to kill people to use the bones in the structure. If all they needed was something difficult, they could have put together a bunch of sticks and used it to create a form. The whole story is very, very stupid, and the explanation of the ants is the only one given. The rest of the film is about the group being killed until they find the new anthill, and kill the brain, and the hundreds of thousands of ants go away by themselves. foot. There is a spare ant-brain found (off the camera) and sent back for analysis, thus creating a reason for a sequel.
