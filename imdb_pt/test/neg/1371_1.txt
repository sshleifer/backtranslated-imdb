I'm sorry, but this guy is not funny. I swear I've heard that 4-year-olds come with better jokes than some of them. "Dee dee dee," for example, is possibly the worst sentence I've ever heard. He does not have any creativity, and being mocking people with mental problems when you reach the level of having your own show is incredibly stupid on the part of Mencia. <br /> <br /> Although each one compares this idiot to Chappelle, yours is not a contest. First, they had very different shows. I think all in all Menica shows on average had only about 2 short 5 minutes in between their 10 minutes on God knows what. Chappelles show came out more like sketch comedy, with 2-4 sketches that occupied the whole show. All Chappelle did was a brief summary of each piece before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think about having a program that consists of the same comedy he talks about his stand-up specialties would be a beneficial idea? Does anyone really want to hear a little George Lopez was a pioneer years before Mencia, but only dragged beyond belief to the point where he is dead? The chance of the snowflake in Hell. <br /> <br /> My point is that although most people hate this guy for his rascism, I just can not stand him for his incompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority that they could call "controversial" and then let it follow the path of Chappelles. The problem is that this guy makes it clear that he does not want to be Chappelle. So, instead, he drives his fucking show like a blazing train to the ground. Someone wants to watch a weekly standup about the same things every Thursday, I know for sure not. <br /> <br /> I can not express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiot's show is ready. Personally, after watching your standup, I do not know how he got his own show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc ... Actually, anyone is better than this idiot.
