In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one that deals with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. The point should be revealing the truth. This means, in particular, having subject matter experts and representatives from all sides. This movie is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of "street men" exposing the issue of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed theme of the film, does not receive any serious treatment. For most interviews, the interviewer simply hopes to be approached and asks general questions like "what do you think of the wall?" - she does not approach random people near the wall and asks how they were directly affected by her. Outside of a respondent, the Israeli general in charge of building the wall, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the context of the wall (eg how and when the project started, whether it was successful, what groups are for and what against the project, etc.). Outside the interviews, a very large portion of the film consists of prolonged shots of uneventful scenes such as wall shots, wall building, and people getting off a bus. These photos take a long time, in my opinion. It's good to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of front wall footage (and only the wall) are excessive. Clearly, these scenes (accompanied by Arabic music conveying a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of aversion to the wall.
