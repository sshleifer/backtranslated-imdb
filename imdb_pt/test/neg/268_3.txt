Watching this movie brings several words to mind: "sophomoric," "ridiculous," "unlikely," "self-indulgent," and finally (and fatally) "boring." Misdirected, poorly photographed and misinterpreted, the film is a messy mess with plots (if you can call them that) by straying in all directions. Someone may have used finger painting of a five year old as a model. As punishment for this child crime of a movie, this cast of "stars" should be beaten and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . All in all, it looks like George needed an excuse to get together with his little friends for a paid summer vacation and we're the suckers paying for it. Bad George! Bad!
