Oh God. Why does Nickelodeon have such a hard time producing an even decent movie? I mean, this movie might have been good, but it was: Very short B. Slightly superficial, stereotyped and insulting to some C. Lately useless. First of all, the thing of "dressing the nerd to look cool" was VERY consumerist, VERY superficial, VERY useless, and very insulting. There are stereotyped nerds - idiot faces, glasses, never kissed, vacation with his mother, etc. Well, maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because he's gay! Does that mean that all gays are nerds? And what is wrong with being your mother's friend? <br /> <br /> The worst part, by far, was the end. The whole drama of the movie revolved around Zoey finding out that Chase loved her, and blah, blah, blah, and then when Chase finally decided to tell her, A. He did not tell her in person , because when he was about to typical distraction came along B. tried to send a text message to her, but his PDA dropped into a source and died before she received the message. The end. <br /> <br /> HOW THE LAME ????? I mean, why can not cartoonists simply change anything on the show? Many of us would love to see these two together. Why can not we see? I mean, are the producers really so uncreative that they can not think of new problems to keep up with the changes in the series? So they have to stick to the same plot and outlines, and make as many episodes as they can just use them? After a while, it gets monotonous and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I WANTED TO SEE SOME REAL ROMANCE HERE, DARN IT! <br /> <br /> Okay. I finished with my speech
