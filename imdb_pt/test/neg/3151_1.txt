Barney and Friends is probably the worst kids show I've ever seen. It does not teach children anything, the songs are cheesy, they are not educational and the characters are simply agitated. I am not to disagree with those who hate the show. Honestly, I've seen more negative reviews than positive for this program. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are really mature people. This program does not contain any educational value or educational material appropriate for the age. More reasons why I do not like this show is because of the bad plots, cheesy dialogues, horrible special effects and the abysmal story lines. In addition, it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and what strangers are your friends. To say this is a "model of what preschool television should be," as expressed by Yale researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer, is a bunch of crap. They do not know what they're talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason some children continue to cry or get addicted to junk is because of this show poisoning the minds of children everywhere. For people (parents / kids) looking for real pre-school stuff, switch to Nick Jr. and watch "Super Why!" rather than. It's so much better than this shit and Five TV had the guts to put it in "milkshake", but luckily he took it. I recommend everyone to stay away from this show as much as possible. Parents, I recommend that you keep your children as far away from this program as possible. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Do not worry wasting your valuable time with this stupid show. It's Total Waste. -10000000000000/10. Grade: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
