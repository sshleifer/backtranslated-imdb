A gentle NY lawyer (George Segal) is going crazy. He promised his father on his deathbed that he would NEVER send his senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later, he takes care of a dangerous and senile psychopath. He meets a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and they fall in love. But her mother continues to frighten her. Segal is ready to kill her ... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... Is this a comedy? I have nothing against black and sick humor, but come on ... there have to be some limits! This movie does everything to play every bad joke you can imagine and rub your face in it. Too bad none of the jokes are funny. The jokes involve rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile elders, profanity and racism. Basically, this is a movie that thinks it's smart trying to shock people and thinking they're going to laugh about it. I was angry and did not laugh once. The film is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The cast is the only thing that kept me watching. Segal and Gordon were wonderful in their roles - especially Gordon. And Van Devere is very good too. But the script is against them. The only interesting (not funny) thing was a useless court scene with Rob Reiner Jr. (and trying to identify his then wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie could have been worse- - The original ending made Segal lie down with his mother and pretend to be Daddy! That was (fortunately) changed. <br /> <br /> A bad and sick movie. Bottom of barrel. I give a 1.
