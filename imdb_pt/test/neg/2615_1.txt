AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN THE IRON STOPS? That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked. This movie almost took me all my life and I went through some really bad movies. Coming from a true Puppet Master fan, I'd expect to hear myself say that, but it's true. The plot is empty, the special effects are horrible, the soundtrack is the most benawl, infernal tootling I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot about the acting, it was so bad I forgot I was there, said nuff. The only redeeming factor in the film are the dolls themselves, they are truly the stars and could act out of Guy Rolfe himself (he is the master of the dolls) and although you can see his wires and strings, they carry me through the painful start Retro-Puppet Master finish. To conclude, the PM7 is recommended for true fanatics who are masochists. <br /> <br /> Cheap <br /> <br />
