I have heard that this Japanese film is daringly, creatively interesting, a "new phenomenon" in the Asian scene of filmmaking ... perhaps even something as innovative as "Ringu" by Hideo Nakata or "Oldboy" by Chan-wook Park, especially <br /> <br /> You can imagine my disappointment when, instead, I found the film disjointed narrative and cinematically (though not in a way that a movie aficionado appreciates), clich√©, even funny --- in general, a very poor imitation of the "Pulp Fiction" style. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching after 30 minutes when I gave up on becoming something more than it is.
