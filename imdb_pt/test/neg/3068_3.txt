Acknowledging the photo of the restaurant on the cover of the DVD made me realize that this was a local movie. The word Detroit in the title widened my suspicions and I did some research on things and yes, a local movie. <br /> <br /> So I got it. Someone I knew really knew some of the producers / directors (I can not remember which ones) and said the producers / directors got people to pay to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Bright! What a great idea. Filmmakers earn some capital to make the film, thanks to the cast and crew. Then the investors (cast, team, others) get some of the profits I'm imagining. <br /> <br /> Profits! A way. This movie totally disappointed me. The special effects were special like in special children traveling by small bus to school. The acting was a lot of fun, unintentionally. There's a great line where a guy says "well? This bone will not smoke!" as a pickup line. Unfortunately that's the only fun part of the whole movie. The story? Well, I sort of followed around 3/5 of the way, so everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it suddenly turned out. I mean, like in ... no resolution of anything ... how they ran out of time. "Sorry people, out of time, good evening!" <br /> <br /> We sat, confused and vain, and made another movie. Then, about 20 minutes later, a neighbor of mine appeared ... with one of the guys from the movie! We played it back and he (the actor) gave us a comment, which was amazing because he ripped the movie! <br /> <br /> What more could you ask for ?? <br /> <br /> The most absurd scene for me was a motorcycle chase scene where it was so dark it could literally have been a guy running with a flashlight and not a bike at all. That and the jaw fall on your face, the sudden end is enough to make you howl. In pain! Zombies looked less like zombies than my co-workers. And I do not work in the morgue either. <br /> <br /> So, I recommend watching this if you can get someone from the movie to come and give you a comment about all the things that happened behind the movie. scenes and make sure that this person hates the movie because it only adds to the fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, give this one a pass. Rent something like Feeders if you want a really bad chin in a funny movie ...
