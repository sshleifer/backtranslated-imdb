Island of Death is not really a good movie, by any standard, but it's curious. Imagine if Natural Born Killers had been made 20 years earlier, like a Eurotrash Greek porn movie. This is what you have here - the picturesque story of a young British sociopath couple who cut a deadly band through the population of a beautiful Greek island. <br /> <br /> I'll spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot; this is not really important except to create ever more perverse or violent sex scenes followed by disturbingly brutal murders, often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple. It might have been brilliant, in its own unhealthy and unpleasant way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I found myself impatiently checking the runtime and chapter index to see how long the stop would last. The slow rhythm, the indifference, and the gentle performance transform even the most vile perversities into pablum, and link the scenes to an eternity of monotonous labyrinth. Oh well. You can not win all of them.
