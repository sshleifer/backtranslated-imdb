I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B movie if it has some kind of redeeming value, but Dead Space has nothing to rescue it! This is the kind of movie that will leave you frustrated, restless and sick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Bad acting. Lame story. Terrible effects. Horrible and excruciating dialogue. Dead Space has it all!
