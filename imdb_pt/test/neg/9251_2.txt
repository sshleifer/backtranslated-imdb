This was shown on a premium channel so I did not realize it was made for TV. Even so, I like some of the life movies (Lifestyle here in the UK), but that was awful. The family was so cheesy, "I love you mother" "I love you even more dearly" So after they were broken in the second time, 10 minutes later, they were back, "I love you mother" big cheesy smiles etc. She calls her husband and tells him not to bother coming home. They were only broken in by a guy who wanted them dead, a crazy guy living next door, who needs help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to take care of her. <br /> <br /> However, as a comedy, I would give a good grade 7. I can even show it to my friends next time I have them around. It could be great fun after a bottle of vodka or 10!
