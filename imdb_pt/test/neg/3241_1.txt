No word can describe how horrible this movie is. It's like the director literally took like *** on a roll of film and sent it to the viewing audience. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is horrible, The plot is so dumb, and the deaths of each character is ridiculously bad. Some stupid scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling a weapon out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka through the city, Rajat Bedi being beaten by an ill-animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth, double penetration in Monisha Korella How do they think that was correct?) I would also like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that holds this claim is when Kapal has the bike and somehow wins the glasses. The purchase job seems to have been done with microsoft ink. <br /> <br /> The best parts of this movie are with the Sunny Deol. This man is so strong it makes even God feel scared. In one scene, he literally opens a prison door, kicking it. Chuck Norris's round house does not have any of that! He is so powerful that he can fly from London to India in a matter of 10 minutes! Overall, this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe. If you were to watch, watch it for the joy that follows along (BTW this movie is supposed to be serious)
