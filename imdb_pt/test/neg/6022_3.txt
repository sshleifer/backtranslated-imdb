This movie was an absolute waste of time. It's nothing more than a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are not sympathetic to the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you are looking for something else to do, because the movie is annoying, since you already know what will happen. The other half of the time you're desperately waiting for the protagonist to produce a couple of balls or just end your life jumping off a bridge or something. In addition, the secondary characters are, for the most part, one-dimensional. There's no depth to any of the characters in this movie! No depth!
