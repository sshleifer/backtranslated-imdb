I watched this movie the first time the other day and I was bored to tears. I guess I was just looking for a flashback of the wonderful series that I remembered. I watched The Mod Squad television program religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. It was full of action and the relationship the three had with Greer was captivating. There was none of it here. When Greer was murdered, you had the idea that these 3 could have cared less. The actor who played Pete is a great actor, but they wrote his part as if he were mentally challenged. Pete in the television series was quiet and serious, but also had a funny side. They had this guy acting like he was drugged, drunk or just plain ignorant. I would not recommend this movie. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete disappointment.
