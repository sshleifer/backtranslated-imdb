First of all, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever, Plan 9 From Outer Space, nonetheless. Coleman Francis deserves this title. I present the exhibition B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of a surprisingly careful exploration of crossdressing, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of film are not bad either. also. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film has no problems. Bela Lugosi was totally strange, chanting strange lines. Poor Bella looked like he did not even know what was happening sometimes. The performance was decidedly wooden, although not worse than a movie of the Universal B period. The long sequence of dreams that composes the middle of the film was totally bizarre; more like a deer film vaguely menacing than a sequence of dreams. The Alan / Ann story, the original focus of the film has quality quality. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst director ever. He managed, at least in part of that film, to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried to do it in Night Train To Mundo Fine (vulgo Red Zone Cuba), it ended in chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least watchable without Robot's help.
