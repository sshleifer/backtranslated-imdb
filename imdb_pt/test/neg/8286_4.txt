The next stop on our journey through the calendar-slasher scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All these old men, full of possibilities and ready to venture into the real world and become adults. This is, however, if they can get to graduation without having to get involved with the lunatic on the campus who is running around, ripping the students' lives off with their fencing sword ... Yeah, it all comes from a teaching star middleweight who falls dead from a blood clot during a run and a year later, his older sister returns home from the Navy for graduation. The track coach holds the blame and takes care of his lowered position in the store class while the girl's boyfriend still regrets his death a year later ... All these characters are the main candidates for "Serial Slasher of the Year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who did it. "Graduation Day" is fun, although it's by no means a fascinating title, and there are not many memorable moments, but there's enough to keep you entertained. As Linnea Quigley fucking the music teacher and being spotted with a group of 30-year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course ... Rollerdisk! I have to love this crap! You can do much worse than "Graduation Day", children ...
