I've watched this movie a few times and never really liked it. I'm not a so-called "nude horror" fan, so I can not get fired because of this. I found it a little contemptible, I think the thing that irritates me about Hammers is the aspect of sexploitation, not sex, but Sexploitation. I'm surprised how many people rated this movie so well, so I'll take another look at it. But to me, it was not scary, it had no atmosphere, just a bit of "omigod, look at those bad / stupid London prostitutes and that innocent little Anna about to be raped by another nasty man, ooher!" I suppose, ultimately, for me, the film has no depth at all, just a handful of unpleasant men and women, just for the value of excitement. This was undoubtedly, to a certain extent, what Victorian England was, but the scenarios are even clumsy and dull, conveying a sense of Victorian threat. The horrors of Roger Corman, on the other hand, are now style, atmosphere and stylish horror. To me, this was just scouting and boring junk.
