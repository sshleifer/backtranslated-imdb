When one of my friends recommended this to me, delirious about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the overall grandeur of the film, I obviously expected an incredible movie, at least fun. <br /> <br /> The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that this movie is supposed to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something that anchors it, even if it is only the smallest. This film, on the other hand, felt forced and false. Many of the scenes were unnecessary and watching me made me think the director was trying to be artistic. <br /> <br /> The acting was bad, and the relationships between the characters were not sufficiently developed. Maybe it was just me missing something the others could see, but I had not even realized there was some kind of attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started doing it like rabbits randomly in the middle of the movie. So again, maybe this movie was bad. <br /> <br /> I am not against violence in the movies, but in this, almost everything was unnecessary. Throughout all the fight scenes, I felt shrunken with how painfully clich√©d everything was. <br /> <br /> And the plot? The word risible comes to mind. I would have been amused if I had not wasted two hours of my life following this ill-thought-out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the flaws of the movie, in the end, I was expecting something interesting to complete it. I will not discuss the ending because I would not want to "spoil" the movie for those who have not seen it. Except that the metaphor "Be a stone or a grain of sand, in the water they sink like the same." can not be used as an explanation for everything. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was made just for shock value and shock value. I just hope that sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognize a bad movie for what it is. I have seen many other great Korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed Oldboy as the best.
