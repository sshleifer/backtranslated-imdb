Most of you really did not like this movie ... you were right. A small minority of you really loved the movie ... I can not say you're wrong. For me, this movie was very stupid. I've seen many idiot comedies, but this one outpaces them all. As he watched, he could not stop rubbing his eyes, not believing what he was seeing and trying to decide whether to laugh or cry, while STUPID things were on the screen, and people were leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> According to the main characters, time travel is accomplished, just go into any museum and you will actually travel to the past. Also, if you are looking for an afterlife experience, just go to the nearest planetarium, there you will find the Lord - sorry, Loydd and be given important commands ... All of the above does not make much sense, right? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never regret the movies I watch), you probably will not like it but you will be intrigued by the writer's ability to produce the script STUPID ... <br /> < > I'm giving away 3 out of 10, not good, far from being the worst ...
