Let me do a preface by doing this, I'm a big fan of George Clooney and I love John Krasinski in 'The Office'. Well, I was and I did. <br /> <br /> This was the worst nail in the world and took 113 minutes to pluck it. The stupefied boredom was only interrupted by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would end. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was on the preview. All three. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was just plain bad. I had a colonoscopy which was nicer. <br /> <br /> The title should have been Super Bad. This movie is a block for a Razzie. It should have a lot of Razzies. I want my money back.
