... now please move on because this is getting on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the man behind such brilliant pieces as "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other not-so-brilliant films, ie the unnecessary "Psycho" remake) experimental phase with "Gerry", which reached its peak with the instigating "Elephant". "Last Days" had some interesting aspects, but it was very uneven, while "Paranoid Park", his new movie, also has beautiful 15 year olds walking around ... and not much else. Some legal references to Fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the highlights, but the film is very artistic and meaningless for its own disgrace. We had much better stories about the age, and "Paranoid Park" does not bring anything new. I do not see anything artistic in seeing excessive photos of Gabe Nevins in panties or taking a shower. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (the girl from "How the Grinch Stole Christmas"), who plays her cheerleader girlfriend, have sex for the first time, just because she felt she had to do it and then ready, she calls her friend to say how incredible it was (and you can tell from Nevins' face how traumatic it was). Everyone knows that they are starting earlier and earlier these days, movies like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" itself (which shows how lost minds are in general, not just when it comes to sexuality) have made a picture better than that. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the end result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk," a biopic about Harvey Milk starring Sean Penn, will hopefully bring good old Gus back because, frankly, this obsession with underage boys is almost ... scary. 4.5 / 10.
