I have seen many - possibly many straight-to-video, no budget films reduced and developed a taste for the "good", or those who are less painful, as ridiculous as it may seem, hahaha. DR. CHOPPER, that's what I like to refer to as ... absolute shit. None of this is nice - acting sucks, the characters are crap, the killer sucks, the blood is minimal ... and it sucks. It's about a group of college friends who drive to a newly discovered family hut, owned by the parents of one of the children. The goal is to be a relaxing retreat, but little do you know that a former plastic surgeon who died seriously ill, along with his two female assistants, looks for a usable tissue to save the doctor. His name is Dr. Chopper since he rides a motorcycle and, of course, chops. This is just a terrible movie, not worthy of anyone's time. Enough said.
