I remember thinking that because of the cast, the subject and the director, I would love this movie. <br /> <br /> I entered the theater and sat down as a dumb schoolboy Anticipation for the opening scene built. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by the opening and felt that I really would love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet and feel that anything that gives scenes can be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to reveal anything really important, but it can be seen as such, so that's the warning. <br /> <br /> The spoiler can be included below, beware. <br /> <br /> I think the first scene that really struck me as simply ridiculous was the scene of the Russian space station. I mean honestly, refueling a bus without real notice, and then simply showing the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can make the whole thing explode. <br /> <br /> While this is all possible, it seemed to me to be way above the top. I'm not sure if it was just the situation or whether it was the tacky acting, the silly look of the Russian technology, or just the exaggerated attitude of the scene itself. <br /> <br /> It only got worse after that because then we endured what seemed like 2 hours of constant super high explosions in space ... you know, that place where there is no sound because it is a vacuum. <br /> <br /> But the stroke of mercy for me, honestly, was the scene of the gun. At the beginning of the movie, we see Bruce Willis destroying his land vehicle (the vehicle they'll use to drive when they get there and help them drill) when they tell him that's what they're going to do. be using. He is picking up pieces and complaining because so much of what is in it is heavy and is not necessary for what they are doing. So when we're wandering by the asteroids, we see that they have opted to add a huge gatling as a weapon to the vehicles ... you know, NASA's standard fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in the case, you know, aliens or something. <br /> <br /> I could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the silly scene of refueling the Russian space station, the extravagant love scene near the end, the character of Bruce Willis being nothing more than most of his other previous characters, but Steve Buscemi going crazy and throwing the weapon of the space vehicle over the place and causing havoc / damage, well he threw the whole thing over. <br /> <br /> Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor movie, see Deep Impact, if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what happens, skip this movie.
