Big D.B. tries to keep the peace between the settlers and their red brothers. Boone (an old Bruce Bennett) has to try to prove to the local chief of India (Lon Chaney, Jr., looking like he is drunk, as usual) that his son was killed by the chief idiot of the tribe who has also dealt with rifle trafficking when no one is looking. Faron Young sings, but holds the rifle like a mop. <br /> <br /> OK western-adventure driven by two guys, none of whom have many credits on their resume, but this movie is not so bad and has a good run time of 76 minutes.
