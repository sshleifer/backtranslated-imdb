This review tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch the movie Angels and Demons on the first night they left, even though it was a school night because "Angels and Demons are worth it". Two of the four read the book. Of those who did not, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. This was the least busy part of the night after watching the abominable Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a laboratory where antimatter is being created while another process is taking place. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how confused I am ... I did not understand what happened: they were just doing the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own dead father ... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take the X-33 scene. They take Maxmillian Kohler. They pretty much get CERN and the symbology attached to it. They take Hassasin and replace him with a British religious face. They take the diamond out of the Illuminati. They take the scene of almost rape of Vittoria. They take Langond's fight with Hassasin (now British crack guy). They get the press guy behind them. They take the death of the fourth cardinal. They take away the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They take the great scheme of the Camerlengo. They catch Langdon in the helicopter and land on that island at the end. They take away the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take away the fun of Langdon and, unfortunately, take away the sexual appeal of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In addition to the movie COMPLETELY losing the focus of the details, the film is HORRIBLY shaken. It must be admitted, however, that there were some good things. For example, the recreation of the Sistine Chapel must have been extremely difficult and extremely well done. The blast scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, scratch this movie to ruin the book for people who have not read it.
