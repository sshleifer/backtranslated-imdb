"Garden State" is another of these "indie" images that are supposed to save on production values ​​in order to give the audience some real and real human drama. Incredibly, the production is very good, as are the performances (by some well-known actors). Where the picture is missing is in Zach Braff's script, which seems most often taken from situations taken from other films. <br /> <br /> When you're as young as Braff, you have not lived long enough to use the movie. experience as a film forage. Braff's experience seems to be watching movies, then repeating the same trivial cliches in his own film. In Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown in New Jersey to bury his mother, who took his own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. He seems to have no feeling about it; he has no relation to his father, who blames him for paralyzing his mother in a weird accident at the age of six, and has no dismay at losing his mother (in fact, he attends a party soon after the funeral which he was invited by a friend of his, who works as a graveyard-digger). It all sounds great as "Beautiful Girls", also about a guy who goes back to his hometown to "meet up" and hang out with his old friends, with a bit of "ordinary people" thrown aside. <br /> <br /> It's really a miracle that Braff could accomplish anything in his life, given his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he did not kill himself), who are still living their "lives." as if they were still in high school, partying with stupid bimbos, drinking and drugging, etc. None of them even recognize him from his TV role as the "retarded quarterback" (Natalie Portman's character, the most conscious person in the movie, does), and says things like "Hey, I remember you from the junior year" . These guys are so losers, for them, watching television would be a cultural leap. Even a friend, who made millions inventing a silent Velcro, has no real reason to live, because his whole frame of reference is high school and the party. And you do not need a lot of money to party like in your second year of high school. Braff, is revealed, is heavily medicated, which prevents him from "feeling" and dealing with anything, really, as an adult. would be. Then he meets Sam (Natalie Portman) as a lost girl who gives funerals to pets and lives with his mother as a 10-year-old girl in a room that looks like a pink dollhouse blown to life-size . Either way, they fall in love and Braff learns to "feel" again. The clichés come fast and furious. Braff has a long heart-to-heart conversation with his cold, distant father and tells him what is and the name of the game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in the millionaire's house, playing face to face with a giant fireplace, and the part is so routine, so standardized, I swear, I kind of hoped someone would come up and throw a sled into the fire . In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to replenish his garbage, and Liebman tells him (easily the worst line in the film) "The body can play tricks on you." Once I found the cufflinks of my former best friend in my wife's purse, and I did not have an erection for a year and a half. " Obviously, no licensed doctor would say this, but it's dirt poetry, a Braff nod to, I think, his loser friends so they know he's still thinking of them, just like the joke "37" in "Clerks" was O Kevin Smith nods to his fellow trash bag. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Braff finds true happiness and gets rid of the drug; the story unfolds predictably. But if you're going to have a movie that's cliché from wall to wall, at least give some charming performances to bring it to life. And Braff does. He has the right kind of vacancy, from casual acceptance to make his role as Andrew's zonked-out real and poignant, and Natalie Portman (also of Beautiful Girls) gives the film a big boost. With her tiny features and shimmering expressions of humor, she almost steals the photo as her traveling companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better at "Shattered Glass") is remarkable as the gravedigger friend. I would recommend "Garden State" if you can not get enough of the fairytale novels from the movies, but when people start calling them masterpiece, they are just ignorant. Braff thinks you can pick up the same old and tired plot, write in some "f ** ks" and "awesomes" and hit a soundtrack of acoustic rock and it pairs the material. Do not do.
