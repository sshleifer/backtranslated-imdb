This is a terrible reprint of a very good movie called "Up In The Air," starring Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I just managed to spend about 20 minutes before turning it off. Almost all the lines are identical, I have no idea why they would redo the movie. I totally disagree with a previous post that does not like the songs (there it is also the same). In the original, the singing is first-rate, not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually sang, it's hard to say, since the vocals usually added later, and the songs are very good, surprising in a "B" movie. If you have the chance see the original is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
