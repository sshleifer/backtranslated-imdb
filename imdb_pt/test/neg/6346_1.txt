I'm not sure who should be blamed for this disaster - in fact, the acting is not so bad and the story is not as terrible as some Disney-made movies. The story itself is superficial and underdeveloped, but this is not surprising in such a film. The acting is more than a little two-dimensional, but I give credit to the actors for managing to do anything with the material they had to work on. <br /> <br /> However, it is inexcusable, in my book, Basing an entire plot on the theory that they created a 'perfect' pop star and then cast an actress who can not sing to save his life. If the girl can not sing, have someone who can record the song! <br /> <br /> This actress is a TERRIBLE singer - she was so boring that she usually sang in a totally different lyric!
