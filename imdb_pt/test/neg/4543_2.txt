"The Chilling," directed by Deland Nuse and Jack A. Sunseri, is one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchcraft") appeared in that stink is beyond me. dumb: Frozen bodies in a cryogenic laboratory are revived after lightning attacks and turned into cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look horrible and there is no blood. - Avoid that cheap piece of junk like the plague. My rating: 1 out of 10.
