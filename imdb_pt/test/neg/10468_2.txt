Except for the good rack of Clara Evans ... this show was really bad ... so why did I watch it? Too much coffee, and had to relax before hitting the bag. Watching BB turn into his Big Chief outfit, it was fun at best, laughable at worst. <br /> <br /> I could have done a better skeltor and special effects on my Dell. Boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and he's looking more and more like the Scarecrow from his TV series back in the 1980's ... the eye candy for women needs to return to acting school, although Evans size 40 and playing a 17-year-old (she's in her 20s was a stretch) .... the Sci-Fi Channel did better than this ... but for us people who do not go out to the bars much more, I think we have to get what we get ... after all, anything that gets you out of CNN, MSNBC, and Fox coverage of the 2008 Election these days is one thing good.
