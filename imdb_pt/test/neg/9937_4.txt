The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it was shot on video, so it has that quirky "home-video-ish" look that's terribly disturbing and makes it hard to take it seriously as a "real" . And "Zipperface" really looks like a bunch of amateurs get together for a "real" serial killer thriller. Not really, but it's not as bad as it sounds. Having a woman as one of the two case detectives strolls into the exploiting genre. Dona Adams gives an incredibly amateur performance on paper - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. In addition, she puts on a great fight against the killer in the end. The red herrings look ridiculous at first, but in the end they work - I guessed the killer incorrectly. And you have to wonder if maybe Tarantino has seen the Zipperface guy when he got the idea from "The Gimp" to "Pulp Fiction." (* 1/2)
