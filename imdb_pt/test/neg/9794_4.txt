After his widowed father dies in a horse accident, young Tom Burlinson (as Jim Craig) is left to run his Australian farm "Snowy River" with only Kirk Douglas (as Spur) to help. Times are tough, so Burlinson will work for Douglas's rich and silver brother, Mr. Harrison (also played by Kirk Douglas). When a great job arises, Douglas (older?) Silverhaired feels that Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go along; Burlinson falls behind and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). The least satisfying aspect of director George Miller's film "The Man from the Rio Nevoso" is a weak one. plot. Observe, for example, the sequence of events "Jessica is lost". The maiden gets lost in one of these freak storms as she runs away. His worried father assembles a drunk to find her after predicting bad weather. Maiden "Jessica" rolls to the edge of a cliff appearing conveniently. Suddenly sober father and men do not check Burlinson's farm. Hero Burlinson discovers the maiden. After lighting the fire, he decides to kiss her. <br /> <br /> The "romance" is played innocently for a man and a woman as obvious as Burlinson and Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark history" that is revealed before any mystery is built on the subject. The main attraction here is the Australian scenery.
