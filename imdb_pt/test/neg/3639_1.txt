Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is played by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who earned her fame for being the younger sister of pop star international Britney Spears. With her beautiful blonde wig in season one and an attempt to hide her monotonous country accent, it is confirmed that Nickelodeon really went to dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who played Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope was won, since she was the only decent actress. Female casting is a complete disgrace, but male casting has potential for teen media. If they continue to chase Jamie Lynn Spears as the image of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. With hope, they will soon discover that you can not make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she tries for that downward spiral she calls career. There is no way to know why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics would definitely proclaim it as something different.
