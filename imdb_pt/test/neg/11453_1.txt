The selection of the swollen, boring and racist "Cimarron" is considered the worst choice for Best Film in the history of the Oscars. Misunderstood (particularly by the overlooked Richard Dix, whose performance as self-centered and irresponsible Yancey Cravat is considered one of the most narcissistic characterizations in screen history) and with a major footprint, the film is truly shocking because of the racist trend its only black character , which is presented by being shown sleeping on a chandelier. Other reviews by IMDb's reviewers have dismissed the attitude toward this character as being merely dated, but many films that appeared during this period did NOT portray blacks as mentally retarded and lazy in the same way that this giant delights; then this argument seems weak to say the least. But if you consider this humiliating characterization as in a shockingly bad taste for anyone at any time or merely the forgiving ignorance of a less educated era, it is very painful to observe with the eyes of the 21st century. But even that may not matter if the movie was not of the excessive size that is. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture at the 1930/31 Academy Awards, when longtime classics like "City Lights," "The Public Enemy," "Dracula," "The Dawn Patrol," and "The Blue Angel" were not nominated, "Cimarron "is by far the worst choice to enter the pantheon Oscar.
