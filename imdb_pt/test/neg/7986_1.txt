Thomas Edison may have made many inventions, but WTF is it !!!! I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. The plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point and gets electrocuted. Ok, the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper. I thought the first Charlie Chaplin movies were horrible. Okay Thomas Edison may have been an inventor but why did he make this film that he could have filmed a baby being fed and would have been better off. People may say that I'm being tough with the times, but you'd like something like that I said Edison may have made the lamp, but why did he make that particular movie. Well, I may sound like a complete # # hole, but check this out on Youtube, then you will see this abomination. I still can not believe that this movie is completely horrible. All in all the worst short films I have ever seen. Rating: 1/10
