All the airport movies are stinky, but this is the biggest turkey of them all. The formula was different for this one because it focused on TWO disastrous flights and lots of plotting on the ground, while the other films focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground. The feats with the Concorde are worth watching the chuckles, although the special effects are not as terrible as I would expect for a film of this quality made in 1979. George Kennedy's sexist comments are disgusting and his encounter with a prostitute in Paris is totally unnecessary (and made me choke a little). Poor Martha Raye was relegated to a role in which she did nothing but relieve her gut repeatedly in the Concorde's bathroom. There are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous films, giving you one more reason not to watch this movie.
