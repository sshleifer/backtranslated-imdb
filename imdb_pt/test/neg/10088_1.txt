It was horrible, simple and simple. What was their message? Where did the movie go with that? It has all the ingredients of a sub-B level movie. From plot plot to poor acting to slow cinematography ground. I'd rather watch a movie I've seen like Goodfellas, The Bronx Tale and even Grease. There are no friendly characters. In the end, you just want everyone to die already. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
