I had read reviews online praising this obscure ride as a combination of bloody horror, quirky black comedy and frontier house art; the film has elements of all three for sure, but they are at the service of such an absurdly silly premise (the title immediately gives the game)? and amateur production to boot? that their long-term neglect due to a lack of proper distribution? Basically, until Cult Epics was released for the release of the DVD, 30 years after its creation! ??? was not a great loss for the cinema or even for the genre (s). The bed was apparently created for the purpose of accommodating the flirtation of a demon with a woman; Anyway, a dying man who made use of the canopy and even painted it ends up stuck on the wall behind the screen (!) and gives intermittent comments on 'action'. Several people (from teenagers on the run to hidden gangsters) provide fodder for the ever-hungry bed; Newer on the menu are a trio of girls? one of whom, however, remembers her lover long ago and consequently the bed apparently dreads her! Seeing various objects? from cigars to fried chicken chunks ?? and people being swallowed (the belly of the bed is described as a barrel of honey-colored liquid) make the film slightly amused at times (especially when a young man's hands are reduced to his skeletal training, which he also seems to carry easily in his step!), but also terribly repetitive - so that even in a brief 77 minutes, all the futile exercise feels tense and downright desperate.
