Stodgy's drama starring Pat O'Brien as a reporter who appeared at his former boss's house to ask for money to fund his son's operation, only to find him dead on the floor. As O'Brien knows the identity of the guilty party, he offers to get rap for the money he needs. A decent premise is wasted on a movie that pretends to have surprises, twists and turns, even if it does not happen. Performances are rotten all over the line, the film wears a hard American noir, but the mix of dishonest accents does not work, and the story is hardly exciting. And it possibly contains the least alluring screen kiss ever.
