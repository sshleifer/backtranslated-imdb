There is somewhere here the result of a decent, though routine, SF story. It is frustrated by several factors. First, the actor is simply awful. Even the competent actors are terrible. The dialogue is wooden and steep. The plot progresses predictably. This looks less like a finished movie than actors going for a walk. Extremely disappointing.
