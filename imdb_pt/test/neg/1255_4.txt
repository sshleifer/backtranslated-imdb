Wow, I just witnessed one of poker's biggest tragedies and I'm not talking about the unbearable death of the great Stu Ungar. This movie I'm sorry to say was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A real tragedy in the history of filming. Well, maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but unless you have some interest in stugar's life, do not even think about approaching it. And those who have an interest in your life will find that most of the parts have been trivialized and become great novelty scenes. I watched it because of UNgar Stu but almost wanted to wipe me out as he did while watching this 4-star movie for the effort but unpleasantly painful
