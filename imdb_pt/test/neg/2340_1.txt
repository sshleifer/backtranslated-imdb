If you are a pretentious person, it would be a good idea to brag about your intellectuality by saying that you really like this movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not worry and watch something better. <Br /> <br /> This is the stereotyped snob film. The plot would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end. It is only presented in a confusing way as an attempt to make it difficult to understand and make the film look like intellectual. <br /> <br /> Mullholland Drive is not pleasant to watch. You would rarely understand anything the first time you see it. And if you do, you'd probably be disappointed because it's not a big deal.
