Well, it was not a complete waste. Armand was, as usual, very good in the film, the whole Turkish vs German was kind of strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie ... do not bother to go back and check ... the central theme is about serial killings with all the vaguely woven gang war. I've never seen a movie in which the characters looked Italian, supposedly Turkish, taking English (American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me. In any case, if you have nothing better to do, you can watch this movie ..
