I gave this movie a 2 mainly because it actually has an ok cast, but the movie itself is just like that (rarely enter a rude word starting with the sixth letter of the alphabet) -in no sense that I felt bad that at the time I voted your lowest vote was a three. <br /> <br /> Plots very predictable ... two musicians nare-do-well do not have money and many problems with money. However, when a friend leaves a bag full of money (which belongs to drug traffickers) under their care, of course they spend it and then the "fun" begins. <br /> <br /> It's not an original idea throughout this movie.
