Snakes on a Train is a movie that I rented because of the sheer fun of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on a Plane was a nice action movie, so obviously the filmmakers wanted to profit from success with this low-budget effort. At 85 minutes, Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable to witness. I had to stop the movie to do something to amuse myself because of the lack of events in the movie. Throughout the duration of the film, it is never fully explained why this girl has this curse, or why she continues to spit this green / purple goo constantly. Not only that, there is an endless boring dialogue between the two main characters, Brujo and Alma discussing how to get rid of the curse. I can enjoy low budget cinema. I'm not really picky on movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is actually one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The writers of Acid or something similar at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and, more importantly, how on earth was able to devour the train? <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Snakes on a Train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs. Do not be puzzled as I was with the title, this is a movie that is seriously bad. Let's put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
