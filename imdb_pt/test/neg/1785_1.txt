Why do you ask, does this man claim to have the truth behind the existence of the Almighty? Well, your deductive logic, my friends, you see, I know that God exists because Satan does, how else would my poor eyes have been soiled in such a horrible movie? Yes, there is no doubt about it, on a cold Friday in the year 2006 Satan owned me and forced me to watch this movie. He what? You wonder; the devil makes little girls spit vomit and climb ceilings, why would he waste time making you watch that movie? My only conclusion to this question is that Satan believes that watching Camp Fear is the worst form of deadly punishment, not ripping out his eyes or causing you to speak in tongues, instead making you run out of thought for an hour and a half of the most horrible movie of all time. . Can this movie be as terrible as it says? Yes my friend watching this movie is the equivalent of being kicked in the bag about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm being too hard, this movie has a few moments in it, the beginning, for example, starts in a brotherhood house with lots of topless girls; now I'm never in a brotherhood I'm not sure if the girls really do this, but hey you can always pray. Now, after the five minutes of breasts and butt cheeks are over, we are introduced to a scene on the campus of a girls' college; the girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archeology class where they discuss virgin sacrifices and ancient mounds. Flash forward the class teacher (who happens to be the only male in this college of girls apparently) takes a handful of her nubile students, plus her friend, to a remote lake in the mountains, her searches, to find ancient Indian artifacts; Yes, certain teacher, we know what your angle is. Now is where the movie starts, the group of five, four girls, a guy stops at a gas station to get some directions, but behold a gang of bikers pulls up and harasses the girls, only to eventually leave them alone and follow separate paths. Moving on, they come to a "camp" consisting of four logs and some trees and then things start to go wrong. First the prof. and his girlfriend will depart to have some time alone when one of the girls takes care of finding them, only to be captured by some unknown force. Continuing the other two girls start looking for the missing girl when the motorcyclists, as well as a drunken guy, have been looking for them, their plan, to rape the girls and do horrible things with them. The film continues with something about a druid needing four virgins for a sacrifice to save the world from some kind of aquatic monster before the year two thousand; but the problem is that this druid, one of the girls is de-virginized right in front of us, then that plane runs away. Now that I've said there'd be spoilers I'm going to ruin the end of the movie for you, the four girls are taken, drugged with a little green goo, and then they're ready to be sacrificed, after one of them is killed, the two remaining bikers and the prof. come and save them; they're standing on a parapet where the motorcyclist who does not drive says, "I think I can get down there!" only to jump and break the leg. The prof. runs to the guy and gets overwhelmed leaving only the once-heroic rapist-now-heroic biker left to fend off the giant 6'3 "druid. First he makes a pathetic attempt with a stick, then pulls a knife, the knife reflects a leisurely inside a mouth of golden snakes and instantly lights up the druid, then they take the wounded away through emergency stretchers and ponder whether everything is really over, only to have the lake bubble showing that the monster inside him still lives. is the movie and this is my criticism, which unfortunately will not be read by most of the eyes as this is only the fifth comment posted for a movie that has been out for fifteen years.Fortunately Satan can only reach out to some of us and not to Judge would like to make a heartfelt apology to the poor girl from Circuit City that I'm going to borrow this movie: "I'm sorry, Sheila, please do not hate me for letting you watch this."
