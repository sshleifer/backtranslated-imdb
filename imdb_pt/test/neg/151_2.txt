This movie just did not do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies, but this one has very little to do with terror. The effects are cheap, and when they cut one foot, they look so fake. The same goes for the other effects, such as tongue torture and intestinal sex. They could have spent a few extra dollars on the effects. <br /> <br /> With lots of sex (with pixelation like in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick things like that. While most bloody, for me, it fits with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These films show girls eating and playing with all the fluids that come out of their bodies, eating insects and fish in a crude way and having sex with all kinds of strange animals, like frogs, eels and ... A look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here, just sick and demeaning sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Terror fans should avoid this and are better to check out the guinea pig2: Flowers of flesh and blood or even the subway of August Mordum. Although these are not great, they at least offer a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely flawed in that department.
