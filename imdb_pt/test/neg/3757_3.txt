You have to hand it over to screenwriter and director John Hughes. With huge success behind him in the vein of teen and high school, he managed to spread to other areas of the comedy, finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian-actor John Candy. Here, adult Candy becomes a better person after agreeing to take care of his brother's wiseacre children; is an infallible formula designed to please both cynical teenagers and their parents, and it's no wonder that the film has been a winner with the theater audience. Still, Hughes relies almost entirely on Candy's charm to end the scenario, and may eventually tire of the repetitive jokes with the front and center of the star. The kids are smart, the other unformed bubbles for adults, and Amy Madigan is too intense, too exaggerated to play Uncle Buck's girlfriend. It later became a TV series, which is appropriate, since the material was already perfected on television. * 1/2 of ****
