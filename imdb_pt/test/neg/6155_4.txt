Combine good cast, bad writing, good orchestral punctuation, bad dialogue and good story idea with a lot of potential, but it's never noticed, so you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> I just bought the movie for a buck, it's worth it, but not much else. Good to see Mark Hamill take action again. <br /> <br /> There should be a decent sequel to remedy the damage of the original. Or at least give the proper attention you should have received in the first place. <br /> <br /> Berstein's punctuation required his attention from the opening credits, however, the long takes of slipstream plans and the even longer revelation of interesting plot points make his attention punctuated . <br /> <br /> It is very easy to face a movie like this, after all it is the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a tremendous cast, but it is what it is. And that's not much. Favorite line - "We'll make it, ha-ha! ... (BOOM!)"
