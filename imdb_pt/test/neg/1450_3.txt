Advantages: Mary Boland is deliciously on the edge as always (I never tire of her superior crust zaniness, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). BATHROOM. Fields's brief role is amusing, although the famous pool table scene stretches a bit, because it seems to last ten minutes. The movie follies, typical of the period, are great. In addition, a nod to Alison Skipworth's beautifully grounded hotel mistress; I'd love to see more of her (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another praiseworthy personality). <br /> <br /> Minuses: Gracie Allen. An annoying and bland presence, whose hassle was unparalleled until the rise of Adam Sandler. This almost falsetta nasality, with an accent of unknown origin, ages in its first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen movies I've seen and as long as I (as a big fan of classic comedy) try to try at least one movie with all the big comedy stars, this is definitely a team that I will not call again . Your time and interpretation of the material is totally out. A maddeningly mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> The result: an OK comedy, but the jokes are few and far between. And with only an hour in length, you can expect that this is not a Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for fans of Boland and Fields who want to see all their work.
