This World War II movie, set in Borneo, tries so hard to work on so many levels that it's a shame that everyone has failed. Nick Nolte is a runaway American who witnesses the executions of his comrades by the Japanese. It wanders through the depths of Borneo, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who meets the adopted tribe of Nolte. Nolte, now resembling Robert Plant, became the new king of his tribe. He defeated a convicted warrior in a bloody battle and had a revealing tattoo on his chest (a dragon). Now, before leaving and getting a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, things are not going well in Nolteland. Havers wants the help of the tribe in the fight against the Japanese, who are invading the island. He teaches the natives how to use machine guns and the shooting starts a lot. As the tribe becomes more successful, they are faced with a new squad of Japanese who are not like the others. This platoon cannibalizes the villages they conquer to maintain their strength (talk about their sushi), and they move through the jungles even faster than the tribe. As we know the result of the war, we know that the tribe triumphs, but with heavy casualties. Here come the spoilers: Havers is wounded and returned to "civilization". He gives the location of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then goes through the trouble of releasing Nolte, and the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> Milius's direction is certainly adequate, but the script here is rather vague in its motives. It presents ideas of stories, then leaves them to arrive at the next idea of ​​history. Nolte is horrible when the soldier turned king, trying desperately to channel the spirit of Colonel Kurtz of Marlon Brando. He talks about freedom, the beauty of the jungle and the wealth of his people, and you will not believe for a second in the words he utters. He is often unintentionally funny, especially his initial insect in the jungle, and spends the rest of the movie sounding like a hippie. Nigel Havers passes the movie looking at Nolte as if he were Raquel Welch. The vague sub-homosexual current between the two goes beyond friendship, not exactly sex, and settles into an unspoken relationship that must have had the natives talking. Havers usually gets around and has an internal conflict, repelled the tribe is hunting heads, but warming to Nolte's attention. His fellow British soldiers are natives faster than the Bounty landing party in Tahiti, but all I saw about Borneo is that it is very humid and has lots of green. <br /> <br /> The climactic betrayal, where Havers gives Nolte's location is completely devoid of any reason. There is no thought as to why Havers does this except to keep the movie running. I was angry when, by chance, Havers and Nolte ended up going to the same ship going to the Philippines, the ship ran aground, and Havers ran into the basement to free Nolte's newly undone. No goodbye kiss, but Havers says goodbye to the king, explaining the title. <br /> <br /> If you were fighting a war, and an enemy squad was eating your allies, would not that scare you? This elite Japanese squad is not shown enough, though their eating habits are so horrible that I would become a conscientious objector immediately. The same kind of spooky enemy was treated much better in "The 13th Warrior." <br /> <br /> Other kinds of interesting ideas are discarded. What about the fact that modern technology brings the death of so many people backward? Why did King Nolte let the British use their subjects without much hesitation? Why can not Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? In the end, "Farewell to the King" is a disappointment, not anchored by a strong leadership, and trying to be too many things without thinking and exploring its options. I can not recommend this. <br /> <br /> This movie is rated PG13 by strong physical violence, strong armed violence, some blood, some profanities, some sexual references and adult situations.
