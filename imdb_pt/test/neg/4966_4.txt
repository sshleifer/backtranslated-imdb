I was just cautiously keen on renting "All Boys Love Mandy Lane" as I instantly remembered hearing and reading a wide variety of opinions? both positive and negative? in the short time between his brief film release and distribution to the videostore's shelves. Supposedly this was the most ingenious and refreshing new horror film in years, with non-stereotyped teen characters and unpredictable twists and turns for a change. Okay, the basic concept may seem reasonably innovative, but inevitably the script quickly reverts back to the same old and annoying slasher clich√©s, and once past that point, even stylistic trademarks can not save the movie from the terrible mediocrity. The opening sequences are indeed marvelous and literally bathed in a melancholy mood, which in fact makes it even more painful to witness the film sinking into the "ordinary" level of the rudimentary slasher movie. After the sublime introduction, show a drunken macho boy calculated his leap from a roof to impress the beauty of the title, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" ends up being just another book and an uninspired horror film about a bunch of idiot boys stoned and horny on an isolated ranch before being killed by a not so identified maniac. The whole pretentious montage of the movie collapses faster than a ruined house of cards: we have never received an adequate explanation as to why Mandy behaved so frigid and arrogant towards all her admirers (because she grew orphaned, perhaps? , boo-hoo), the boys soon illustrate that they would settle for sex with any bimbo randomly and not exclusively with the "divine" Mandy and the final turnaround? though undeniably unusual ?? is simply meaningless. The middle section is quite boring and does not even offer any genuinely horrible excitement (shotgun murders? Please!) Or authentic rancid fissure. My generous 4-in-10 rating goes entirely to the gritty and unsettling style of the '70s (with faded colors, bizarre yet beautiful photographic images) and the surprisingly wonderful soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine opted for Bobby Vinton's classic "Sealed With a Kiss" to play during the trailer and final credits, while initially I was convinced that the film would inevitably feature Barry Manilow's "Mandy".
