This film is poorly written, hard to follow and features bad performances and dialogue from leaders Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The premise, believable but weak (narcotic infiltrator succumbs to the underworld of the drug) deserved better than this flop Lili Fini Zanuck. The competent supporting cast (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie also contains the worst scene of "love" in the movies. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is overrated; Specifically, the revolting and substanceless "Tears in Heaven" by the legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is totally unacceptable from start to finish. <br /> <br /> 2 10
