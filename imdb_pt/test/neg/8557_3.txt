Edge of Madness is a tale about an 1800 woman who is handpicked by dirty Scotsman who can not keep his penis in his pants. He just happens to have a younger brother who is against rape and kills him but continually says it was an accident. It makes his wife go crazy, she deludes herself and she falls because she loves George too much. <br /> <br /> Like I said, this kind of thing has been done before. This is just more "artistic" because it is Canadian and is an indie production made with a low budget with little known actors (except that a Lassie boy, yes, he is in it). I do not know if this would be an Oscar bait, but it sure was annoying. And that's based on a 40-page tale. Half of this tale is embedded in this movie, and I'm happy. Otherwise, I would bear death. Unfortunately, I had to watch it in my Media Fundamentals class, and I had a chore about it. Read the story and compare and contrast the movie with the story. UNDERSTANDING. <br /> <br /> You know, it's harder to answer movie questions when you do not like the movie. Well, I hope this is the last type of work my class and I have received. For what it's worth, Annie Herron was totally hot, she had a nice, soft ass and I liked her naked parts in the movie. <br /> 3/10 for boring, Oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality .. more nudity.
