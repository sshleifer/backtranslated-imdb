I must say I was surprised to find several positive comments for this turkey (in desperate need of a feather transplant)! I'm giving it a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about the wild rock'n'roll man - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put that crap and the "killer" does not deserve it! It's a good thing that happened at the end of his career ... they said that Elvis pretty much ruined his career with the films he published in the '60s and this could have done the same for Jerry Lee if it had been released between 15 and 20 years before. ! It's based on Myra Gail Lewis's book and that's a shame to start with. It is a bad and inaccurate story of his life along with Lewis and there are much better books on the Killer that could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add to that a group of actors who do not know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! The other great actor Dennis Quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor on many moons! He is walking in the photo, talking about his "God-given talent" and as a spectator, you would like him to show something on the screen too! Funny silly and funny gestures and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had happened to him in this really horrible movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... except for Winona Ryder who does her best with the low quality lines given to her. It's "Grease" again and whenever Jerry Lee walks in Memphis in his convertible, having the radio on in the car, the whole town is dancing with his music! Everyone in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved ... from the wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a pity! A charismatic and entertaining artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves more and I hope he took the $ 500,000 he got from the business and told the company to prostitute himself ... twice!
