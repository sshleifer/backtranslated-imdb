Going to Professor Ms. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun and entertaining comedy that entertained me by the time of execution. Despite a good first half hour, the movie quickly turns into a tedious mess and clich√© that is as much fun as pulling your eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers, with that. Scream writer Kevin Williamson wrote and directed this film, and proved that Scream may well have been a fluke. Most elements of this film have been seen a million times in other films; and while it was okay for him to steal elements of other films on Scream, due to being a slasher tribute; here it seems that he is completely without ideas. The storyline follows the school's smarter girl, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher who made them hostage in their own home. However, this is not just a teacher; is Mrs. Tingle, the wickedest whore in school. She is also not being tied up in bed as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other. <br /> <br /> The plot is very much like the 1997 movie 'Suicide Kings'. and a whole series of previous films. In fact, it's not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could have filled the film with interesting characters; could have worked very well. Mrs. Tingle's character is the most interesting of the film, but she is massively one-dimensional and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is suitably bad on paper, and while she does not have much to get her teeth; she clearly has fun playing the central figure. The teen cast is not worth mentioning, with only Katie Holmes standing out; and this is really only because of the profile of his star, not his acting talents. Williamson has draped almost every scene of soft and dull music, which would be really annoying if the movie was not absolutely terrible anyway. Honestly, this movie has some moments that are pretty good; but basically, if you want to see a good example of teen comedy - this is not the movie you want to see.
