I just saw this "latest" version of Macbeth and was pleasantly surprised by the solid acting and obvious effort it took to turn a low-budget historical piece into a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> One note, however, the song was very thin and did not add anything to the intensity of the movie and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a bunch of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer needs to get along !!!
