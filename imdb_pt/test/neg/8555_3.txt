Get the CD. The show is tame and editing sucks. The crowd gets a lot of time onscreen, just like Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time in the same boy shaking their heads in the same way (which leads me to believe that it is exactly the same picture) than during the ground of Richard Kruspe in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so quickly that it is impossible to tell where the camera is pointed, and the replays are simply redundant. Not worth the tape on which it is recorded.
