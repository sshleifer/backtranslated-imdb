Let me get this out of the way before I screw up this movie: I love the work of Park Chan-Wook as a director. Although I do not agree with the masses saying he is the best director working in our time, I can not deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really enjoyed one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. In addition, the acting of Min-sik Choi was the only thing that allowed me to take this movie seriously. . . to 1/5 of the execution time, ie. <br /> <br /> Now, the Bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in film / literature. I will never understand how critics can criticize a Hollywood blockbuster for being a cliché, then welcome films like Oldboy, which are so uninspired and clichéd, if not more so. Regardless, Oldboy is one of the most generic and non-original films ever designed. * Spoilers * The man is kept in captivity, the man seeks revenge, the man discovers he had sex with a family member, the man's life is over. * End spoilers * Put simply, this plot has been used in everything from Greek pieces to modern melodramatic novels and countless movies / books in between. It's so melodramatic and unoriginal when the main revelation happens, I laughed out loud. Does that mean I'm crazy desensitized with no emotions, as some critics of the movie say about people like me? No. That means exaggerated plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved this, and Oldboy proved that too. Why do people fail to think of something that is really disturbing, instead of just citing tried and true clichés masked with sophisticated movies and classical music? This brings up the blood / blood issue. Simply put, it's not there. The director is too shy to point the camera to the screen when something "bloody" happens, as if we were watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I heard Oldboy call it "the most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever", but when I watched it, I could not see anything, not even remotely bloody or disturbing. All gore is off screen, and yet the level of violence is nothing you have not seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why does this still have an R-rating confuses me, let alone "the most brutal movie of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that make Oldboy look cute on all levels when it comes to violence / blood. <br /> <br /> The other big glaring fault is the main villain. Most of his time on the screen he's showing his ass to the public in the American Pie comic style, but should I think he's so mean? When he's wearing clothes, his hair is combed back like a bad Asian mix of villainous James Bond mixed with something out of Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an overdose of acid, and his dialogue is so bad it made me laugh one more time. Seriously, Oldboy made me laugh more than any comedy this year. . <br /> <br /> In the end, Oldboy is for those who drink good wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring their lives are at dinners. It is for those people who are so caught up in their own egos that they have forgotten just how unprecedented they are and consequently have forgotten how the boring and boring movies (never "movies") they like. <br /> <br /> These people all I can say is this: I like "movies" and I also like "movies". I like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like nonsensical action movies that leave me in a coma. But the fact is that for me to enjoy both "movies" and "movies," they have to be original. They have to be something I have not seen so many times that I have lost count of the number of times the storyline was used. When something is not original, it is expendable. If it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. Before giving Oldboy one more perfect rating because he "touched" you, maybe you should think of something: would not a movie be as touching as, but at the same time original, would you think more? I just wanted someone different from me to understand that. <br /> <br /> General: Oldboy is forgettable and tacky. <br /> <br /> 1/10
