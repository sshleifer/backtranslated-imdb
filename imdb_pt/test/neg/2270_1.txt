The comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version is too short. <br /> <br /> The cast is uninspired and the acting of wood. One has the impression that the director did not read the book, so he did not understand the characters. Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous, but his inadvertent folly that Redgrave captured brilliantly (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> The Musgrove sisters are so unpleasant that no one understands why Wentworth or anyone else would give them a second look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is devoid of sentiment. In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root managed to convey the depth of emotion they felt with each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this, it is difficult to understand that Anne spent years bogged down in regret unless one has read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the relationship of the main characters. <br /> <br /> In the scene where Wentworth enters Anne and Mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, they are just little friendships. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth comes in (the first time he sees her in years), the tension is thick. Resentment is coming from Wentworth in waves, while Anne is almost outdone. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth is courting Lousia, it's as if he's really invested, the underground currents are missing. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger at Anne. He is displaying his courtship in front of Anne, as if to say, "Look what you gave up, I do not need or want you any more." <br /> <br /> He still cares if she suffers, as the scene in which he asks his sister and the admiral to take Anne back home illustrates. In the 1995 version, the viewer feels the shock of Anne that he would care if she was tired, we also felt the discomfort of Wentworth that he still cared. In this version, he just moves on with Lousia as if nothing had happened. The main scene in which Anne is talking to Harville about who loves the most time, man or woman, is totally unsuccessful. The actors are just reciting lines without any emotional investment. <br /> <br /> When Anne reads Wentworth's letter, it's as if she's reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Compare this with the 1995 Version where the viewer feels the joy of Anne on her second chance. We're there with her as she reads the letter. The director made the two actors read the letter and you heard the two voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne is at first incredulous and then evolves into joy. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was necessary to explain to the viewer what has just happened. The 1995 version did not need to explain, we knew and rejoiced in the characters. The only thing this production has in its favor is to keep Mrs. Smith's sub-parcel intact, while the 1995 version did not. <br /> <br /> The 1995 version, however, included part of Austen's original ending. The scene in which Wentworth is hired by the Admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to go back to her house (which he and Mrs. Croft are renting) after they get married. <br /> <br /> This is a production to be avoided at all costs.
