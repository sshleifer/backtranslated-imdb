I can not believe that someone actually paid to have this movie done. Stupid, unrealistic and stereotyped. Since the huge 747 took off, the pilot pulled the levers to increase speed. so you have 5 people armed with semi-automatic weapons that shoot without even a bullet that breaks the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. Then, once down, in the belly of the plane, a stray bullet hits a line of fuel and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. The acting was simply awful and forced. There simply seemed to be no direction. I've seen some horrible B movies in my life, but with the names that were in this movie I was extremely disappointed.
