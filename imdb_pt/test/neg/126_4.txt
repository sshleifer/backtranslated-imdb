Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, firing battles with the 40-shell cargo gun and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is fun and competent, but there's nothing that really takes you away if you've seen your part before. <br /> <br /> The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is intelligent but hardly profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped - the enraged veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the corrupt cops, the indifferent cops, the stationmaster, the corrupt politician, the fat federal who seems to have been labeled Mexican in a Hollywood movie. 1940. Everyone acted reasonably, but again nothing special. <br /> <br /> I thought the main villains were very well made and very well represented. At the end of the movie, you certainly knew who the good guys were and who they were not. There was emotional excitement when the really bad ones had their mere deserts. Very simplistic, but then you were not expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found very annoying was the constant cuts in the RV's daughter during the last fight scene. <br /> <br /> Not bad. It is not good. Reasonable 4.
