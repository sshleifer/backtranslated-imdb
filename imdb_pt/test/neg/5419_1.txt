This movie is boring, boring, boring, boring and boring !!! Not the worst movie I've ever seen, on the contrary, but ....... how I'm going to put this ....... It's annoying! There are some very nice landscapes and some clever wit, but that's about it. If it were advertised as a travel diary, I'd rate a 7, but it's supposed to be a plot film, some drama and, for God's sake, a point or a satisfying conclusion. <br /> I read some comments on this forum about this movie and I wondered if they saw the same movie that I did. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie (yawn) at your own risk ........ one thing to be sure is actually ranked correctly = G CLASSIFICATION! (What else does God mean AWORTA CHORING!)
