Same? Is this necessary? How can anyone make such a movie? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with hair and fat funny as an elephant. Stunts all the time, car chases with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the ending. Completely absurd with the presence of the little girl. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, no one asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They must be kidding. Steven Segal faints after a car chase and I know he can not take action. It was terrible. Nothing can save this movie. <br /> <br /> I missed 90 minutes of my life! See you later
