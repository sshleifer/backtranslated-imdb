Infamous horror movies rarely measure the hype surrounding them and I still have not found a worse offender than Wes Craven, The Hills Have Eyes. Having prevented me from attending this for years, I was very pleased when I won it for Christmas and waited for a night when my girlfriend was about to settle down and watch - knowing her extreme dislike of anything genuinely creepy. I need not have bothered. <br /> <br /> After a promising start - although familiar - that puts the movie in the horror world of 'Desolution USA', things quickly crumble when the protagonists and antagonists find themselves in the abandoned desert. <br /> <br /> Looking like it was filmed on a budget of $ 5, with cannibal clan costumes hired from a devious fantasy clothing store specializing in fake caveman and Indian red costume, the story follows a boring group of nasty WASPs who make a detour on a trip to California to look for a silver mine in a nuclear test zone (!). When they break, they are attacked by the local family of meat eaters and have to fight to survive. While we waited for another Liberation, the Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn or Devil's Rejects, I really realized. I came across something that should have remained dusty and unseen in the bargain box of a broadcaster of video. <br /> <br /> With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and some horrible close-ups of wounds, I kind of see how a certificate of 18 (in the UK) is warranted, but with those close-ups cut it would not seem out of place like a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV. The whole silver mine / The subplot of the nuclear test site is just a McGuffin to justify launching the 'civilized' family against the primitives, but given the ease with which the savages get their asses, the which increases the credibility of thinking that they have survived for a generation by preying on passers-by. <br /> And then there's the end ... or the lack of it. The Hills Have Eyes seems to be missing a third act or at least a satisfactory outcome. Instead, I kept asking myself, "Yes, and ...?"
