Director Fabio Barreto won a strange Nominea Academy for his latest film The Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna, Barreto made one of the worst films of All Time. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think of me as poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? In the movie they do. There is no script, it's just a very long video clip with beautiful places and lots of sex scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
