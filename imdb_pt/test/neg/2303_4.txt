Dubbed beyond understanding, the HBO version of Lumumba is a disastrous representation of what appears to be what was once a decent movie. Some scenes simply do not make sense in English and the actors bring zero energy to the voice reading. Add self-censorship involving CIA agent Frank Carlucci, and you'll have a movie stripped of both your drama and your power. Here it is hoping that the subtitled version arrives at the American television screens at some point.
