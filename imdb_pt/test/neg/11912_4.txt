The Shanghai Cobra starts out as gangbusters, with a soggy rain scene coming straight out of Shack Out on 101 or Gun Crazy (the first). Unfortunately, the film continues on its tired path through a standard formula of Chan, which is barely animated by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if Director Karlson had cut half his budget in the first five minutes, just preparing the machine the way he wanted. Watch the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.
