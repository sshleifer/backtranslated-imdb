Although this film is inaccurate overall, there are some items that may be true. Certainly, he was a wild character in his youth, having played jokes about his fellow cadets at West Point, almost expelled several times, graduating last in his class (of 34), and often reckless in his leadership during the Civil War . But history may have made him a scapegoat from the Indian Wars. Surely he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? In addition, there is evidence that he testified before Congress (at great risk to his commission and command) that he argued over the impartiality of breaking the treaties with the Indians and that if he were an Indian he would also fight rather than live in A reservation! As one character said in the 1776 play, when asked about what will be said about the British about the loss of the Revolutionary War, the character states that "history will do what it always does ... it lie". Who knows how bad a man was Custer. Certainly he was not the nice character as portrayed by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely evil as he is later portrayed.
