Daft Potboilers do not come much more than that, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that does everything right. Except in this case, no. Based on a hypocritical novel by financial financier Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote "The Robe"), and already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, he has more spirit than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses sight. To compensate, he takes medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, he's not that stupid, he planned to become a doctor before he became an arrogant playboy.) Between the times, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> As hard as I try, I can not find the redemptive social commentary and criticism of American customs that supposedly lie just beneath the surface of Sirk's films, (this is not very deep). On the plus side, Rock Hudson is not all that bad (I think I'm rediscovering it), and of course it sounds great (Sirk's films live in cathedrals-sized rooms). Nothing in this movie matches the best of his later work, and even in terms of soap opera, it's definitely a daytime TV.
