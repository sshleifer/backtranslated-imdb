I hoped Pulp was an interesting film, but I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> The pulp has very little history, and what never matters to you. It was a real struggle to keep watching. When you're done you say to yourself "huh? Is that it?!?". This is the one you think about after watching him - why did they bother? <br /> <br /> It's too bad, since Michael Caine is a good actor. I was also hoping to see the great Lizabeth Scott in this, but she only appears on the screen for a total of maybe a minute. Scott is one of the great femme fatale noir girls and this was her last film. Oh well ...
