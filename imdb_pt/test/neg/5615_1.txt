Despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever-incredible Rappaport and Woods, this is yet another of those idiot comedies in which New York casts the hero in an effort by the writer and / or director to show which place is bizarre. Yes, there are other things in the movie that suck too, but that's what's important. The trend of independent filmmakers in New York seems to be "I do not need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. The flashback on why the only guy is called Wacky Jack was a lot of fun. The script is not a story or a plot, it's a lot of not good scenes tied to each other, presenting the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no reason behind what characters do. Uncle Sam makes the kid deliver the drugs, why? If it's so important why did not Sam do it? Then the main character hides in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from the lie. The guy falls in love with a flight attendant without either of them having reason to fall in love. The characters are a lot of pawns for the writer to move around to see if he can make anything crazy happen. <br /> <br /> If you have fun or like to watch bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad movies, watch this. If you want to see what a movie in a good mood is, see "Brother", by Takeshi Kitano. "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people detest eccentric indie films: MANY OF THEM SUGAR. And a note to the director: Do not be afraid to excite, entertain, enlighten or entertain audiences from time to time. Being annoying does not make you a better filmmaker than the ones that might interest me.
