This movie is so hopelessly bad, NOTHING about it makes it worth seeing. No effect, no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered. Oh, and neither a camp nor any fear does. Do yourself a favor and go see the original Friday 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp, but whatever you do, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even Michele Bauer's appearance at first can not save him. Usually, in these types of movies, you expect violence, suspense and some blood and some T & A. The violence was poorly executed, the suspense was laughable, there was no blood, and the T & A is abundant in the FIRST 5 MINUTES, then, NOTHING. At least one of these things, duly made, would at least have become watchable. <br /> <br /> To say at least one good thing about it, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands that they are doing schlock and just does it. If everyone else fit that tone, it would have been fun, no pun intended.
