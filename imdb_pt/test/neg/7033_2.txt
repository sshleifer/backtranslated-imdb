This was a terribly bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was awful, she had no Shirley Temple charm at all! Those horrible smiles she would make when she frowned in a way that I thought should be cute and make the audience go - "aahhhh bless!" It just made me want to slap her. She must have simulated "oh my goodneth!" about a hundred times throughout the film. He could barely utter a phrase without a false giggle. Horrible HORRIBLE movie .. If I could rate it at 10, I would. Do not waste your money on this junk, get out and get a genuine Shirley Temple movie!
