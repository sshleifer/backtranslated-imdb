OK ... before even starting the more or less constructive criticism of the film, I would like to say a few words that come from the heart ... THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!!! Do not go to see it, unless you really like SWEATY BOY-BANDS and act on wood, without traumas. So, let's go to because I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is no plot. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery that the feeling was not there. 2. The whole thing looks like a big one-and-a-half-year promotion for some kind of "BSB" band ... every guy in the school has a perfect abdomen, not fat or ugly young ... girl in the movie, not one. The main character is wet in the pool, or all sweaty in his bed ... poor guy. It must be horrible to go on a date sweating like this. 3. Can these guys do anything good with their powers? Anything good? Like putting off the fire in that old barn or helping your friend who got into the accident, instead of just running around breaking things and showing in front of the other. 4. Wood working. The main character only has two expressions on his face. Expression number one: sad. Expression number two: trying to look seductive, but still looks sad ... In the boy band there are 4 guys: the main, his best friend who got into the accident, the blonde and the room ... what was room name? I think he only talked twice over the whole movie: once in the beginning (he said that the cliff jump using "the power" would not kill them) and the second time at the end when he and the blonde lost the girl . The movie could have been made without it and no one would notice ... Anyway, my verdict: 1 is the perfect track for this movie. Guys - you will not see it. There is very little action, no suspense, no hot girls. Girls - at least the actors are very similar ... What I advise you is to make a soundtrack of this movie - that's the only thing I liked about it.
