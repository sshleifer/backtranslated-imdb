Kokoda was inspired by events at the Kokoda airstrip during World War II when the Australian militia slowed down and finally stopped a push of 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move overland and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the film is set in this time period, but it's fiction and everything that happens is just a mess of standard scenes from other war films. The first hour is just one clich√© after another. Some of the scenes are simply there to lead us to a feeling that this conflict was horrible and incomparable when there seems to be little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the runway and no mercy was shown on both sides. Both sides suffered from logistical shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. As the Japanese approached Port Moresby, their supply line grew and this eventually led to their downfall. On the other hand, as the Australians approached Port Moresby, their supply line declined. Some of the scenes seem to come out of the manual in standard scenes to include in any war film. The film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could have made a great movie about one of the best moments in Australia, the film Kokoda is a superficial disappointment.
