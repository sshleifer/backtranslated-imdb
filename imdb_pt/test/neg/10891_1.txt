There are movies that are so bad they are good. Then there are movies like Rest Stop that should never have been made because they are just terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad characters, unpleasant characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all essential flaws. Some half decent special effects are the only thing worth noting. <br /> <br /> I can not even write a screenplay, because all I want to do here is to warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother with this movie. It's 1.5 hours of your life that you will never get back. <br /> <br /> 1/10
