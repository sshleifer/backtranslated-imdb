The only time they seem to drag through IMDb reviews is when I saw a Duff movie. I think I'm looking to find the assurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a Duff movie packed with incredible characters in unbelievable situations that limped in lamely and boringly to a banal cop-out conclusion. So I check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like Jim, hanging out on a member, alienated, as the page after page of various star ratings and applause let me doubt my critical faculties. However, perhaps I should check the settings for the submission of comments, since after a while the gushing dies down and I am relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own. I feel avenged. It's a junk movie, it does not stick together and it makes up a wasted night sitting through it. Praise be to such spirits.
