What in the world! This piece of cinema game would have been suitable for the Lifetime Network. Michael Imperoli is a good actor, but I think his interpretation as "Stu" fell short. The mounts were unbearable and too much. The support cast, where are you? Whoever did the casting should be partially to blame. Cinematography was useless. A game story with an after school feel. Such stories should be left to the Oliver Stone's of the world. It would still suck, but at least it would be fun to watch. It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race started. Mario Andretti in 1982 on the Indy 500 came to mind.
