Lame is really the best way to describe this movie. He has a very poor script, dialogue and uninteresting characters and also basically everything else missing. <br /> <br /> There are many characters and the problem is that you do not care about any of them. What is missing in the film is a good and clear main character. Instead, the movie now has a little bit of everything, has a bit of a hero, has a bit of love interest and has a bit of a villain. I wish they had just a little less Ghoulies, as they are very annoying in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies are diabolical creatures, who kill for pleasure. In this movie though, all they want to do is drink beer and watch college girls naked. Also, someone had the 'bright' idea of ​​letting the Ghoulies talk this time around. This works very badly and irritating. Ghoulie puppets had definitely been improved for this movie and they are more detailed and are able to do more but at the same time they are much more fake than the previous Ghoulies movies. <br /> <br /> Obviously the purpose of this movie was more comedy than horror this time around. The film is like a bad-tempered comedy from the 80's (even though this movie was released in 1991). It's humor is the worst and the dumbest thing in the whole movie. It's so incredibly annoying and just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The story is not going anywhere with its history and the film is basically a big mess, which never seems to end. The Ghoulies plot seems basically to have nothing to do with the other lines of the movie plot, involving the human characters. The movie is by no means about the Ghoulies terrorizing a college, with humans trying to hunt them down and stop their fury. No big surprise that this is the only film written by Brent Olson so far. He simply has no talent for it and I think he figured it out too and went back to college himself. <br /> <br /> Even when compared to previous Ghoulies movies; this movie is just terrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
