Some directors take two and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch takes two and a half hours to put together scenes with "clues" and their trademark quirk, but there's never a story. No plot. No character progression (unless you find delirium revealed as "progression"). It amazes me how one can call Lynch's garbage "art," but if beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, so be it. Lynch's work in film and TV in the 1980s came out as "vanguard" and "alternative", great. 20 years later, work as "Mulholland Drive" comes out as a 2.5-hour masturbation piece by David Lynch. It's embarassing. I finally saw the movie that takes my first place as the worst of them all. At least the people who were producing "Godzilla" and "Rodan" were not going through them as "art".
