Fred Astaire is reunited with Rita Hayworth a year after his great success for Columbia, "You Never Get Rich". This was the movie that put Hayworth on the Hollywood map, but his performance in this romantic musical hardly gives a hint as to why she was so popular all of a sudden. On the way to Buenos Aires, a tyrannical hotel owner requires his four daughters to marry in age; it may be thought that cinema takes place in the eighteenth century, but no, it is today 1942. Astaire is a former player who turns to dance to make money, mingling while going through an admirer of letters. for the beauty of Hayworth's cold stone society. Fred looks at Rita with a brotherly smile, but she is so much like a mannequin (dubbing her songs as a wide-eyed doll) that all the romantic sparks spread rapidly. They dance together quite comfortably, though, and Jerome Kern's score is memorable, but not so bad. ** in ****
