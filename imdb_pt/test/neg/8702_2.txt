I realize that it is very difficult to live by the first 10 Commandments movie (which was great and personally not a fan of Charleton Heston), but wow ... this movie / mini-series was disappointing. Even the lively Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that took me away was Rameses. Compared to Yul Brynner's version, Paul Rhys's version seemed as weak and not as Pharaoh. The acting really was not that good. For a modern adaptation, I expected something better. He just did not look as impressive visually as the first. I think they were running on a tight budget or something. There is an occasional narrator whom I found strange and unnecessary. It also broke the flow of history. And um ... the voice / lines of God were kind of weird.
