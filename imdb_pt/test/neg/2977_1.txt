Even though I've tried to avoid German films recently, positive reviews have lured me to rent this one. There I am again deceived by the German media, which has repeatedly repeated domestic films. For me, it's no wonder nobody on the outside wants to see this crap. The idea of ​​making this movie is no idea (I think some idiot read an article from a women's magazine about speed dating). In short: the characters (which are none), the dialogue and the content are so incredibly trivial, trivial and clichéd, I kept watching because I could hardly believe what I saw. BTW to call the flat theses mechanically delivered by the numbers (certainly from the above-mentioned magazines) dialog, would simply be incorrect. Acting is so exaggerated that I can not remember worse than that on the screen a long time ago. You have to guess the director had / has no idea. Surprisingly, distributors and producers across the country are still wondering why German films (with rare exceptions) do not generate any worldwide interest. Because? Because it is waste of time and money.
