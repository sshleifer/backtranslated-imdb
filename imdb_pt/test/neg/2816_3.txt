While watching this movie, I never thought I would be defending. It's honest enough from the start about not having too much plot. There are no real characters to catch except the killer. Some of the performances may be better, but most of them are capable. <br /> <br /> I know, three out of ten are not stellar, but there are reviews saying it was filmed wrongly and completely useless, etc. I think I started doing what I should have done reasonably well. The lighting is minimal at times, more natural than most audiences used to do, but supposedly looks like a camcorder snuff film. In fact, sometimes the quality is probably still too high to be true, but no one would be able to spend the minutes of camera work that is really that bad. <br /> <br /> It's not particularly scary, but it's disturbing at times. There are one or two characters that do not look believable, and the soundtrack sometimes gets tiresome, but overall it was a lot clearer than many motion picture films.
