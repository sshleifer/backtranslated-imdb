This film gives a cinematographic example of the word without value. It's awful, you can forget the plot or the decent acting because it's not there. And with the rejection of any decent story or action or even the characteristic of being scary, then usually there is only one advantage to a horror movie. The appeal for those who like soft core porn. This movie does not even have it. Women show a little skin, but not really more than Xena's show. Except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a couple of poor, and I mean poor sex scenes. So in short, if you like good movies you have no interest in this movie, if you like cheese you still have no reason to rent this movie, if you like erotic and softcore porn you really have no reason to rent this film and, most importantly, if you value your time, you can not do better than avoid this movie.
