I knew ÆON in the early 90's on television and I loved it ... <br /> <br /> What did you like? The cranky style of drawing? The impeccable artistic action involved? The absurd and unimpressive communication between the characters? The whole layout of the surrounding future world? No matter what you love ... <br /> <br /> The Aeon Flux movie from the end of 2005 does not have any of that. Karyn Kusama, the so-called "director" of the film, was hopelessly overwhelmed by transporting the original content to a new movie. If you are not familiar with the original series, you will not understand anything during the first 60 minutes of the film. The story is inscrutable and the insipid characters do not develop during the film. Trying to improve the plot by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations among the main characters is not only a weak attempt to cover up their shortcomings as a storyteller, it is simply unworthy of the original concept of ÆON. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron may be an attractive woman, but she can not represent the character ÆON. Although she was tied to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical movement simply ruined the action sequences in the film. The result is a tremendous amount of shaken image cuts to cover up the sheer limp of your body. <br /> <br /> Forget everything else, it's not worth talking about ... <br /> <br /> I give 1 point to Ms.Theron showing off her boobs and 1 point for the beautiful architectural photo on the movie. That's it.
