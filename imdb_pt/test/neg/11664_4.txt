Everything you do in this world should make at least some sense. Unfortunately, too little of "Delusion" makes any sense. Jennifer Rubin is fit in her role as the main punch of hitman Kyle Secor. Secor, on the other hand, exaggerates in the point of annoyance. Jim Metzler, the diversion yuppie is very unbelievable as the beginner, revenge on quest, opponent. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she has carefully hidden, all credibility flies through the window, and the weapons that point to the final confrontation between Secor and Metzler are beyond ridicule. Avoid "Disappointment" unless you are delusional enough to believe the wrong positive comments here. - MERK
