This is a great example of what could have been a great movie and a great idea, but turned out to be very bad in the process. I was mostly tempted to get it because of the DVD cover, stupid with me, but I did anyway and I was impressed, in a bad way. This film is essentially about El Chupacabra wreaking havoc around Los Angeles and it's up to a local animal cop and writer to save the day before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists knock them out. The main reason I did not like this movie was because of major continuity errors that were hard to miss. Along with some bad acting, good lighting and nothing scary, this movie did not hit me as much as it probably should have. However, compared to other Chupacabra movies, this one certainly is at the top of the charts, just a little bit. <br /> First, the continuity in this film is very far and I mean off the shoulders and in the ditch. There were so many points where the characters said or did something and then in the next scene, they are not doing it or the change has never occurred. Case in point: the main character has a weapon, the Chupacabra attacks, he pulls a gift out of nowhere and distracts and the weapon disappears. The girl runs while he defends here with the mysterious talent and she had no weapon, so the main character is running with the girl and has the gun. Where did the talent come from and what happened to the gun? The time of day spoils. One minute is sunset and you can still see the sun and then the next minute looks like midnight. There were some holes in the plot like, why the Chupacabra was there, what the scientists were doing, what happened to this guy and why he shot the animal and he was still alive? These things bothered me and none of the questions were answered. <br /> <br /> Next on the list is acting. Boy was wooden and bad. The main character Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems a little too calm in points and too dedicated to find out what killed some dogs and when a tragedy strikes, his emotion was simply not there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty bad job. She was the author of a bestselling book about Chupacabra and she simply did not look in her role or performance. His performance was laughable and poor. Even to an author, she knows a lot about this and knows how to turn off a high-security defense system in a hidden lab. Tony Criss was fine, but he seemed a little calm for some of the things that were going on. The movie reminds me of a bad re-enactment to kill for some crime-solving show where the actors and actresses are not really so committed to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely do this when it comes to lighting or editing, but for this movie, I could not help but be hard on lighting. This got me out of the movie several times because the lighting was so misdirected. There were times when they tried to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "comic," but backfired. The worst part is at night when it's dark outside, but the scene is so saturated with light that it looks like your day. They keep switching from high intensity light to soft light to random scenes, and the lights seem so bright that the actors were half closed. It should not be so bright that there are dark shadows at night. During sunset, when the lighting was perfect, this was the only time the light was good, and it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There were no scares in this movie. There was only one time I jumped, but besides, it was not scary. There were spots that probably could have been scary, but it was so bad, you could see the Chupacabra approaching the man, but if it were dark, it would have been better. Even the creature's design for the Chupacabra was poor, it looked good, but it was a man or a small child in a jumpsuit. They did not hide his face; they showed it without any sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance. There was a good amount of blood, but it seemed unreal. This movie was not scary, that's all. <br /> <br /> In general, they have Americanized a great South American legend into a human blood eater, which the Chupacabra is not. In fact, he was afraid of people and would only kill goats, sheep, dogs and deer because he was said to hate the scent of humans. But then, would the story be? I did not like this movie for any reason, but I'll give them credit for trying to make a good movie with good intentions. I would not recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if you like indie or B movies, you should check this out. Also, if you are easily tempted by cult-classics, you would enjoy this movie. I did not see it, I will not see it again, but in a very quiet way, I like this kind of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is doing.
