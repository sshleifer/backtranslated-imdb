I watched this movie with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival and no one had a good word for it. <br /> <br /> I happen to love Bluegrass and Country Music, so it's not as if I'm unfriendly to the subject. But the problem is that deep down is a very conservative film - little more than a filmed story of Mills and Boon. A bodice of the most simple and sulky kind. <br /> <br /> It's not just that the love story in your heart, that between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric, is more than unbelievable. (Because any man would be attracted to the man-eating devourer, Lily is beyond me and, frankly, Mike Harding, as Reece seems to be just going through the motions.) <br /> <br /> It's simply that the whole movie is very tame and well behaved for its own good. There is little danger, dirt or drama. Of course there is a moment of "excitement" involving a school run by Lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is funnier than dramatic (it's so poorly written and acted). And the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the way this subplot is resolved. <br /> <br /> As for good old Reece Kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?), I beg you! Is the end of this movie believable? Matching the character that this movie had already built? I think not...
