Sometimes Hallmark succeeds - like the 10th Kingdom - but many of his fantasy films advance, and that falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been hacked (a demon [?] Shown in the trailer and advertising photos did not appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a boon. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE NOT KNOWN WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE: <br /> <br /> Either way, the film updates the story to the early twentieth century (?) and does with which Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx). fan, I expected him to say: "The Dead do not solve puzzles") 18 years old. The basic story of Hans Christian Andersen is followed: the boy takes a piece of ice in his eye, gets ill, is taken by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in his palace and Gerda will find him, having several adventures along the way . <br /> <br /> As the two main characters are older than the original, a lot of time is spent joining them and 'in love'. Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and they certainly were not passionate enough to understand Gerda's quest. By the time the main plot comes on the scene, the pace of the movie has dropped to a crawl. Unfortunately, when Gerda begins her search for Kai, he can only keep pace for an unhurried ride. <br /> <br /> There are some strange additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the beginning of the film, the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation for this is given. A polar bear that lives in the Palace of the Snow Queen is more than it seems (although this is possible because the producers realized that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be good in a Fairy Tale, but not in a modern movie). Again, this is never explained. In addition, tips that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are discarded, but never followed. The screenplay is also full of anachronisms that really take you out of the 'fairy tale' mood. <br /> <br /> The production looks good, although there is evidence of a penny: the Palace of the Snow Queen is the hotel where Gerda and Kai were covered in ice. The three main characters are touched with varying degrees of success: Kai is as tasteless as Gerda initially, but when she leaves to find Kai, you warm up with her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen, but seems to be in a different movie for everyone else. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is unsatisfactory. It looks good, but it trails and lacks magic.
