The sequel that nobody asked for the movie that nobody wanted. Obviously, there are many flaws in this movie to name here, so I will focus only on acting. Miles O'Keefe would have been more appropriate to play the Asian helper Thong, mainly because he would have no dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines displaying an emotion, blunting. Charles Borremel brings his life to life, pausing every five words. And finally the extravagant, John Saxon type ... no comment is needed. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the Barbarian" if you need to, but do not waste time with this low budget Loser.
