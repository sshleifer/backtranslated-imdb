Boring and predictable opera. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson, who is having an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is friends with Lahti and does not know about cheating. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with her baby. TO YAWN! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to admit that I paid money to see this in a theater in 1986. I enjoyed all three stars, but even their considerable talents failed. I knew constantly what was going to happen. As another poster said - this works like a long-running movie with the public. <br /> There's Lahti cursing at one point and even Moore drops once! There is also a senseless shot of topless women playing soccer (!!!). Other than that it is TV friendly. The only good thing about it was Timothy Gibbs playing Moore's teenage son and Danson. Very handsome and very good actor. That aside there is nothing to recommend this. You've seen it before ... and you've done better. It is obvious that it has been forgotten. Skip this.
