My reasoning behind watching this movie (despite the fact that it was free) was more or less out of curiosity ... light, slight curiosity ... I was not as familiar with this "biographical" direct to the video account of Mr. Gein and discovered during the opening credits that featured horror icon Kane Hodder in the lead role. My emotions shifted not just from curiosity, but now from a faint glimmer of anticipation of how his portrait of Gein would turn out. Also in credits (among some dark photos of Ed's crimes) were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought to myself. "That can be a little fun." As the film began and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as I call it "micro-hope") for this movie disappeared completely and I was stuck to an overpowering feeling of humiliation while dying a little inside watching pile of manure. Hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, loosely puts it at stake here - transforming Eddie Gein from a mild-mannered recluse to a coarse, weapon-filled killing machine. He hides in the night, killing custodians of the graveyard, his friend and teenage girls stealing graves, leaving Plainfield in a panic while the sheriff's local department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation to a minimum. The policeman and his mother have a warm relationship that gave me a confused feeling inside (or that could have been just the cyanide pill I ingested in half of this turkey). I'm not sure what the purpose of this film was, and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with. There are already plenty of films related to Gein's story that unless Ed Gein Snuff Footage is discovered, I do not want to see it on the shelves anymore. If you want a more authentic movie of this nature, check out "Ed Gein (aka in the Light of the Moon)" from 2001.
