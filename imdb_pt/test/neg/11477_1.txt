This is absolutely the worst comedy I have ever seen. It's hard to explain, because (unless you've seen it), I bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad; it's just there (this is the original part - it's not good or bad, just there)! <br /> <br /> Let me say that I've seen all the comedians appearing in a leading role, and like all of them. That's what makes it a mystery. Support leads are actually acting (though the dialogue is bad). The only character that is reasonably good is the character played by John Goodman. He does a good job with the little dialogue he has, and he actually has a funny line (I'm not going to ruin the one funny phrase in the movie, in case you decide to watch anyway.) It's a big pancake. the main leads. I will not call them characters because no character was developed. This script is so juvenile that they do not even bother giving the fictitious names to the leads. They all just use their own. They do not even seem to be trying to act. It is as if they are all reading aloud to each other from scripts that the local junior sends to them. I actually wrote an article like this for my English class when I was thirteen - it was not funny either. <br /> <br /> In short, do not worry about renting this. It's not funny. He does not even have the kind of bad dialogue you can moan. I just sat and looked through the whole thing. It was so annoying that I could not even get annoyed at how bad it was. I can not imagine how this is even getting a rating of 4 here.
