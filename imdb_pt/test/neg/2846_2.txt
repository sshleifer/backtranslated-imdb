Bridget Fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of the beautiful Hart Bochner. One afternoon she comes home, calls him "honey" and quietly fixes her a drink, only to find that he is in a bad mood. Minutes pass as she compliantly puts it with her frowning silence. Suddenly he becomes furious, accusing her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason to do so, calls her the C word, bangs her head against a closet, patting her around and throwing her from the second walk. counter, breaking her hand and a couple of ribs. <br /> <br /> She wakes up in the hospital where, it is revealed, she is deaf, although we notice that she reads perfectly. This avoids all the embarrassment associated with an ASL interpreter or having his words quacked in a mock language. <br /> <br /> All right. Let me just expose the basic elements of the plot. This beautiful and devoted disabled woman is beaten by her husband, misunderstood by her elderly mother, betrayed by her sister, has her bank account emptied by unknown hands, nearly raped by a fat man who approaches her in a bar, is believed to have murdered her husband now missing, and is being pursued by two policemen (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other seems not to like all women and is embarrassed by their presence. The end finds her alone in a deserted bus stop with a hand full of money - alone, tearful, but brave. <br /> <br /> Now, a surprise test. There is only one multiple-choice question. "This story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman". Do not sound sexist. One can easily put forward a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, escapes to take revenge and ends with the woman he loves, whom he thought 'I I lost a long time ago. <br /> <br /> The steering is functional and conventional. When Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, we see from her point of view the faces of anxious doctors and nurses looking at her-that is, at the camera-an echo of each scene in a myriad of second-rate films. that the litter is being quickly led down the hallway, and people wearing starched white coats trimmed with stethoscopes hover over the camera. <br /> <br /> Hart Bochner has played a number of bad people in an interesting way - some of the characters are stupid ("Hard to Kill") and some are more than rude ("And the Sea Will Know" ). Her virile beauty has a kind of evil hue. It would be very easy to put him as a hero. Good, intentionally smooth performance by Steven Weber as the idiot cop - perhaps the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. His scope of performance is limited, but is in full view here. What makes it an object of interest is its almost stereotyped beauty. She's like a high school prom queen. Very feminine. Of course she can not help herself if she slips or moves her hands so gracefully. Nor can she do anything about her nose. For most of its length it is perfectly normal and attractive, but at its tip there is a bulge out that follows the natural glow of its nostrils. The tip of the nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the film - Pfui.
