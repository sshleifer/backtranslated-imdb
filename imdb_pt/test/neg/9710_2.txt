This movie is just plain bad. First of all, the story is just weird and not good writing. Leaves you with questions when you're done. Sometimes okay, but not in this case. <br /> <br /> The acting is nothing to write. Adults do a good job, but children, considered children, do not do a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was worse. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure if that was the lead role. I never imagined who this movie was. Mickey or Pete. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes that stood out, but overall there was nothing interesting about cinematography. The sound, however, was better. There was a good score. A little adventure, but this did not seem like an adventure movie to me. It had some elements of an adventure movie, but it was more of a drama. However, it was hard to tell who this movie was made for. Children? Difficultly. There is a lot of language and violence for that. Adults? I do not know. He had many elements of a children's film in him. It was like an adult movie in a children's movie. <br /> <br /> The story was just weird. I do not have much idea of ​​what it really is. You were thrown directly into it without knowing anything, but there were references to something that you thought you should know all along. The fact that the children's parents were dead, for example, and that Mickey blamed Pete for it. You expected to know what happened, but you never did. <br /> <br /> All together, this movie was bad and a waste of time. There was no drive in it. Nothing to really carry the story forward. That's not what you spend Saturday night with.
