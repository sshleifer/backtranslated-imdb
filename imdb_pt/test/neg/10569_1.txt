This is terrible! It's as if someone gave a child a defective video camera and $ 30 and told them to make a movie. Even so, you would have a better and more professional movie than that. The story is so dumb you can say there is not one. I do not think the guy who did it knew what to do - watching foreign art films all day is not enough to make someone an instant director. The acting is really bad, really the kindergarten level and the writing is just awful. The only scene I did not hate was the one with the caravan crash, but even that means it was just a little less horrible than the rest of the movie. How do people get funding for these things? I do not care about alternative films, but should not they, at least, be a big pile of cow dung? I would call amateur 'Price of Milk' if it was not an insult to amateurs. That would not even be a good movie if you were drunk or drugged!
