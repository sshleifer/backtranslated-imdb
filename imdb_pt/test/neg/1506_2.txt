This movie is so horrible that it's funny, not much to troll 2 levels of joy, but funny, though. The acting is horrible, the music is atrocious and the story makes no sense blind. The story revolves around a man dressed in a horrible grandma costume killing a lot of people at a party. The scenes of death are so poorly made that they are hilarious. A girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest, but does not scream, try or defend herself, or dodge or run away. She can also stand, despite being stabbed repeatedly. Another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious. No thought seems to have been put into the plot. Grandma seems to magically move from one area to another (for example, hiding under leaves in a forest where the victim simply stands up, appears in front of someone even ten seconds behind), people kiss moments inappropriate (you could stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac) and the double turnaround at the end is totally ridiculous, it seems they just played this just to confuse people. I would advise people to watch this movie if they worship horrible horror movies like Troll 2, The Dreaded or Blood Gnome, but do not watch if you're expecting a scary horror movie, you'll be disappointed
