Chili Palmer is tired of making movies and knows he wants to make some success in music. Being a mafia middle experienced negotiator, he wants to rise in the music market. However, I know everyone is like him and making the good singer Linda Moon to record a hit will be more difficult as expected. The first part is funny and full of irony, this falls into easy jokes and has much less good times. Only the two women (Uma and Milian) are decent on their part. Most of the film is made with histrionic character, overly exaggerated (a bit is OK, a lot is disgusting) and the only one that can be saved is the gay bodyguard, which at least is consistent, the rest is very idiotic . Most surprising is the fact that the movie is not boring, everything happens so fast and there are so many things going on that you do not have time to get bored if you want to follow the movie. It can insult your intelligence (a lot!), And the movie is bad (yes!), But, well, it's not annoying.
