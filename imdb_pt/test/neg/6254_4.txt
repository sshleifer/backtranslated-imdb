CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) <br /> <br /> starring: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck , Williams Summer, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. Plot: A group of cheerleaders, along with their coach and three boys, are on their way to a game when suddenly their van breaks and they take refuge in a nearby hut. Soon, they drink, have sex and are brutally murdered, one by one, by an invisible killer. <br /> <br /> the good: some laughs, an amazing identity of the killer, a special participation of Brinke Stevens, my favorite scene THE MASSACRE OF THE MATR√çCULAS PARTY used as a flashback. <br /> <br /> the bad: I was excited about this movie, I loved all three Slumber Party Massacre because they were so much fun, and I was expecting a lot with this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with the sounds of the Scream "They just exaggerated! They exaggerated in the "We're cheeky but proud" thing and basically did soft-core porn, but with a good who-dun it. <br /> <br />
