It's sad to have to say that a movie is really awful and tries to find ways to say it. However, this is a terrible movie. Gene Hackman wasted time (and suspected himself, many dollars) in re-playing his most famous and often re-created role as "Gene Hackman." Otherwise, television actors will have the chance to become movie stars and successfully resist temptation. Patrick Swayze has a smaller part and has gone on to bigger things, for which he must be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie as a result of another person's criticism, and felt that another view was deserved. You may not agree with my comment, but now at least you've been warned.
