the usual disclaimer - I do not give 1 star ratings to movies that are harmless, bad, low budget and silly, although they may deserve this. These movies are often funny, and have a rating of 2 to 4 based solely on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary cinematic art. This film fits this model perfectly. It's a Mexican monster movie, full of verbal narratives and not-so-special effects that are extremely weak. The makeup is not that bad, and the acting is sometimes quite fun, but this movie is almost as silly as Aliens vs. Predator and the script is not half smooth (Aliens vs Predator may have a 1 of me but I want to see it again before committing). <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but deliciously complicated. If you have read this far, you should really want to know ... A group of incredibly unscientific scientists compose the main characters. Most of them are heroes - more or less - but one is (of course) crazy and quite evil. This mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (which looks a little like the Wizard of Oz can man, but has a human face inexplicably located inside his head). An Aztec mummy, discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife happened to be an Aztec princess in a past life (do not ask), is confronted with the robot by the great "climax." put the more stoic movie observer on the floor with belly laughs. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, given the budget and the total stupidity of the script, this is a very fun low-budget goof ball movie. If you like that sort of thing, go ahead.
