Okay enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is terrible (I have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you hardly hear the actors speak) Lady Bertram has the most annoying voice in the whole world. Anna Massey is "acting" in an unbelievable way. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond. Also the bertram girls are not pretty enough, and the guy who's playing Henry Crawford is awful. To say that the work of the camera is dishonest is a euphemism. I watched this adaptation over Christmas, and I think under any other circumstances I would not have been able to afford it, and certainly would not have been able to justify the lost time. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of true to Jane's adaptations. so I could not stand the film adaptation or the recent film of pride and prejudice. but look at any other adaptation instead, even Emma is better than that.
