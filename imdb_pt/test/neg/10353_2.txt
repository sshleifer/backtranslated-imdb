I watched the first episode and thought it was a very wooden presentation. <br /> <br /> I watched the original from the early days in Big Girls Blouse until the last series on Channel 7. Kath and Kim was a great documentary and it's humor is something that most people have. <br /> <br /> However, in this American version, I found it annoying, Molly Shannon is fashionable to be Kath Day, Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80's with her frizzy standing. While the Selma Blair figure hugging clothes is not as good as what the original Kimmy wore. I also thought Selma seemed to be puffing a lot of her belly, she's obviously an (Australian) size 12 where Kim should be (Australian) a size 16/18. <br /> <br /> Molly and Selma's exchanges are obviously so scripted and there are breaks where there should be no breaks or the breaks are a bit long, as someone suggested there might be a hint of laughter there during these breaks. It's as if Molly and Shannon were not accustomed to each other, there is no chemistry between Mother and Daughter. Phil was fine, he had the eccentric air around him like Kel. However Craig was handsome and not the sweet and simple Brett of the Australian version. <br /> <br /> I thought it was like watching a very bad play. The acting was practically of wood and the exaggeration of the expressions of Selma was funny after ten minutes. Especially his scenes of bad mood. <br /> <br /> In short, I think this show is a waste of time, the script was obviously dumbfounded for the Americans, who most in the picture says they prefer the original. If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why not pay producers the money to examine the original. <br /> <br /> All I can add is Magda, you're a smart cookie for not letting the producers use your Sharon character.
