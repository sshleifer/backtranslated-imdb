This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to admit I did not watch from start to finish, since cleaning the bathroom was more fun. <br /> <br /> The 'star' was the most unpleasant character I have ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, scary and unfriendly are very complimentary. <br /> <br /> It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially the star that behaves like a mentally deficient doped in one of those noisy black actors with the mouth. <br /> <br /> As horrible as it is to watch one of these can not silence black actors, watching a Puerto Rican is even worse. <br /> <br /> The name of the film is descriptive, it is the plague. This movie is a must miss.
