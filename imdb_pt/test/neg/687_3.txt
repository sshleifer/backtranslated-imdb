I have as much testosterone as the next, and Raquel Welch, at her best, certainly deserves a look; but the fact is that a cardboard clipping could do better, and an hour and a half of W showing off his considerable assets does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> Considering the cast, it is surprising that it is as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy, Harry, is as convincing as a $ 9 bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, which I usually like, seem to be sleeping on their lines; and as for Edward G ... well, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck. <br /> <br /> This movie is a mess: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 'caper' music of the 60s. If it were not for Miss Welch, I would have given a 0. <br /> <br /> Having said that, she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delightful appearance in 'Bedazzled' - and for Just for that reason I gave a 3.
