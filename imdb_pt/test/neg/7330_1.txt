well, there is not much to say about this movie. it's just rubbish. very poor acting, poor script and lame story ... well, the actress, (who does not even know her name) played main role, (not the blonde but Latin) was acting well, but the blonde who played the friend of main character, his acting level is like playing high school, just like most of the other actors in the movie. Also, zombies ,,,, very bad acting too. and, the story itself really does not make any sense. Well, if you're really bored and really have nothing to do but want to kill time somehow, you might want to watch this movie, but even then, there are still millions of B movies better than this crap. your total waste of money and time.
