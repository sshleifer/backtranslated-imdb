I watched the MST3K version of the movie, and this review includes smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie, it looked like it might be promising as a science fiction movie, but the more I watched it, the more disappointing it got. The first reason is pretty idiosyncratic - I liked the shy girl with glasses much more than the model that Wanda became at the end of the movie. More profoundly, it was the fact that losing glasses and changing clothes replaced any real growth of character. Instead of growing up in a character who could take care of herself, Wanda was so dependent on the males to do everything for her as she was at the beginning of the movie. The acting could have been better (though I got tired of cracking over Ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself!) It's not that bad.) The background was nice, but it was a bit mushy (aliens = humans with facepaint ), and could have used more explanations. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just because I was interested in the movie itself, but Joel and the bots did little for me. The movie could have been better without them. <br /> <br /> Overall (for the movie itself, not for the MST3K), a 3 out of 10. It was a movie as well, so it was.
