After a long, hard night being celebrated at the Walkabout in Islington, I needed a stimulant. My throat ached, my wallet was empty and I ended up talking to a drug addict at a bus stop trying to sell me gas. Today, I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a group of butt warriors in various shapes and sizes to retrieve a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yes, this is good. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not a genre known for great movies until Peter Jackson came up with a certain Oscar winning trilogy. In fact, the best film of spades and witchcraft I could think of before "The Lord of the Rings" was George Lucas's "Willow," a friend of the child. Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easier in this film. But I can not - it's badly written, acted badly (except for Paul Smith who is just average) and terribly put together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenarios apparently erected directly from Bedrock. Considering the source material of the comic book, it is easy to forgive the various inconsistencies of the plot. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying child, in this world or that, is disconcerting. His personality seems to pass from pampered boy to polite gentleman at the push of a button. Schwarzenegger exhibits less charisma than a field full of cows and just crosses the motions, a perfect actor for his groundbreaking role in "The Terminator". <br /> <br /> It's simple to kick a movie when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good movie at any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns her sister's death and Schwarzenegger affectionately puts her hand on his shoulder to comfort her and then lets off with the distinctive Germanic accent, "she's dead," then you know you're on a hard ride. Some smiles were raised in inappropriate places, like temple priestesses who, when sent to death in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging by the orgiastic groans that seemed to echo there. the place. If you have to watch an 80's fantasy film that was not pornographic, watch "Willow" (but never accept it as an endorsement). For the real thing, take your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he's done with "Lord Of The Rings". Trust me, 11 Oscars really means it's a great movie - unlike the bloody "Titanic."
