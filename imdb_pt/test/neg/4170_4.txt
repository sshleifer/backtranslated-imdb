Code 46 is one of those sci-fi films in which the government controls who you can love and will actually punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. Those who have and those who do not have live in completely separate territories, the powers that can remove their memories, etc. We've seen this before, but that's okay - no movie is 100% original. This kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. Unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than watching Code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe it's a comment on a dehumanized future, but it's still monotonous to watch. It's sloooow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the image is cool, but normally (along with its "evocative" soundtrack) it looks like a glorified perfume commercial. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera I find annoying. You know, two characters talk while the camera simply "floats" on one side. Two seconds later he is floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep their attention. <br /> My friends liked this movie. If they tried to make me watch it again, I probably would not, unless they agreed to pay me $ 50.
