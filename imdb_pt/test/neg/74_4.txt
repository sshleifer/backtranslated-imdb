The talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent, unfortunately, can not get any engaging idea of ​​cooking in this artificial pittance about a disobedient mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make her life work in Los Angeles despite her mother's volatile behavior. In addition to several good sequences, I did not buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically intelligent and focused to be passed on like this wicked woman), and her naturally grounded personality is a poor choice for the role. of an irresponsible father. Natalie Portman does a lot better when she is a child, and yet there is a frightening detachment in her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one she asks a guy to strip off, are wrong and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it is not a comprehensive film, nor has it proved to be an important movie. ** in ****
