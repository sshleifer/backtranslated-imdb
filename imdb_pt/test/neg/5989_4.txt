The best thing about Shrieker is the dialogue. As Scream and I know what you did last summer, this movie is aware of the conventions of this type of horror film and manages to come up with some good lines and scenes that play in those conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just annoying. The plot is your Ten Ten Little Indians whodunnit base with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will be eliminated until only the hero (ine) is defeated by evil. And that's exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. The values ​​of production and acting were good, but I had no motivation to watch until the end (although I did) because I already knew how the final scene would unfold. The ending surprised me a bit, because he managed to literally fail, instead of throwing away a bucket of special effects. Maybe the special effects budget was spent by the end.
