I've had a lot of time sitting in this movie. Unless you're really pro-adultery and like to hear people talking nonstop about your sexual exploits, I can not see how you can enjoy this movie. Wow - most of the main characters behaved like weasels in heat and their pride over their infidelities grew boring. About the only element of this I enjoyed was the disgusting scene where the character was urinating and blood was splashing everywhere because he caught a STD --- GREAT SURPRISE!?! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD movie, watch the sequel, Barbarian Invasions. Despite the unpleasant general nature of many of the characters, the sequence is VERY engaging and more realistic - it was worth your time.
