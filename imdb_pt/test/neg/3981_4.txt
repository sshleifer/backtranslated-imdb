This is a great premise for a movie. The overall plot is very original, interesting and something to think about. However, weak production, an obviously small budget, the performance of the main character, and several minor actors really hurt this would be classic. A rising producer should try to resurrect this story and give this basically half-heartedly a proper release attempt.
