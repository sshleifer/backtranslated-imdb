After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can not express how disappointed I was with this movie. Although I agree that some poetic license may be admissible, this film is in constant disagreement with the books, doing an incredible injustice to the exciting, plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the writers, director and producers of the film have never heard of Mr. Smith, let alone read his work. Smith's vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden figures, all historicity is ignored or discounted, the realism of the books has been changed to include ghost monsters more appropriate for a cartoon. And why does an Egyptian henchman speak Spanish? Geesh, no wonder the movie has been turned into a TV miniseries! Did Wilbur Smith make any contributions to the production of this film? I can not believe he did. Terrible and terrible movie. If you have read one or both books, do not waste your time or money watching this money. You will be extremely disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this film a '2' rating, and this only because of the beautiful, sometimes spectacular photography.
