I recently had to watch this for a project in a Sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie I ever had to go through. It was like a bad movie with all the "good bits" removed. Bad acting, the fake documentary, absurd plot and direction aimlessly combine to make a terrible and terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The female characters are basically just sexual objects. Consider this exchange: "He's hot." "He has a girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "Not." * The girl takes the boys' hands and takes them behind some bushes. boy comes out and sits next to the other boy, the girl walks away * "Did you hit it?" "No, I did not want to take off my pants." "You're stupid." Another girl appears when the boys are going to Beverly Hills, gets into the trunk with one of the boys, and when they are arrested by a police officer, you see the car going up and down. <br /> <br /> A homosexual pervert, a very happy Clint Eastwood, and what appears to be a fighter's mask all contribute to inanity. One of the boys gets caught by a cop, nobody cares. One of the boys is shot, no one cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said that the dialogue was practically improvised, and it shows. Simply horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
