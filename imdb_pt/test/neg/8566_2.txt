The only good thing about this movie is its final turnaround. In 97 minutes of film, we can only save a single idea, which was totally wasted in this movie, I must say! For more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clich√©s, bad interpretations, stupid ideas and revelations, complete lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all in a pathetic and non-original plot? until the last three minutes, where, FINALLY, a good idea came along! It's nothing exceptional or an extremely original idea, but at least it was a good "decent" idea, the only one the whole movie has! I will not ruin it, but I must say I think the idea with a better plot, better FX and definitely a better acting, would become a good movie. If you watch this movie and hold on to the end you will know what it is ??
