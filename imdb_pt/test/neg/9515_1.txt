When I voted my "1" for this movie, I noticed that 75 people voted the same for a total of 146 votes. That means half of the people who voted for this movie feel that it's really terrible. I saw this not too long ago at a film festival and I was really impressed with its poor execution. The cinematography is unattainable, the sound is bad, the story is cut and glued to many other films, and the acting is terrible. This movie is basically a flop of three other movies. NO WONDER THAT HAS NEVER BE RELEASED IN THE USA.
