As the other reviews say, this may come as a surprise to those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But you've seen Delicatessen, there's nothing new in this movie. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this movie arrived too late to have any interest. I do not think it's a movie worse than Delicatessen, but it's a hassle to see it now, as it would probably be to watch Delicatessen again. There's really no point for the movie, nothing that really matters or stays with you. There may be a distant resemblance to Kusturica's films, but he's actually in a different league, so you should go see his movies instead of wasting your time in Tuvalu.
