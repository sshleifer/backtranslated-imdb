Would it really be necessary to include embarrassing images of non-participants in a documentary? And why all the stupid dog scenes and then the repetition of all the same stupid dog scenes? This film begins with a great promise - to expose international politics and the wine business. It started very well and included all the right characters. But production is a mess. Points began and developed most of the way, so they never ended or were left with pending endings. Very bad camera job and disorienting and editing. They should have used subtitles for Christie's British grunt. <br /> <br /> Too cute and there is not enough fact for a documentary. <br /> <br /> Probably honored in Cannes because of US bashing (although in my opinion, there was very little of it. <br /> <br /> We left at 2:00 am - I have no idea how long it lasted more.
