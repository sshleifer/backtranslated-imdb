When I was driving home after work, I bought some movies for my four-year-old twins. I had bought this movie that my kids would like. I watched this with my kids. My 10 and 17 year olds were about to vomit. In this movie, the father acts like a tard. My little ones watched every day. One day, they threw away all of our movies. I sold the movie Omosis Jones on Ebay. My degree: F ++++++++++++++++ I'd rather be seen on the worst list of dresses. <br /> <br /> My kids now hate this stupid movie. One gets the idea that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the silent movie sounds in Japenese. I broke the CD in half when I was irritated to see it over and over again. No offense, but the performance of Brandy and Elena was the best
