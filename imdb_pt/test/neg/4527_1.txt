This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Too much talent wasted. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says that an example should be made, in reference to a nuclear bomb, I said "Please be this theater!" Do not waste your time. Nor is it worth a free rental! And where did they get those shills to fill out the comments section on IMDb? I can not believe anyone who has ever seen the original series has enjoyed this stench. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the "comedy" and made it into a direct action movie, it could pass. What the hell was the purpose of the dance scene? Also, the fat jokes and references were tasteless. This movie never missed the chance to go to the lowest common denominator and finished scenes, it seemed, as if no one thought of them. Simply horrible! Save your time, if not money, and give a pass to this movie!
