The Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a movie about a possessed young woman. Do I need to describe more of the plot to you? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two terrifying films. Classics (IMO). The Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not for a long shot. Certainly not as terrible as a low-budget copy of the Exorcist could have been. From start to finish, you have the feeling of a production "made for the Sci-Fi channel". It's one of those movies that will probably be ridiculed and ridiculed in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar program). <br /> <br /> The make-up and effects were absolutely laughable. The acting was horribly bad. There was not a single presentation that would not make me roll my eyes or laugh. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the sheriff. The script was not so terrible, but it certainly was not anything special. <br /> <br /> It seems that for most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than with the girl possessed by the devil. in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently, if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon, then all you have to do is lock them in the room. Come on. And if your daughter is possessed, do not worry too much, because all this makes them speak in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to look down and put smoke machines in their bed. Also, there is nothing to worry about. Apparently, she was possessed by a low-listed demon. <br /> <br /> There was none of the hideous deeds done by A-List demons, such as crucifix sex, painful body distortions, or even vomiting with projectiles. <Br/> <br /> Film totally laughable. It's not worth it or rent a discount. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
