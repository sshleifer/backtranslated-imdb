Misguided, miscada, obscure and endless madness due to MGM's high-budget treatment. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect that her rich and handsome husband (Robert Taylor) is not the dream boat he married but a psychotic killer. The MGM's attempt at a Hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the start by a ridiculous, confusing and ridiculous handwriting, and Hepburn's idiot as a woman at risk fearing for her life (who could possibly imagine Hepburn in fear of anything?) Louis B Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnelli that he was directing a thriller, not a musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, also of the anti-good type as a good guy, maintains his dignity in a discreet and discreet performance. The dazzling cinematography of Karl Freund creates images of mysterious beauty - and was wasted on the wrong film. Final result: "Parnell" of the Metro of the 1940s.
