*** SPOILERS *** One of the worst movies I've seen since the last few years "The Village". An insult to anyone of any intelligence. Badly written and surprisingly invented. No one, especially in Los Angeles, speaks the way these characters do. Not subtly. If the purpose of this film is to say that "we all have a bit of fanaticism in us," he does a horrible job in stating the obvious. Not only was his point of view clearly based, but all the characters in this film were INCREDIBLY STUPID. The scene of the car almost made me leave, along with the ransom, and, oh, we can not forget the WHITE Rookie DUTY WHEEL catching a black hitchhiker and ... I could go on and on. Horrible, just awful.
