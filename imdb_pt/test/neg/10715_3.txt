Fun With Dick and Jane they could not entertain on so many levels. There were loose ends with writing, for example, it seems one of the biggest conflicts was the indictment of Jim Carrey's character, DIck Harper, but writers never follow that particular conflict. Basically, the story is weak and mostly bland, but Carrey saves some scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey was not very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone might as well have been there just by his looks, because she was funny too. This is just another example of Hollywood filing franchise actors with a lousy story with no originality.
