Nothing that I do not like more than a kung-fu movie that touches a laugh. It's the main reason why I can not stand Jackie Chan (or his look-alikes). He was not always a clown, I might add. "My Young Auntie" is a martial art of the worst kind. It is a perfect example of how the subgenre was brought to the mud by silly pranks and childish behavior. Unless you're 5 years old, I really do not understand how anyone could find this kind of movie funny. But humor is in fact a very subjective thing. Personally, I think this kind of approach has caused permanent damage to the beloved subgenre. I thought the actress Kara Hui was very good here. But I had so much difficulty going through this one that I could not enjoy its good performance. If you do not mind all the nonsense, you can have fun. I know I did not.
