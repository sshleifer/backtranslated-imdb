I do not see Mr. Magoo. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not funny about it. He's not funny since the Naked Gun movies. Well, it will not take long to find out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The plot of the film is ridiculously silly. Nothing in the whole movie was funny. The first few minutes of the movie were animated to resemble Magoo's old cartoons. I wish the movie had stayed that way.
