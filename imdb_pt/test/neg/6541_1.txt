Most movies are bad, with high production values, this is rubbish without high production values. Which puts you off the big group of horrible movies. As bad as this movie was, I need to give Kathryn Aselton due respect, which, I believe, if given the proper script, could perform well. She plays Emily as the girlfriend of the perennial doofus Josh, who often refers to her as "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, Emily is a semi-believable character. which means that Rhett will soon need to be added to the cast, to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more absurd than Josh. When we met Rhett for the first time, we learned that he is "deep" because he is filming a lizard that is PROBABLE that he sees the world "uniquely!" Rhett then shows the tape to Emily and in one of Emily's few unbelievable moments, she acts impressed with this amateur lizard tape, WOW, I believe that's how she responds again without irony of sarcasm, even if slightly implicit. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, you get a warning that the camera work will be bad, we open up a tremendous close up of Josh as he tries to conquer viewers by acting like a GOOFY! oh how care free this leading protagonist is that he will act GOOFY! haha This movie could almost be a case study on how BAD movies can be (and how bad movies can get in the festival circuit, I mean, compared to most of the crap circuit, this movie probably looks a lot cool). I believe SXSW gave this movie a little prize (oh south by southwest, why you encourage them, it's just cruel). But here is where I give this movie a compliment, it is the best of the mumblecore movement. Remember all the other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting but still, it's good to be the best of something. <br /> <br /> I have not seen baghead yet, but it seems like maybe they have made a few steps forward, the preview at least made it seem tolerable, where even the preview of the Puffy Chair could not really hide the fact that it was going to suck. I got off the subject here anyway, Rhett probably is not portrayed by a professional actor, just like Josh is probably not a real actor, but the director (or brother of the director, there are some mixed messages there). I think Rhett was a companion to someone and they said "why do not you play this guy called Rhett in the movie? The fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means that the actor and the character are the same, that I am mistaken, "which I am not. If Rhett scratched the raccoon off his face, you'd probably say he was attractive. So, anyway, Rhett, Emily, and Josh team up to take the Puffy chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things happen along the way, bad performances, bad supporting actors, bad camera work, an attempt at significance. This movie would not have been bad if it had not been so shamefully pursued a deep self-importance. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is amateur, if you can see this movie without paying for it, as if it were on TV or to rent in the library, then consider looking at it, just to see if you like this style super cheap to make movies. I like what the duplass' is doing the whole make a movie with no concept, but I would like them to make a movie that someone would like to see.
