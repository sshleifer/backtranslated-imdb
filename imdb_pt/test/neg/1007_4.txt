I was disappointed with the third film in the "Death Wish" series and would not recommend it unless you're really interested in Bronson. He is your habitual self in this, perhaps a little lighter than in others; the rest of the cast is good if you watch a movie of the week on TV - the whole movie has the production value of a bad episode of Team-A and I enjoy the fun of a show like A-Team but not on big screen, even if it's an action movie that does not claim to be anything fancy. The film takes a while to continue, and when it finally arrives, it gets out of control to the point of ridicule. The plot is something out of an episode of "Highway to Heaven" and Bronson looks like a fish out of water with the cast of the majority of the elderly population and the game of weapons is so out of control that you are not even satisfied with the revenge of Bronson against the bad guys. Skip this and go to the fourth installment I recommend.
