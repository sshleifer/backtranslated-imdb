"The Puffy Chair" was a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life, which can not be recovered and spent in a more interesting way (even "The Blair Witch Project" was a better use of the precious moments of life). It should be called "The Swollen Chair," because only "swollen" chairs could accommodate the extremely selfish brethren who drooled for public consumption; and obviously they are so full of themselves that they have assumed that the audience would really like to consume their slime. "The Puffy Chair" made "The Wooly Boys" look like a cinematic masterpiece! "Valley of Dolls", "Beyond the Doll Valley", "Pink Flamingos", "Electric Saw Massacre", "Night of the Living Dead", "Urban Cowboy", "The Blob" - all of them be a better use of time, than to see "The Swollen Chair." The characters portrayed are either too predictable or too lacking in normal emotional reflexes to even come close to being pleasing or believable. Also, at one point in the movie while the characters should be in the same small town, if we look closely, one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the southern United States, and the other half is located in Maine. Is this some town, huh?
