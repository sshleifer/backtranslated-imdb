I do not usually write reviews, but for this movie I had to do it. I'm shocked by the acting talent in this movement, going to waste ... the script was terrible ... the horrible editing ... and the plot too thin. You spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what they are doing. The second half of the film slows down a bit, but it has no depth or sensation. The only saving grace is the pleasant, but still limited cgi, and the location is London. I gave 3 stars for it, and the fact that the actors still try to do a good job with the drivel they received. If you like to miss a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment, by all means, this is the movie for you. But I would recommend doing something else with your time, like watching the real archive online! http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
