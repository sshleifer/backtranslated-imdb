This is just one of the hundred million movies in which directors try to shove a lot of drama into a movie that is nothing dramatic. As in the beginning, the part where the monk-face stuck the arrow in his own hand, then shot the same arrow in the gargoyle five minutes later - meaningless. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the plot is the CGI, which would be much rivaled by a flash home movie. The actors seem to be doing their best to portray a bunch of 1970s robots; the dialogue makes so little sense that it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Many things just happen without any explanation of how or why, like a lady wandering around a zoo she had closed hours ago. And when she sees this THING flying toward you, your first reaction is to take a picture, instead of what she does ten minutes later - to be able to walk (not even run) as if her life depended on it - which obviously does not happens. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not recommended. It makes me wish they would still make new episodes of MST3K.
