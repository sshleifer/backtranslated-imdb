A boring movie about a miserable loser ... which is factotum in a nutshell. Matt Dillon plays Henry Chinaski, alter ego of author Charles Bukowski in whose novel the film is based. When we meet Chinaski he may be a writer, but he certainly is not a success. He floats through life, being fired from one manual job after another and not caring at all. The fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with the fact that he does not care. He meets a woman, Jan, played by Lili Taylor and follows a relationship. Chinaski moves into Jan's apartment and now, instead of getting drunk on his own, he can get drunk on someone else. Good times. Eventually, he's fed up with this relationship, so Chinaski appears on his own. Unfortunately he still can not hold a job so early that he is broke. At this point, Marisa Tomei appears and, for some reason, her character, Laura, decides to rescue that miserable drunken loser she does not even know. Soon we will meet some acquaintances of Laura and the film will become a kind of bizarre world with this rather eclectic side. Soon, Tomei and his friends are off stage and once again we stay with Chinaski and his drink and his miserable life. There has been some time spent with Jan, but most of the time there is only time spent being a drunken and unemployed loser. And then the movie is over and it's not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and seems infinitely longer as the movie trails. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. If you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching Matt Dillon's drink, then this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a compelling story, well-developed characters or any entertainment value, then you have come to the wrong place. Dillon's performance, in fact, is not bad. Too bad the movie that surrounds him is actually very bad.
