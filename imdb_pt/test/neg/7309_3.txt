The figure of the Empress Elizabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is in fact mainly associated with Romy Schneider and the Sissi trilogy of Ernst Marischka (1950s), where beauty, gentleness, sweetness but also history are always present. This was Sissi, perhaps a myth for some; however, a powerful portrait. The spirit of the Habsburg grandeur, as well as the spirit of simplicity and simplicity of Bavaria, greatly influenced these films. They simply had a soul. However, Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, though done 50 years later, seems to be a misrepresentation of the Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; however, it does not add much, but deprives the whole story of much. Let me look into this in more detail. September 1898, Sissi embarks at the port of Geneva. Accompanied by his court maid, she will visit Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), to whom she will tell the whole story of life to find herself in this tragic life. The action consists of flashbacks of important moments in Sissi's life, however, these moments are chaotically presented and therefore someone unfamiliar with Austrian history may be totally mistaken or confused. Much attention is given to Sissi's poor marriage to Emperor Franz Josef. The scene of your wedding night is a failure. No one treated an empress like that (I mean, take off my clothes and pay). The focus on Sissi being misunderstood is right historically, however, the points that his visions differ from the rest of the courtiers are not true. Where is her desire for peace? Where is her love for her nation? Where is your charity? Sissi seems to be quite elegant, modern, liberal (from the point of view of the 21st century). She mostly takes care of her appearance that is not true historically. Sissi had an inner life that is not shown in the film. "Since women will wear pants" is a phrase said by her and becomes the image of Sissi presented in the film. Sissi detests the monarchy, which is the film's remarkable criticism of the Austrian empire. In addition, she partially accepts the anarchist movements and, to my surprise, she blames her husband, Emperor Franz Josef, for the death of his son Rudolph. Where is there any mention in the story that Sissi was present at Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, her mother-in-law, is best shown, however the scene of Sophie's death seems untrue and the conversation a bit clich√©. <br /> <br /> Sorry to criticize so much, but another crucial aspect of the story. movie that I find weak here are performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments as Sissi, she usually does not match the role. She looks more like a "femme fa tale" than a tragic empress. Her makeup is seriously inaccurate, as are most of her gestures like the Empress. Malik Zidi is a bit better as Rudolph and can be considered as one that increases the value of performances in general. However, Stephane Audran does not do a special job like Sophie: you just do not get the impression that she hates Sissi. He despised her for the sake of Sissi's tender age when crowned, because of her behavior, lifestyle and belief. Part of it appears in the movie, but that's definitely not enough. But the biggest mistake is, I think, Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism ... here, he seems to be some sort of libertine thought just to make love to his queen. And the portrait is so weak that this performance is very very pale. The exact choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt, she really fits the role with her looks and her gestures. But unfortunately, her role does not require much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> A good point of this film are some very authentic costumes and places. The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of Sissi's death is a good surprise of the film. It does not look like it really was; however, the moment is good from the symbolic point of view ... the empress walks and does not know that this is her final moment. That's how she must have felt about it, that's how a madman destroyed a part of the greatness of the world. Another good moment visually was when Sissi talks to his son Rudolph in Corfu. But those moments are rare. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not a good movie. It distorts a very eminent historical figure, a significant historical time, tries to heal the sweetness of the Sissi trilogy, but seems to offer nothing creative. The charm is gone, greatness is gone and history is ignored! Not much to look for! 3/10
