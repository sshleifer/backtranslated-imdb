I think "Category 6: Day of Destruction" was very unrealistic. The digital effects where as a children's cartoon. <br /> <br /> The actors did not act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted as if she had tomato sauce speckled on her. <br /> <br /> The movie was annoying, but I watched it because it was turned on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tommy Tornado, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Please keep the special effects real. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: "What have we done to annoy Mother Nature?" <br /> <br /> I do not know what else to write to fill the 10 lines. What more can I say that the film is so boring, I think my commentary will be equally boring.
