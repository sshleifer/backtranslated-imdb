One of Bolls best attempts. It just shows that if you do something long enough, you have to improve just by chance. Still not good, but it's at least watchable, which is an improvement over bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is that Farcry's story was not the strong point of the game, while Bloodrayne had a strong story and therefore Boll had more chance of ruining everything. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie film is actually quite good. Occasionally an exaggerated touch, but in a good way and worth a watch just for that. Acting wise, it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are very good but you can tell they are not taking you seriously based on comparisons with other presentations. But the lighter mood this gives the film really helps. <br /> <br /> Although I think that getting a little closer to the history of the game could have made a slightly better movie, the changes made are very practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game it was hardly Oscar to win just one vehicle for FPS carnage. I would have liked the scenery in the Jungle, since it was a fairly integral part of the game, but Canada does not have a lot of jungle and is at least set in a kind of rainforest. <br /> <br /> Boll feels the need to change game plots already written professionally and directed I do not know, but it does. And until he begins to let the original material speak through his adaptations, he will always be lacking. Watch the movie for a laugh that is good for this and maybe to watch during a party as a fodder drink.
