Now I've loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," but I can not believe Shane Black wrote that stack ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I did a screening for a film festival. Horrible. Everyone was laughing. It's boring and cumbersome ... not to mention stupid. In addition, it is surprising how L.A. looks like Cambodia. The whole idea of ​​time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is kind of dumb. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I used to be the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by the director of Michael Bay's 2nd unit. The 2 stars are based purely on the value of production.
