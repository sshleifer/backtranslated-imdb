The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover but we discovered it was a photo of her from another movie. Unfortunately, she's in this very little film. You can, however, see how far she has come. The other bright spot in the film, in addition to its very small part, were some of the location scenes filmed in New York and New York. the 80's. <br /> <br /> The sound is terrible. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialogue is hard to hear. Sometimes the dialogue has been redone without any background noise, which is disconcerting. For example, sometimes when they are in the car, the car's noises are very loud and suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise. The director likes close-ups on faces and then it becomes clear that the film was exaggerated because the words do not match with the movements of the lips. For most of the movie, voices sound like people are talking in a can. <br /> <br /> Background music, when there is music, distracts instead of adding to the movie. <br /> <br /> The direction is laughable. Goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie seem like a joke, especially at times when there should be tension, as in the midst of gun battles. The writing is terrible. There are some subplots that do not make sense, and most characters look very dumb because there is no explanation for their motives. The writer / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were together in Vietnam, but none of it makes sense. These assassins and ex-soldiers do not seem to be able to see the shadows of other people or to hear other people moving. The actors go from calm to panic and return to calm again without any warning. It is simply a combination of bad direction and poor writing. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled into the student film of someone who happened to have Sandra Bullock in it. If you like to laugh at badly made student movies then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
