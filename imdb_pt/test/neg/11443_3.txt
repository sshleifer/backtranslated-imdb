I watched this movie recently mainly because I'm a big fan of Jodie Foster. I saw this movie was made right between its two Oscar winning awards, so my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately, I found the film horrible and I still wonder how she was convinced to make this movie. The script is really weak. The story itself may have been a bit believable if someone like Mel Gibson had played the role of man-killer. The idea of ​​Jodie getting away with Dennis Hopper and his annoying accent was impossible for me. I thought Jodie was great all through the movie, which was probably the only reason I watched the whole thing. Maybe parading Jodie with as few clothes as possible was the only reason the film was made. I saw a TV biography of Jodie where basically all her films were commented in chronological order, and this movie was the only one ever mentioned. After seeing, now I can see why.
