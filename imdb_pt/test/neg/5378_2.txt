Ok, sure, this movie will never win a Oscar. Citizen cana this movie is not ... BUT why every movie has to be examined? when was the last time you saw a movie that was funny, not because it was good, but because it was goofy? does anyone remember roger corman, king of the farm? <br /> <br /> Well, I had fun. I liked the cheese. Just go in not waiting to think and prepare to throw popcorn on the screen.
