One of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I was trying to watch it I had the flu and I was wide open for any brainless entertainment. Unfortunately this was too much. Like, so many totally unfocused actors can be in a movie? This movie makes porn look like a European art film. The cast just speaks its lines without emotions; Special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), who will soon be ex-wife, who talks about her divorce, like the rest of us talking about the weather. Simply horrible (and funny). With lots of drink and friends, this can just make it as a background entertainment and a few laughs as well as Ed Wood movies. The plot is a joke and direct soundtrack of a daring novel. <br /> <br /> I hope no one paid to see this movie. <br /> <br />
