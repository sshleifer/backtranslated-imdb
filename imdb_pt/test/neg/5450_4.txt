Jonathan Demme is a character-oriented director who, upon seeing him pulling a Brian De Palma (that is, imitating Hitchcock), is almost predictable when he can not raise much suspense within this lukewarm mystery. Working from a screenplay by David Shaber of Murray Teigh Bloom's novel, Demme tries to reach a point between Alan J. Pakula's paranoid dramas and thrillers hung with Hitchcock particles. Roy Scheider is a retired secret agent who is mourning the murder of his wife, who is now busy avoiding the evildoers who are about to kill him. Decola immediately, but the script is full of fragile topics and any excitement disappears quickly. There is a visually stunning climax in Niagara Falls, but Demme receives little of her cast, and even less. ** in ****
