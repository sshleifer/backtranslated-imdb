I absolutely hated this movie. Even if the film wanted to convey some kind of social message, it was made as clich√©d and melodramatic as a Mexican novel. <br /> <br /> Also the acting was terrible, especially Charityn and his son. This is one of the problems with Dominican films, they use celebrities who can not even act just to attract the masses. <br /> <br /> I am even more embarrassed by the positive reviews that unfortunately mean that the Dominicans are only being patronizing what is being done here, rather than giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry to be based on quality.
