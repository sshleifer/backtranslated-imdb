Someone decided to make a "black version" of Airplane. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to make a really bad "black version" of Airplane. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to make a real, very bad "black version" of the plane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> Someone decided to make a very, very bad black version of the airplane that went moodless after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all his time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast. <br /> <br /> This movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time. If nothing else, it deserves to be remembered for this achievement. <br /> <br /> It's not a black thing, it's not a white thing, it's just a bad thing. A very, very bad thing. Separating it point by point would be a waste of time. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple plane inside it. Do yourself a favor ... go buy a picture of a purple plane, and you'll have taken out the best this movie had to offer. <br /> <br /> This definitely goes to the category "What the! ^ @@ &!!, they were thinking ????"
