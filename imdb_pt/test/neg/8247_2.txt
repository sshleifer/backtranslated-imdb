I sat down for two hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, although it's not at the top of the list, it's in the top 250. I was a bit surprised. Even so, yes. I'm very impressed by the acting skills of Robin and Matt, they still have not saved the movie. I'm not sure what I really did not like about the movie. Maybe it's because I give up math. Maybe I'm not much to be sad for two hours. Even though I loved "American Beauty", but that was it. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I'm missing something in this movie, please e-mail me. I'm curious to know why this is in the top 250. And do not say "Because it was a good movie." <br /> <br /> 2/10
