This film gives a new meaning to the term "unequal", giving us some intriguing characterizations offset by a clumsy plot, which relies on some well-placed stingers to deliver most of the emotions. <br /> <br /> plot relates to a group of men harboring a secret that caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparition that causes death. She may also be seducing her children. <br /> <br /> It's a great spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one movie, but unfortunately they are not very convincing, particularly the scene in which Melvyn Douglas falls in love. the depths begging others to listen to him. It's no shock, then, that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially Rickie, who laughs. They deliver the worst "we're not-all-drunk" scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has some saving graces, ie the great ghost compositions of Dick Smith (however misguided they are in this film), and Alice Krige's fascinating performance as Soul / Eve. I never I read the novel from which this film was taken, but I intend to read some of the other reviews on this page. You do not need to read the book, however, to realize that this is just a shadow of the original tale. There is a good story here, but it seems lost somewhere in the middle of an exhibition that shows men having nightmares over and over and making no subtle references to the secret they all share. <br /> <br /> In the current situation, it seems that there were about half an hour of images removed from this impression, particularly near the climax. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire manages to dig a pond dig so quickly? What did Gregory Bate and the boy have to do with Eva? And while we're at it ... what the hell was she, anyway? Why did letting her get out of the car made the apparition disappear? If it was an apparition, how could he have sex with two men and ignore them? <br /> <br /> These and other questions will never be answered, at least not for this movie. Unless some restored scene is discovered somewhere, it will probably remain forever a curiosity with some exuding makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and some engaging performances.
