very disappointing and incoherent - from time to time a germ of an idea developed and was discarded on the next line - it had the feel of a film that had been cut and trimmed to try to make it work - I was bored and distracted all the time and I'm talking like a big fan of the series. Many of the jokes were not original and were tired. The medieval section lasted a long time and the acting quality was very poor - some in the small points of guests, like Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham, made more than 30 seconds of the main cast. I made it in 90 Min's. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, actually. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to take a look inside the little shed in Soho Square - which is something that everyone is always in that part of London wonders about.
