I have too few to add to what all the other reviewers have done more than clear! This movie is horrible! In addition to horrible ... In fact, so unbearable that they have yet to come to a term to describe the horror that is "Skeleton Man". If you expect your movies to have a minimum of logic and plot, you should stay as far away from it as humanly as possible. Of course, many people are being killed by this puppet skeleton wearing a ridiculous cover, but no one ever bothered to explain what he is, where he comes from or why he is so angry with the world. It looks like a cross between Skeletor from "Masters of the Universe" and the "Sleepy Hollow" knight and flees freely in some desert forgotten by God. The scenario of "Skeleton Man" is another totally retarded aspect! For almost half an hour, I assumed that the movie happened on a small isolated island, but it simply touches the continent, where extravagant roads cross the forest and power plants are located at the end of the woods! There is? Why do everyone pretend to be trapped when there are millions of escape routes? Anyway, after a couple of totally random assassinations, a special squadron of command, led by poor Michael Rooker, arrives to hunt down a monster about which he knows nothing. Really hilarious is how all the members of this squad present themselves as specialists in a particular field (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, a training instructor ...), but all die before any of them are able to demonstrate your supposedly masterful skills! The gods of horror must really hate Casper Van Dien, as he is present again, portraying a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, falls on the road, but somehow is catapulted back into the woods to die there. Okay, that makes sense ... In addition, the characters steal cool phrases from "Predator," the bonehead horse changes color constantly, helicopters are knocked down with bow and arrows, ordinary bullets make the trees explode and completely meaningless Flashbacks from Vietnam haunt Michael Rooker. I say we all join forces and vote this pathetic movie on the top 100 IMDb as fast as possible!
