About 20 minutes after that ragged excuse for a movie, I realized I remembered one of those boring people at work who are always telling really silly jokes or doing extremely dull things because they think it's funny and they're trying to entertain everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie is starring as Traci Lords, it's not that bad, but your lines are not funny and she's not the star <br /> <br /> the most horrible I've ever seen , except for Lords, the girl who plays Casey, and maybe the colonel, who seems strangely out of place. I can not imagine why a retired military colonel would like to start a SNOWBOARD ACADEMY. Do these really exist? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better spent persuading these women to make a porn feature. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has a score of 3.5, "Frostbite" has a 2.7. I'm puzzled by these two films that are between 1.0 and 1.0 percent, the FGF is "The Godfather" compared to this junk. 1/10 stars
