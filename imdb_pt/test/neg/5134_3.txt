OK, I do not want to bother anyone who liked this movie, but it was a really bad movie. The way the scenes were edited and the acting, it made me shudder at some points. I really tried to take advantage, but it was like a student movie, they must have the smallest budget. I really liked the story line up to a point and the characters were nice, but the movie in general was horrible. Also, why is it that in almost every movie with lesbian characters one of them has to commit suicide or die or turn straight?!?! This is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. I gave it 3 stars and all considered I think it was very kind of me. Just watch this movie if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
