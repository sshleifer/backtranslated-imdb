OK, I wanted to see this because I had some good reviews, but this movie was awful ... just awful. The characters were one-dimensional and nothing the actors could do could bring them to life. The story was abysmal ... The wind stopped becoming a plot device in the middle ... He just completely forgot. The visuals while they were cool were soooo long ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the floor, 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup. I do not know what this guy is trying to do ... it's like he has no dialogue-free plot and the movie needs to run for so long, so we're not going to edit scenes at all ... Foreign films are great to create without much dialogue, this film makes me think that there is no way that American cinema can do that. I want to give up watching movies completely ... Bad Bad Movie!
