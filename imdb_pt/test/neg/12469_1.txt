Basic structure of a story: Beginning, Middle, End. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure is touched, and we have Memento or Irreversible and the story is receded. Sometimes it's not just linear, like Pulp Fiction. Regardless, they all have a beginning, middle, and end. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I've ever seen that has no end. <br /> <br /> Beginning: The girl's best friend gets kicked out. <br /> <br /> Middle: The girl needs to deal without the best friend. <br /> <br /> Ending: nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Not that having an end would have saved this movie, but at least it would have been complete. <br /> <br /> It is an exercise in apathy; we have a mix of characters and they all become failures. Imitations of boring, vain, tasteless, and pale people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action within this movie: NOTHING HAPPENS. Nothing happens. Mischa Barton tries to speak with an English accent, Dominique Swain complains a lot and Brad Renfro gets a blowjob from some older guy. End of the movie. <br /> <br /> At the moment the credits rolled, I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners should feel: time periods, those precious minutes of our life, have just been wasted. <br /> <br /> The only passable point (and this is very emphatic ONLY) is Brad Renfro. He acts well. Lacey Chabert I usually like it, but I'm not lucky here. Because of the good work in other films, I'm going to forgive Mischa Barton in this farce, but I hope all cast members have been slapped by their involvement. <br /> <br /> Please, I beg you. Avoid. Make no mistake about thinking "I'll make up my own mind". My sister told me never to see this, and I ignored her, wanting to decide. That was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie. There are many that I do not like, but I never hated a movie. Until I saw that.
