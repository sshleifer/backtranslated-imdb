I expected a comedy about the NVA, but this is a parody. It shows the East German national army in a light that is not appropriate, and definitely not true. <br /> <br /> You can make a comedy about everything as long as the underlying facts do not change. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL" has shown. <br /> <br /> The NVA movie would be an "OK" comedy because the jokes are fine. Nothing special - not hilarious, but enough to live with. <br /> <br /> The point is that the movie makes a farce and a parody about the NVA. A death machine that was ready to attack the WEST EUROPE along with his friend the RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get the most from its soldiers. An army that marched to the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march also in Poland to destroy the SOLIDARNOSC. Can not you make a movie without showing a little evil, or would you do a parody on a KZ, Guantanamo or Sept. 11? Showing Osama bin Laden as a funny and screwed guy? 90 minutes on a funny Osama in an Afghan Taliban camp where he makes jokes and training his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie is doing on the NVA!
