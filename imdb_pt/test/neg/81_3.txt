Okay, so this would never change the world, and it was bombarded at the box office, but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those movies that I fell in love with as a kid (the BBC showed this a few times during the 80's and I happened to have a VHS tape of high quality on the machine - lucky, that!) and watched endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and, unfortunately, the weather has not been kind to this blockbuster. Either that or I just got out of that kind of broad, doped mood. Come on, when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughter that he gives us little close-ups with 'fun' slogans, what can you say about the cast or script? <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's ambitious, interesting, unusual and sprawling, but it's never fun. I would describe it as a children's movie with some 'adult' nuances - you can safely let your kids watch, despite the 15 year certificate. They will not get referrals from drugs, so do not worry about it. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized that I had forgotten how captivating was the title song and the trucker's song 'Everybody's Going Faster, Faster', not to mention the patriotic anthem of the city of Ticlaw. All the cast laudes laudable performances, the photography is clear and perfectly captures the mood of the various venues, and there is a real-time feel about fashion, cars, gadgets (especially the electronic drum kit mounted on the panel), interiors and pop culture references - I was more than a little surprised to hear the crazy bum on the bench telling everyone "I'm OJ Simpson!" especially now that Simpson's cool tangles overshadowed his sporting achievements. The problem is that there is almost no plot to speak, it's too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit a lot of genuine laughter. I wish I had left this as a nice souvenir.
