... But not this one! I always wanted to know "what happened" next. We will never know for sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret's baby. I'm a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more repelled by the film. I compared "Scarlett" to the original GWTW because any film that was worth following GWTW needed to be at the same quality level as the first. Rhett was chosen beautifully, though NOBODY ever compared himself to Mr. Gable. I'm also a strict fan of Vivien Leigh !! She was Scarlett. She fit the bill. No other actress in this life or another will ever fit the same shoes, but with "Scarlett" the work could have been done better. I did not think long enough to find Scarlett fit, that was obvious. <br /> <br /> Overall, something to look at, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest you write or find fiction fans yourself. This movie is not worth the time.
