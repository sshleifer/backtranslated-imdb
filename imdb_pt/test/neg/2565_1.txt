I do not know about the rest of the viewers of this movie, but personally I'm completely sick and tired of Steven Seagal's movies. When Above the Law came out, it was a great action movie. Wahoo. Now in the Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal of Above the Law. I get tired of seeing any character changes. It's the same character, hour after hour, after time. He needs change. This movie was probably one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. Calling this action movie is giving too much credit to it because there are very few action scenes and they are scattered throughout the film. I think they wanted some drama, but it was a meaningless attempt, since the film does not depict anything beyond the usual Steven-Seagal with small eyes we saw thousands of times. Get a new look and lose the ponytail is all I have to say, I definitely do not recommend watching this movie in any way, go out to eat, dammit, rent Barney goes to Vegas, but under no circumstances rent this movie on the Seagal will do a great job.
