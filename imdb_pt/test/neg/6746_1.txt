I'm still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was: 1) If it turns out that the police are dumb, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant (I certainly could add several adjectives here, but I guess my point is clear). 2) Whether to show how a malicious crook who does not know what he wants of himself can create chaos. 3) Is it to show whether a persistent detective will solve a case by just asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over until the criminal answers? 4) Or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of footage could still be called a MOVIE? <br /> <br /> This was one of those films, which in a way - did not disappoint. Since the first 10 minutes I kind of realized that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award, and surprisingly enough? this was consistent all the time. Was it stupid enough to be worth waiting to see how stupidly it will continue and end? and I was not disappointed either. <br /> <br /> Was it a full waist? YEA. What raises your question? Why did I watch everywhere? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought that was a good candidate for this, but unfortunately I had too much coffee before that ??
