This movie is not good enough for the $ 1 deposit at the grocery store. <br /> <br /> I just bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. I think he could not be too picky about his roles during that time. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was difficult to sit on. It seemed as if they were clinging to straws with a plot. The "night of the guys" had to be the most boring I've ever seen. One minute they're talking and the next reciting poetry? Even the arguments were hard to follow. Most of the acting had no depth. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they were doing with this, but they certainly missed the mark.
