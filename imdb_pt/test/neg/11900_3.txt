I rented this kind of "soft core" before, but I can honestly say, I was not expecting it to be the same type as "Rod Steele: You Only Live Until Dying" - which was both sexy and funny. He had a good script, a sincere leader, and a sense of purpose. There's also Gabriella Hall, who is hot. The reason I did not expect this movie, was because the box was missing the label "Must be 18 to rent". I was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake". <br /> <br /> Firstly, I think films should not start with "actors" rehearsing for a part in a talent agency (or where the "actors" rehearse.) In this film, see the essay "actors" highlights the lack of preparation to interpret the actual characters of the film. <br /> <br /> Ok, after discovering that this was a soft core film, I did not. <br /> <br /> t necessarily turn it off and demand my money back But the stunning way in which the "erotic" extended video scenes are added to what was probably a late-night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to move forward without the sustained quality of, say, Rod Steele. knows that they must have had some money because I think part of it is filmed overseas. I'll have to say that the lead actor trying NOT to pour the potion of invisibility into himself is one of the more disconcerting acting jobs I've seen. I saw Torgo do Manos! It may actually have been worth the dollar's rental rate (which is Gabriella Hall). Still, there are better cute movies to rent with your friends.
