Laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. But as this movie does not deserve anything good, I will use the term horrible instead. Focusing on the adventures of a band of ecological warriors investigating the military's nefarious actions on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget quickly becomes apparent. Michael Pare (a true actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) takes the pack of idiots to a series of scenes of persecution to monsters and victims of misfortunes. There is a vague attempt at pseudoscience to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer as much as the performance. As if that did not insult enough the viewer, the film also presents what I will call "endless ammunition weapons." I've never seen Mickey Parrot or his partner kicking aside once during the entire movie but I can positively report that they complete at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon. Forty rounds may not look like many, but we're talking about normal weapons here. I figure 15 round clip, tops. And remember, they never change clips, nor do they seem to carry extra ammo. <br /> <br /> It's stupid like the one that consign movies to the eternal fire of celluloid hell, and rightly so. The third-rate CGI does little to help matters, and acting is better than being ridiculed, otherwise you will begin to cry. Because the SciFi Channel produces this porridge again and again, nobody knows. <br /> <br /> My advice ... give this one ample space ... a broad bed!
