I'm a fan of Ed Harris' work and I really had high expectations about this movie. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a big plus for a director, but if the script is bad, what can you do? I really think Needful Things is the worst film in Harris' filmography and getting involved with it was a big mistake. Anyway, I've seen much worse movies in my life, but Needful Things was a disappointment because of the waste of talent. The story as a whole seems unbelievable and false. I do not know if it's because of the book, because I did not read it. But if the script was so bad, I can not see the reason for the recording. Perhaps it was the commercial success of King's books, or the need for low-quality films for the VHS era of the 1990s. Whatever the reason, however, this movie was a lousy choice for anyone involved.
