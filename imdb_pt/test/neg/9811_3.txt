Slaughter Trail is a western B with some great pretensions. But this is in Hollywood history for a very ignominious reason. Watching this movie with its soundtrack that can only be described as arrogant, I get the feeling that Howard Hughes was trying to recruit a Cowboy singing for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt, who was a cowboy hero as reliable as he ever existed, but he was not a singer. I think Hughes saw the money that Herbert J. Yates was raising with Roy Rogers in the Republic and decided he would get one too. Terry Gilkyson, who was an excellent performer and a much better song The writer was recruited and sang some of his materials that were not his best and, worse, seemed to have been embedded in the image. But worse than that, there is this annoying refrain that sang a lot of history and, frankly, outperformed the actors, the extras, even the horses. Needless to say, Terry never got to be a singing cowboy. But he wrote classics like The Bare Necessities and Dean Martin's greatest hit Memories Made Of This. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to a woman within a steal of a jewel of diligence. That's right, the outlaws who are Gig Young, Myron Healey and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Gray on the bus as a passenger, and they get news that brings some valuable jewelry. <br /> <br /> It's a great act that Gray and Young take out. Young takes her away from the carriage to presumably a fate worse than death and they make the scene properly within reach of the passengers' voice, but what he does is give him the jolt. The last place the authorities can look, if she does not get away with it. <br /> <br /> But when they run away from theft, they are on tired horses, so they stop at a cabin to pick up some substitutes and shoot three Navajos. who object. This puts the Navajos back on the warpath, it did not help that one of the casualties was the brother of the chief Ric Roman. <br /> <br /> This is the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy at the fort has to face when the coach and the bad guys get there for protection. How everything works is predictable, but in a gaudy and overproduced way. <br /> <br /> In fact, that's the problem with the Slaughter Trail. It's a simple, no-frills western that turned into something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason why Slaughter Trail went down in history is that this film apparently marks the official start of the blacklist. Originally Howard DaSilva would play the role of Donlevy and could have completed his scenes when Howard Hughes officially dismissed him for communist sympathies. His scenes were completely re-filmed with Brian Donlevy in the lead. Whereas that fiasco this movie has turned into, I'm not sure if Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked in his private preservation.
