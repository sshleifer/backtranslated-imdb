Loving Andersen's fairy tales as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries about this strange, though brilliant, author, I eagerly waited anxiously to see this movie made for TV. Unfortunately, the experience was nothing more than a disappointment, leaving me with anger and confusion. First of all, the story / script is filled with vagueness and frank fantasies, and thus creating an almost completely new story, while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, supposedly to sell the crap to suckers like me. Secondly, the handsome boy actor (actually ... have you ever seen a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew can portray Hans Christian as a mentally retarded rather than the brilliant but very disturbed character he really was. Although annoying and irritating, as Andersen, Brew is losing the charisma needed to create any sense of compassion ever before. In third place. The love story between Andersen and the fictitious Jetta (who should actually be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin) ... Why? This man lived such an interesting life, should be enough as the basis for a great movie! <br /> <br /> I could continue to be a very long list, but I feel it is safer simply to recommend to all of you spend your time and money on something else.
