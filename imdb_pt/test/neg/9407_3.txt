I'll leave this to my bettors, uhh, better here to gawk and gawk at this wonderful and wonderful movie, and just to say that I thought I was stupid. The great thing about this site is that you always have a variety of points of view, and look for them, by all means. Do not tell what you're going to get out of the movie with. To me, those who have seen through the simplicities and mischief of it have my money. There was one, perfect when he pointed out the two great moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Other than that, well, what a waste of time. Totally Pacino is only doing the same thing over and over again, he would have been better served by knocking the performance down to about five levels at his protégé level. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Of course they all could have been. But most of them should never have been made. Including this one here.
