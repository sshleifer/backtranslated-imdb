As one of the victims of the Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say horrible? The script was so weak, using cliché after cliché. It seems the writers have coupled this story along with some articles about Enron. Watching the movie, we honestly managed to complete about half of the lines and thoughts of the one-dimensional characters. I realize that this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book so bad? I do not know what to say. Just terrible. The best thing about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth really donned her clothes. Also, this movie gets a big Fat F.
