This is a horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever on Calvin Levels and a weak script. The characters were terrible, and have almost no action, and even Chuck Norris stinks at it! Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting, plus Norris seemed bored with the whole thing and I do not blame him as I was too!. Calvin's levels gives one of the most annoying performances in an all-time movie, I could not bear it as I was tempted to rip the tape from my VCR, plus Norris and Levels had no chemistry together! If you are looking for some great Norris martial art moves, do not approach this, however, if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, hardly any action and bad acting will seem further! This is a horrible movie from Norris, with one of the most annoying performances of Calvin's levels, avoid him like the plague! The direction is incredibly bad. Aaron Norris does an incredibly poor job here, without suspense or excitement, and keeping the movie at a boring pace!. There is a little blood and violence. We have 2 bloody impalaments, heart plucked, body exploding and some gunshot wounds. The acting is very bad. Chuck Norris is not amazing as he is usually here and seemed very bored here, his linings are an apartment, and his acting was not so great and I'm a big Norris fan, this is his absolute worst! (Norris still rules!). Calvin Levels is INCREDIBLY annoying here, his tearful performance was severely irritated, I was so hopeful for him to get well! But unfortunately he did not. Christopher Neame is very weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he acted very well!. Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and did well with what she had to do. The rest of the cast is terrible. Overall, please avoid this, it's not worth the torture, even if you're a big Norris fan (like me). BOMB of 5
