I saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie. I do not understand why it's called a monster movie. The movie is a drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the movie was about relationship problems and people thought a woman was crazy because she saw a spaceship collide with a giant inside for an inexplicable reason. The action began a few minutes later. Since the woman was killed, this is not murder? Could they have done nothing but kill her? If you watch this because you expect it to have action because it's labeled as a monster movie, do not watch it. It's not a monster movie. It's a drama.
