Have I rarely seen a movie that deviated so much from the original premise and still remains (more or less) acceptable ?? Bloodline is a fairly short break (which is a good thing in this case) that focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Who wanted this done and how it cast a spell on the entire lineage of the man who eventually created it. We are introduced to 3 generations of the Merchant family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in the eighteenth century Paris, one these days and the last in a future galaxy far, far away? Opinions about this plot may differ too much - or you think it is too dumb and improbable or original and daring. The initial atmosphere and scenery of Clive Barker have completely disappeared, but the morbid remains that surround it and several sequences are still very frightening and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline contains a lot of exquisite massacres and the charismatic presence of Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is still an extra horror value. Pinhead ?? accompanied by a pet puppy this time? Do you still know how to kill? Too bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly. The best aspects in this production are the newly introduced 'cenobites' and the occult portrait of Paris. The giant turns are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to the initial masterpiece of Barker. <br /> <br /> Although not highly memorable, Bloodline is Hellraiser's latest movie. After this sequel, the series went down completely. So far, 2 more sequels have been released (2 more are still in progress) and none of them are worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered with a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee ?? Meaning he does not want to be remembered as his director. Who could blame him?
