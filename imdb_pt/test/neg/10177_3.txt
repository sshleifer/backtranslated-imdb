My wife saw this movie in the hallway of a local video store. From the cover, it looked like a science fiction movie, but by handing it over, my wife saw Rebecca St. James in the movie, realized it was a Christian movie and suggested we watch. We are conservative evangelicals, but we also know that "Christian" movies have a bad reputation in the mainstream. However, we decided to give it a go. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some things I liked about the movie. The musical score - much of what was orchestrated - was very good. The cinematography was also very good considering it was a low budget film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, any virtue in the production work of this film was lost in a regrettable script. The film begins with an interesting premise - abductions by UFOs - but in the middle of the film, the plot unfolds in an evangelistic crusade headed by the two main characters of the film ... which then transforms into a treatise on the rapture. At least "The Visitation", inspired by Frank Peretti (which was in itself a deeply flawed film), had a game end that united the premise of the film. "Unidentified" does not even come close to where it started, which is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> What about acting? Supporting acting ranges from decent to terrible. (Rebecca St. James does a small part and is passable.) For its part, some of the main characters are well-equipped. Unfortunately, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities, so they are unbelievable. The "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two Christian viewers think the most vocal Christian character in the movie is the most annoying. <br /> <br /> A final note about the evangelistic tone of this film, which will be of more interest to Christian than non-Christian readers. In a word, it's embarrassing. Other Christian films, such as Carmen's "The Champion," and Peretti's "Curse of the Cry" have managed to convey a genuine and inflexible portrayal of the Christian faith, without sounding like preaching or oppressing. This film, on the other hand, is a sledgehammer who looks so heavy and tactless that a non-Christian would find it difficult to take him seriously. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and I applaud the efforts to create a good Christian film. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. If your church is looking for a display of a good Christian film, consider "Streets of Mercy," the aforementioned "The Champion," or (if you are Pentecostal) the provocative "The Apostle" by Robert Duvall. <br /> <br /> What about "unidentified"? Rent it, if necessary, but display it before showing it to a non-Christian or larger audience.
