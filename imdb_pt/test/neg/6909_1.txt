My boyfriend and I decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie that was worth watching, even up there with "Cars". In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was horrified. To begin with, the cows, which should have been females, had male voices. So I realized that they really should be expensive. I put the transvestite cows aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind, but it was so tacky that I could not help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took forever to get to the point. I was having trouble sitting down and I'm 19 years old. The kids in the theater were actually getting up and going up and down the aisles. I felt like joining them. But my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drink references, not to mention that cows / bulls actually wired and stole a car, then drank and drove, invaded a boy's house to push him out (he deserved it), then ran away from the police, whom the movie writers made look terrible. This is not the kind of thing I would like my child to be exposed to. There's a lot of that in the real world, if I wanted my son to watch the guys drink and drive and lead cops in a chase, I'd put them in front of the 10 o'clock news. Children's films should be an escape from reality, not an escape from ridicule. What happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast? That's why Disney's old films, such as Beauty and the Beast, The Lady and the Tramp, The Little Mermaid, etc., are classic. If you want your kids to see a great cartoon basically with the same plot as "Barnyard," rent "The Lion King." You can have a great story without the terrible references about drinking and driving and grand theft auto. The writers of "Barnyard" were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a children's movie that a father might like too, but they did it in very bad taste. I would never take my kids to see this, and I suggest you save your money and watch something else.
