First: a warning. <br /> <br /> Recently I saw this movie on DVD in the Universal series 'Hitchcock Collection'. The source impression seems to be in immaculate condition, but the image is a bit bland, suggesting that it may be a second generation copy directly from the video. The framing is very tight, so all the compositions are terrible. Even the title of the movie is cut. I gather from other reviews of IMDb that there is a much better version available. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. In his long interviews with Fran√ßois Truffaut in the sixties, Hitchcock gave a comprehensive overview of all his work, but all he can say about this image is that he did it as a favor to Carole Lombard and that he did not understand the characters, just photographed the screenplay of Norman Krasna. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is not much that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> It's a crazy comedy of the same cast that Happened One Night, Its Girls Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typically grumpy wife who discovers that her marriage is technically invalid, falls with her husband on the simplest pretexts, and spends most of the picture as "adorably" irrational. <br /> Robert Montgomery not well enough to put her husband, but it's hard not to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the movie, the audience is saying, "dump the silly cow, she's not worth it." <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom she gets involved. He should be a Southerner of the "old family," although this is not obvious from his accent and only becomes apparent in the drunken scene (which he otherwise plays very well). He is an honorable gentleman, generous and abstemious, so of course he is bullied and sponsored by Robert Montgomery and is the subject of many of the jokes - although he is not as ill-treated as Ralph Bellamy's similar character in His Girl Friday. This movie seems to have been made by people who only knew the comedies by reputation, but they had not seen one. For example, a good crazy comedy has a strong central idea with several comic topics in progress that continually interlace and overlap. Here, all comedy elements are just tied up, like beads on a necklace. This is the crazy comedy by the numbers. <br /> <br /> It's the same with the steering. Usually, these comedies run at an ever-increasing rate that approaches hysteria at the end. Hitchcock does not understand that. Its direction is a little lethargic and the image becomes an imposing succession of scenes that seem a bit over-written (but undernourished) and a little too much. He has never been a particularly good director of actors, so he just lets the cast move on. They are well. Hitchcock had a good sense of humor, which he often wore in his thrillers, but he did not have the slightest sense of comedy as a genre. His later problems with Harry were also a flaw, for reasons similar to this movie, but at least he was involved in this picture. Here he is just going through the motions. <br /> <br /> All the people attached to this movie were good solid professionals, so it's not especially bad. It just seems a bit derivative, overly familiar, too long, and ultimately flat. <br /> <br /> Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just for fans of Carole Lombard and the finalists of Hitchcock.
