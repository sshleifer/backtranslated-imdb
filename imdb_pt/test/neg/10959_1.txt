I watched this movie a few months ago, when it first appeared on the shelves of Blockbuster. It's officially the only movie I wanted to undo by watching. Let me start by saying that I like "B" movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" One of the best comedies of all time. I will also note that I am a writer and that I met the director / writer of this cinematic marvel. Evaluating the performance: If I were to pick a positive point, I have to point out that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in it. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer, not an actor, so let's forgive him for his death. Why does not he shoot the shotgun he's holding once? Expenses? To highlight the poor performance it would take pages, so I'll stick with the selfish leader, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (who seems to be a chosen name from a comic book because it sounded cool) has maximum face time in this film, probably because he was a producer. His appearance is quite good, but his delivery evokes memories of SNL ripping novels. I suppose he could do as much with what was written for him, but part of the fault is definitely his. <br /> <br /> Special Effects: It's not my specialty, but for a low budget film I suppose makeup and gun play was acceptable. It did not bother me, but it did not impress either. <br /> <br /> Writing / Directing: Oscar's best screenplay is not something I can predict Gerald Nott winning. It is not just the rudimentary plot, but the dialogue is flat and flushed. I mean stylized hokee-ness, but that was just a bad writing. What bothered me most was the robbery. Nott stole scenes, shots, and Viggo facial hair from a number of other films. The scene where Russel Crow is walking the wheat field on Gladiator, entire sequences of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, that kind of thing just does not cut me. I will choose not to comment on the shooting because I do not know what it takes to establish a good shot, etc ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not rent this movie, nor pirate it. It's too bad to waste time. Good reviews can be totally false after meeting Gerry. It seems more likely that he's posting themselves.
