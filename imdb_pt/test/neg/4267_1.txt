I find the criticism of many IMDb users a bit harsh and in many cases I think they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not that of the guy on the street who wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all. <br /> <br /> In this case, however, I must say that it was BAD. I'm a SciFi addict and there was NOTHING in this movie that grabbed me for a second. <br /> <br /> There was no proper plot. I may be an idiot, but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT was that was so worried about those pieces. <br /> <br /> The main character's pathetic attempt to put these 3 pieces together is scary. Half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. A 3-year-old would have been able to put them together. <br /> <br /> This movie was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
