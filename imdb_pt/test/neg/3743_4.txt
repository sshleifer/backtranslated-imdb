The fact that this film is of low quality is a real shame, but in the 1940s this was the only kind of movie made for theaters that cater to the black public because of segregation. So while MGM, Warner and all the other big studios were producing extremely polished films, small studios with tight budgets were left to mess with what they had. And seeing this movie, it's obvious that a lot of energy was invested in the film, even if it's a really bad movie, aesthetically speaking. Some of the actors were not particularly good (especially French), the scenarios were minimal and the plot totally silly, but the film also had good music - from varied styles, from Classical to Jazz to Rhythm to Blues. This is thanks to many talented but practically unrecognized black talents. <br /> <br /> Now, as for the plot, it was totally stupid and silly, but still watchable in a kitschy style. I loved watching Tim Moore ("Kingfish" from the TV show AMOS 'N ANDY) in the drag, as he made the ugliest woman in movie history (this includes Frankenstein's Bride and many others) - this is probably due to the fact that when not to drag, he was a very ugly but funny face. If the man who pretends to be a woman actually looked remotely with a woman, I doubt that this movie would have worked well. Seeing this ugly, rubber-faced man with a cheese wig STILL being fervently sought by three suitors was very funny. <br /> <br /> This is not a great film, but from a historical point of view, it is fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what America was like for blacks at that time. A very interesting and funny time capsule.
