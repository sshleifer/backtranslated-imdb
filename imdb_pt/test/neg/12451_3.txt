This is an adaptation of a work by Edith Wharton, whose writing is incredible. Unfortunately, this film never shakes the feeling that these twentieth-century movie people do not capture the nineteenth-century repression and desperation that Wharton's play represents. Ward and Dalton are not so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me shudder. She should be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole length of the movie, and I never believed a word out of her mouth. When she asks Sela Ward "Why can not I move you?" near the end of the film, I could not help answering: "That's why I've been asking myself for the last hour and a half !!!"
