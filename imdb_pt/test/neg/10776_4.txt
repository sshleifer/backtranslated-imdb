I seem to be disagreeing with many people here. but I really did not find this movie as scintillating as the reviews I read complained. Undoubtedly, it was a moving story and the history of the partition provided the scope for an epic. but the movie was disappointed. especially for neone who saw 'gadar'. Although the lead is played by the sunny sound and the incessant songs, I must say that gadar is the best of the two. the story being pretty much the same. The partition failed to create depth in its characters, as well as the scenes that should have an impact. with the kristin kruek accent and the small image, which in itself was not an easy job. the characters just did not look real. Not that I'm criticizing the performance of any of the leaders. it just did not work. the atmosphere was well elaborated, but the film really lacked substance. not that I'm a difficult rambo fan, but some action rumors have seen the movie, or some character development. everything seemed a race to the end. and the end added to the viewers' dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I must say that at least it was a good effort in the director's seemingly unknown territory. and if you did not see the gadar then mite anyway.
