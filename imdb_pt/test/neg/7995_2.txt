Terrible action movie in which Franco Nero trades his cowboy hat, gun belt and the coffin he dragged in DJANGO (1966) to an all-white Ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it! Despite the almost uninterrupted action, the film is completely clich√©d and unintentionally funny - with an exaggerated villain in Christopher George. Susan George (unrelated) is the attractive woman with a washed husband, Nero's wartime mate, whom villains try to push out of their oil-rich land - but the latter did not rely on Nero's martial arts (and stuntman). fitness). The solution to their problems is to hire a similarly skillful Ninja for them who happens to be Nero's mortal enemy (played by Sho Kosugi, who appeared in two more sequences and is currently involved in another!). The climax takes place inside an arena where a man's army Nero "kills" George and what's left of his gang from previous clashes; The subtle way he dispatches his enemy, however, is effectively made.
