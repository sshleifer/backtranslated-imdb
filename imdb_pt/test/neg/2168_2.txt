I understand that this was Llyod Kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the pits. The whole movie is dubbed since the audio roll was rubbish. The voice overs were just as bad and terrible quality. As much as I love Troma, they tend to be a little heavy on their voice over work. The acting was terrible. One thing I liked about this movie was the quick appearance of Trey Parker making the joke of the aristocrats with a goofy wig. There are many great directors in this film like James Gunn and Eli Roth (Lloyd Kaufman's friends). Again I think this was Llyods' attempt to save a low quality movie and try not to lose thousands of dollars. I'm not going to continue, but this movie was a mess. Check out other Troma titles.
