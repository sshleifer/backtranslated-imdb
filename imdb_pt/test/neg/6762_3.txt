I once heard this movie described as either you will love it or you will hate it. From reading some of the other reviews and ratings, I would venture to say this is true. I'm putting myself in the crowd hatred. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This movie is bad on all three fronts. Exeter of Earth Island (Jeff Morrow), returns to his science fiction / b movie roots as Dr. Les (less giant head prosthesis). The doctor and his assistant Arnie (George O'Hanlon - also known as George Jetson's voice), along with Les's girlfriend's assistant, Vera, are tracking a meteor. This is the crux of the cast and it's almost a double date. Les has Vera and Arnie has his "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Equometrist Integrating Equitensor - also known as the computer). Let's just say that the relationship between George and his robotic maid, Rosie, (and her relationship with "Susie") is more convincing than the cold, soft feelings that Vera has for Les (and vice versa). The object of all your interests is not a common meteor. It really is an art nouveau / art deco alien energy storage device that moves like a 3 legged dog. There is also the little alien "energy" that controls Dr. Hubbel (aka chief scientist). The alien is obviously and from the outset malicious and evil. Is this the kind of science we are distributing? No wonder the Explorers' aliens were afraid of us. While watching some of these movies, we shoot first. No need to ask questions later. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is synonymous with watching some very boring scientific experiments, like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery. It's not the fact that this is a low-budget science fiction movie or it's a little bit extravagant and outdated. It's very, very, very annoying. The whole movie is about trying to figure out what's going on. It is. Most of the things we learn about what is happening is through monologues and self dictation. Now add low-quality dialogue, cardboard and cheap sets and you'll get the ingredients from a clone of Ed Wood (by the way, Ed made some really annoying movies too - please avoid the Orgy of the Dead). The dialogue ... oh, the dialogue. Jems like: "... less than 2 miles of ocean?" Why not ?! It came through a billion miles in space. " <br /> <br /> "Do you think you will be able to respect a husband who has probably drawn the scientific weight of all time?" <br /> <br /> This movie is obviously trying to pull a Forbidden Planet, This Island Earth, Magnetic Monster or in the same light as the Outer Limits, Twilight Zone. That is, a low budget science fiction movie (or TV episode) that is attractive enough to overcome technical difficulties and strange situations. In the background, these films are pleasing on some level (the story, the underlying meaning or the sheer comic nature of dialogue or situations). This movie does not have any of that. It's only 90 minutes of boredom. I could not even take it at the Ed Wood level. I would definitely recommend skipping this and seeing one of the movies I mentioned above instead. It's so bad, if my name was Dr. Forrester, I would never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except Frank, maybe.
