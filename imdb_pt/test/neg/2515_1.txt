How do you dare? Adam Low, without apparent shame, puts his name on this false tribute. It is not even a serious study, analysis or commentary on the great work of Visconti. Yes, it is long and portentous, yes, we have some wonderful clips from the movies that most people interested in the subject have seen. But what resonates the longest leaving the most lasting impression is gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a third German actor, talking loud and delirious. The appropriately named Mr.Low directed this, hoping, I imagine, to get better rankings than his earlier documentary, more direct to the point, but deadly annoying about Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you, Mr. Low and your companions. You missed a great opportunity and I, for example, will not give you another chance.
