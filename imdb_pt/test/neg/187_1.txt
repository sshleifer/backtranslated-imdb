and I still do not know where the hell this movie is going? I mean really, what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating Sean Connery's complete lack of arabic? Is it about showing that if he could play the role of a warlord in Moroccan, then he was natural to play the role of Ramirez in the Highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt really in this movie? Why was there so much sand that it was so little used? Where was there so much tapping table? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy with whom he was shooting with bow and arrow? Did he realize that the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether he was raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), raised in Louisiana Bay (Universal Soldier), or having a French mother raised in Indochina I can not even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?
