I loved all the dogs go to heaven so much that I went to see the sequel in the theater, and I do not remember being more disappointed with a movie. The story is worse than an old manure bag. I mean, come on! How could Carface imagine being able to take revenge on an animal far greater than himself, no matter how angry he was. Also, portraying Satan as a cat?!?! How clich√© can you get? So much for the story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback did not touch him with a 10-foot pole? The animation was absolutely unhappy. The colors have been washed and I can not count how many times I have been able to see through objects that should be solid. It had to be the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated movies, but not from this PUMP!
