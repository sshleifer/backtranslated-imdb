The plot of the film is quite simple: a viral outbreak has transformed the population into flesh-eating zombies. Those who left became "hunters." <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is not the worst zombie movie out there. Among the worst are "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". <br /> <br /> In fact I think the idea of ​​"Quick and the Undead" was very good, just performed poorly. Considering the budget they had to work on, this movie looks pretty good. I was not bored while watching. Special effects were solid, although they used CGI once (fat zombie being shot in the head), but the rest (gore, courage) was very good. Acting is horrible however. Our main guy looks like the young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" nor worth mentioning. As far as the plot is concerned, they have not worked enough in the development of the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: acting with low budget. Good: special effects, idea for the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie deserves 4/10 of me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a WESTERN ZOMBIE, so watch this movie.
