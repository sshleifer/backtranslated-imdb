Weak tale of an evil wizard who is looking for a secular satanic Bible so he can make the offering of Lucifer undo creation. Hot in pursuit all the way is a 17th Centruy bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant companion Kassandra. Sounds like a load of bunkum? IS. <br /> <br /> This comment by writer D.T. Twohy receives the superficial treatment he deserves from director Steve Miner (who directed that romantic nonsense "Forever Young"). Twohy obviously does not know anything about the real evil. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands just flies and laughs, trying to look bad, while Richard E. Grant can only waste his rich talent. Lori Singer's career also plummeted with this. <br /> <br /> The special effects team is amused, and Jerry Goldsmith provides a higher score than the subject in question.
