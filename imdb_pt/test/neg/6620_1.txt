There is a reason for the Chairman of the Board to have a 2, (which is very high) this movie is one of the worst movies of all time and I saw my share of rotten movies. Chairman of the Board of stars two of the most annoying actors / people today, the carrot and Courtney Thorne Smith. The Carrot Top is no funnier and was not in this piece of crap. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just watch "According To Jim" and you'll see a fine example of what I'm talking about. Chairman of the Board received 1 from me, because this is down since you can go it is so bad. I'm a bit shocked that this piece of junk is not in the IMdb 100 background somewhere, I'd put it in the top 5 on that list, but it's slowly working there.
