Today I had a real desire for a science fiction movie and then I decided to check out Battlespace. Unfortunately, that was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that the director, Neil Johnson, has directed more than 500 video clips, and I suggest he go back to that. Video clips are a perfectly good form of entertainment, and not everyone can make movies. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is probably the narration. And that says a lot since special effects are terrible at times. Voice over did not work in Blade Runner, and it does not work here. The first hour is spent watching the main character walk through the desert while his daughter tells the story. I think the story could have made a great movie, but not like that. <br /> <br /> The second worst part is the effects. They are simply bad and do not mix with the rest of the image, so you just do not believe them. And absolutely every picture in the movie has been filtered, not in a good way. The filtering used as effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad. <br /> <br /> And what is this with all the talking devices all the time, and do not shut up!?!? If I had used technology like that, I would have gone crazy. I was just waiting for the guns to escape: "I'm sorry, but it looks like I ran out of ammo." No, stay away. This movie is simply not worth the time.
