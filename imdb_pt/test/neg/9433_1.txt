Meet Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a young nerd booker contented with his boring life numbers for the Mafia and living in an apartment in the basement of an old people's center. His only recreation is to watch TV and the occasional encounter with his peculiar colleague prostitute, Honey (Janeane Garofalo). But one day all that changes, when the boss of the Mafia is murdered and the well-respected Cosmo is chosen by the new, good and persuasive boss, Gordon (Robert Loggia), to become a full-fledged assassin. It is an offer that the reluctant Cosmo can not repeat, can not refuse, and swiftly exchanges his solitary, mundane existence for a revenge course under the tutelage of veteran mobster Steve (Peter Riegert), a relaxed, suburban bon vivant who appreciates the salary maximum working hours and minimum hours. At no point does Cosmo surprise himself and his mentor Steve, displaying an absolutely awkward aptitude for the job. Although he has never touched a gun before, Cosmo proves to be both a sniper and, after an initial wave of moral hesitation, a killer. Soon, Cosmo is dispatching impassive customers with speed and style, and his natural talent with a weapon quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to Gordon's mob. <br /> <br /> Reality intrudes when, one night, while massaged by Honey, Cosmo admits to feeling a little tense and she recommends that he try yoga to relax. Cosmo follows his advice and joins a yoga class nearby, given by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is immediately taken with the gentle and gentle Jasmine, who soon becomes attracted to Cosmo. Now, if she can just get rid of her traitorous and abusive boyfriend, Randy (Josh Charles), maybe she and Cosmo can actually start something. Cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new craft, eventually convinces Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine take off. Writer / director M. Wallace Wolodarksy, twice awarded the Emmy. winner for his work on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons," has created a screenplay that unites his three genres: "I like comedies, gangster movies and novels," Wolodarsky explained. create that movie. "But what he invented is such a disjointed and improbable movie that sounds like a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live, and its monotonous tone does not go so well with a sense of humor as the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for Jason Priestly to break the image of his cool guy who does not even have full success because he plays his character not as a nerd but as a laconic zombie. But Cold Priestly interprets his character as mentally deficient, almost anti-Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" does not have the sense of scope to really be anti-Forrest Gump. <br /> <br /> Peter Riegert (Local Hero, Animal House) has a great performance as always, and Kimberly Williams does her best with what she has to work with, but Janeane Garofalo (HBO's Larry Sanders Show) is pretty much wasted on her role as Cosmo's friend. Probably not for long, though. Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be chosen and it's only a matter of time before she gets an important role, I hope to do a tag team thing with Marisa Tomei. <br /> <br />
