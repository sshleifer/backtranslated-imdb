Before I sat down and watched this movie on HBO, I was not expecting anything but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid, common plot. Well, that's exactly what I got out of it, except that I was a bit satisfied at the end of the movie. I did not expect it to be, I thought it would be just another hour and a half that I would lose in my hands. Well, it was, but it was still worth it. The whole plot was very stupid, cheap, and some of the lines were very dumb. Otherwise, there are still funny moments, even if they are not many. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are going to rent this, do not do that. Watch on the television. I gave a 4, I was generous because it made me laugh, but it was still very stupid.
