I saw this short on the DVD of Ridley Scott's movie, The Duellists. There was no introduction of Scott before the movie, it just started. <br /> <br /> Boy and a bike are hardly an example of Ridley Scott's other work, it bears no resemblance. The film features a boy, played by Tony Scott, riding a bicycle. Guess what? That's beautiful all this happens. The boy walks around, talking non stop with a confused and meaningless dialogue. The film was shot in black and white, and since being directed by Ridley Scott, I expected cool cinematography or visually stunning scenarios. Instead, I was treated to nothing. This movie is not even good for a first effort. However, I recommend that any Ridley Scott fan check it out at least once.
