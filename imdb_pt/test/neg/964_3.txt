"The Snow Queen" is based on the famous and beautiful fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen about a girl, Gerda, who takes a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaptation attempts to capture the story's sense of adventure and brightly complex images through luxurious sets and production design, but fails in a series of scores. <br /> <br /> Like many other Hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely different. overlapped by scripts and direction with heavy hand. The two actors who play Gerda and Kai are pleasantly agreeable, but forgettable; Bridget Fonda, like the Snow Queen, seems the part, but it's different for the role. There is a notable lack of dramatic tension in this three-hour miniseries. At least some of the rhythm problems can be attributed to the addition of fill scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly at the opening time introducing the main characters. <br /> <br /> That said, "The Snow Queen" would be almost ideal for pre-teens with a taste for fantasy and a little patience. It is great for the eyes without being scary, and the acting is cast with the pantomime type above the level that sets the plot in very, very bold text. Just be sure to read Andersen's story as well.
