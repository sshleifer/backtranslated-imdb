This movie is a disgrace. How can you pick up one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into a kind of half-idiot love story? The whole beginning of the film was not in H. Wells' story and it did not have to be. Also the Eloi was done completely wrong. They built houses or formed any kind of real society. They did not care about each other. That was an important part of the story. The way they formed a world without complex difficulties or emotions. They were barely aware of the Morlocks. I do not know why this movie was made the way it was, but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.
