How poor is this movie? Well, I bought it less than two months ago and I can hardly remember what it was ... <br /> <br /> I also paid Â£ 1 for this on DVD, the old story of 'putting a new' - cover- in-the-box-and-some-fool-goes-buy-it 'syndrome. All I remember is that the cast ran a lot, the use of cars must have been way above budget and that a vampire was involved. So again, I think you might know this from the movie title. <br /> <br /> Direct to video junk or direct to cheap DVD as it is now. This stuff will be in the bargain boxes at rental shops, grocery stores and charities until the death of the sun. Only rogues will rule the land, but this garbage will still be around. God bless the dawn of the DVD era ....
