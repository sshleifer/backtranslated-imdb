I bought this DVD for my young son who loves the ToyStory movies. I never expected it to be in the same league as the Toystory movies, but what I got was just another lazy Disney cartoon, far below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is not original, the characters are bland and two-dimensional, the animation is below standard, even Buzz is not that good. The movie could have been so much better. I especially hated painting by plotting numbers. I know it's for kids, but even kids know when something stinks at this level of lameness. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of the film, I really enjoyed the opening section of the movie, with the slag. monster mutant, just came down from there.
