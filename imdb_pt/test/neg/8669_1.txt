Why did they have to make such a terrible adjustment? The entire "Complete Jane Austin" series, as part of the Masterpiece Classics, sounds like a big disappointment. Characters are totally wrong and there is no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing seems a bit rushed. The release of the 1999 film based on the same novel looks like a masterpiece in comparison to this. I really want to forget it. I am very happy that "Pride and Prejudice" will not be remade as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists. if you skipped this production of "Mansfield Park", consider yourself lucky!
