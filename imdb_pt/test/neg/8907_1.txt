Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you're looking for bad acting (Heather Graham could never live it ... it has three titles for a reason - to protect the guilty!), A nice bad dialogue ("Do you like it?" .. ribs? "), and a storyline only one mother could approve, this is their entertainment Friday night! My roommate rented this under the heading" Terrified "because he liked Heather Not because the movie is scary, but because someone actually paid money to do that shit in a movie. which provides some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth seeing.Heather Graham's dramatic climax was also one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I've ever witnessed.I do not recommend this movie, and may God have mercy on your soul.
