I was a big fan of "SNL" in the days of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I tried to watch it over the last ten years, I was very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted with it. Ten years ago, I believed that the show could not survive, since it became completely devoid of the kind of humor I could understand, and yet it remained connected, which I always found discouraging, wondering how in the world anyone could find the his lame humor at all funny. Whenever I tuned in the last decade, I've never been happy to have done it. In fact, I've always been bored with me for staying awake and wasting my time. For me, the absolute low came several years ago, when a popular young actor I really liked was the guest host. At one point that night he played a big star, maybe himself, and in the sketch, the character "Mongo", I think, played by Chris Kattan, again I think, ended up in the back of a car with him. What followed was Mongo being forced up and down and up and down the actor's lap, with him screaming hysterically as if he was probably sodomized. The audience was laughing and I'm shaking my head, surprised that they found this remotely funny, amazed that NBC even conveyed such a thing. In the years since then, I have repeatedly tried to approach the program with an open mind, hoping it would regain the sense of humor I had loved so many years ago. But until just a week ago, for me, that did not happen. Not even close. One exception: During the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic, and she was the only artist who kept me in tune. But those Sarah Palin sketches, though hysterical, still were not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes. and I always regret not turning it off as soon as I heard the familiar "It's' Saturday Night !!!"
