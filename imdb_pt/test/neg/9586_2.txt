If you live in the suburbs, you are relatively well financially, and really do not have much contact with life in the city of England, so this is the comedy for you. It's not something a mass audience would use, but if you're like these characters, they show you'll love it in pieces. Overall, this is a comedy that BBC snobs will sit and laugh for pleasure and only a few audiences. Comparing it with BBC Comedys as Only Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder and other classics, this series tends to move away from the regular BBC product to the public and deliver to a bit of a popular culture.
