If you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep, Heart of Darkness is the movie for you. The book was not what I expected, and the movie disappointed me even more. The list of castles was deplorable, and the whole plot was pathetic and not like the book except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own point of view when reading Heart of Darkness, and they create their own movie in their mind, but the director cuts important scenes and adds useless scenes. If there was anyone in the movie who was supposed to be from a certain culture, they should have used an actor from that culture. There are actors from everywhere, and I'm sure they could find the best ones to fit the roles. Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and he created a book that will entertain you if that is what you are looking for but the movie was cheap and meaningless and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book should have done it . If you want a movie that drags you into darkness, then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you.
