Oh dear God, this is awful. Stay away, just stay away. If you think you've seen bad movies, think again. Never before has my brain hurt as much as after watching this movie. The performance, if it can be called, is enough to cause internal bleeding inside your head. The story is so thin that it's almost there ... no, wait, scratch it. There is not a full story there, but every once in a while, there are some fine lines that stand out from all the horrible, and believe me, those few lines should have been filmed. The best way to enjoy this movie is to drop the napalm on it and watch the cozy fire in the distance. <br /> <br /> Some may call me sarcastic in this criticism, but I'm just trying to spare some of you. of a severe headache. However, you must be, what I like to call a visual masochist (like me), please go ahead and notice that monstrosity.
