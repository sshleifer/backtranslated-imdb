Now, I'm a big fan of zombie movies. I admit zombie movies are not usually that good, but I like them anyway. Despite the bad and bad dialogues that occur in almost every Zombie movie, this is by far the worst. See, there are some basic rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Tactics are rarely used, and NEVER act like a boxer. They do not dodge a blow to the head, they take it with an ugly smile. They do not try to hit your face, grab your arm and bite! 2. Zombies can not talk. Only in Evil Dead. Otherwise, they will not speak. 3. You do not fight zombies with melee weapons. You lose in a melee fight against zombies. Firearms are used. In this movie, however, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> He had no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a zombie movie, see one with an average score of more than 3 on the wiki
