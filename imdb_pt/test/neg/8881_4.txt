so the second half of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the movie jumped many years forward with French Spain. The movie does little to tell you what happened, and I do not remember much about it. So the movie gets confusing then. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, is accused of Judaism by the church, specifically Father Lorenzo. She is put on the issue and forced to confess. Even the wealth of his family can not buy it from prison. His father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession saying that he is the son of a chimpanzee, hoping to free Ines. All it does is give a reason for the church to condemn Lorenzo, who flees to France. <br /> <br /> So the film skips many years and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines is released from prison. It was great to do the job to make Natalie Portman look so hurt. She finds her family dead and seeks out Goya for her help. She tells him she had a son in prison. Goya makes a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He is the father. Goya sees his daughter and tells Lorenzo that he decides it is best to send her to the United States, so that no one finds out. But before his plans are realized, the British join the Spanish, and Spain regains power and he is now the pursued. This part is not well told in the movie. It's how the movie shows it happen in a day. VERDICT FINAL: The movie is good until it skips many years after the Inquistion, so the movie hopes you understand what's going on. It just got really confusing for me then.
