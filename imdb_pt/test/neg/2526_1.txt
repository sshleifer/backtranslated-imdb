A root canal without anesthesia is more fun. This movie is disturbing and meaningless. There is absolutely nothing believable about any of these characters or the plot. What, in the name of God, were these people thinking when they agreed to star in this movie? The acting in this film is unbelievably bad - even from actors who are usually very good. "The In-Laws" is a funny movie. "The Birdcage" is a hilarious movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a humorous film. This movie is just plain stupid. I can not even begin to understand the kind of sick mind it takes to write the "romance" on which this movie is based. I honestly can not think of anything good about this movie. It just does not make any sense. People please - I beg you - I do not see this movie. You will regret it for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst of all time, but it is definitely at the top of the list.
