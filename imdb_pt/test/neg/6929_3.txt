I loved the book "A Little Princess" for most of my life and I was very excited about the existence of a movie. But I was shocked by this adaptation. It is not just the acting of wood, and the plot is a mix of several incidents in the book, but the theme is all wrong. The real theme of the story must be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves as one, as Sara does when she gives five of her six cookies to a beggar child, even when she herself is very hungry. The theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses, which greatly diminishes Sara's actions, and it looks more like it should be written on a Hallmark card than applied to that story. There are many other things wrong with this film - many to list, but here are just a few of the biggest: this story should be set in Britain in the mid-1800s, not in America during the first World War. Miss Minchen is tough on Sara from the start, doing her actions when Sara is left without a penny much less amazing than it would be if she were sweet at first, as she should be. Nowhere is it mentioned that Becky is black. Sara's father does not come back, he's dead. She is his best friend and collaborator in the diamond mines that finds Sara and restores it in its proper place. In fact, diamond mines are not even mentioned, although they are the source of Sara's wealth. <br /> <br /> In all that Sara has faced, she always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who have hurt her. She would never have called Lavinia "arrogant two-faced bully." Such a thing is completely out of character for her, and weakens the whole philosophy that she should be well behaved, no matter what. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that I have ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "Ella Enchanted" and "Anne of Green Gables's Continuing Story") The plot of the book is wonderful and cleverly written, so I do not understand why the director felt it needed to be changed to make it interesting. I would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version, which is far superior. Or better yet, read the book. It will be worth more of your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version of the movie.
