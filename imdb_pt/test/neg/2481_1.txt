When Las Vegas came out a review described this show as such, quote "A little harmless from fluff". Needless to say after seeing a dozen episodes I think this description is right about money. A variety of cute boys and types of models displaying a variety of thin paper stories while all the while trying to pretend they are serious business people. One-dimensional characters, in a one-dimensional scenario, searching for one-dimensional stories. That pretty much sums up Vegas. I still watch from time to time to see if the show is trying to evolve and take it a little seriously but unfortunately to no avail. So far.
