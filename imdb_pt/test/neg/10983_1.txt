This woman is a terrible comedian. She can not tell a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American trash, that people laugh, because they have no idea how to react, then they say to themselves, "well, it's a comedy show," so I'm going to laugh, I guess. <BR> I can not stand this miserable woman, and her poor excuse for comedy. She deserves nothing but boo. <br /> <br /> Why can not the United States throw out this kind of turbulent pleasure and opt for something that actually contains humor? <br /> <br /> She's not funny. Not at all. Why, oh, why does a person like this idiot?
