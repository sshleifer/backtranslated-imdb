I have recently seen a number of caving movies and this movie has managed to bring together all the worst aspects of this type of film. You have very little appreciation for the surroundings of the cave or the monster they face, while the characters are clich√©s (a spiritual face, leader with tragedy in the recent past, etc.) and the ending was weak. It really bothered me that the director continued to shake the camera or show almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I read that this movie gave a real representation of the collapse and yes, I imagine the caves are dark. Showing almost total darkness for half the film actually brought this house. I quite enjoyed the "downhill" which, for my money to perform better, showed cramp situations tighter, better monsters and had a good end. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <br /> The monster is a guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed, letting him grow in the caves. He seems to have developed super strength and speed, but why is he never approached - maybe the same force that drained his batteries did this, but during the movie whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something big with claws ripping every victim ( see how much blood spills on the walls!) but in the end it's just a guy with a skin on it and a mask? I would be willing to ignore this if great heights of suspense were attained, but that would hardly be the case. Then he starts to rape the last remaining caver and roll credits ... Almost absurdly bad I thought. Sometimes a movie is so bad that you can enjoy it and maybe laugh, but this movie is not easy either. <br /> <br /> You watched, you can not unlock it!
