While Star Trek, the movie was more tedious, Star Trek The Final Frontier is clearly bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on ground leave when it receives a distress signal from the Federation that the ambassadors representing the Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) were kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan, intent on reaching a ship for Adventure on the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and poor writing, he persuades many of the Enterprise's top officers to betray Kirk and seize the ship. They reach the interior of the great barrier and find a planet where they find a divine alien. This is so bad that it's hard to figure out where to start. In the center is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot leads nowhere rather than where no man has gone before. It's almost as if the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes do not have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, philosophy is boring and humor is obsolete. Now I'm going to focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock and McCoy, but he does not give others enough to do. In addition, while Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous films and television spots, he is simply bad at this one. Now Kirk is reckless, playful and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song "Row Row Row Your Boat" in a round by a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given three out of ten instead of five.
