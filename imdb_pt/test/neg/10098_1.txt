2001 was not perhaps Eric Roberts' best year. Both Raptor and this one left. I watched Raptor a while back and actually thought it sucked and be worse for Erics. But this had a moment of fun and pattern D. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the worst actor these days. The story has no effect and the whole thing seems even slower than a snail breaking in curves. <br /> <br /> The two things that stand out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You may argue that their effort is good or not, but compared to the rest they are above all critical. <br /> <br /> I say thank you Roberts until the next (and hopefully it's better).
