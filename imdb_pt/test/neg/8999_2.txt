What a waste of time. I got about five minutes and got very impatient, and then I was getting a little forward, and then the desire to take the thumb off the fast forward button was non-existent. Actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did very capable jobs, I thought, but no one else I've seen has performed well. Again, make this review with a big grain of salt, because the film was so unbearable that I could not get to the end. Heck, I could not get to MIDDLE !! <br /> <br /> I can not send this review because it is not long enough. Maybe this last sentence puts it on top.
