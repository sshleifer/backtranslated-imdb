Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life. <br /> <br /> This film is flaccid and horrible, and its memory does not give credit. The script is confusing and preserves many lines of the book intact (the jokes of the leg here are incomprehensible). Actors' performances are uniformly ineffective, a large cast is wasted, and the leader, Sean Hughes, delivers the belligerent hostilities of Milligan in a melancholy lament, which misses the point completely. <br /> <br /> The gentle rhythm is a killer as well. Farce must speed up in the end. The Goon Shows used to happen, the novel "Puckoon" definitely worked, but this movie, at best, slows down when you want the various elements to blend into a final climax. <br /> <br /> Milligan narrated a summary audio recording of "Puckoon" in 1980, with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. This is funny. Ten minutes of it is funnier than the whole movie. I believe the LP was transferred to the CD, but I do not know if it's still being printed. <br /> <br /> There's a "Adolf Hitler: My Part in Your Fall" movie with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It's also a mess, but it's funnier than that. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Milligan's spirit is very unruly to the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film attacks practically every opportunity and never misses the chance to disappoint.
