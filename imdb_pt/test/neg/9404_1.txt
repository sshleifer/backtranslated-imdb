Pacino and Maconadump really hit the mark with this stinky one. I swear, I'm an avid movie goer and fan. I have been a fan of most people in this abortion at one time or another. So far. The crap of the story The crap of the act (Rene Ruso-Major League was good) The garbage heap The secondary trash The teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junk <br /> <br /> I swore to watch Romy and The meeting of Michelle in high school twice a day for the next seven days as a punishment for not taking this colostomy bag out of a movie after 10 minutes. I was out of town for a seminar, and that pile of money cost me $ 9.99 and two hours. I was cheated. This director must be in jail for fraud. <br /> <br /> Stay with me if you have other questions about reviews. I'm always right.
