In the 1950s, a gay photographer named Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) founded an agency of male models, launching a magazine called "Physique Pictorial" and men's film, and many of the models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. Switching from the 1950s, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself these days, director Thom Fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men and a lot of penis for 93 minutes, with a bad taste and a very silly crap. I've never heard anything about this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I do not know what AMG is. In my opinion, only the gay and very specific public may like the theme of this boring and pretentious film. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fresh Meat" ("Fresh Meat")
