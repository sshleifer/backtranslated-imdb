All I could think of while watching this movie was, "Is this going to end ?!" It was unbearably annoying to watch. I was wishing I could turn it off, but I wanted to do this justice review, so I fought the good fight and resisted the torture of watching this movie to the end so you, the good reader, do not have to endure this pain as well. . <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have a great premise if you read the premise on paper. However, the actual film does not fulfill this premise. The opening scene features a mine in the early 1900's where they force children to carry dynamite into tunnels that are not large enough. for adults to fit in. This seems to be establishing the premise of an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes, it is clear that this is not the case. Adults who have committed such crimes are never punished; there are no consequences shown in the film by their actions. The opening scene is much better than the rest of the film and is completely irrelevant to it. The last time an opening scene misrepresented a film so painfully was the opening scene of 28 Days Later, which was the only good scene in that entire movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie so bad that they changed the title to try to disguise their crappiness and sell it again) is exactly the same in that regard. The opening scene is the only viewable scene in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie advances to the current day. A single mother and her two spoiled, dirty-mouth children. This is when it would be wise to press the STOP button and never get closer to the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first hour, zombie boys are hardly seen. They get maybe 3 minutes of screen time, total. All they do is kill a pig, that's all. The rest of the time is spent showing the dumb mother and her sons donkeys buying things at the local store, walking through the woods and having futile conversations with one another. The teenage daughter changes and goes out with some other stupid teenagers and smokes marijuana with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to care if the zombie children dispatched someone in this movie. Each character is dumb and boring, with no redeeming qualities. Not to mention one-dimensional and cliche. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been * greatly improved * if mother and her dumb sons were dispatched within the first 10 minutes by the zombie boys while they were driving. to his new home, then the final credits rolled. That would instantly change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When the mother changes her eyes off the road and almost collides with a pedestrian on the road, her daughter rebukes her, "You almost killed us, Mother!" Of course, anyone with common sense knows that if the mother hit the pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would be dead - not the people safely wrapped in the car. I think this line was put in the film to show firsthand that the absolute stupidity of the main characters has no limits, and runs in the family. <br /> <br /> The Passions / Zombies Racing takes 1 hour and 34 minutes. , but it definitely looked like 5 hours or more to me. Trying not to sleep was a tremendous challenge. It is not until more than an hour past for the 1 hour and 34 minutes that zombie children actually bother to kill anyone. Then the scene shows the stupid teenagers drinking beer and making a car and saying phrases like, "If you want to get into my pants again, you'd better get the car in and get out of here right away." Seriously, this is textual from the movie. Teenagers are so clich√©d, unidimensional, misinterpreted, dumb and annoying that when zombie kids finally get to hack 3 of them in 1 hour and 5 minutes in the movie, it seems like a cause for celebration. Of course, the loser's daughter who drinks foul-mouthed beer, the stupid and stinky "Princess" of marijuana from her mother's main character runs away from Scott. What a buzzkill that was! She was on screen more than the others and therefore the most annoying of the four of them, and more deserving of a pickaxe on the head. One more reason why it should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes, as mentioned earlier. Still, keeping it about 1 hour and 5 minutes, is totally inexcusable. <br /> <br /> The reason for this, of course, is that feature films need to be filled for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So keeping her alive for a long time when she should be, they have an extra 27 minutes to fill the movie with her and her mother running through the forest. For 1 hour and 22 minutes, it's the * second * time in the movie where the boring daughter gets stuck in a vehicle where the engine does not turn on while the zombie kids are going to get it. <br /> <br /> Zombie children are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development for any of them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all 3 main annoying and idiot characters live. Which, in my opinion, is the way the filmmakers make one last gesture of passing the bird to the public. In my opinion, the filmmakers certainly know that they tricked anyone who had the great misfortune of watching the whole movie. Why not rub their faces in it, not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes, die. <br /> <br /> Avoid Small Things and Zombies like bubonic plague.
