Retro Puppet Master is complete and absolute CRAP. In particular, the puppets look stupid and lousy. The acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid. This film dates back to the past where the puppets where first created, this does Puppet Master. Master Puppet Master is classified as PG-13, the first Puppet Master to be classified as PG-13. The film contains no horror or suspense. The fact that this film was a Puppet Master movie confuses the mind because this plot does not have the buckets of blood, good acting, or any animation like the previous films did. Do not watch this movie, do not rent it, and do not even watch it on TV, because this movie is obsolete, non-violent and completely out of the question. As a Puppet Master fan, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
