<br /> <br /> Never make a movie just for its good title. <br /> <br /> Although everything starts well, the film suffers the same imperfections as you see in the B movies. It is like at one point the writer does not do more like ending the film, so it ends in a way that nobody suspects to think that he is resourceful. <br /> <br /> A movie to be listed at the top of the junk list. <br /> <br />
