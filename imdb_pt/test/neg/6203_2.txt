David Dhawan copied HITCH and an unofficial copy. The movie is not at all funny or funny, since the original is boring with forced stories, like Lara's strip of having a son and no husband, plus a stupid and unwanted Chota DON. David tries to stifle the drama as well, but the film seems disjointed, annoying <br /> <br /> The songs just popped up, as well as romance and everything but a few funny scenes from Govinda, the dance before the break is nothing more worthwhile to mention The last scenes are very funny, but they tend to stay very long <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change his style or try something good Music is a grace <br /> <br /> Govinda looks overweight and looks very loud and shouts his lines on early reels, but he comes in to the rhythm and gives his best in the office and in the scene with Salman in his cabin and at the end <br /> <br /> Salman just touches himself and his nasal tone plus his fake style of acting is a headache <br /> <br /> Lara is avoidable, Katrina is fake as usual <br /> <br /> The boy stands out
