Being a long-time fan of Japanese cinema, I expected more than that. I really can not be bothered to write too much, as this movie is so poor. The story may be the sweetest and most romantic thing of all time, pity that I could not stand the horrible acting, the mess they called rhythm, and the Japanese story "peculiar." If you've noticed how many Japanese movies use characters, graphics, and twists that look very "different", forcibly avoid that movie. Seriously, a 12 year old boy might have told you how this movie would go on, and that's not a good thing in my book. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Beat" Takeshi: Your part in this movie is no more than a tip, and unless you are a fan of fanatics, you do not have to suffer from this waste of film. <br /> <br /> 2/10
