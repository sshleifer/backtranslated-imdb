Okay, some other people have commented that this is not an action movie, so I do not need to redo it (even though I've just done it). This is not exactly a let down, it's actually cool from time to time to see an actor try something different. But, unfortunately, this is not one of those occasions. <br /> <br /> Now, the story: nonexistent. This movie lacks almost as much plot as 'Showgirls' did. Of course, they play in an environmentalist couple, no, not even an environmentalist, something else, playing here and there to please Seagal (that's what he is). That does not make a story, not even close. Now the end ... Even those of us who really liked this movie ... the end, you have to admit that it was a little too, or too stupid. <br /> <br /> Now from what I understand this was a straightforward movie for video (at least in the states), but that's too good for this movie. This piece of garbage should have been cabled only, on TBS or Starz (late night).
