I usually like Casper in his movies, a real credit to STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the cover of the box in this video SSOOOOO mi-sleds the tenants. In my local video, people rent him waiting for a (PERFECT) Borg as a vampire, and instead they get a bad version of Lon Chaney. He had great potential and fell a lot. I really think I could have written a better story and a screen game. Why is it in all science fiction films, they (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? None of these writers or writers stayed awake in science class? It's a pet pevee mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a set of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of cola as a total of six packs. Makes you look even dumber.
