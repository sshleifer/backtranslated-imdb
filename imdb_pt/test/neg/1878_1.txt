I've seen tons of junk, in every language, on every topic and every trend in filmmaking. From each period, each director and any type of budget available. That being said, I really have to state: This is one of the three worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's painfully bad. It's pompous. It's bleak. It's incomprehensible. It's annoying. It's a really bad mess. It's a piece of you-know what. <br /> <br /> And, what is more important: one point is missing. And even if he had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it is impossible to ignore the lack of cohesion of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's strange just to be weird. <br /> <br /> I really felt sick watching this crap. The theater where I saw him (Lincoln Center in New York) was full when it started. In the end, half the audience had left. There was a Q & A scheduled at the end, but no one stayed. With the exception of about two patients, everyone else rushed to the door, including me. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. It's probably one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie theater in Hell, this movie will play 24/7, for eternity ...
