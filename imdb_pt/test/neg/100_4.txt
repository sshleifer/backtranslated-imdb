I was looking forward to this movie. Trusted actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? If you are going to try something that should encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know. OK, I did not expect the directors or writers to really know the meaning, but I thought they might have offered crumbs to peck and try to add fuel to the fire - that! they almost did. Things that I could not. A woman wandering in dark places and solitary parking lots alone, oblivious to the consequences. Great puzzles that have fallen into oblivion. The promise of knowledge contained therein by the original criminal call. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and I can be lyrical about the fool and found the role of Adrian Pauls crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically, the plot and script, to a certain point and point, were the last 10 minutes. What? You have no ideas! It's a shame that this movie has disappointed us so much. It may not understand the meaning and I did not really expect the writers to understand this, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not a spiritual walk, and have a spine on the road
