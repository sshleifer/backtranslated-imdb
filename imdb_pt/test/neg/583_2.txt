OUR GANG has had a breakthrough in a feature film in its 22-year history, and that was the best that could be done? It is tedious, forced and purposeless, and I respectfully disagree with the other poster of this film; the RASCALS remake of 1994 was better than that. Almost everything is. Children are subordinated to the Civil War process; does not look like a movie of OUR GANG, but as a clone Shirley Temple of second category and without humor.
