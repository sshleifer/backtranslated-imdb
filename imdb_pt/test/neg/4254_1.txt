This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would anyone make a movie about getting away from the murder? Allen again plays the only type of character he is capable of, the sexually rickety man who can not get the girl. Have a clue, Allen, there is a reason that is the only character that you can portray successfully. Hold on to this movie! It's a waste of time, unless you want to know how to successfully kill someone. I'm sorry for the actors who say 'yes' to Woody Allen. Look at his cast and tell me how many of those people are still working. My respect for all the actors, who work for him, comes down immediately, because they chose to participate in the film.
