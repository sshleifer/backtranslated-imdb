I just finished watching The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and it seemed like a chore. Watching the nasty, skeletal character of Keira Knightly made me shrink even more throughout the film. <br /> <br /> It took me four nights to watch this, it was very annoying. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. He is always good / believable and is severely under the watch of many movies. This, however, was not good enough for him. <br /> <br /> In addition to the unpleasant characters, boring plot, the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying. I felt like I spent my time watching this for nothing (which I did). I should have done the cleverest thing and turned it off, but I kept it in respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography.
