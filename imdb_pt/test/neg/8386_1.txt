I watched this movie last night, although I rent a horror / horror movie from blockbusters and I took this one out. The opening scenes were so long, the conversations between the characters seemed to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed so bad to me, she gave him HIV and then she's going to meet someone else, but she's killed by the man she infected (I think she may have done it by a long time for different people) So when he dumps the body that happened to be the man she was going to meet, she was in the woods and watched him dump the body. Then he chased them (he already buried the body?) And they got into a car and he somehow found them from a different direction from which they came and killed the guy. <br /> <br /> I think the severed head was the only good thing in the movie, as it was quite realistic. and then, when the woman ran, she fell in front of him so he could stab her with a shovel! And then it's over! <br /> <br /> What a relief, it was the most senseless movie I've ever seen ... please stay well away from it, it's so badly done, I counted only 5 different people on it, and the scene where it kills her so unrealistic and they just swear on it and that's it !! This is me ... STEER WELL CLEAR !!
