This video has audio for a person to listen to while sleeping. And the same can be said of the video. <br /> <br /> Morgan and his wife pretend they are working hard on minimum wages? With a camera rolling? And your little wife complaining? Give me some time. Both are rich. They are sitting in their fake apartment for $ 350 / month filming this with their $ 1,000 / month each video team of 12. I used to respect Morgan, but now their experience of "30 days" is nothing more than to try < Morgan, you're being filmed doing a $ 6.00 an hour job and you're being paid by naive employers who do not see those great talents. Cameras filming the whole thing? And should not we think that they are not paying you under the table?
