George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are a lot of jokes about her Alzheimer's dementia, and most of them are not funny, although there were a few funny moments spread out here and there (like the nude running around the park scene and the old men at home). At first, Segal tries to kill his mother because she is difficult to live and because he is a selfish guy. Making the movie sort of a Wiley Coyote comedy versus the Roadrunner Comedy, where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible girl, would have been a joke - pity that was NOT the general tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> I applaud Carl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless movie that intends to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED and his MOTHER DEAD, eating RAOUL and KATAKURIS HAPPINESS - all the movies about death that dare offend. The problem here however is that WHERE IS POPPA? It has some funny moments, but it also has lots of plans and the overall product is surprisingly bland. Also, topics like homosexual rape, incest, and the like are really hard to make funny. I read in "THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES" which is considered a cult film, although I can not see anyone wanting to see it more than once.
