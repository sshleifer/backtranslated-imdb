The puzzle as a concept is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid it's miscast, Vinnie if given the role of hard man is his element as in Stock Lock and Snatch. In this film, Vinnie plays a sports journalist (greyhounds, to be precise), who during the course of the film is easily beaten easily and packaged along a porch by a man who 10-15 years older than him. I'm sorry Vinnie's hard seems hard and so has to pitch it so it's silly. Trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the Thames. He takes on the role of cop, while the actual police are part of the players, interspersing with flashbacks of Charles Dickens. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is onscreen, his reputation precedes him, he looks tough, but he does not do it. part needs to act hard, snarling at the camera in parts. If you watch Mean Machine, he is perfectly cast and believable and does a very decent performance. Returning to the film which confuses the subject a little is the flashback of Charles Dickens, who is narrating a different story with characters that also appear these days, these two stories do not seem to be related actors themselves they're used. The sound of the film, especially Julie Cox, is inaudible at times, and it is not true that her role in the film is short for the interest of Vinnies Love, she begins the film as a Detecive, but quickly becomes the girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute is a kind of response, but not yet answered. Get the stuff out of Charles Dickens and you can have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, is slowly becoming the British Steven Segal, hold the supporting role, you are very good at it.
