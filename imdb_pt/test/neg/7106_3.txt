I made the mistake of buying this since I collect comic book-inspired movies. Even the 6 $ was very expensive. I thought there might be some extravagant fun in it, a "so bad" that it becomes good vibe, maybe I was wrong. I had watched it a long time ago and I did not remember any of it. Now I know why. I was bored and was looking for distractions to do something else. I'm all for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl does not work on any front. The script is bad, you do not care about the characters and the mood is almost all lame, except for some fun one-liners. Special or local effects are bad or often replaced by comic panels or animations that are very shocking compared to the live action. It's like they did not have the money to shoot the cool stuff and then used the designs as cool as they could be (an uncensored animated animation would be so much better for Tank Girl now that I think about it). The action scenes were cheesy but not fun. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic, though it was interesting. In fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. <br /> <br /> He has some interesting songs from well-known artists such as Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they simply do not fit most of the time. Once they got to sing a ridiculous song and a dance number that was simply meaningless and horrible. I think that's when I totally shut down. I suppose Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, seems like the trash part of the punkte, but apart from its "attitude" and sometimes unfunny retorts, is more two dimensional and shallower than the worst comic book characters. Jet, played by Naomi Watts, is probably the only salvation of the movie and it's amazing how such a good actress got involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell was not so bad playing his usual villain role. It may be a cult movie for some, but please consider that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the film (check out Tank Girl's entry on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
