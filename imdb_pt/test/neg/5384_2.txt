From the artistic point of view, the film can not entertain or provide any moral resolution. The plot is difficult to follow, if any. The acting is hard to bear. The dialogue is clich√© and clearly written by someone who does not know English. Only cinematography deserved to be watched in this movie, although you can still see flaws in the image. As an Asian-American woman, the movie irritated me because it proved how close-minded people can be. Politically speaking, putting Asian women in such shameful roles should be banned. The perpetuation of the stereotypes of Asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self-esteem of Asian women, but also for the country as a whole. I feel for the lead actress who played Maya and for the exploration she must have faced in playing such a role. <br /> <br /> As Americans, please, avoid this movie. Art must be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another, not to retain it.
