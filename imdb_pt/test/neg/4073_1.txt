I should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the comment here. I saw the whole movie by fast forward and finished in 25 minutes. although it is a low budget movie could have been better. <br /> <br /> The movie begins more like a thriller and in a few minutes it says that you should turn off immediately. And why was the movie called "forced landing" when it landed so well in such a bad climate? <br /> <br /> Without any acting, all the characters just moving or doing like children. <br /> <br /> And do not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker who would have been more appropriate if this movie were a full-time comedy.
