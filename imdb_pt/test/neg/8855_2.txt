Brave drama? Emotionally powerful? Blah! The BBC lost a lot of time for such masterpieces as HBO's The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale. Okay, so the budget might be a lot smaller, but 'The Street' last night was misrepresented, predictable, unrealistic, stereotyped, unfeeling and a big waste of time. The TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be and is getting more and more behind the American productions. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of brutal local gangster violence. There was no indication that this man was "insane" enough to beat a man he respected for so long. There was no remorse when he did this and this should not be the kind of character that would recede when Bob Hoskins called his son of perfect love in a show of bravery. <br /> <br /> I would like to have been more eloquent to express my disdain for this program, but I am not and although I can not prove my argument well enough, believe me when I say that this was trash, TV shocking, not offers no real perspective on life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
