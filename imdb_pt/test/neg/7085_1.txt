This is possibly one of the worst films ever made. All about it - acting, direction, screenplay, cinematography - is terrible. The alien (a bright-looking human being) claims to be from a nearby universe; The writer is supposed to mean "galaxy," but he did not bother to get a dictionary to check its terms. A better title for the film would be "It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances." The plot is overly silly and almost non-existent. All humans receive magical MacGuffins who obey a tortuous series of unlikely restraints just to move the bare storyline. Any thought about the passage of time is ignored. Now, a few days after meeting the alien, then BAM! suddenly there are only a few hours left until zero. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You'll be dumber for watching. The ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone who is "Ta-Da !!!!" as the screenwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. I think the real alien plot is that this movie is so bad you will get cancer watching it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without ruining yourself ("enemies of freedom" - honestly) laughing, you're retarded.
