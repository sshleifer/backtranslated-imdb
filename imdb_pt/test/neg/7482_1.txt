Carson Daly has to be the only night talk show host who is not a comedian. What was the thought of NBC! He's not funny! The writing is horrible! All sketches are painful to watch. The new current karaoke is not funny, especially since it tells what they are going to sing before they sing! Interviews with the escalator are just stupid and needless to say, they're not funny at all. All he plays, especially during the monologue, are the less intelligent, more stupid, not funny jokes that have ever been on television! I mean, whenever he makes a joke on Jessica Simpson, he ends up with "because she's stupid," which cancels any grace that was in the joke, which was already too low. Any 3-year-old could have done any of the jokes and sketches they put in that excuse for a show. Seriously, do not watch this program unless you're on the verge of suicide and want something that takes you to the edge.
