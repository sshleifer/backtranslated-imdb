The authors do not know anything about the Russian prisons, the film is absolutely cockamamie, has nothing common with reality. They also do not make foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison so foreigners NEVER live together with Russian criminals. The uniforms of this film seem to have been stolen somewhere in Latin America. Prisoners in Russia also do not work out of prison. Every death in the Russian prison is a matter of investigation, so prisoners will kill themselves only if there are very important reasons. Playing football is also prohibited in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very restricted, there is no chance of bloody fighting etc etc etc. So this movie has nothing in common with reality.
