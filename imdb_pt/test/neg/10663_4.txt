As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this film, I was approached - be white - to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio. <br /> <br /> Although I speak German too, they kindly asked me to do all the dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian public ... So all the Germans in this movie really speak English! funny enough I made several characters, so if you really want to spoil some time watching the movie again, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-indigenous characters are made by only 4 voices! . . . .
