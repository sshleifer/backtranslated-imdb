This could have been a prominent role for Valeria Golino, but the film decided to shift its attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino) who is married to a fisherman and mother of three children. She is a free spirit and prone to explosions, so the rest of the village and her family decide that she should be sent to Milan and seek a doctor. The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa, Sicily, and shows daily life with teenagers rivaling gangs and trying to find something to do on rock bathed in sun. Grazia's eldest son, Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) loves her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression. The daughter Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino) is a young woman in love who falls in love with a local policeman and the youngest son Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very daring and mocks the accent of the policeman. Upon learning that she should be sent to Milan, Grazia escapes and Pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone is looking for her. This movie could have really made a bigger impact if it could focus its focus on Grazia. We see some explosions and irrational behavior on her part, but there is no follow-up to these scenes. Nothing comes of it. The film looks great and is beautifully photographed, so give credit to director Emanuele Crialese, but the story needed to focus on something more substantial. The film does a good job of showing us how life on this island is and what is happening in the life of the three children as they grow up. His speculation is that Golino's character gives a hint of being a mermaid creature and that's why she's having a hard time living on land. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way, and if you do not, you may be subject to the harsh realities of your rules. All the speculations, but I think the attention of the movies could have stayed with the character of Grazia. After she hides in the cave, she really has nothing to do. In a way, the character is stagnant. I wish Golino had more to do, because I always liked her and whenever she's on the screen, you can not take her eyes off her. She is a pack of fury, passion and brute energy! What a shame Crialese did not write a more complete role for her to act. When the film ends its left feeling empty of an incomplete story.
