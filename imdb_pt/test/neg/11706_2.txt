I can not express enough how bad this movie was. First of all, what a waste of some legendary stars, although they are quite old and rather unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well, I think he should have a big favor on someone, since this was his last movie role. The script is a mess and the film seems terribly drawn. I wonder if maybe I saw it back when it came out (1981) I might have thought it was decent. However, seeing so many real horror movies, this was one of the worst. The only really convincing thing in this mess was the very young and adorable kind of scary Alice Krige. The main young character was trying to act the best he could, but it was totally terrible. I was not sure how much of that was the lack of skill or the lack of an understandable script, but anyway it was just bad. Do not watch unless you want to see a bunch of old men a little scared.
