As a sci-fi and casual fan of Angelina Jolie, I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth it ... maybe it has some scenes or a plot that would make up for all of its other flaws. Also, it may be interesting to see Angelina as she was embarking on her star career. <br /> <br /> Oh how wrong I was. One thing I learned - at age 18, Angelina Jolie could not act. So to make her comfortable, the producers cast that whole movie with people who could not act. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can really act) decided to overdo it. Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> For horrible and exaggerated acting, add a meaningless script, an insipid dialogue, a cinematography from the bottom up ... in fact, add Everything you see in the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> The storyline shows Angelina as a cyborg scheduled by her corporate lords as a killer. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid things happens. The end. I would tell you more, but I did not want to waste my life watching this accident. <br /> <br /> I beg you - this is not worth watching. Nor is it worth thinking about watching. Save the pain and move on.
