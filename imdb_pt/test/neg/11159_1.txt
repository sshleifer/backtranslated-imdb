Let's sum up how dumb this movie is with two details: Arnold for Antichrist: "Let's see who's bad," he said with a serious face. And you can tell they were not trying to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight the evil of all evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed Water, a crucifix, a priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes, not even Satan expected them to be so intelligent. <br /> <br /> After a captivating start (which reminds you of Devil's Advocate), it does not get anywhere. Someone get me those two hours of my life back. Never watch, rent it, not buy it. <br /> <br />
