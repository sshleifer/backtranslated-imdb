An anonymous movie that could have been directed by anyone. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of classics like "El Cid", "The Nude" or "The Man from Laramie"? are wonderful shots of airplanes in the clouds, affectionately filmed. The story is very banal, and almost completely devoid of dramatization. The couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about June Allyson's choice for his wife, IMHO, totally loses her. With her less-than-appealing look, her voice hoarse, she was the perfect housewife the script needed. At that time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not a single woman among the base staff, even at the table. All they had to do was worry about their husbands, who were fighting for democracy and against an Enemy whose name we never heard of, but in 1955, it was not difficult to guess. <br /> <br /> I wonder why a young man who has never seen a Mann movie should choose this among all the great movies he has made.
