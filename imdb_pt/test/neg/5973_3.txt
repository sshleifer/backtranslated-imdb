The title of this documentary is very misleading. At no point during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the Nile Perch fish on Lake Victoria has caused any of the problems faced by the town of Mwanza in Tanzania. The film tries to put the problems of Tanzania in an environmental cause, but the truth is that the problems come from a parasitic external force. The documentary is very slow, with no narrative. Instead, it relies on small text signals between any related segments to display information that does little to add or expand the subject. There are only two attempts to discuss the environmental effects of the Nile Perch fish. One is a small segment of about 10 seconds duration where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the Nile Perch was introduced into the lake and consumed the other species of fish. The filmmaker makes no attempt to follow the subject or deepen it. The second attempt is when in this documentary they filming the screening of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact that the Nile Perch introduced, and again no real attempt is made to expand how devastating the problem has become. <br /> <br /> The subject matter of this documentary has nothing to do with perch fish and more to the problems faced by most African countries. The film attempts to link the introduction of the Perch fish with AIDS, Poverty and Pollution in Tanzania, but never makes a direct connection. Like any smart person who deals well with problems in Africa, the problems shown here are not unique to Tanzania but affect most of Africa and have nothing to do with fish. It would have been great if the filmmakers had shown what the local economy or life was like before the fish was introduced and how it was negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish, but it did not. The fact is that many of the people interviewed say that fish provided jobs and opportunities for many. Yes, things are bad in the city of Mwanza, but they are worse in other parts of the country and the mainland. <br /> <br /> A weak attempt by documentarists to link fish to hunger problems in Tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. First, Tanzania is a very large country and Lake Victoria is only a small part of the country. Many of the people interviewed say they can go to Mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were very bad in other parts of the country. <br /> <br /> This documentary is very weak, has no narrative and does not really try to connect anything it displays to the Nile Perch. He plays with people's emotions, displaying images of the devastation of poverty, hunger and AIDS making no attempt to show him how none of this is exclusive to the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania or directly related to perch. The fact is that most problems have more to do with War, Globalization and Christianity than with the environmental effect of Perch fish itself.
