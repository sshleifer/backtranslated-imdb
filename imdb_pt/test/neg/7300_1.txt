A post-apocalyptic warrior departs to save some kind of nun and on the way finds some cyber-punks in skates who want to kick his ass. This is one of the most difficult to watch movies of all time. There are quiet scenes that seem to last for hours before someone comes out with the next poorly written and misinterpreted line. There are sequences of action that keep repeating - and we're not talking about the rapid repetition of 1-2-3 action in a particularly good kick that was popularized by the Eastern directors, we are talking about many, many repetitions of long and bad fight sequences. This is incredibly confusing at first, but it soon becomes annoying when you watch a 30-second sequence for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time. Any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confused continuity, the only thing that keeps this movie on the video machine (besides the bet of a friend I could not watch all the time without begging for it to be turned off). and safely disposed of so as not to harm anyone else) is the fact that, while painful, this film is unintentionally hilarious, I'm by no means a fan of those "so bad movies it's funny" but in some parts it was in tears. Other points to note are sound and image quality, but this is forgivable, since it is obvious that money was a major problem in the production of this film. Final verdict - King of the genre "so bad they're funny," anyone who has that kind of genre video in the night should get a copy. Also we must not forget that it is the worst film that I have seen.
