After spending half an hour examining Rumors, a gay bar located outside Tupelo, Mississippi, the SMALL TOWN GAY BAR shifts the focus to the murder of Scotty Weaver at Bay Minette to demonstrate the risks generated by the interviewees. But there is a problem here. Bay Minette is not near Tupelo, as the movie suggests. It is not even in the same state. In fact, it's about three hundred miles away on the coast of Alabama. <br /> <br /> Director Malcolm Ingram does not rush to point out this fact, nor does he bother to mention that although the Bay Minette itself is little more than a large site on the road, it is actually two deep breaths the main metropolitan area of ​​Mobile, Alabama - which has a notable gay community, some gay bars and even a congregation of the Church of the Metropolitan Community. If Ingram is not sincere in these points, one must ask if he is also in the others. Speaking as someone who was born, grew up and still living in Mississippi, I have to say I find most SMALL TOWN GAY BAR a lot of hooey. Neither Meridian nor Tupelo, the communities in which Ingram focuses, are as rural, small, or as isolated as you'd imagine, and gay bars are in fact more common in the state than the movie suggests. That said, Ingram ignores the fact that the absence of a gay bar does not mean the absence of a gay community, and in doing so demonstrates a deep ignorance about southern culture, which tends to keep those who frequent bars - whether they homosexual or heterosexual - in low esteem. SMALL TOWN GAY BAR is, in my opinion, an example where a filmmaker approached his subject with a personal agenda at hand and then proceeded to film the agenda. Do gays and lesbians living in the hinterland of Mississippi face major, sometimes scary, challenges? You bet they do - but this is no excuse to play with reality to such an extent. The DVD includes a track of comments and several deleted scenes, but I found the film itself so ridiculous that I wasted no time with it. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
