I just saw Coronado ... Around here the only line they invented to sell was "the FX team behind Independence Day". I think that says a lot. No talk about writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> It's a little adventure story set in a banana republic in Central America, but the plot is fine. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I've been wondering how this movie looks like the cut-scenes of some action-packed computer war game. Although FXs are good, they are often visible. Much like CG-style scenes like Command'n'Conquer. <br /> <br /> You almost instantly know that that particular truck, scenery, bridge, castle, or jet fighter never existed. The look is smooth and pleasant, but it does not conform to the standard we've come to expect from Action Adventures today. The film does not have many obvious filming locations. <br /> <br /> The acting, the plot is below average and the FXs are good, but not up to the standard of the feature films. I'm not surprised that this thing went straight to video / DVD. <br /> <br />
