I'm going to blockbuster, pick a random movie, have it, and yes. <br /> <br /> That ... it was a good sexual porn .. the kind of quality sucked, and kind of gave me the slightest headache. For me, this movie was good for its sexual stuff, but not so much for the horror and suspense. It was ... magical ... <br /> <br /> The suspense .. not as good as I would have expected. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat in the hope of jumping in fear, but instead I lay down on the couch and did not see much. <br /> <br /> The quality .. is not really very good. I mean, if you pay close attention, during the time people are in the COLD mountains, they barely wear anything. That does not make much sense either. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for crap, it's not really a suspense, and a movie that's practically sexual, you have it.
