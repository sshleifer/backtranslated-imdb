Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV movie, has to be the hottest thing on two legs. Wow. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a distortion of 100% of the history of Hercules. Like "Troy," this movie has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes him especially insulting is that they actually invented a gay character just so people could hate him, making him as vile and vile as any character in TV or movie history. This is threefold insulting, since Hercules may have had a wife since it was the expectation of those ancient times, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. So it's ironic that they create a real gay adversary character for this movie. No, it's not ironic. Evil. The creators of this farce should be ashamed.
