I remember when they did a great thing about it when I was leaving. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. It debuted at the opening weekend at number two behind Indiana Jones and Last Crusade. Then he dove. Critics hated this movie. I do not remember seeing a good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I did not know what they meant at the time, but now I do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women being slapped and nearly raped, and a disgusting bar bathroom with overflowing urinals hahaha. When I was younger, I did not care about that. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! <br /> <br /> Now I find this really bad, but still fun to watch from time to time when it's paired with Bodyslam (which has a better story). First, Hulk Hogan's acting skills are not great. he is one-dimensional as the character he plays in the wrestling ring. And, in fact, Rip and Hulk are not far from each other. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he is not good at playing the villain. He is best in comedy and characters of nervous drama. It simply is not believable like Brell. There is not much character development in this movie and the ones that suffer are the characters of Randy, brother of Rip and Charlie, the trainer (in the wrestling of an unknown instructor carving a wrestler to the ring lol). Tiny Lister plays with Zeus the way it should be played, so there's no problem there. Joan Severence is passable and for all her softcore dogs she has a scene of lingerie lol. In the end, you know, what's the point? <br /> <br /> For this (as with other movies or wrestling movies that feature wrestlers as the main star), turn off your brain. You will have more fun if you do.
