I remember all the hype surrounding this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Rice's novels, my first thought was "how can they do the Queen of the Damned without making Vampire Lestat first?" <br /> <br /> Having finally seen the movie, now I can see how they did it. If you read these books, imagine taking the bloody parts of Vampire Lestat, putting Marcus and Marius into a character, and removing everything that relates to Lestat's beginning (wolf hunting, his violin playing, Vampire Theater and also Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes topping Queen Of The Damned. <br /> <br /> What we lose is a very important part of Lestat's character. His inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with Louis, Armand, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. <br /> <br /> It is also important for the story that we miss the "Story of the Twins", which is the Genesis of the vampires of Rice. And although I'm sure that the cannibalism would be intense to be displayed on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> Even worse, we have this love interest between Jessie and Lestat. The Vampire Chronicles is basically an American story of Yoni. For those who do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese Porn Comics). But in Yoni, these are gay male relationships, told by a woman. Although I'm sure many men oppose the "homosexuality" of the characters, in this film they went to the opposite extreme of the way. For instead of Lestat persuading assassins, he looks for young female groupies. <br /> <br /> And the other flaws in logic and plot are vast. At first, Lestat emerges from a long century of sleep and later asks Marius how he spent the '50s in red velvet. Marius has no idea who Elvis is and says he slept during that time. It makes you wonder how Lestat knows about the fashion and music of the 50's, since he himself slept in the same time period. And nothing is even mentioned about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think this is a great shame. It's like seeing "Snow White and the 3 Dwarves". <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie I thought was very bad. The only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the acting was bad, the accent made me climb the wall, and all the really deep parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like Enkil after he was sucked. /> <br /> If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get Lost Boys, the original Interview With A Vampire, or even some old episodes of Dark Shadows. Leave this a rest to piece with a stake in the heart, garlic cloves around the neck and a bottle of holy water in the mouth. <br /> <br /> In the end, remember that before Aaliyah was killed, it was intended to go straight to the video, no theatrical release was planned. Now it's obvious why this happened. It's just sad that someone as talented as she will be remembered by this dog from a movie, instead of something she could actually have shone. <br /> <br /> I rate this as a 2 on a scale of 1-10. .
