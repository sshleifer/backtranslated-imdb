This movie was not as bad as the story, but the camera work is what makes it difficult to watch. I do not like the "realist" camera work being done today; you know the type jumping out of the center, panning around, etc. What pissed me off particularly about this movie though, was the new thing they threw in the mix, filming some black and white pictures in each scene. I think the film would have been much better if the camera work had been filmed in a much more conventional way because, as it was, I could not concentrate on it and saw myself analyzing the camera work. Perhaps, if more people express dissatisfaction with camera work like this, the filmmakers will finally understand the tip.
