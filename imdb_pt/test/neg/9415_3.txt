You know I only watched 15 minutes of this movie, so I can not describe how great it is. I want to say that the concept alone is so unique and intriguing that it simply did not let me go. Then there's the mass of award-winning academy people involved here, plus the academy-nominated director. YOU CAN NOT WALK. I mean, it's the middle of the night and you're still not sleepy. This movie comes on. You watch and you're shocked. It's so brilliant, so original is so good. It will feel like half an hour later you turned the screen off, but when you go to your bed, you see it's only 15 minutes past midnight. ENJOY !!! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
