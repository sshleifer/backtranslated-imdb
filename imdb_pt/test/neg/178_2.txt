I do not understand why this film received such good reviews from critics - - I've seen dozens of (on TV) documentaries on the wine world that were much better when (if) you watch, please think of two annoying aspects of Mondovino: First, the filming is horrible, terrible and disturbing: for me, it looked like the guy behind the camera just received the material and was playing with it: lots of zooms (no purpose other than pressing the in / out button) for example - I almost stopped to watch because of it! Second, the interviewer (I think the director) is not really relevant: he looks and asks questions like a Boy Scout, not as a journalist, even though the general idea and themes are interesting, a bad conclusion: overestimated documentary maybe just for the guys who know nothing about wine => not recommended at all (2/10)
