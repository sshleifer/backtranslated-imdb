Maybe it was the overweight gain Seagal had won. Or maybe it was Wayans horrible performance in an action movie. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two main characters? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal should never have made this nightmare. It is true that the plot was good. However, as an avid follower of Seagal's career and experience, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his clean, pure, healthy Zen-Buddhist life-style, notably in his screen discussions with Wayans. (So ​​again, his real-life affair with the "nanny" was also inconsistent!) If Seagal wants to become a more diverse actor, then he should do what a co-worker did in "Kindergarten Cop." ... put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way. Otherwise, leave the cracks wise and futile attempts at humor by pursuing a serial killer. Seagal is not a kind of natural humor. Did not work. <br /> <br />
