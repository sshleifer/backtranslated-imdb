This movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest reputation) who are going to a small fort to take over the estate of a newly deceased uncle, where they plan to settle. Upon arrival in a nearby town, they will not find anyone going there (even though it's only 15 miles away), so they walk. When they arrive there, they discover that there are no soldiers, but rather a good number of people who took care of the fort and built a small town nearby. They soon find out that something is not right here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as the locals call it) is in serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead of getting into the plot, I'll make some comments about things I noticed in the movie. Firstly the acting is very flat, only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe. My first one was poor performance, but in the end I watched some of the outtakes and those same people became live. So my only thought is that this is how the director wanted it. In addition to poor performance, I have a big problem where people do not react to a particular set of circumstances. Take for example no one would take them to Ft McMillan for any price, although its only 15 miles away. However, when we get to Fort, we find that it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom must receive supplies from someone, not to mention mail, etc. This must happen in 1867 but we can see The train car has electric lights (they are not at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general styles of locomotives so popular at the time. There are also places where you can see paved pavement (and maybe a car at one point, did not want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. If they had followed the rules of the "world" they created and let the actors be actors, they could have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 that I gave, and they rewritten 4 more times, which could have done even better .
