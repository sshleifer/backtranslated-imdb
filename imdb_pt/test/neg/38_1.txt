I just came here to check out the Terror Hospital for an alternate title so I know what not to pick up. Not only do I get the original title, but I also found out that the Terror Hospital is one of the other seven nicknames. This is a real clunker. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for various reasons, mostly unintended consequences of the feature at all levels of production that result in at least a light form of entertainment, especially fun. That does not have any of that. Instead, the viewer bears witness to an unnecessary and very convenient redundant exposure to the situation and draws scenes of characters that move cautiously from room to room, and all of that is half the film. Forget trying to figure out where someone is (or who they are) during dark or night scenes as well; you probably will not care, anyway. There is also a random sequence of car chases that seems rather monotonous compared to some of the older movies that I love ... er, I mean, I watched and went back to high school. Really, we're talking about mysticism, possession and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for junk. Unfortunately, there is nothing here to make it even "good" junk; when coupled with the above mentioned, the effects of bad action and not so special are just that - bad effects and not so special. This is just trash, pure and simple. Leave it on the rack in the pawn shop or in that box on the yard sale. There is a reason for this ...
