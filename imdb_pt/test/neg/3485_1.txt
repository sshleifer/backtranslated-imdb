I was fortunate to grow surfing in San Diego (not the biggest waves in the world, but it was a childhood hell, I'll tell you this) and I've seen MANY of the so-called surfer flicks in my life. After watching NORTH SHORE for the first time now, all I can say is THANK GOD I've never seen this as a child. If I had seen this and mistakenly thought this was a realistic picture of the surfing scene, I would sell my picture and get totally involved, I do not know, accounting or something. <br /> Seriously, this movie has as much in common with real surf as the TOP GUN was the real military life. The acting sucks, the music is worse, the cinematography is dubious at best and OH MY GOD what was Laird Hanilton thinking?! WOW!!! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! SUCKS !!! If you want a REAL surf movie, see GIANT RIDING. Hell, watch SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. Sucks. Is bad. Sucks REAL bad. Brah. ;) PS: I had to change my summer of "WTF?!" for wtf because apparently we should whisper on this site. Do not scream !!! (shhhhhh!); D
