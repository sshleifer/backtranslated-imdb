PDQ Bach did better. Much of the talk about "Bach" is written letters to several patrons complaining about the amount and speed of their payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, especially on the death of children and other family matters, is somewhat more engaging. The music is disconcerting: 17th century chapel orchestras and choirs that produce the sound of the concert hall of the twentieth century. The overall quality of production reminded me of a junior slide show. Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This movie does not add anything. Netflix sent me two discs that would not be played, so I broadcast the movie. Clearly Netflix was trying to tell me something.
