I really do not care about that. If they had got rid of the comedy / slapstick and focused on the dramatic / philosophical aspects of the script, it might be worth it. The more the film continued, the less I liked the protagonist / postman. He has interesting things to say, but he is also an insecure and hypocritical idiot. <br /> <br /> 3/10
