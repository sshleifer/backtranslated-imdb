The One is a very appropriate name show, mainly because it comes close to being the only network exhibited in prime time that little more than one person is watching. <br /> <br /> When I first heard The One, I thought to myself "Weee !! Another music show! We do not have enough of that!" and then proceeded to tie my helmet and run through my house, banging my head on blind objects and sharp corners. Because in all honesty, the constant pain and suffering throughout the year inflicted by having only one or two reality-based shows simply is not enough. We needed another. And not just anyone - "THE" One. The one with slightly less attractive competitors, with a little less talent. The one with a little less than a point, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario where this is possible. The one with useless scenes from the competitors when they are not performing included. Because I care about what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his spare time! I really do! Now, you may be thinking, "Hey, across the continent of North America, less than 4 million people watched the first episode, does not that mean it's a drug?" Well, for that I say that less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news now, does not it? Think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, The One can be horribly unoriginal, a sight that even the air station could not bother to promote because it also realizes just how utterly useless it is, but it's still non-syphilis! Yay!
