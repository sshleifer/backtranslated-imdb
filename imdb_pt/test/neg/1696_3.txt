Pat O'Brien plays Knute Rockne, the All-American football coach Notre Dame. Undoubtedly, this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of the "Knute Rockne All-American Football Notre Dame" - is probably more interesting for fans of football and / or football Notre Dame. You'll see some good documentary-style footage. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's hard to recommend this as a MOVIE. It is not much more than a historical document. You will "know" that the end is near when Gale Page calms down - and do not blink or miss Ronald Reagan by doing, of all things, "Camille"! <br /> *** Knute Rockne - All-American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale, Ronald Reagan Page
