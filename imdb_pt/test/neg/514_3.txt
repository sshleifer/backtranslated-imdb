Pun intended. This low-budget action / horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things up is the material the direct fare for video is made of. <br /> <br /> The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who is attacked by local authorities. law enforcement after he is forced to shoot down creatures of the night in view of the public. The police chase after him, vampires chase him, he responds kicking ... a lot. <br /> <br /> There's a bit more in the story, but it's so inconsequential that I honestly can not remember; I think people actually spoke in the movie, but this is under discussion. The plot is nothing more than a set-up for Wilson killing as many vampires as possible at runtime, usually kicking them. <br /> <br /> Technical specifications are, in a word, anemic. Low color treatment, amateur use of lighting, simplistic camera use and angle. Blood and blood are perceptibly limited, strange to this type of film. The most painful of the filming flaws is the abrupt switch to the super-unstable camera during each fight scene. If the camera starts to sway like a monkey reese at speed, then you know that Don is about to start kicking everything in sight. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with some friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise, do not watch unless you really enjoy seeing things being kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
