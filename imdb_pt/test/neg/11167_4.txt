This is a rip-off of already bad Hollywood movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school students try a joke with the class asthmatic maladjustment, but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie, you know what's going to happen before it happens all the time, it's no good if a movie tries to be scary. The actors are very well and the girls are cute (after all, they are Asian) so I'm going to give two of five in the mojave'o'meter.
