While the new Pride and Prejudice movie is beautiful to watch, and the soundtrack is adorable, we're not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is, for some reason, portrayed in the early 1790s, instead of the regency period in which the novel is set, as academics have long demonstrated. The Bennets Longbourn property is barred and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. However, the Bennets in the novel are of the gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk around the house, nor the manure corral and chicken droppings are contiguous to the house. Scenes are redefined from the novel and, let's not forget, Jane Austen has placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film places the great scene of Darcy's proposal outside in a storm in front of a neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside Collins's parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put her in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total honesty, brutally to each other in this scene, the Collins never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the proposal outdoors? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth crosses a windy field to stand on a cliff and see the panorama, she is expected to weep "Heathcliffe" at any moment! Austen was Bronteized! Judy Dench is a great actress, but Lady Catherine must be tall and impressive. Little Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dance with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another of my favorite MI-5s on A & E; in P & P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling - although Austen notices in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy for a bit, and she notices it when she sees her wonderful smiling portrait in Pemberley - a portrait that in this film is for some reason replaced by a carved marble bust. And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern discourse. Mr. Bingley was turned into a clown who wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The main point is that while this is a great movie to watch and listen, it deviates so much from Jane Austen's novel that any student attending it, thinking it could replace reading with reading, would fail!
