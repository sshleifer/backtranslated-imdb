So we must find it funny that this woman travels to the jungle - to the war zone - only to find out why her fianc√©e did not travel to Switzerland? Or should we take this seriously? It's not even remotely funny, clever or funny - it's stupid - and so is the movie. The lead actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a movie - even worse than Jar-Jar Binks. The dialogue tries a lot to be funny (almost all the time), but it never is. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And as for the plot - have they even once bothered to explain to us which rebels are fighting (besides being anti-government)? I think it did not matter to anyone - not to the rebels or the characters who simply flew blindly to the battlefield. Do not waste your time. "Coronado" is not funny or funny.
