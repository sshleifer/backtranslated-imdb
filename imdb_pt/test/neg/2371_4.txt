Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour take this film, not without effort, since the script was obviously hastily patched up of old episodes. When it came out, this must have been a real disappointment, as it is also done in a bus ticket budget. Attempts to get him out of the house - which is a little unrecognizable, a bad job all over - with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing match at the local gym simply do not work. Most of these are just character light settings for a solitary non-particularly good joke. That said, the interaction of Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone else's with him) is largely hilarious; They even manage to do a siphon job, but you can see the bout with recycling a literally uninspired script that changes the plot to the middle. Don Warrington has very little to do except "be black," and due to the random script, Christopher Strauli changes character at least twice. And in the end, as he always did on the TV series (though you may not remember - read the scripts), Eric Chappell disappoints him with a 'time-out' ending. Were they so cynical, or too desperate to be in the movie business? Rossiter and de la Tour are always funny, but like a movie, it's a terrible post-script for a TV series that remembers a lot. REST IN PEACE.
