I kept waiting for the movie to thrill me, to inspire me, to shock me, to make me sad in some way, but it did not stir my emotions. It just snaked to the end. None of the characters seemed too original or complex, they just looked like actors reciting their lines. I think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was believable was the veteran and probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, time and mine. If there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it is certainly well hidden or I am very dense, which I doubt.
