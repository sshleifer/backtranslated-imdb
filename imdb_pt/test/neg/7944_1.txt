I do not think it necessary to outline the plot for you, because the site and other users have already done a great job. That being said, here is my opinion. This is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there have been some really bad ones. I do not even need to go into detail because there is NOTHING redeemed about this movie. Bad acting, bad plot, bad direction, bad special effects - you choose. If you're not alone as the worst movie of all time, you're tied up with some other crap. I would be ashamed to have my friends knowing that I was in this movie. But hey, most people who will see this will do it, no matter what it turns out, then more power for you. When you feel the emptiness between your neurons two hours after your night, do not blame me.
