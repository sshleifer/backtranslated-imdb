I do not understand how some people might be playing "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many best first person shooter games available. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that uses no imaginative idea in its armament. All weapons in the game are real-life weapons, but there could be at least a scam that would allow players to gain access to a "supernatural" weapon, like the all-powerful BFG in Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually. This can become extremely annoying, especially in the middle of a gunfight when you are so close to killing the enemy. The reloading delay also gives the feeling that the weapon is slow in performing its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many character choices to choose from. As I recall, there are four types of characters for terrorist and counter-terrorist forces. This means that many of the characters look the same as each other, which actually reduces the realism of the game. <br /> <br /> The game is very sexist when it comes to character selections. In the initial version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose (in the Terrorist force selection) that was good for female players. In more recent versions, however, the female character has been deleted and replaced by another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed with the latest versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the game maps are very small. The largest map seems to be the desert map, but it has standard details. In fact, all game maps have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most unimaginative first person shooter of all time. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste your time on this boring game? It's best to play the Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom games. Avoid this overrated and overrated game. <br /> <br /> I give the game 1/10.
