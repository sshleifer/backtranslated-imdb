"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in the direction of strange behavior, but this episode focuses on other people in the unpredictable life of Clark Kent. When a poisonous flower finds its way to Smallville, Jonathan Kent is the first to be affected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it affects Jonathan, he becomes temperamental and violent, but Clark manages to stop him from doing anything hasty until his father finally faints. OK. So far, so good. the next one is Lana. The episode was good up to that point, because the flower causes her to try to seduce Clark. at the last moment, he refuses, but the damage has already been done. This episode causes the wrong impressions and is not suitable for people under twenty due to adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect the flower has on Pete) was good, but in the middle it was all about Lana's alternate personality, it was not defiantly, and it ruined what could have been a brilliant Episode. I give this episode two.
