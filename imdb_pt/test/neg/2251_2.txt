I'm sorry, people, but I have to say that I really can not understand the overwhelming feelings that everyone has about watching this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my watch to know how much longer did I have to spend on this absurd kindergarten. <br /> <br /> So, why this verdict? <br /> <br /> First of all: The film tells a story that brings no emotion! It's not even the fun and twisted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we used to know. This story could have come out of every child's head. There is nothing clever about it or anything inventive and it goes on for hours ... the story has appropriate content for about 30 min. The rest is just amazingly improved scenes that should make a cool picture. Does not work. Even the previously seen cuts that Tarantino usually uses only confuse and are by no means legal. <br /> <br /> Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill Nazis. Ah really? They? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of men, one of them being man enough to die rather than cheating on his comrades. Is this the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give the Nazis? A brave soldier who is braver than any of the "bastards"? Certainly not -> fail And what about the terrible Basterds Nazi murderers? Well, they're all killed by Nazis, except for two being held hostage -> wow, what terrible vengeful monsters they are ... Third: Any character? Yes, one! The only role and only glimmer of hope for the entire movie is Chritoph Waltz, who is building a truly deep and very detailed character here. Great performance! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely outdone by Waltz. I've never seen such a weak performance for Pitt ... And the rest? Well, some Germans you've never seen before and you'll never see them afterwards. When the film began and I saw the group of seven Basterds, I expected to see something like the "Magnificent Seven": a group of extraordinary faces, each with a distinct character, making their way to their fearless fate and knowing ... I was very disappointed when I saw the "Inglourious Basterds". No details, no characters, no real men, just a few random faces that you will not remember and have not had a chance to differentiate ... But you really do not even have to differentiate because the "Inglourious Basterds" "Except Pitt hardly has any part in this movie ... <br /> <br /> So I was very disappointed, and seeing this movie in the # 40 place of the biggest movies of all time is the only thing about it, that leaves me open mouth ...
