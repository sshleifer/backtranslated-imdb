The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie. And once you see the cover of this movie of a frozen zombie coming out of your cryogenic camera, you'll think it was in the movie B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's how I approached this movie. But boy, I was in a shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I love B movies too. Nothing makes my day more than a little movie about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. But to say that this film was missing is a euphemism. This movie was pure junk. You would think that zombies would look like what the box cover art displays, but instead you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any Halloween display counter. In addition, the script is beyond pitiful. Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm Mary, played by Blair. Not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of Joseph's character. Instead we see the head of cryogenic laboratories, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to pick up the corpses and try out his organs. There is no emotion or anything to make you believe that you should give a shit about someone in this movie. <br /> <br /> All and all, very disappointing. All the elements to make a great horror movie were there. You've had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and little or no sense of direction have ruined everything. Overall, 4 out of 10
