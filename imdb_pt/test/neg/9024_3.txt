John Wayne worshipers will cringe when they watch the Lawless Frontier. Even for a poverty line studio, this is a stinkeroo. <br /> <br /> Unusual for a Westerner, we have a criminal who is a sex offender. Earl Dwire plays a white mestizo and Indian who, for reasons that are not explained, pretends that it is a Mexican accent and mushy. Dwire sounds like the Frito Bandito of advertising fame in the past. <br /> <br /> He and his gang take over Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheila Terry. They really do not have anything worth stealing, but Dwire just wants an excuse to kidnap Terry and do whatever he wants with her. She listens to the cowardly fate she has in the store and she and Hayes run away from the ranch. <br /> <br /> Where they find John Wayne, who is on the trail of the bad guys. They also come across a very stupid sheriff who believes Wayne is one of the bad guys. Again, for reasons I can not understand. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult way to make a living working on such operas for the duke. Luckily, better things were on the way.
