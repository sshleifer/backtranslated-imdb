I was hoping to enjoy this movie, to accommodate myself on a night of fun fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be fun. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found myself dozing over and over again. Judy Davis performed well but had very little to work on. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected but had very little to do. The plot was full of "twists" that were simply silly, and as so often happens in such films, no one acted the way a real human being acted. And personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was totally wrong. <br /> <br /> The film also seemed to shift midway between a black comedy with farcical touches to a total farce with touches of black comedy. One reviewer here notes that other comments seem to want this film to be something different and therefore doomed it. All I can say is that I would have contented myself with the movie being * something * and continuing with it. This looks like the director had some great ideas, but was not able to pull them out. I give a 4 out of 10.
