At the heart of almost every major crime thriller is a carefully considered, meticulously planned supercrime that 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of vulnerable and moral grayscale people for whom life is not. fair, for whom returning to man is, well, something worth twisting. Writer James V. Simpson's script, for the first time, is kind of right. He has made more than a double certainty that we have nothing but sympathy for veteran Iraqi veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short), who is about to have his house taken by an evil bank (brother, me) . I've been there). And he gave Ty a good friend of the family in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super cool and got a job at the armored car company he works with, with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and a weird French guy (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play tricks, but they're also expensive for armored cars, so that means they carry guns and they're tough. <br /> <br /> After a short time, as theoretically observes Armored, one can begin to think like I did, that maybe - just maybe - this is going to be some kind of awesome, ironic movie with some features that move the story along its natural course, raising the personal bets of everyone involved in the hope of revealing a very, really clever plan with many potential "fucking" moments. I mean, just music is a movie-assault book - hard, edgy, beating overtime, while we're dealing with close-ups of characters who say things like "I actually do," and "Are you nuts?" "For about 45 minutes, the movie had some serious potential to make a genre." <br /> <br /> So things start to really smell.These guys, these jerks, have no plans.There's no "Okay, here's what we're going to do ... "scene, no plants, no explosives, no black van or ski masks (despite its 'run-test', as can be seen in a trailer.) No, these guys will steal $ 42 million dollars from their own trucks (which are only being tracked by HOURLY in contact with the radio, despite being equipped with a sophisticated "GPS technology"), and they are not even going to sit down and discuss it. , Mike just tells Ty about the plan the night before, which is completely ridiculous.But of course Ty has to think about his house as long as Mike promises that "no one is going to get hurt," he is on board. that, however, somebody gets hurt, why, because, besides taking the trucks to an abandoned factory To hide the money, they have no plans. That's it. That was how far they thought things were. Then, of course, things begin to unfold. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared. <br /> <br /> This script frankly sounds like the product of a bad improvisation game: "Armored Car, stolen by its own guards ... GO!" Despite some kind of decent buildup that could have taken the movie in some interesting directions, history simply melts away, and then NOTHING makes sense, or is remotely plausible. <br /> <br /> When filmmakers do not have a cool "hook" for theft, their characters look stupid and crippled. And when the characters are stupid and incompetent, it's hard for an audience to invest in them and their story. And when that happens, any suspense drains the underside of the film, leaving a hollow shell laughable. <br /> <br /> Ignore it. 3/10
