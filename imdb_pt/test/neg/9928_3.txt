... than you easily realize the biggest flaw in the movie. What was the reason? The details of the murders were used but never explained. I think the team got a lot in the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely missing. There is no discussion to follow. I think if this was done correctly, the movie would have lasted a little longer, but it would have been worth it, at least for me. <br /> <br /> Casting is very good, I loved Wilson as the vulnerable Vicky. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say, really. But I really wish they would focus a little more on the less obvious. <br /> <br />
