Barbershop 2: Back to business was not as good as original, but it was so funny. The film itself lacked little things that the original performed which made it much more enjoyable. Back to Business seemed to be just another useless sequel to bring money with a very thin plot. Cedric the Entertainer's excruciating excuses for flashbacks ruined the film and it seemed like a bad way to try to get the audience to fit the character more. Overall Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a continuation not necessary without the original charm, soul and spark.
