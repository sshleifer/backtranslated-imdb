Do not kill me, but I have something to say about it. <br /> <br /> Pros: Well, the lighter season I've seen of all the seasons that are out there in Inuyasha only has tobe the Shichinintai bow. Unlike the rest of the seasons, I personally think this one has one more plot and these mercenaries; Good God, they're such nice characters. Shame they were killed. Of course, I would write a 15-page article because I like Shichinintai so much, but it would be annoying for some of you. So this series really does have some nice characters. I'll miss Bankotsu ... poor, poor psycho boy. <br /> <br /> Cons: Out of Shichinintai's bow, the series was totally boring, repetitive and some of the characters are extremely annoying. Kagome for example: She reacts too much to my taste; she acts as Yuka of Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: He's a high-spirited demon with a huge sword. What is so unique about it? He has adorable dog ears! Tch. Sesshomaru is all talk, actionless and very arrogant. Naraku has just been the vilest villain that ever existed in the anime world. Miroku and Sango ... they have some color, but they seem to be on the side too. But what bothers me the most is the fact that they have absolutely NO COMMON SENSE. Rumiko Takahashi did a lot better than that. I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like series with lots of action, no annoying love triangle, no repetitiveness, this is not for you then.
