I do not care what anyone says, this movie sucked. The only thing we had was the camera work which was very well done. As for the dialogue, I've heard so many people talking ... it was a drug too. Yes, it was honest and true to life, but from there, I can hear someone talking like that on the street, or in a fast food diner. What made the dialogue good in films like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park was the fact that it is a WRITTEN dialogue, which takes time to reflect on. Another thing was that the director should not put himself in the picture. I believe the male character could have been much stronger, but instead looked weak. In fact, the movie seemed to revolve around the male character, and then he disappeared completely in the last twenty minutes. The girl in the movie I found completely repulsive, not in appearance, but in her poor and needy ways. Saying she's in love with a guy, and actually getting jealous of him the next day, what crappy shit. Final thing: the sound was terrible, and I hope it was just something that plagued my theater instead of actually being in the final cut of the movie. There was a constant buzz during several scenes and it was clearing the conversation. The only good thing again was Blood's work as DP, but the actress who played the main guy's ex-girlfriend did a great job too. These two things could not save a terrible movie, which I refuse to call a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
