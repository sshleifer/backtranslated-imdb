I was anxious to see this movie, unfortunately I should have listened to the advice of my daughters. This should have been a parody, but it assumed a realism that corporations had much to answer. Jim Carrey after all the work he did is still Jim Carrey and his comedy has no better, his co-star was not able to support him. Their son in the movie was invisible. <br /> <br /> The life of the crime was a blink of an eye, and that was the film's missing link. The movie showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, which they lost to me. <br /> <br /> I laughed at some parts but overall it was not good enough, AlecBaldwin felt it was there to add some weight to the movie. His character was not strong enough. There were just too many gaps to make this a clever and tight movie.
