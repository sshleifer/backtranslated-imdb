I have to hold my hand and say that I was one of the first (and probably the last !!!) to see this movie. Where I start, it's a complete mess. The main attraction, of course, was the soundtrack. What is obvious is brilliant - that's what Himesh does best. But, as they say, do not give up on your daily work - HR definitely should not. <br /> <br /> HR's acting is simply plain horrible. Even if the movie has a plot, what puzzles you most is why this man is on the screen and what the heck is doing there. Two words of advice for HR - give up acting and, secondly, use chapstick. <br /> <br /> HR has no onscreen presence, no acting ability, and the female leadership seems a bit too young for him. As for Malika Sherawat - just the same old Bollywood vampire crap. <br /> <br /> You can pack the product as much as you want, but if there is no substance, it will not be safe. Do not waste your money ...
