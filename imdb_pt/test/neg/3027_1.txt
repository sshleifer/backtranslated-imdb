Begotten is undoubtedly someone's attempt at originality, but what we have here is art in its most morbid and grotesque form, so that's why Begotten has my respect, but to be realistic, it does not make any difference. abomination is about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the incoherent horror, we begin in an unknown time, in an unknown place. Right away, we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is generated, a god is, seemingly depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, I mean, really trying like hell to end it all, it takes a while (why not after that ultra introduction It's something that's coming up, something's coming up from the corpse, say hello to Mother Earth. "" Well, she gives birth to something. "" It probably would rather stay in the womb, but it's life. Begotten's psychotic embraces the thing in the only way he knows.The thing, along with Mother Earth, is mutilated by strangers, hooded, robbers, with evil intentions being the only clarity available.Thereafter, things drag on like never dragged Not to give the impression that I do not recommend this badness, because I do it, but only once, and only for a short time. ssoas with an appreciation for the dark side. <br /> <br /> From my description, it may seem that I do not "get" generated. Trust me, I get it, and yes, Begotten is art if I've ever seen it. Everything in this film, no matter how related it may seem, is significant. That, perhaps, is the only thing that makes Begotten's art. With that being said, most of us require some kind of entertainment value, and this comes from someone who liked The Chooper. Probably the first five more intriguing minutes I've seen in a movie, but let's face it, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it's just for some kind of psychedelic purpose, in that case, no it matters. But how could anyone classify a masterpiece so boring? Depending on how much your attention can last, it should be 1 or 10, any other number simply would not make a statement. It hurts to do that, but as for the value of entertainment, that's not all. 1/1
