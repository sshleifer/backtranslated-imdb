I've seen this movie for a long time and it's still one of the worst I've ever seen. I really like movies; science fiction, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. It is not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but they all exploded. I did not want to see this movie, but my friends insisted on watching it. I did not know this was crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino crossed Texas, killing everyone on the way (especially the scene with the alcoholic shooting was excellent), but at their turning point, everything changed at the bar. Stupid vampires have taken over and what could have been a perfect gangster movie has become a dumb horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a true horror movie. And when you love bloodstolling thrillers do not watch at all, you will be very disappointed in the end.
