This movie literally does not have a redeeming feature. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©s, incredibly misogynist and stupid. The script seems to have been patched up from 100 other films, the acting is horrible, and a little rough humor made me feel nauseous. What a shame, Gregory Poirier, for thinking NOBODY would be funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in several years.
