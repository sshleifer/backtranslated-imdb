The story of an erupting volcano in downtown Los Angeles seems like a great plot for a catastrophe movie. This, however, is missing bigtime. The film seems chaotic, has a plot that is difficult to follow or believe and the acting was very bad. <br /> <br /> I agree with many comments that Lee Jones is good at sending out on people as a whole. boss in some private field. In this, he is directing the emergency office. Being head of such an office, it is of course a good idea to take your daughter to dangerous scenes. Smart thinking. Ann Heche tapping walls and walking in tunnels that supposed to be 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes, right Apart from the bad acting, these factual errors make the film look as silly as Armageddon. The only good point of this movie is that there is Ben Affleck to make things even worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
