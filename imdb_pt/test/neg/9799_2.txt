Flesh Feast begins at Miami Airport, reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) calls his mate Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to warn him that he has just returned from South America where he was investigating Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) & he was in a big story, but while still talking on the phone, he is stabbed in the back and dead. Schuman meets with Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, who is also an executive producer) who has recently been released from a psychiatric institution, and together they discuss their terrible plans. The news of Cater's death hit Casey and he decides to take the story to himself and do some investigations, in fact he manages to get his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to do most of the investigations and just report him lazy . Virginia informs Casey that they have someone inside called Kristine (Heather Hughes) since Dr. Frederick rents her extra rooms to the nurses, Kristine reports to Casey about the grotesque restoration experiments of Schuman and Dr. Frederick involving human flesh and specially cultivated larvae ... <br /> <br /> Co written, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a very poor film on all accounts. First let's start with the screenplay by Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for cinematography (you have the impression that most cast and crew had more than one job), it's basically terrible. The characters are one-dimensional idiots and have no personality, I did not like anyone in this movie. Why worth it I like some of the ideas here, the carnivorous worms, the basement lab, stealing bodies from a hospital and that unforgettable twisting finale that is almost worth sitting in the rest of the movie on its own. Unfortunately the dialogue is so poorly written, hard and unnatural sounding false, that is, there is a scene in which a nurse says "will not let us leave the house," which is fine except for the fact that she is talking OUT in the garden for someone. No thought has been put in the story, since no explanation is given as to why carnivorous worms are able to restore youth, actually, in a point near the end, when asked about it himself, Dr. Frederick asserts that there is no time to explain at that point, which to me seems that the people who wrote this also had no idea! Even in an extremely short, 68-minute Flesh Feast, it's very slow and bland, poor editing does not help with scenes and photos that last a long time, for example, there is a scene where an ambulance parks outside of a hospital. to the doors, the guy goes out, he walks to the back doors and opens them etc. etc. Do we really need to see every detail? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on some gloves, so she takes them to the opposite room and places another pair! I personally think Grinter probably has not recorded enough material for him to stretch each scene as much as he can to increase the run time. I like this bizarre ending, I really like it. Technically, the meat feast sucks, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it must have been small, very small. Just about the whole movie happens in a house, Dr. Frederick's lab consists of a table, some plastic cups and test tubes, some old electronic medical equipment and a strange screen with funny colors (do not ask). Cinematography is poor, music is a drug and the whole film seems nicknamed, also called evil. The elements of exploration are also disappointing, there are a few shots of larvae, but they do nothing but squirm a bit, there is a brief scene in which a corpse has its sawed leg and a cadaver dismembered on the hooks. The acting is bad for everyone involved, and I'm talking very badly, which makes the idiot dialogue even worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yeah, there are one or two unintentional funny moments and that ending is pretty unique, to say the least, but mostly it's a true amateur movie that quickly becomes painful to watch . I doubt most people can get through this is a session, I can tolerate just about anything, but even I considered shutting it down. Definitely one to avoid, you will be glad you did and if you really have to see this do not say you were not warned!
