I've been a classic horror fan all my life. Many evenings stretched into the early hours of the morning watching Universal's "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night." Unfortunately, I saw this movie earlier in the evening and it still almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything was so important. Dr. Edelmann does not seem to believe in the supernatural, but in a short time he is treating Dracula medically and watching Larry Talbot transform into the Wolf Man while barely blinking an eye. He and Talbot discover the monster Frankenstein as if it were a daily occurrence. Edelmann is all excited to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina protest, he says "Aww, you're right. It's no big deal." After realizing Dracula's betrayal, he opens the earl's coffin in the sunlight and POOF !, he's gone, anyway. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not seem to be just phoning her was Jane Adams as Nina. Her reward is being rebounded from the hunchback on her back in a hole by the monster Frankenstein at the end of the movie ... and no one even try to rescue her! She, Dr. Edelmann and the Monster die, while Talbot and Miliza casually leave the castle. <br /> <br /> Definitely the low point for Universal during its classic years of terror.
