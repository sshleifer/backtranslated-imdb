We rented the movie and maybe the worst movie ever. The box they had in the store had a cool monster on the cover, but in reality the monster was a black lagoon mask creature. Terrible, horrible, horrible ... you really may have to rent it, it's so bad. It sounds like you're watching a bizzare homemade movie.
