First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this film. However, having said that, I can not say it was a "good" movie. I entered the theater with very low expectations (something I learned to do). Glad I did, because the plot and development was not stellar. The jokes were low humor. But, I was in the right mindset to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I was not the only one. In fact, the whole theater was laughing loudly. I did not hear anyone complaining after the movie came to an end. I even saw a guy fall out of his chair laughing! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's boy is not a high-quality movie. It's a funny movie (albeit of poor quality), and if you go with the right mindset, you'll love it. Oh, and do not take the kids for that.
