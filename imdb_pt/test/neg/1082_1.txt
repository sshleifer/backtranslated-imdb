Well, how do I get started? I saw The Italian Job for the first time a few years ago and visited a video store that I could not remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do. <br /> <br /> After voting on the ratings for this movie I saw the statistics. Apparently, this movie is more appealing to those under 18. No wonder. They did not pay enough for Charlize to blink and I think some girls from the magazine rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "AWESOME". <br /> <br /> In addition to this film is completely predictable, the actors are mostly forever B-stars and even good ones are being misused in a horrible way, the film is filled with obvious placement of products and imagine this: he can even repeat himself without making a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the movie and it's all from there and once they figured it out, they decided to use the best time again in the end by repeating their gold stealing detail. All in all, a lot of noise over nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more like he was before. Besides the "look, I'm here too" by Donald Sutherland appearing at the beginning, I would say that this movie should have a "pass if you were above 18" over it.
