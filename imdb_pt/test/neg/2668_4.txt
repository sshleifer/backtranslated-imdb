By far, this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. The acting is bad, except Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was fine, but overall this movie was basically a big disappointment. Nothing advanced the story, lacked substance and the scares that made Halloween and H20 so good. All and all, skip this movie, it's not worth the price of the rental.
