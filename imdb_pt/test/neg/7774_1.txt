I do not know if I should be fun or insulted by nonsense like this made by "Lifetime: Television For Women" Should be renamed "Lifetime: Television For Shut In Drama Queens" because I still have to see a movie that wasn is a tear which shakes the boiler. This movie was no exception. You know a movie is going to be bad when the biggest headliner is Tori Spelling, completely a bad plastic surgery creation and spoiled privilege minus any real talent. All the others combined with her in an incredibly bad performance and the plot was beyond stupid, as if someone could believe in something. If I had not been helpless on the couch stuck looking with the same fascination that you see a bloody car accident I would have changed the channel.
