Greetings, spectators! While observing Octopus II, I contemplate the inherent claudication of the Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror Genre. Many viewers may blame the misinterpretation, the meaningless script or the poorly constructed storyline as the reasons that make the OCD film upset. These reasons may actually be difficult factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an OCD film that is at the center of lameness. See, the technology does not yet exist to make a movie realistic. Full-size OCD and CGI technology currently used by studios do not have the ability to seamlessly integrate with real-world environments and characters. Even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark / semi-dark cave so many times before the sci-fi fan gets bored with the genre completely TOC sub-genre, that is). <br /> <br /> What can be done, you ask? I would not suggest that the genre yield to the quarrel, but another way must be explored. We can not really go back to the days of the "Fade-to-Black" suggestion that someone was killed. Or can we? If we can not achieve the goal of realism, we have to compensate for it in other ways, such as twists, innuendos and ingenious photos. It will be through ingenious and alternative methods that the claudication disease, so common to the OCD sub-genus, will be cured.
