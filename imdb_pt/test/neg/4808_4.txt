When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "Hey, what the hell does this sound like a good movie, why not rent it?". So I rented it and went home to see it. When I inserted it into my DVD I was shocked. Well FIRST of all, no one told me it was a Mexican movie and it was spoken in Spanish, good thing it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Second, I was naked, naked NUDE! Since I have no history in Mexican films, you can see my shock when I saw him. *SIGH! Covering virgin eyes, NOO * THIRD, predictable to say the least, but actually being predictable was no excuse for me in liking movies because I do not seem to mind if it's predictable unless be way over. <br /> <br /> FOURTH, as Heidi and Kike were together, so corny. <br /> <br /> FIFTH, how the movie ended. It was a BAD, BAD ending. As the sudden approval of Mr. Van der Linde for the mayor's election was because his daughter, knew how to give the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping he was not so easy to accept, the director might have just hurried. <br /> <br /> After all that, good things are coming. The movie was really hilarious at some point with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and everything, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with words. What I really like was the music that Valentina did with her girlfriend. That's all, and for the other things I did not mention, they were just more or less.
