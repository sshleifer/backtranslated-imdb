... in search of the most cheesy movie "so bad it's good," I laughed repeatedly in the first fifteen minutes of several movies, only to be disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time!!! My eyes watered, my belly and my cheeks ached with laughter all through the movie. Of course, Hulk Hogan is an inferior actor and the plot is totally predictable, but everyone plunges into this movie knowing all this - all one wants to see when renting out is Hogan breaking into a whoopass can with a bunch of "YEAH BROTHER" and "WHATCHUGONNADO" is flying from his infamous mouth dug. And while the on-screen Hulkster paled a bit in comparison to the Hulkster in the ring, those looking for the best cheese certainly will not be disappointed with this backhand gem of a movie. A tumult of laughter.
