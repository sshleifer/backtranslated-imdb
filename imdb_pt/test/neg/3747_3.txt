Sorry, but I usually love French thrillers - for example Chabrol - but this was a chaotic mess. The fact that it was based on a book by Harlan Cohen is saying, because instead of being a French film (strong in psychology and character), it is more like a roller coaster John Grisham-esquire for numbers with playful twists, flashbacks that upgrade your previous flashbacks, a predictable villain (as soon as your name is mentioned, you'll think 'hmm, he'll be the bad guy!') and mysterious stereotyped character sets that seem to inhabit different movies. In the end, I was laughing hysterically at the irregularity of the tone of the film (the scenes in which the protagonist is being helped by two obscure characters are involuntarily hilarious), the totally disconcerting plot, the absurd coincidences and the good luck scams , guessing the password for an email account) and yawning uncontrollably (I thought I should have misinterpreted the runtime for 1 hour and 50 minutes as it seemed to drag on for 3 hours and 50 minutes).
