I found Dominion a terrible attempt to continue the success of the story. The original movie was a story about evil and how it can infiltrate our lives. <br /> <br /> Schrader's version is devoid of evil. Spectators do not have an overwhelming sense of dread, fear or even foreboding. Harlin's version offers an obvious evil, shows violations of church holiness, and builds a compelling story that is plausible, given the formation of Father Merrin. Schrader's story leaves someone wondering exactly what happened. Dominion does not evoke the emotions of viewers to sympathize with Father Merrin, and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was disturbed in the first place. <br /> <br /> Someone interested in seeing a sequel that lives up to the original. must see Exorcist: The Beginning.
