All I heard while it was created was the equality of the sexes, and here we have a movie that not only exemplifies the imbalance, but continues with a whole concept that a sex is better. While watching, I was waiting for this redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as if there was hope for the future, and there was not. I admit that I did not finish the movie, I had to turn it off in the part where the old man's prostitute told the genetic man Adam that it was nice to be a prostitute and get, and I quote, "Sucker than any man in time past ". I know that not finishing is a bad criticism about myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and the team to develop a story that will keep the viewer interested, and they have failed. This film betrays all the true qualities of the feminine nature of the maternal figure and the need for balance. Instead, it exemplifies what America would be like for lesbian nattis, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr. Director! Someone please give me a redemptive quality ... wait I have! There is no sequel!
