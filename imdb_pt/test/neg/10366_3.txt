This movie has some flaws, and most of those flaws are the lack of anything going on. Possibly the greatest film to show agility within Fly-Over Country, "Rolling Kansas" is a movie where nothing happens and you do not care about anyone. As life begins, moves and ends. Some attempts at humor are made, but everything gets very flat. The occasional appearance only reminds the viewer that they may be wasting their lives doing something other than watching this movie and the only rock music they bought and used in all cases. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go see a good movie. This is free and often repeated at Comedy Central because no one has seen it, no one wants to see it, and it is marginally better than the dead air. Not with damn compliments, but it's worth listening to the only rock song in the movie. Too bad the movie is not worth watching.
