The best thing about "The Prey" is the slogan ... "It's not human and it has an ax"! The movie itself is a stinkaroo padded ... endless photos of insects and wildlife make the viewer want to die! No slasher fan will like this junk ..... Watch "Friday the 13th" again and record any copy of this movie you find! <br /> <br /> It is also considered one of the 25 worst movies ever made!
