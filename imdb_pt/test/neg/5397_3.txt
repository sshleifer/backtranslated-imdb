"You have some beans, beans are good, you just eat and you go." I could not help laughing at this little dialogue. Beans are the musical fruit, you know. The more you eat them, the more you go to eat, cook, eat. <br /> <br /> Hmmmm ... Okay, I can understand why the actors were in this because they needed salaries to pay their bills, but I'm not quite sure what the intentions of the director and the writer were. Even after watching the making-of documentary in the DVD extras. <br /> <br /> Mike Rooker gave it a performance he did not really deserve. I've seen him in other movies MUCH better than this one. What would have greatly improved this movie was throwing it all away, keeping Rooker and instead making another entry into the franchise "The Substitute." Rooker would have contributed to an excellent substitute teacher who instructs disobedient and morally disobedient young people about the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society. <br /> <br /> Casper, you really should not. t just pushing the greenery as if you could pick up oak poison. Oops. Never mind. I think poison oak is the least of your worries now. Well, at least this time your croaking was not done by the giant python tail. There are few things more embarrassing than being stuck in the chest by a giant snake. At least the death scene in this movie had a little more dignity. As well as a more liberal stain of karo syrup and red food tincture. Nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye! <br /> <br /> First time I saw a monster wearing a bright rayon cover with a ruff fur collar. First time for everything, I guess. But to be uncertain, if he was an Indian ghost, why did he look exactly like a monster of European culture and folklore? Had not the monster been more Indian? <br /> <br /> Although I have seen the final credits, I do not realistically believe that I could in good faith recommend it to others. .
