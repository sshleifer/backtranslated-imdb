Wow!! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie", I was tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life. It's really hard to describe exactly what this movie is. I honestly do not know what kind of human being would finance a piece of excrement. The film appears to have been shot on video or 16mm. I usually have no problems with SOV movies, they are 16mm movies, but that was horrible. And where did they find these "actresses"? I've seen some bad acting, but that takes the cake. Watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this horrible mud. This has to be the worst movie I ever had the displeasure to watch. I want my 74 minutes back! If you can get through the first 5 minutes without recording your TV or committing mass murder, give it a try. After all, what do you have to lose?
