Zombie movies are hot, I love them. Can not get enough. Why would I buy a movie of this caliber goes without explanation, I really love zombies. Surprisingly, this really is not much of a zombie movie; I can handle the low budget, being fooled just annoys me. <br /> <br /> A bunch of cliches of horror films waiting in a warehouse / lab / who knows what to escape from a firestorm out there. Panic, screams, low light and (eventually) zombies happen. <br /> <br /> I kind of feel bad for the filmmakers, because it's obvious they really thought they were putting something together; a serious and scary horror film. It is not, far from it, a boring mess of woodworking, grubby FX, poor lighting, over-dialogue, and over-editing. <br /> <br /> Things first go awry when it takes a good 10 minutes for the characters to sit down and start figuring out what's going on. It gets worse when another 20 minutes pass and they're still sitting around trying to figure out what's going on. All of this is full of evil and malicious dialogues. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone clings (not for a zombie) and cheers a little before the characters regret it (the only emotion anyone else generates) about how much this sucks. Me too guys, me too. <br /> <br /> Finally, the zombies are in the mix, but no one is watching anymore. I think there was a bit of blood and blood, but I was too busy praying for the credits to roll. And when the screen finally faded, I felt even more deceived by the inopportune end inspired by the 'Cube'. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for trying too hard, even if it failed miserably. This and the punk girl were very hot if they were totally used. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this to anyone except for film students looking for "no-no." <br /> <br /> 4/10
