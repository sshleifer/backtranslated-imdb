The thriller genre of the 80s, co-starring Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash, along with Brenda Bakke, are some of the actors in this story about a haunted health club. Goofy dialogue and some unpleasant effects make this movie watchable. Not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogue and acting. Only for fans of B movies. <br /> <br /> B
