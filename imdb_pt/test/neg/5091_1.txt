For weeks, I was eager to see this movie and see myself extremely disappointed with the wings. In my opinion, the only good thing that 'River Queen' had for it was the incredible landscape used as the backdrop. The plot was everywhere, the character of Samantha, Sarah, was very difficult to understand and what the hell were the many closes of her face? That did not bring anything to the story - if there was one! A better actor for the role of Boy could also have been selected, it seemed to me that he read his lines directly from the script while recording his scenes. real shame as it could have been such a good movie.
