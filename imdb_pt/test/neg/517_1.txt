There's part of a sequence where a little water runs into the sunken airplane, everything that happens in this movie is the footage from Airport 77. You can even distinguish Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the scenes. A total theft? Well almost by definition. There may be more movies in this movie than in Plan 9 From Outer Space. <br /> <br /> All the new material, actors sitting on an airplane talking, is tasteless and terrible on all levels. Dennis Weaver is totally lost in a low-key movie, although this is true for everyone other than film director Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of those many fake names needed to keep working. <br /> <br /> A level of scarce professionalism that makes this movie a waste of time, in fact it would be better if it were filmed by someone with no technical knowledge, because Ray has enough knowledge on how to mount a scene on the worst TV of the old school fashion that this movie, like most of its films, is totally devoid of life. The worst kind of hacking job. The worst kind of movie. Boring. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is a waste of money, a case in which the crew at all levels are ghosts who expect to get the lowest pay they can and no one will see or know that they have appeared / participated of this robbery. There are so many people who want to make movies that it's disgusting to see Ray burn the money given to doing nothing but filling the time. <br /> <br /> His commentary track is interesting because he has to start by explaining that he is really Fred Ray, as he is not credited in the movie itself. That led me to see it, do not let it fool you.
