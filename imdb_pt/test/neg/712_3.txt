Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength. "Black Jack", which was jammed between the extraordinary forgotten "Au Royaume des Cieux" and dazzling dazzling "Sous Le Ciel de Paris", is a mess, which Duvivier himself hated, which is not surprising. write about this failure. We can note that: 1. Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier. This may explain why Welles' actors were featured in the Duvivier films: Joseph Cotten in "Lydia" (1941), and here an Agnes Moorehead totally wasted. It's the first time. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy Moorehead's performance! On the other hand, Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Au Royaume des Cieux de Duvivier for his "Othello". <br /> <br /> 2. In any Duvivier movie, there are one or two worthwhile sequences and this is no exception: the quest in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short time) , then the chase when Dalio is caught The touch of Duvivier can also be felt in the end unhappy. <br /> <br /> As for the rest, as the reign of my dear writer writes, it is a black joke.
