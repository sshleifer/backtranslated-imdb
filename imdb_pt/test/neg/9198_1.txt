If you pack all the cliches about the city's firefighters in 105 minutes; you have the ladder 49. <br /> <br /> She has a story, but it is highly obscured by all the clich√©s. Transforms into film what to each event; it becomes so predictable that it is not worth watching. There is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial. <br /> <br /> It looked like it wanted to be a tribute to the firemen, but it turned out to be boring and pretentious. The parallel between Jack Morrison being fatally trapped under an inaccessible part of a building and the firemen being trapped under the debris of the Twin Towers was too obvious. <br /> <br /> It does not compare to movies like Backdraft and it certainly does not set an example for future films about fire personnel.
