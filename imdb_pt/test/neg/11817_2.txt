This is a piece of a despicable movie. Like so many "chained women" movies, this is full of lesbianism. However, unlike most previous films, which have strongly implicated this, MAMA NEGRA, MAMA WHITE shows a huge amount of skin while an excited prison guard looks at the women while they take a shower, as well as having sex with one of the inmates . By the early 1970s, this is definitely a soft-core pornographic film - something like GIRLS GONE WILD GOES TO PRISON! It's also a bad idea for THE DEFIANT ONES, though in that case it's two hot women who hate each other when they're on the run. Considering that the original film is considered a classic, this can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. That's because there is no subtlety and the film is just cheap - cheap emotion, cheap writing and very cheap acting. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier is the "black prisoner with an attitude" - a lady who set off and sent to prison on this infernal island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, the two can not balance and have opposing goals. However, since it is clich√©, there is really no surprise at how the movie ends - with the two becoming (gagging) friends.
