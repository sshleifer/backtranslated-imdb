Some movies are off-beat, but enjoyable, but many movies are simply weird. "Motorama" does not fit very well in the latter category. Many seem to like this because of the endless guest appearances and total lack of sense, but these two things can only take a movie so far, and "Motorama" simply has no other merit to its credit. <br /> "Motorama" delights in the improbabilities of the plot. His main character, Gus, is a 10-year-old boy on a journey through an imaginary country trying to collect pieces to make $ 500 million. When interacting with adult figures, neither of them seems to notice or worry about being 10 years old. At first it's unbelievably funny, but it quickly becomes simply unbelievable, especially considering the people with whom it comes across and the fact that it seems so undisturbed by the disturbing images (for someone who grows old) that are happening around them. Gus has no depth and, as an anti-hero who has no problem in causing others grief to get his game pieces, it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters problems. <br /> <br /> This problem is provided by a series of guest appearances, each mistreating Gus in increasingly strange ways. In addition to making the already worn-out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable, the characters share Gus's lack of depth and are equally memorable. The character's actions may get a bit interesting, but the actors themselves do not add anything to them, thus denying the full sense of getting big names (they could have been touched by anyone and the character would have been the same). These guest appearances appear to have been signed for more prominence than anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" must be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there's very little sense in the roadmap to work. The incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer do not, as the film moves quickly from incident to incident, hoping that something will eventually make the public feel sorry or understanding for Gus. This never happens because by doing this nothing is allowed to connect, it just pushes back and forth as if it were on a treadmill, one incident after another. With a story so preposterous that it's no longer pleasant, and a leading character who never evolves to take care of himself or anyone else on a higher level, "Motorama" has little to offer except a crawling sneaky and trying to get rich . Why should we care?
