There is so much to dislike this program that it is difficult to know where to start. Unpleasant characters, horrible plots, terrible writing, and terrible acting. Do not even make me start playing the obnoxious themed music. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, the show is out of touch with the US public due to heavy Canadian references throughout the film. "Oh, say Derek, are you going to Queens College in the fall? How come you have beans? <br /> <br /> Granted, other shows are filmed in Canada for financial reasons like Stargate: Atlantis, but while those shows may have suffered some hassles (such as Rodney calling a ZPM from "Zed-PM") the show does not focus on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV is featuring Degrassi (another program based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) during the day, when no one is watching to fill the time (most teens are in school when it goes on the air). I bet it's for the same reason. It shows that the focus on teenage life in Canada does not translate well into a US audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in an oven.
