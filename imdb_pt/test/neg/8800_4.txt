"The Man From Utah" opens with a cowboy singing playing a guitar on horseback. This is how we are introduced to John Weston (John Wayne), going to town and looking for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) thwart a bank robbery with his fancy shots, the marshal offers him a secret job as a deputy to investigate the Dalton Valley Rodeo. Apparently, the annual rodeo grand prize winners are a group of grumpy boys in the employ of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also heads the rodeo committee. The serious defiant to the supremacy of the henchman of Barton Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) ends up seriously ill or dead. Even back to those Lone Star Westerns of the 1930s, John Wayne had a charismatic presence that suggested the future quality of the stars. If for nothing else, seeing Wayne so young in these films is a real treat. The film itself accompanies a rapid pace of fifty-three minutes, largely taken up by images of rodeo, bulldogging, parades and Indian dances. In the deciding rodeo event, Weston avoids disaster by uncovering a poisoned needle embedded in the "Dynamite" saddle, a previously uncorrected bronco in which he must outlast Cheyenne. <br /> <br /> The end is no surprise, as Barton's bad boys give up winning the rodeo events and go for the entire $ 30,000 pot of cash prize deposited at the local bank. But Marshal and Weston are there to thwart their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen before in films like "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone," Wayne's character ends the movie with a beautiful young woman, this time the daughter of Judge Marjorie Carter (Polly Ann Young), who craved him throughout the film.
