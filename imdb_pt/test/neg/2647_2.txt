Back in the dark days of 1990, Spielberg's long-awaited Heir to the Throne of Spielberg (after the failure of the supposed boy Phil Joanou) was mistakenly considered Spielberg's pretentious suitor, David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to sell the studios for more than a million dollars, convincing baby boomers to believe that his script - a combination of nostalgic references from the 1960s and a disturbing drama about child abuse - somehow matched good stories and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once sang, "See how you can be wrong." <br /> <br /> But the beginner's art-inspired script, ET, convinced enough people that he was the next Chosen - the New Spielberg - and so an agreement was made to not only buy the script for more money than 99 percent of the world's population would ever see in his life, but also for Evans to direct the film - even if he had never directed anything in his life. <br /> <br /> Hey, how can it be difficult to be another movie genius, anyway? <br /> <br /> Two weeks of filming, Columbia discovered. His journals were called "totally unusable" by the studio - or at least level enough not to fall under the command of E.N.C. (Emperor's New Clothes) spell. All his footage was discarded and recycled into guitar photos. So, what's a studio to do after sinking 10 or 20 million dollars into something they still believed represented the Steven Spielberg Resurrection? Hire Spielberg himself to save the day? Columbia probably tried that. <br /> <br /> Enter former professional Richard Donner. Hey, he may not be a cinematic genius, but he does the job. "Superman" was not so bad, after all - and the first "Lethal Weapon" was very good. <br /> <br /> So Donner comes in and takes the reins from the steering. Fortunately, he manages to convince Columbia that the worst of the movie's bland fantasy sequences - which would have happened as a ten-year acid trip - has to disappear. Unfortunately, he leaves in the Crying Buffalo (ooh, as poetic) and in the ridiculous, pseudo-Spielberg final fantasy, complete with Clueless Mom perfectly content for the rest of his life to receive postcards of his missing son as he circulates the globe in your red wagon. Right. <br /> <br /> But Donner got a decent performance from Elijah Wood. And Lorraine Bracco as the idiot mother was not bad either. Maybe Donner should be reevaluated. Maybe he's not as fake a Hollywood hacker as everyone has ever believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm giving a wrong glitch is that someone was clever enough to cast the great John Heard (but in the wrong part of course). The children are well ... though Tom Hanks's horribly overly explanatory narration almost destroys every scene in which he intrudes. <br /> <br /> One might think that after the David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys of the world, the studios can finally understand. It could be expected that these disasters caused by advertising films could prevent the Emperor's New Clothes syndrome from raising its ugly head again. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
