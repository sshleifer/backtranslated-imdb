May 2: someone clicked 11 NOs, and then went on to do 15 more in my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: As I write this, I'm still very much under the impression of what must be the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a big case of laughter, but I'll try to calm myself down. (It's kind of hard to write when your nose runs, and your mouth drops sporadically on the keyboard.) <br /> <br /> A couple of young people who have just returned from vacation are hitchhiking on a bus. A couple of young people joined them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it is a hijack vehicle. (Do not giggle!) The driver is part of an organized "white slavery" gang that catches young women from airports and has been doing this for five years. (Do not laugh.) Five years at SAME airport, without the police or even the FBI someday getting it. (Not laughing, please.) Apparently, dozens of women disappear in the same place for years and years - yet no one notices a trend. Is the FBI incompetent? The Shuttle world seems to consist of three types of people: easily kidnapped blondes, stupid / coma / invisible FBI agents and omnipotent psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blondes with tattooed back). <br /> <br /> The driver barely survived this single mission, and yet he did it - I repeat - FIVE years, without being killed or losing one of its members. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Do I need to mention this? We all know that movie psychopaths have immortal DNA. You can stab them, bounce them against the walls of a bus repeatedly, caress them gently with a hammer, stick nine-inch nails into your ears ... Hell, you could stick a hand grenade into the mouth of the common psychopath of Hollywood, and he would still escape with minor scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even a minor demon, but just a regular Hollywood psychopath with better survival skills than the biggest and worst cheap sewer. <br /> <br /> The basic outline of the plot: A guy loses all his fingers on one side in a silly scene. (A magic bus that reads and obeys minds!) Passengers try to escape. They fail. They get hurt. They are in a bad mood. They argue. They try to escape. They fail. They get hurt. They argue. They try to escape. They fail. They get hurt. They try to escape. They fail. They try to escape. The abductees can steal the driver's weapon! Unfortunately, they do not kill him because the Golden Hollywood Rule of Gandhi's Pacifism forbids them to do so. (No laughing). One of the other passengers ends up being part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied at Rob Zombie / John Travolta School for over-action and silly. He threatens rape. Later one of the girls hit him with a crowbar on his head about a dozen times ... very difficult. Only seconds later he regains consciousness. Yes, he survives. (Immortal, remember?) He's dead a little later. (I have no idea how, though! He should not be a murderer.) The captors argue. They try to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, psychotics are much like God in their powers not to recapture their prey. The game begins again: the passengers try to escape. They fail. They are in a bad mood. They look into the void. They get hurt. They try to escape. They fail. They get hurt ... <br /> <br /> You got it. Frankly, I believe a drunken snail, drastically disoriented, would have escaped these shameless captors with ease. There were so many opportunities. At one point, those pesky psychotics (remember: FIVE years!) Even sent one of the kidnappers to a grocery store! She leaves a message for the police. However, yes ... you guessed it: this fictitious fairy-tale US town has no police. <br /> <br /> And just as you thought the film could not get any dumber - not even if Luc Besson and Brian De Palma joined forces to lend a hand with the script - this happens. The girls are abducted to be sent to some remote island (?), And this is achieved by carrying them as cargo. Apparently, this fictitious America has no FBI, no police - and no frontier customs either. However, there are immortal criminals more fortunate than twenty lottery winners. A blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, and yet she failed. How come the victims of these idiot thrillers NEVER attempt to wipe out their immortal opponents after they have fallen to the ground and injured? I think I answered myself: they are immortal! So, why bother to try, she must have thought ... <br /> <br /> So why did one blonde died of gaseous and the other was packed and sent alive (with a sandbox and photo funniest since Demi Moore's elementary school photos)? Could it be the tattoo? I think they killed the cutest, but it's me. Was her tattoo ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I do not care? Why should I look for logic in a movie made by imbeciles (for imbeciles)? Also, how can I think straight when I'm laughing so much in half the time ?! Of course, being a 21st century terror / suspense, the cell phone does not work ... Maybe this invincible gang controls not only the FBI, the police and the customs, but also satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Do I have to spell? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And much smarter people who should be making movies. Take a camera to an idiot and he'll lay an egg every time ... This kind of answer is the eternal riddle that came first: the egg or the bird-brain director.
