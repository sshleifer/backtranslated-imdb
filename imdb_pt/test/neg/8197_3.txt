This is a movie that was probably meant to entertain high school, the first high school students. Maybe for them to be funny, they might even see something scary about it. For me, the acting is bad and the plot is bad, there is not much value for the adult viewer. I saw this movie as weak and boring. Sometimes there was a possibility that the film would become interesting, but it never materialized. The creatures look very good, but after seeing them for a few seconds, they appear to have no substance other than their appearance. Sometimes I was not sure if the movie was trying to make another comedy attempt or if it was just another horror attempt that failed again. This movie was not good for me.
