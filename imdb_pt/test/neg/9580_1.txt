I bought the DVD from a large trash can for $ 4.99, thinking I was lucky in some documentary pearl that would actually show extensive pictures of the mountains of Karakoram and K2 in particular. Fast-forward through the film, I hit the climatic scene where the mountaineers caught the first glimpse - Mount Waddington, rising to 13,260 feet, off the coast of Canada. At least one of several bozos prepared to climb the K2 clearly has no idea how the real mountain really looks - it has to make sure that your buddy and climbing partner would not be brought by the partner for an ugly one. Mountain. Since one of the premise of the film is that about 27 people lost their lives in K2, you may think that the idiot in question may have taken a minute or two to delve into some basic facts, but the clown seems to think that the preparations on this scale, although they are good enough for the likes of Reinhold Messner, below it. To be honest, I did not watch the whole thing. What I saw makes me shudder. They say you get what you pay for. For $ 4.99, I was robbed.
