I really saw evil on the big screen. I saw this as part of a double feature film in the early 80's (I can not remember the other movie) when I was in my teens. The movie is bad, too bad. Embarrassingly bad. The effects are atrocious (you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor). There is absolutely nothing scary about it. In fact, I laughed over the film. <br /> <br /> History has tried to create this great development for the climax, when we must finally see who is responsible for all the evil events and we see the greasy Victor Buono, who is as scary as a supersized Twinkie. Seriously, what are they thinking? Buono, who was a villain in the TV series Batman, is one of the most skillful actors ever to appear on the big screen and I just can not imagine anyone being remotely frightened by it. <br /> <br /> EVIL is almost forgotten. now (for good reason), but it's actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see that turkey again, just to see that black girl being pulled through the room by an invisible force with that very visible cable.
