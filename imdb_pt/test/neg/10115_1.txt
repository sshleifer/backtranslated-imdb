At what point does a movie get so bad that it's good? A must-see in what is terrible, Darkhunters stands out as a brilliant example of cinematography c ** p and just so it probably deserves some kind of award. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the ancient battle of Heaven and Hell. for the unclaimed souls of the recent dead. In the case of the Darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves as a herd of cats, a hooded figure of the Grim Reaper with a face of flickering flames like an electric charcoal fire, a Philip Marlowe-a-like with a serious one A bad manicure and a psychologist who seems to be on a day of Kwik-Save release. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly deceased teacher who spends most of the movie running around a fuzzy field. and bizarrely, a kennel in an attempt to flee from its pursuers. <br /> <br /> The plot is thinner than a dieter sandwich, with no character development or attempt to create suspense. The performance is laughable, comparable to a school play - although this is an insult to many educational establishments. And the dialogue .......... oh, how my sides ached! With the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as "unwanted life cucumbers" by the flaming demon, you wonder if hell really is a McDonalds. <br /> <br /> But it's bizarrely appealing, you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get - in little more than 80 minutes, it's worth the time spent for unintentional laughter.
