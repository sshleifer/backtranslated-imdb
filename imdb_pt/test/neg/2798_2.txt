Black Harvest is about a group of friends who goes to a farm (belongs to one of their relative friends or something) for an escape. But there are murderous scarecrows lurking there (there was something about a curse there too, but I forgot what that was). <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is horrible, I do not know what the director was thinking when he was pitching actors and actresses. The script is the same story as the "horrible" performance (this statement is very obvious, but ...) if there was a better performance and a better script, this could have been "ok". <br /> <br /> Directing too, I see no potential in the future of this face. After all these negatives, this movie still maintains a "fun" factor that increases to two. The last advantage is that they do not use CGI! My general opinion about this movie is that it's bad, really bad, but it's so bad that it's "fun"
