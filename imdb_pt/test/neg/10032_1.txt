I went into a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I will not say the name because I am a dedicated customer. I was pleased with all the items I bought before this one. On display in front of the store was The Bell Witch Haunting. (I may mention that this is the only store I've ever seen on sale.) I had heard the story somewhere and I remembered that it really should have happened. I was very excited and could not wait to watch it. I had high expectations for this. I could not believe what I saw when I saw it. It did not look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I was under the impression that it was supposed to be a horror movie. I mean the movie should be about a haunting witch you know. This is not a horror movie. You will not jump out of your seat watching this movie. I gave the film all the chances in the world to improve as it happened. I swear I did. Never improved. There were several scenes of this boy doing poop and pee thrown at him. I did not find it that much fun. I watched the entire movie in disbelief that the store would really sell it to me. I think that's how bad this economy has. I have this to tell the cast and crew. Do not show this movie as material to get other work in the movies. Do not do it. I mean it honestly. I praise you for trying. To the people who bought it. I say that. Do not sell your copy to anyone. They could get very upset. Have a nice day, guys.
