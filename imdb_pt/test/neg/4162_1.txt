If you are a weirdo who thinks it is "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get her pregnant and then have sex with her again once she has had an abortion and do not tell her that she is related to you, then you would like this movie. <br /> <br /> No matter the fact that the guy is married and has a child at home - this makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he is not aware of what he is doing. He can not do right for his job, his family, or Mary. He's a loser. There is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is vile and incestuous. <br /> <br /> He moves slowly and gets nowhere during the first half of the movie. I could not even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. I'm glad we did not waste our money on the movies in this movie. 0/10
