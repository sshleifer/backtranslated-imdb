This movie is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially the love he has not had a taste for 5 years. <br /> <br /> Basically it's a movie with a man with very poor social skills, and he says the wrong things all the time. The plot is hollow and planned. The main character, James, is solitary, but this solitude theme is not properly explored. It is more like an empty statement from which other subplots derive. Sadness and disappointment after being abandoned are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotions in the film. <br /> <br /> It's also not funny as a comedy. There are some funny linings, but that's it. It does not have the cheerful and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with good humor. I do not think "I want someone to eat cheese with" funny.
