When attempting to build a large mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient indigenous artifacts buried in the earth and releases the Death Eater ... a creature that walks around and kills people in search of their fallen friends or Something like that. <br /> <br /> Actually, this movie had to be an original Sci-Fi Channel. If it was not, then the director would never say anything again. The effects in the movie are at best laughable, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing more than a CGI animation being added to the frames at a later date. The actors do not even seem scared when they see the thing (probably because they really do not, and they are just terrible actors). It's a great comedy, even if it's pure terror.
