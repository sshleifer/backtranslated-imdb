There are movies that are leaders and movies that are followers. <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" was a leader. And here is one of your followers. The "Party Camp" is as interchangeable as any of his brothers who has probed the depths that "meatballs" (the original) had so successfully extracted. Of course the one had Bill Murray. So what does "Party Camp" have? <br /> <br /> I'm glad you asked that question. <br /> <br /> Jewel Sheperd made these movies with bread and butter, and that side dish SHE provides! Even as an innocent (wink, wink) girlfriend of a valiant rich (Cribb), she provides that sensual vapor she gives to all her parts. And yes, guys, she shows (if you know what I mean and I think you do). My God, that smile of hers could melt through titanium. <br /> <br /> What? Oh yeah, the movie. Nothing special like I said; all cheap jokes are pointed and hit (at groin level). And eternal teen Jayne is good for a laugh or two. But instead of a sense of humor, there is only nudity, sexual jokes, nudity, a sequence of soft dreams, a nurse's sex symbol simply for (CLOTHING!) Malicious effects, even more nudity ... <br /> < > Hmmm ... Maybe it's a good idea Bill Murray was not into this. <br /> <br /> Two stars. For Jewel, of course. Very "camp", but not much of a "party".
