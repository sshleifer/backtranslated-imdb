Robert Aldrich's brutal, almost black comedy "The Grissom Gang," a remake of the 1948 British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish," has the 1920s heiress, Kim Darby, kidnapped by a bunch of clumsy thieves; soon this gang is dispatched and poor Kim is then transferred into the clutches of another crooked gang - third-class gangster brothers with sweaty, damp faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen in a trance. At first, Darby (not very brave and not very smart) tries to escape this drooling brood, but they are on it. Eventually, she simply gives up trying, and therein lies the problem with the story. Are we in the public supposed to sympathize with her? Is your growing concern about the family's half-intelligence reassuring? These are disgusting and stupid characters, and I wanted to see as few of them as possible. But since the parallel stories (the progress of the cops on the case and another involving the fake singer Connie Stevens) are rather dull, the director has no choice but to continue to foist those sweaty faces on us. Then, nervous, Darby begins to sweat too, although his scene in the haystack is played with sensitivity and Aldrich's climactic moments are instigating, if disorganized. ** in ****
