this is a terrible adaptation of the Charles Kingsley story. The animation is, to be frank, horrible. And the songs are a disgrace to shoot music, especially the song "high cockororim", which they keep repeating. I feel sorry for Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's best talent, giving voice to the depressing animation sequence. Bernerd Cirbbins tries his best to present himself in this horrible production but fails. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it's the last movie on this planet!
