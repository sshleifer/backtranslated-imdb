Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays Alexandra, the faithful PVC bitch, faithful acolyte of Faust, an evil entity imprisoned in hell. Determined to free her master, the evil prey invaded a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but while conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the foolish mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, resulting in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark. Now Alexandra needs to find a replacement gem, which will not be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is used on the neck of her former lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis). ), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows damn well what the evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, the interdimensional Lite and Dark tights enter into all sorts of problems while trying to find a way back home. <br /> <br /> In the world of Jim Wynorski's distorted film, all women are big-booted girls with the fashion sense of a cheap prostitute. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this movie - be it a police captain, an antiques curator or a mental patient in a nursing home - is hot, hot, hot and does not use much, and it is this fact that makes this otherwise unpredictable part of STV is bearable. <br /> <br /> But be warned, although the presence of semi-nude quality cookie facilitate the process, there is still a lot about this movie. to ensure that it is labeled as an ordeal: the acting is of wood and the dialogue is painful; the black humor (as the DVD synopsis describes it) is as funny as a knee to the dwarfs, with the comic joke of Lite and Dark being particularly noteworthy; and the special effects are the bargain basement, consisting of rubber creatures and visual effects that would appear to date ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> Only 3/10 for the high quotient of bimbo.
