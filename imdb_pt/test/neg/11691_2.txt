A moderately interesting beginning, some beautiful scenes in sixteenth-century Japan and a promising idea. But the execution? The comparison that comes to mind after about fifteen minutes is "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death". Same. An expert in "oriental history" who does not speak Japanese, walks on a tatami mat without taking off her shoes and is usually dumb like celery? Please. This sounds like a student movie: sets are laughable, acting (except perhaps for the title character) near wood, the plot totally arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! This is best seen with someone who knows something about Japan, just to see disbelief repeatedly crawling on their face.
