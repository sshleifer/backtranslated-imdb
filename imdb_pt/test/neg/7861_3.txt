During the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki attempted to relive the old Yamato saga in the form of a laughable "Yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and pointless "Harlock Saga" while the Galaxy Express 999 suffered from the hack of a movie clipped in his name. <br /> <br /> If you've seen "Queen Millenia", you remember it was a wonderful movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to tell a sequel to this chapter already completed, also finding a way to suck at doing so. <br /> <br /> This film takes all the annoying aspects of a generic science fiction film of cellulose, mixing it with bad melodrama, and to add insult to injury, plays on some of the most renowned characters in the universe of Matsumoto. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming aspect of this movie is good art, but the rest is so incredibly bad that you can not save this movie from being a total loss. <br /> <br /> If you liked Queen Millennia or the Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this trick of a movie. You will thank me.
