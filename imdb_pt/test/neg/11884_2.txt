My wife and I could not even finish the movie. In fact, it was quite painful. <br /> <br /> First, historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as by the ridiculous unidimensionality of the characters. For example, Augustus takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. In fact, he is portrayed as if he were a great humanist and a believer in democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, the camp! My lord, the dialogue is horribly bad. I remember the soap opera that my mother watched when I was a kid, having a better dialogue than that. The constant and pontificatory exposure ragged on the ears like nails on the chalkboard. Ugh (Ok, I exaggerate a little, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO series, Rome, is superior for no other reason than its characters are at least believable regardless of its historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome was also wise enough to know that they could not stage scenes of epic battles. The creators of this movie do not. When Caesar attacks Munda, the battle scene is almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I will guarantee that the costumes are perfectly good. The sets are good, although their CGI scenarios can be a bit shocking at times. The sound is bad, despite both in terms of music, foley and dubbing of many of the minor characters. As a history expert, I was hoping for an alternative approach to Augustus than HBO's Rome, which, I feel, failed to capture its general "feel" as well as Caesar or Antony. Instead, I should have just been left with my reading.
