"Get Shorty," "Out of Sight," "Jackie Brown" (and even "52 Pick-Up") - people were finally hitting Elmore Leonard, making good movies out of his work. So, despite my students' warnings about how bad this movie would be, I could not resist renting it. I thought, how bad can it be? Hi, what a mistake, especially shortly after reading the book, which was lame (and also circularly self-referential, too) over the rest of Elmore Leonard's books. Still, the book was better than the movie. Leonard again overcomes the weak and unskilled screenwriters who try to take over his book. The dialogue written by Steven Tyler was painful to watch. And the lyrics of the first song of the character Linda Moon? My high school students write in more depth. Sad sad sad Why even give a star? Because Harvey Keitel and Uma Thurman are still fun to see on screen, and Andre 3000 did not play the fool.
