This is very bad, the characters were boring, the story was boring and there was no sex scene. In addition, drama is lacking, conflict is minimal, making it extremely slow. Nothing happens in this movie, you would expect a sex scene, but they only have one kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife and a stranger that they take the high way. The couple invites the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this point, you'd expect the stranger to have sex with his wife, right? No, they just kiss and that's it. In addition, this movie contains no action, no comedy, no drama and not even suspense. Makes you think that maybe the studio did not even read this script !!!!
