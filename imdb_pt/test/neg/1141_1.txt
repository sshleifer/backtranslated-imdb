I'm a big fan of the Vacation franchise, and I love Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie, and at least some of the names behind the scenes were involved in this project (most notably Matty Simmons, who produced or performed - produced all 4 theatrical releases, as well as "Animal House." For these reasons, I figured this TV release would be worth it even without Chevy Chase. For the record, I did not expect it to be very good; I thought it might be a bit of fun fun, so my high level of disappointment proves that the movie was really bad.It was mind-numbing, jaw-dropping, broken-hearted, head exploding terribly.However, I could not stop watching.It's an illness I have.I can not go out on a movie or give up on a TV show before it ends.Nothing made me want to spend two more hours of my life than this movie.
