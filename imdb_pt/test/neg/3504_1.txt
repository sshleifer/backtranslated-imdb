I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, that's not the one about sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, the one in which everyone is racist, and race is the topic in everyone's mind at all times. Running. <br /> <br /> It's like the movie has a form of tower syndrome where race is the constant theme. Running. Racist. Racism. Racial Relations. Relay race. Paul Haggis made a film that led to Magnolia's structure, which was used to show the disconnection of people who are tangentially connected, and then spoiled it all in a mental vomit of 1.53 on racism in America Race - In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories in parallel, all connected and about race. The first hour, people say ridiculous things and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides comic relief. Very bad, the first half of its story is taken directly from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction, RACISM, whose section is the section Quentin Tarantino, where instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism, CONSTANTLY. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about it is Mexican history, when the Mexican is talking to his daughter. He gives you his invisible and impenetrable cloak to protect you from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers had daughters and know what they would say instead. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene in which he is trying to fix the lock and the Mexican says he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anyone do that? Is it realistic? NOOO. This reminds me more of The Doom Generation's convenience store clerk. "Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents Female." If I watch the second part of the movie, I hope your head is shot and your head without a body starts to cough. <br /> <br /> I did not mention race in more than one paragraph. RUNNING. RACISM. RUN FOR THE SUN. Best. So there's the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against the blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks cute and does nothing, and several other bad actors acting badly with the bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers' wife, could I help if I was crumbling? When Philippe is trying to guess the fact that he wrote about his partner about racism, I can help, but can not I laugh? The movie is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, remember, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, plus a nod to Matt Dillon who really tried to do a good job. job. Who got paid for this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Do not see it unless you feel like being preached on racism in society through a bad and unreal calligraphy of two white men over fifty. which have no similarity of reality or interaction with the real society in any form or medium. <br /> <br /> Part 2: The second half of Crash takes up any and all story lines in the first half ... and expels them into a kind of redemption, completion, the world is a kind of great coincidence. And it is, in fact, one of the worst ways to do it. <br /> <br /> Let's take the Magnolia, 1999. People were not conveniently tied up again and again. They were just connected in a strange way, which happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something that you knew someone else was also involved. Crash takes this package to a serious end. <br /> <br /> Stories are lined up for all to meet again. Are there only 5 in the LA police force? Are not these people working odd shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift and an early shift the next day? And why did Tate have to be the murdered comedian? Would not it have had more emotional strain than realism if it had been someone we had not been with all day? As Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then goes crazy. Everybody would be going crazy. <br /> <br /> Eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to make the Hindi shoot his daughter. It irritated me and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then it would be the direct cause of people ripping. It really pissed me off. In the writers, not in the scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and totally unnecessary. The coincidences are too much and require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia, which was gently connected, this had connections after connections on connections that were so exaggerated. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock came down the stairs. She does not die though. She should have. I clapped as she fell. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is pulling a Magnolia. Not just in the structure, but it has a montage on the song In the Deep, where you see everyone depressed. Magnolia picked it up and made postmodern comments by having all the characters sing along with Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia left in 1999 while Crash left in 2005. It's hard to comment on a movie that will not be done for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. <br /> <br /> Waste my time. <br /> <br /> First semester: D-; Second semester: lowest mark of all time; General: F ---
