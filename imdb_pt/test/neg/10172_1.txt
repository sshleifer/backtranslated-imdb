This movie was the biggest piece of crap I've seen in a long time. It's marketed as Sci-Fi when, in fact, it's nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool. <br /> <br /> It tells you a bit about the state of the Christian church when they have to resort to cheating just for you to hear their sales pitch. But again, what do you expect from an organization that would try so hard to help protect such a large amount of child molesters in your organization? <br /> <br /> Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war traffickers. Let's not forget, our exasperated ex-president actually went out and said "God told him" to invade Iraq. And no one questioned whether he was hearing voices or seeing things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, going on the subject here. No, this movie has nothing to do with UFOs, it is nothing more than a religious production.
