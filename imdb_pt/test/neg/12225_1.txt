This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If I had not been watching for free, I would never have finished. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems this is supposed to be a movie in the vein of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10x better than this one), but failed miserably. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on antics. A guy falls, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas is clever, basically the worst premise for a movie of all time. The plot (or lack thereof) is completely retarded. The plot seems to center around the coach and his family, however, there are so many other things going on in the movie is completely ridiculous. Terrible and terrible movie.
