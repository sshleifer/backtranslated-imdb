I had high hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD, "In the spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After suffering from this, I realized that I just spent $ 2.50 to rent it, it. This movie started slowly and slowed down ... brief fleeting moments of lightness proved that it was in the spirit of American Pie whether you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not much fun or fun! Do not be fooled like I was and expect something that is not watchable because this movie will depress you more than entertain you. "I need to fill three more lines for this stupid movie that does not deserve the effort ... that stupid piece of foolish ignorance." This movie broke down, even short nudity sucked!
