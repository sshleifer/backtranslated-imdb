Could not the liberals, like Alec Baldwin, know that they lost the 2000 and 2004 elections? The ridiculous. unscrupulous scams at WalMart, non-syndicalists, George W. Bush, and the stock market, not to mention the intentional GWB accent that Balwin's character uses in the film, just makes him look silly and bitter on the screen. As the credits roll, sour grapes remain "special thanks" to Ken Lay and other CEOs of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and IMClone. Let me show you something - if you put all your money into a company's stock, you're an idiot. We do not need that excuse for a movie to tell us that. What a waste of Jim Carrey's talent - from the trailer I was expecting a completely different film - what I got was a 90 minute DNC commercial about how to scare people away from investing in their own future, keeping them stupid and keeping them dependent from the government. . No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can not make a decent movie anymore - maybe you could get an original idea and put it on the screen for the first time ... although I should not be surprised since Jane Fonda was cast for the original .
