This film is a completely imprecise representation of the actual story of Noah's Ark. Producers probably did not even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the Bible, but the writers of the film "gave her the name Naamah." This movie portrays the destruction of Sodom a good 1000 years before it happens, and what about Gamorrah? It was also destroyed at the same time that Sodom was. (Perhaps the producers thought not to include Gamorrah in history and to show the city of "Sodom" as in you-know-it would raise more eyebrows.) This film is filthy and mocks God and the Bible. It is a wonder that any true Christian wants to participate in the production of this abysmal, hideous, reprobate mockery of the Bible.
