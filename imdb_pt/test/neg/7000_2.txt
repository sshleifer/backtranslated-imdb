Dir-Emmanuel Itier: Virtually useless thrill that spends more time leading up to sexual encounters with and without the star 'Amber Smith'. He tries to wrap a story around the sex scenes, but as usual with these types of movies, this is not done very well. I was so bored with this movie that I really made good progress in the end to end it. The video version I watched was called "Tell Me No Lies".
