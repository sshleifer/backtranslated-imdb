Wow!! Here comes another straight-to-video scarecrow movie to keep movie masochists happy. If the cheap-looking opening credits do not tell you that you're on a good ride, then the diabolically tragic "writing" will most certainly be. <br /> <br /> A diabetic boy is tied to a legendary scarecrow as part of his baseball team initiation. Then the scarecrow goes mad and starts attacking people. Need I say more? This movie consists of many inexpensive effects that make it look like it was edited with iMovie (note that frightening color reversal) and actors who were apparently not good enough to show up at some Cinemax special late at night. In fact, this is not fair, since the actors did not have much room to work around the abysmal script. Parts of this movie really look like parody, especially when a character picks up their guitar and starts playing the worst song ever conceived by humans, with the worst lip dub ever performed to accompany it. The "blood" here is also a big disappointment. In most B movies like this, there is a thick layer of negative effects to make up for what's missing in the story and acting. Here, the material is so cheap that it is not even fun. This movie really makes "Jack Frost 2" look really fun in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is the "worst you've ever seen," then you probably have not deepened the world of terror B direct to video. Regardless, this movie will cause a lot of mental anguish, no matter what its past.
