I really wanted to like this movie. A movie with zombie kids coming out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror movie. Unfortunately, the movie was in the last three movies in the horror series. <br /> <br /> A mother and her two daughters try to move on after their husband / father passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They need to adapt to the new environment. They end up struggling due to all the environments for different reasons. (Crazy Zombie Kids are in this category) The film never gives any sentimental attachment to anyone who lives or dies, the film does not produce scares or skip worthy moments, the movie barely shows the children doing what they should do ... Killing! With a bigger budget and a better cast, this movie could have hope. Until then, pass on. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 in fact.
