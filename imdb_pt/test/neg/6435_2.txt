License fees to watch this junk, and pay for it with hard-earned money? No humor, no hint of laughter, God knows how he won a BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We have been subject to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, oh, when is the British public going to see this awful soap for what it is? Pap Crass! This program no longer represents reality in the East End of London than the daily life in Beirut, and never did. <br /> <br /> The Eastenders I know (the real ones) are gentle, brave, hardworking, and loyal. And one of his greatest attributes is humor. It was the Eastenders who went through the worst of the London blitz and even put two fingers on Hitler. And what do we see on our screens for five days a week (including a bus)? Nothing but a lot of moaning, moaning, weak "dead up the neck" who seem to do little more than sit in a pub all day courting each other. What a great advertisement for Britain that is !! Do writers really believe that this garbage is being pumped? Obviously, the audience share flexible mind, but then I heard that apparently someone can brainwash to believe in anything.
