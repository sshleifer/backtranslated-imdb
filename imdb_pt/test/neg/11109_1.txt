This is one of the most horrifying 'scary' movies I've seen for some time. I had to wonder if John Ryhs-Davies was bored and wanted a distraction to make this movie. The Chupacabra looked like a cross between the Sleetaks from the Land of the Lost and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Also, they should have used someone who was a bit smaller, since the Chupacabra's legend is much smaller. All in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. Why bullets and electrocution could not stop the Chupacabra, but is the Captain's boxer's daughter okay? See if you are sick at home or feeling down and need a good laugh.
