This movie is a science fiction pattern from the 1950s. In its favor, the plot succeeds in pulling out an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. But come on now, if the aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to Earth? Why would not they just take it away from a STAR!?! The only credible reason for Cronos' presence is a direct attack on terrestrial society, not mere energy collection. None of this is even hinted at; Kronos may have been built by a superior race, but his activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the hero-scientists plan for Kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific palaver. This equates to the "reverse polarity" gambit that has been used so much in bad scifi that it has become a joke in itself. Low and behold this causes our unwelcome visitor to release their collected energy. No one in power seems to care about the impact that releasing so much energy (which at the end of the film includes, among other things, the total yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the environment. And, unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the outskirts are the suburbs of Los Angeles. Oops!
