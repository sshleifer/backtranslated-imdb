Maybe the director was trying another PIRATE (musical of Good Garland and Kelly) - but this lame musical time falls flat. The voices of Sinatra and Kathryn Graysons do not mix well - and their chemistry as a whole lacks spark. Sinatra's premise as a sweet guy who tries to imitate his "bandito" dad is fine, but he seems clumsy on paper. What's incredible and wonderful here is how Sinatra can have a rather insipid song and make it look special - his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe she's not singing something totally different and not nearly as interesting. She has her big time with "Love is where you find it", which blends perfectly with her and shows off her skills. The photograph is lucid and the two stars look attractive, as are the costumes and scenery. Co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash put a lot of energy into doing the impossible work. In addition to the Sinatra song, there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It's fascinating and strange. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is a real surprise.
