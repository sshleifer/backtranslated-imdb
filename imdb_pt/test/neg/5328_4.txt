I know I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I'm twenty-four I watched again, and I wished I had not. Because all the things I laughed at when I was younger are no longer funny. then this is an hour and a half without fun. To me, the jokes were stupid, not funny or just plain childish. So the same thing that I loved in the movie when I was a child, now are the things I do not like. Aside from not being funny, it's not really believable in any way. The evil character is very poorly made, but I think that's the kind of movie that it is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie are pretty bad with bad fight sequences and so on ... But if you're young, you'll probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10
