Maybe I expected a lot from this movie, but at least a comedy should be funny, and this one has very few fun moments. It insults homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, the obese and probably several other groups as well. The graduation scene where everyone claims to be gay is one of the most unpleasant I've ever seen. Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously bad and Kevin Kline seems confused most of the time. Other critics compare the movie to "Will and Grace," but at least "Will and Grace" is funny.
