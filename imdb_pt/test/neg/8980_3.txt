Trekkies really is not a movie about the fandom of Star Trek. It's a horrifying show about Star Trek fans who have no sense of reality. As a show of horrors, fine. But it is a mistake to think that this movie offers a vision of Star Trek fans. Most Star Trek fans get scared by what this movie shows.
