Mockney comes to Brighton; despite a poor reception in the British press and in state-funded British cinema, I had hoped we would have some of the dirty and uncompromising London by Graham Greene's seafront. <br /> Do not even aspire to it. The characters coming out of their clone and crimp trailers play Guy Ritchie types. The format looks more like a British TV series than a film (Brighton is a gold mine on stage, wasted with plastic studio works). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in search of a good performance by Famke Janssen ... she is a bit clever for this company, her brand of big screen impertability that belongs more to blockbusters like Deep Rising. As for the performance (a role still!), The search continues. Circus is boring. 3/10
