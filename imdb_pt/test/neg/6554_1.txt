<br /> <br /> This movie is so incredibly dull that it makes any man want to cry, the clich√© is put on peanut butter over 5 years old and in such a way that it really sucks the mood of your heart , all the jokes were badly timed and would not be funny if they were timed correctly. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie, there is a real chance you will never be able to enjoy comedies ... ever.
