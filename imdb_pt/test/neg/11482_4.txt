I expected a lot more from this movie. The preview looked interesting, so I decided to take a look. The conclusion is that "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" only had one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier and found his performance very enjoyable. The character is well-designed, but everything else simply fluctuates over the duration of the movie. Clark Gregg is very good, but I do not think his character has been explained very well. That is, there is not much to explain; he wants to become a woman. Still, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The film's obvious low budget was good to see. I liked that the movie was filmed in only one screenplay (a bad one in that) and only a few actors. It was a good change. <br /> <br /> Although the main idea of ​​the film was really good, it became disappointing to see many scenes that had nothing to do with it, just played here and there. As I said, the script looked promising and I must say I was interested where director Tod Williams was going, but it was basically a very slow film without much dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started. to look good in the end, but again, fell back into a hole. The acting was mostly good, the writing is in need of some work, but the budget of the film helped to come out in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to someone if they wanted to watch a silent movie with a strong main character but otherwise I would stay away. Personally, I did not watch twice.
