As someone already said that the Living Dead Dolls were cute and if they appeared as a new series of little bad things I would buy one or two. Well basically this movie was dark, not in the scary sense, but in that I can not see the way. And that was annoying. Three women in a house, the youngest said not to enter the forest under any circumstances (well, that did not happen) and it would have been better if that advice had involved their death. And no one does any cleaning or rehab or something like that, you would think a lot of coughing would happen. A sexy young mother where you waste your time trying to figure out your age (by my calculations 34 or 36). And it seemed that it had been more than 20 years since someone had lived there, so what about the parents? oldest album I'm so sick of cliches that it's just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast. Teens getting stoned and drunk in the car and well you know where this leads .... death and apparent deafness also as Tim seems oblivious to his friends scream. I mean, I pushed many cars where the driver driver did not yell and I heard them. Cliché strange man in the forest that nobody believes. Plumber who lived in them there are parties for years and this is his first experience with the kids said, so driving him avoids pick picking the young man in the dead of night ... run him over your idiot! Cliché ... wandering through the woods with no idea where you're going, armed with the knowledge that boys with picks (yes, they're back) are away from home. A nonsensical scene, the brutalization of the pig ... why do not many directors see any problem with the mutilation and slaughter of animals? I'd rather see kids running around and biting people on their thighs than that. Zombies do not seem to have as much energy in other movies. Does the villain know how ineffective he was? Her large part was in the store ... stomping and demanding to be attended to first. What a man no event he was. Why not kill it before the family gets there and prevents the movie from being made or remakes the movie differently. I give my notes to the house, the forest and the little gothic dolls I want one!
