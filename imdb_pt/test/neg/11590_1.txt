Where do I start? First, the story sucks. The acting sucks, the effects are really bad, I think I'll start with the story. The story of Komodo vs. Cobra: number one, this does not explain how or when the Komodo and the snake got there. Or, by the way, how it was created. The acting: TERRIBLE! It looks like the director just took some people off the street (which is probably what he did). And last and definitely the least, the effects: they are so horrible that komodo does not even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, which seems incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when the snake appears. All in all: terrible piece of crap, do not even think about renting.
