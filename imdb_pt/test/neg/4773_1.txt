I have not seen such a stupid and stupid movie for some time. Absolutely no logic, no horror, no scare, no suspense, not exciting .. I mean, I have not found a part of the movie attractive ... <br /> <br /> I do not know know the that they were thinking when they made the film .. You watch the whole movie to find out that there is a plant that can walk around, drag human corpses and eat human flesh. Not only that, but it can also speak, that is, mimic sounds, such as a cell phone ringing or human talking ... then it's like the plant makes the ringing of a cell phone ringing, so they go behind the cell phone and find out it's a plant. .. how clever the plant to set up an ambush. <br /> <br /> This is clearly the level of creativity of a primary school child ... Bad !!!
