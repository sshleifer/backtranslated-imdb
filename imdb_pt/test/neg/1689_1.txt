I loathe, despise, and hate this movie with a passion that makes the red gates of hell seem cold in comparison. it's nothing more than an exaggerated, scary and utterly moody trip to that unpleasant time, the 70s, a decade I'm glad I'm not part of if this absolute banal is all that was on offer! <br /> <br /> The animation is antipathically dated, especially with its tacky appearance, lost pictures and characters with big bulbous heads, this film is painful to the eyes. From knowledge, snide nod to parents with the freakily gay sea horse, and it's hand movements from camp and voice kenneth williams-esque, to openly, undoubtedly drugged anthem, Cockalorum Alto, this movie, I'm sad to say, is the one who was forced upon me as a child and I never fully recovered from the terror he caused me ... <br /> <br /> This horrible display of complete terribility must carry an R certificate, so disturbing is content!
