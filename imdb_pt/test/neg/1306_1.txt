Much like the title suggests that this is not the particularly good movie that I expected it to be. I thought it would be great with the man himself totally monty but tragically not. From the beginning, I literally lost interest immediately when two women were just making tea, and suddenly she pointed out that there was random water coming from under the door, then filling her face with the chain of the house, it's hard to believe not. Do not watch the rising water level on the outside or at least hear it. Sorry for this sounding like an outburst, but it really grinds my gears and affected me. Most of the acting was poor and the story tried to copy almost every clich√© from every disaster film, but it ended up failing in that direction. CGI was poor I could do a better job using ms pint, driving poor too, and in the end I did not mind 1 character at all !!! Do not waste your time, people no wonder it was released directly to the DVD. Well, thanks for reading xxx.
