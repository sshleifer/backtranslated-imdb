Anyone from Law & Order's, CSI (choose your city), and Homicide: Life on the Street is weaker than Bones's strongest episode. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is stuck on modest Angel, and Emily Deschanel portrays "Bones" too ... unrealistically. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes together, either with forced acting, or just terrible lines. <br /> <br /> Murders become predictable after a while, since the prefiguration and clues are too obvious. <BR> <BR> <BR> The music is fine, although it's really unnecessary at times. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bones is hardly the program I would recommend watching over the days of the week as it is a carbon copy of better programs. with unreal characters and increasingly dull stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
