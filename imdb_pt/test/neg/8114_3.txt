I'm sorry, but for a movie that has been so much stamped as a semi classic and a horror movie, but seriously, I think when the director makes me laugh unintentionally, that's not a good thing. The characters in this movie were so exaggerated and unbelievable. I could not stop laughing at Issac's voice, it was like the British voice of a crying girl. Not to mention that the dramatic character of Malicai showed his character. <br /> <br /> Sons of Corn is about a city where all children have killed adults and worship a God who commands them to sacrifice 20+ elderly people. When a couple has a bad car accident, they come to town for help, but of course they are caught in the child's trap and are being sacrificed! But Malice has other intentions when she is fed up with following the orders of Issac. <br /> <br /> The Corn Sons could have been something great, but turned out to be a bad movie that you could easily make fun of. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure it's not what he intended and it was a very bad story, or at least the actors destroyed it. Like I said, for a good laugh, watch, but I'm warning you, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
