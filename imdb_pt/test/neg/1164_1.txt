This is the worst movie I have ever seen and believe me that I have many bad movies. I love a person's horror, but that was just terrible. There was not a scene in this movie where I felt scared. All actors must have been people who met at a bus stop 20 minutes before filming. I wish Blockbutser had given me 99 cents back. The acting was terrible. The writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to show this movie before it was released and had to know it was terrible. I would be ashamed to have my name associated with this monstrosity. Do not rent this movie. If you do, do not give it back so that no other poor soul makes the mistake of renting it.
