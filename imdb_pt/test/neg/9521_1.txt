I was very interested to see this movie despite the article I read about the director at Tattler Magazine. I do not judge movies by what the director may or may not have done. This premiere feature was very difficult to watch. I think the split screens are a distraction to the drama in the movie, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances, and the movie was a copy of several other movies that I saw. There was really nothing new about it.
