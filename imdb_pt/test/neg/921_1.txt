How did I deserve to watch this crap ??? Worst ever. The acting was horrible when I read that this was a comedy that I expected to at least smile at once - or twice but ... If you're willing to waste an hour and a half of your lives, this is the right movie . I recommend just looking at a wall or something like that, nothing more to watch this "movie". Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you're a guy) about pregnant women, I guarantee it will be more fun :) The actor on this one (I forgot his name) is not that bad, and I'm surprised how hi he accepted o Function. Anyway "I want somebody to eat cheese with" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
