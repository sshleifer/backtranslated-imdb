A disorderly collection of Western tourists in Africa suffers from the misfortune of their plane crash, so they are forced to catch a bus to travel through the desert of Namibia to reach the nearest starting point of civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass does not work, and they find themselves off course, stopping in a deserted ghost town that had been a barracks during World War II fighting. They find a bit of kerosene (useless in terms of refueling the bus tank), a warehouse full of half-poisoned carrots in tin cans and a native hermit who sees them indifferently. The fellow among them who seems to have something on the ball in terms of survival techniques, will get help. They should remove the tires from the bus and burn them if he does not come back in five days: we expect someone to see the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Does this sound interesting? Well, of course, even if it looks a lot like * Flight of the Phoenix * or any other movie in the genre "desert island." That's why it's surprising that * The King Is Alive * is number 4 (if anyone is still counting) in the ongoing "Dogma 95" series, that if I remember this ridiculous "Dogma 95 Vow of Castity" correctly, proclaimed that "genre films" are strictly verboten. Oops Well, anyway, you can say you're going to try to be all artistic and material to make up for being a genre movie. Yes, it did not take long for a member of the group, a former aged actor, to start scribbling - from memory! - the various roles of * King Lear * in rolls of paper. The idea is that the execution of the play helps to take time away. All this goes against the runaway survivor's advice of remaining optimistic (did the old actor ever perform at The Odd Couple's dinner-theater only once in his life?), Regardless of whether such an activity is colossal. waste of precious time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I really do not know how to continue. It's so monumentally stupid, so full of absurd situations and characters that it begs for rational criticism. It may be an opportune moment to offer a Full Disclosure: I despise this so-called "movement" of Danish cinema to a nearly irrational degree. I think my face gets a little red at the mere mention of Dogma 95. First, if the name of your movement has the word "dogma" in the title, you've already lost me; Secondly, in this particular case, the movement's insistence on the abnegation of individual artistic achievements is a recipe for radical hypocrisy when one considers that the filmmakers here are plundering one of the greatest works of the greatest writer INDIVIDUAL who ever lived. (But undoubtedly the Dogma crowd believes that Shakespeare's Works were actually written by a consortium of Elizabethan goons like the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the Queen herself. > Hell, I could have forgiven the whole venture if I had thrown the scenery for farcical purposes (attacking the precious Dogma - now that would be subversive!). But the film takes itself very seriously, and soon becomes the clich√©s that accompany the genre in which it belongs: people turning against each other; men who grow beards; the inevitable deaths of some of the main actors. All with a serious face. "Is this the end promised?" Well, not completely: we also have to endure the abysmal transfer of DV. For this is another Rule in Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity: just portable digital video. Some friendly advice for the Danes: Your "move" is in trouble when the finished product has worse visual quality than a high school graduation home video. Professionalism belongs to the bag of tricks of an artist, alongside his own individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are related words, Mr. von Trier: not every idiot with a $ 100 handheld can be a filmmaker. Pass on. And by the way: allow your Dogma directors to be credited for your movies while you're at it. The fact that the writer of The King Is Alive gets credit, while the guy (or girl) actually filming is not, it's just a little hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Despicable. 1 star out of 10.
