The 1998 version of "Psycho" needed to be kicked back in the 1960s, rather than current days. The headliners would have done a good job with the scenario. There were two scenes that only stood out like a sore thumb. The first was at the beginning of the film, when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) was sitting at her desk. His boss took his client to the office because "it was air conditioning." I would imagine that most Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the encounter of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila sporting the Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the film. The movie scared several viewers into the theater.
