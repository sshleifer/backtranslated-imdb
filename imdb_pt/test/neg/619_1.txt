One of the worst things a movie studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others by marketing a 'shock' or 'blood' factor to sell tickets and buy a new diamond necklace for Birch. Another thing worse is totally misrepresenting the true facts of an incredible saga, fabricating events, dialogues and images to the taste of the director himself. Lastly, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is to use actors from under the drum and shoot everything on a sound stage that has been rented for fifty cents a day. All three transvestites that the creators of this movie are guilty of. That is, hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. A score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. Not only should filmmakers be ashamed to do so, they should be ashamed to exploit negatively the heroes of this story, who are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand, both the living and the dead.
