Square hogs as a way to efficiently utilize cargo space is the only smart time in "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper made it worse, see "The American Way", but this movie is up there on the "crap cream" scale. I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that "Space Truckers" will not please anyone. Too cartoon-like can also be taken seriously, an almost total lack of humor and poor character development, virtually guarantee disappointment. The crowd of popcorn and beer can tolerate a view, but everyone else was warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all the above reasons. - MERK
