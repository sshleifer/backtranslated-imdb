SPOILER AHEAD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is on the loose in a college town in New England looking for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of her beloved Princess Ananka. Slow, slow (even at 65 minutes - she moves slower than the mummy!), She acted with indifference, but it's worth waiting for at the end. The mummy catches the girl (!!!!!) and she ages quickly as the two slowly sink into a swamp. This is (I believe) the only time in a Universal Monster movie that the monster got the girl! Also, this is a strictly amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy sequences - and that's saying something!
