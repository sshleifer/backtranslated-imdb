This conglomerate fails so miserably at all levels that it is difficult to decide what to say. It does not deserve a line, much less ten, but to adhere to the IMDb rules, here it goes and I probably will not get it the first time and I have to type a little more to make up for that submission to be accepted. LOL If I had seen this shock during the 70's while I was going through my mushroom phase, I would still have considered it unimaginative and shallow. The most exciting shot for me was the shot when the elevator door opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> One person here wrote that he had found the creator of this mess, as if that was a red day in his life. One can only pray for something much more exciting to occur in the life of the posters. Hold on, my friend.
