The only thing in "Sudden Death" that exceeds the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of holes in the plot. What with that, and the sheer number of inventions, could hardly call what was left of a plot. To say that the script borrowed from the premise "Hard to Kill" would do the most cheeky of the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a troublesome hero working on the massive Pittsburgh indoor ice rink like a fire Marshall. On the night of the seventh game of the final series, he receives tickets to be able to treat his children away from the decisive game and, of course, spend some time with them. Also picking up the match, but for political reasons, it is the vice president of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a group of unbelievably well-organized mercenaries captures the vice president's box and demands hundreds of millions of government money, our hero, Darren McCord, has his plans more than a few posts. <br /> <br /> Every time a new these formula movies are made, it seems that all that hinders us in innovation are the meanest baddies, and increasingly spectacular and horrible ways in which good guys get rid of them . Director Hyams and his screenwriter went over (not that this is an original sin) in trying to make us hate the evil terrorists. The horrible bandits will shoot at the secret service, security and civilians (old and young) with gay abandon and with little regard for the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme gets quite involved with fists and shootings, heroism and death defying stunts. The script does little of the muscular European. Almost everyone has walk-ons besides Powers Boothe, who seriously exaggerates his shallow paper and written as the most ruthless and meanest leader of all time that ever existed. <br /> <br /> There's plenty of clever and explosive enough special f / x cinematography to keep anyone awake. But, really, that's all this action movie has, action. While there are some interesting sequences, nothing could be called so outrageously brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne
