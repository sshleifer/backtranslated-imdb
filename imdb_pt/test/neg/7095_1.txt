This film takes all the movies of gangsters / gangsters already made. MP Last Don has a reference for all movies. The acting was by far the worst I've ever seen. Who the hell is John Mario anyway? His performance was by far the worst I have ever seen. It makes the bad actors look good. As far as Master P is concerned, it is selling faster than a N * sync show. I'd really like to be there to tell the whole production company: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WRITING SCRIPT? "Obviously, these people are so obsessed with the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live their real gangster lives. One thing I know is that there was no one who wanted to distribute this movie, so it seems (and predictably) that the guys at NO LIMIT had to start, NO LIMIT FILMS. This movie is terrible and does not deserve to be called a movie!
