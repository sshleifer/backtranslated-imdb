I really tried to like Saw. The story was good and I admire the dizzying pace of the way the film was shot. However, there were many cliches and elements that, although they seemed "legal", made no sense at all. <br /> <br /> First, what I liked about the movie was the general tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of the vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role of obsessive detective, and Monica Potter was good at an ungrateful role as a doctor's abducted wife. The Shawnee Smith scene was incredible and Wan and Whannell should be praised for using this scene as a demonstration to get support for the film. The whole notion that the Jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill himself is a great idea, but once the movie started, logic began to run away. <br /> <br /> When they showed that Zap was the only one Keeping Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was clear that he was not Jigsaw's killer and part of him. The scene in which he puts a stethoscope in the heart of the terrified Diana while Allison yells at him through his gag was one of the most free scenes I've ever seen. It was supposed to be cold, but not setting anything. In addition, since the Jigsaw killer finds a way for victims to kill themselves, he has no problem cutting a police officer's throat. I think it's a way of showing that he does not want to get caught and goes to whatever means necessary to ensure that this does not happen, but to me this makes no logic, especially when he shows no remorse at the death of another detective that I liked this setup, would have only been better if given to someone who really deserved it). <br /> <br /> I felt that Leigh Whannell was just as well as Adam. It was not really a showy role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor. However, I did not much like the direction of James Wan. The story may have been original, but the direction certainly was not. I think I'm tired of MTV-style quick cuts in favor of the old-fashioned approach to driving, but a lot of scenes involving the Jigsaw killer reminded me too much of Se7en, much of that. As the movie progressed, for me, it was starting to become a series of demos like "Hey, look what I can do." Instead of being intriguing, it has become very disturbing. But hey, it worked. He is now directing "Final Destination 3," so he is well on his way to a successful career, and I think he will become a top quality horror director for years to come. <br /> <br /> What really made it to me was the end. As I said, I knew Jigsaw was not Zap, and I liked how Adam discovered the mini-tape recorder after killing him. It would have a great ending, except for one fatal flaw: I felt they should have left where you did not know who the killer was. The way it was done was only done for one reason: Boy, are we smart? Oh no. To me, that just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Some of the best horror movies are made for a reason, where there is a reason for the violence we see in history. While "Saw" started very well, it began to be undone by the filmmakers' insatiable urge to be "cool" and lessen the winning story they had. Maybe if they were not too insistent on making the movies themselves, and trusted a more experienced horror director to help him, I think it would have been the horror classic that he was wrongly received in the last four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of terror, I'm very scared.
