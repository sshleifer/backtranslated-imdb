As we well know, films are not meant to be a direct embodiment of history, but it is a disgrace when making a film that has absolutely little or no correlation. I wish the director and / or screenwriter had done their research on this topic. All this movie does is create a forum for hate between people, while causing a break that should not be there. This film portrayed the Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative way, while making the third (Hindu) group seem non-existent in the brutal murders of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies, along with disregard for faith, as portrayed by Gian Singh, was a disgrace to the higher format. Although on a more positive note, the actors did a great job of acting in their roles. Both Kristen K and Snow C played exceptionally. I hope that those who watch this movie do not see it or use it as a model for the actual historical event.
