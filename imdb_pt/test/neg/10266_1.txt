Why, on Earth, did Bava have to add insult to injury by doing this follow-up crap? <br /> <br /> To begin with, we, "the spectators" at home, are treated with a narration of some unknown ding. -bat informing us of the later events of the previous episode, indicating humanity's triumph over demons, (yes, right). <br /> <br /> I can tell you "right now" that it does not happen anyway. "It has something to do with Demons, for this is a whole new story with a different background. Bava, as usual, makes a casual appearance that does not even seem to fit the main context of the story. Acting on this one beyond the terrible and all the concept about the demons appearing through a TV set, Oh God, I will not continue. Go see for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual, you'll be treated to ridiculous dubbing, bad scenarios that make no sense and, most of all, unanswered questions. As typical of a sequel that distributed the first batch of junk. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those collectors of Argentophile DVD, then maybe you want to give this a chance, otherwise avoid the plague, it is not near the first, so you may want to avoid like the plague.
