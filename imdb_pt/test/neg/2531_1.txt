I was so disappointed with this movie. I am very familiar with the case, having read not only the book by Mark Fuhrman but also the much superior "The Wealth of Evil: The True Story of the Murder of Martha Moxley in America's Richest Community," by Timothy Dumas. Anyone who sees MURDER IN GREENWICH should be aware that they are watching the story of Mark Fuhrman, not the story of Martha Moxley. This film is nothing more than an ego trip to Fuhrman. Just watch your character approach as if it were the second coming (yes, even though it's being watched by women). The actors who play the children seem too old for their roles and the flashbacks of the 1970s are totally unconvincing. If there are any heroes in this story, it's Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and her brother John. They kept this case alive for two decades before Fuhrman entered it to make a name for himself. They and Martha deserve to have the true story told.
