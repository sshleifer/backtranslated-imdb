As I write this, there are no user reviews yet, but there are 17 votes with an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I did not notice any, and even if I had, I did not think I could have stopped rolling my eyes long enough to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> A common debate among movie fans is whether the biggest mistakes science, police tactics and similar things so common in B movies should significantly diminish someone's pleasure. I tend to fall into the field "Yeah, that's a reasonable reaction" - especially when mistakes are central to the plot. With this movie, I look forward to reading how someone can defend this mess. They completely ruin all aspects of military tactics and strategies, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of movie B.). In short, I can not think of anything trivial that they got right. Any film would have its work cut off when its central premise was a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, capable of disappearing into another dimension at will, and yet seemingly vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (They do not make ghosts like they used to.) Combine this premise with every wrong detail and you have a bad memorable movie.
