For those of you who have some kind words for this movie, I suspect you did not see it when it was released as "Parts: The Clonus Horror". <br /> <br /> It was a terribly annoying movie. He lost the mark in at least three ways. It was not good enough to be scary; it was not bad enough to be funny (though MST3K took care of it); and even in 1979, the plot was not original. <br /> <br /> Previous contenders are "The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as spare parts). The movie is fun and had a great cast. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yeah, the Woody Allen movie. Remember the flat nose? And "Clones" (1973). The last two plots are not as similar to Clonus as the first, but they predate Clonus. <br /> <br /> There are also several fiction books from previous decades that deal with the idea, though often the word "clone" is not used.
