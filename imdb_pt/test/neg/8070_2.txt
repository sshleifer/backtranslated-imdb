Vampires Rollerskating?! I'm sorry but even for the 80's that's very tacky to be scary ... You can excuse the odd original kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and TV shows but this was once done so the sequence needed to be a little less camped, nor more bizarre! In addition, the first film had the presence of Chris Sarandon - a man who could even make nightclubs in casual knits looks seductive! - that this unfortunately does not exist, so there was 'no danger' in anything that happened, just seemed silly. <br /> <br /> I admit that I only saw this once when I was 7, but by then I was already a huge fan of the original I remember being angry. For me, there is no sequel to Fright Night, just a tacky parody that does not deserve any appreciation.
