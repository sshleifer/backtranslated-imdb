Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of uninterrupted disasters and near-death experiences reminiscent of Saturday Morning's Warner Brothers cartoons. Like the coyote who falls off the cliff five times a episode, the "front man" (more like a clumsy child) can always delay his meeting with the Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> This Australian surprise is offensively bland, and sometimes even depressing. <br /> <br /> The 2 (in ten) are for visual acrobatics (some never attempted by anyone since Daffy Duck) and the use of color (as in those high-class national laundry detergents). <br /> <br /> It may be an age group where this "comedy" finds a following. <br /> <br /> I definitely passed that age a long time ago. -Teeners: Here's a "ha-ha" for you!
