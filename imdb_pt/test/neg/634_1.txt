* THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR MAYBE NOT. THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE * Dang it. Just when I thought SCIFI Channel had used all of their ridiculous ideas for movies, they gave us that. In fact, the plot itself is nothing we have not seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc ... It means that a monster / animal / threat of some sort is lurking in a nearby environment threatening a lots of people. In this case, a foreigner on a train. Wow. <br /> <br /> I must say that when I first saw this thing on the handle, I could not stop laughing. No SCIFI movie prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic that I could not believe it! The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical genre characters. But as they are not so famous (to say the least), I did not expect too much from them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments, but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called 'special effects', horrible even by SCIFI Channel standards. That model / toy made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model / toy helicopter, larger than the train car), the meteor HORIZONTALLY coming from space, the alien 'baby' (a half puppet and I ain 'kiddin'), the regular aliens who looked very ugly ... while they were static; when they started to "move," it was horrible, the explosions (the terrorist exploded LITERALLY! And what happened to the exploding helicopter! How many gas pipes did that thing carry?), the insane math used (they could not even solve a problem of the right school!) ... And I'm not going to talk about the end of doomsday, by that time I did not know if to continue laughing or start crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. But be warned; It's so ridiculous on so many levels ... and you need a lot of suspension of disbelief ...
