Tagline: the lucky ones died ... before watching this. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a 1920s Bulgarian movie, so I can not say that this is the worst film ever made, but it's certainly the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not remember that. <br /> <br /> All I can remember is a family of stupid people who do not do anything right. Their car has a four wheel trapped in the sand, so they decide there is nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. Then there is an old man who is aware of the existence of a bunch of cannibals in the whereabouts, but never considered the idea of ​​reporting it to the police. <br /> <br /> And speaking of the police ... if those aberrations lived around eating humans for years, many people must have disappeared ... how did the sheriff suspect nothing? <br /> <br /> But I gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so. The rest is boring. An unbelievable hallucination. <br /> <br /> I will be merciful and will not talk about the dialogues. And the acting. And the effects. <br /> <br /> I'll just mention the final scene where the weird girl knocks out a snake (the snakes! They come out at the end, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a stone- precise, demonstrating Mr. Craven's total disregard for reality and for things that happen on planet Earth in general. I believe there were riots when the movie was released in 1977. <br /> Even being eaten by a cannibal would not be a fair punishment for the director for this attack on intelligence.
