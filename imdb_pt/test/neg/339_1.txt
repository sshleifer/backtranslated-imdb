I really did not like this movie ~ !!!! it was boring and I did not care much. I'm more of an action girl, and I had NO. I went and rented this movie because of the other review that was left .. but it was totally misleading! Do not take this movie unless you enjoy dessert and boredom. I really did not like the movie. it was not my style, but it could be yours .. you would have to watch the previews or something, but it is my recommendation if you are a girl ... do not make this movie! This Scandinavian production is based on some of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi observation strategies, allowing us to reflect on the patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and comprehensive points of view. this is not for me!
