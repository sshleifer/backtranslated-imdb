Terror in the jungle is a real find. If you have seen, you are one of the lucky few. It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> The story is about a plane crashing in the middle of the South American jungle. The scene of the accident has to be seen to be believed. Everyone dies in the accident or is subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. Only a young blond boy survives. A nearby tribe takes the child to the village and they (all men) venerate him because of his golden hair! I'm not kidding with you! In the end, there is much fighting between the natives and the man in search of any survivors of the downed plane. All the while, the boy sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries non-stop !! It's a joke !!! <br /> <br /> Very obscure and contains very questionable subtexts. A must if you're into shady movies, it's so bad it's good.
