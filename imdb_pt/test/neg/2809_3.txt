What a pity. That could have been good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film can not decide whether it should be a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine kind) or whether it will be an insightful satire on the former East Germany and its customs. His attempts on the last flop totally, however. The film does not hold up well and the ending is very artificial and unbelievable. Any stereotype one might have about German comedy is sadly reinforced. <br /> <br /> The characters are stereotypes one and all, and the main character, played by Kim Frank, is colorless to the extreme. He simply can not carry the film and seems to have been chosen largely by his baby face. It may not all be the actor's fault (he's a pop singer), since the script does not give him much to work on. <br /> <br /> A plus - the recreation of the 'style' of East Germany and the period is good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the film feels somehow dishonest and humiliating. The movie seems to have been produced by people who were not necessarily giving their best and just wanted to make money with some cheap laughs. (If they were giving their best, it really is a sad affair!) I watched the movies with an East German audience and felt sorry for them. The GDR regime was horrible in almost all respects, but those who survived deserve more than that.
