I am one of those people who respect every filmmaker as having achieved, every movie I watch I usually respect (although I admit that I select carefully) and appreciate what it is. No longer. This is actually one of the worst scripts I've seen produced as a movie ... so much so that I felt compelled to warn others about it. The dialogue was truly unbelievable, the main protaganista was about the last person I would be interested to know more about. A scene where an old friend from school said "it made me laugh just because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of a plot already completed." The direction is superficial, at best, and at worst, the production of films by numbers. Comparing this movie with the atmospheric majesty of a movie like Five Easy Pieces is a scam.
