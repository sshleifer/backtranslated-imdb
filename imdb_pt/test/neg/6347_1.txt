One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely ridiculous. The story is bad. The animations are completely childish and displaced. The physics of holograms is hilarious as they are completely wrong. OMG, I still want to believe that this movie has the Disney seal. Disgusting. The actresses are rather beautiful, but there are so many good movies with incredible actresses that are much more valuable to watch than that. Final note, bad movie. Do not worry about watching. If you are looking for movies to watch with your kids, consider other alternatives like Ratattuile, Monster Inc or Enchanted Story. Seriously.
