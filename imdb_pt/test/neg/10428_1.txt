The inflamed, scattered, and sometimes suspect journalist's account of John Belushi's rise and fall, Bob Woodward, becomes a totally misunderstood film, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something nervous and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his discovery in "The Shield") is put in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, making a postmortem journey into his life, recreating "Saturday Night Live" skits that are now part of TV. It's like watching someone trying to get out Lucy Ball Lucille - it can not be done. The reason why there was such sadness in Belushi's death was because he was unique. Chiklis makes a commendable attempt to seek out the party, and he is funny in an early scene trying to escape the morgue. Still, it is a difficult undertaking and no actor - no matter how talented - could have saved him. * in ****
