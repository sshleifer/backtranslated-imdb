I live in Rome, where the Turkish director of this film lives and works. Of my Italian friends I heard many good things about their films ... so, after seeing the preview, I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious films, highly improbable and naive. I love movies, but this one is very heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy, and must be locked up in a hospice ... made me sympathize with the negative character of an aunt, who runs a trafficking company that only wants to make money ... and I consider myself an anti-capitalist ... so bad !!!
