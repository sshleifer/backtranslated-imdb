Something not so great. "Silence of the Lambs" remains Demme's only good movie, and I'm, of course, including all the overrated left-leaning exercises on big screen indulgence, some of which I have not seen - and never will. <br /> This is a lightweight comedy that takes a thriller to somewhere in the middle. The first half is a bit difficult to sit on; not funny or particularly interesting. Daniels plays an exaggerated naive imbecile who is so naive and confident that he defies belief. His lively acting is often annoying and not funny. He really lies to Griffith at first and tells her that he is married with children, when in fact he is divorced! In the whole history of mankind and movies, any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie - if he lie - and say he is not married. (Later, the credible or credible rationality behind it was revealed: he wanted to "protect himself." What a load of crap ...) The fact that your character makes all the wrong decisions and does All the stupid things in the movie made me really yearn for Liotta to hit him when he caught up with him in his apartment. <br /> <br /> What happens in Daniels's apartment is the classic end-of-film. fight for the death that the good guy - although the dumb guy - predictably wins. Still, at least the last half hour has some action, something going on, and Daniels no longer has the opportunity to be excited. The film lacks credible characters (whether main or marginal), and the feeling is that they are 80s, which means that the film has a rather bland appearance; visually ugly Sayles once again makes a point as a cop. The film is also perhaps a little too heavy on the side of coincidences. Griffith once again plays a soft-spoken idiot, but as always, she is convincing because she is a soft-spoken idiot. This was an earlier film, prior to her breast augmentation surgery and breast enlargement; compare the natural breasts she exposes in this movie with the exploding balloons she briefly flashes in "Nobody's Fool." <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" of Griffith and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email.
