Tedium as only the French can. I checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes, and with 143 minutes remaining, I also considered leaving. I will not even try to discuss the incoherence of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be pleasant, because in about 1 hour, I realized that none of this mattered. It was not merely self-indulgent or pretentious, it was a vacuum. A soul vacuum. This movie has no saving grace, no pleasant character, nothing funny and nothing sad. It is not smart enough to be drama, and there is no moment that is ridiculous. The most intriguing thing about this movie is how it managed to get positive and mostly positive reviews. I've been fooled by these reviews, but you do not have to be a gentle reader. All I want for Christmas is my three hours back.
