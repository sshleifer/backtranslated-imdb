The Giant Claw is in a fierce competition with films like 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for the worst movie of all time. A giant vulture that looks fake attacks the "Lionel Trains" in this completely unconscious film. The script is so bad that everything the characters say to each other is ridiculous. It is no wonder that this film is the main target of the film, "It Came From Hollywood", where this jewel is hit for the line "A bird as big as a battleship", with needles joyful and endless. The line appears relentlessly throughout the film, so there's no escaping it. There are several plans for 'The Fighter of 20,000 Fights' and 'Earth against the Flying Saucers', among other science fiction films from the 1950s to bolster the vulture's attacks. At one point, the great vulture is responsible for some deaths, so the military puts the whole world under martial law and no one can leave their homes. Of course the immense vulture is primarily concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday, wherever they may be. However, the director is so dumb that he does not even provide some photos of the beautiful Mara in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the boredom of this zero-star thriller. This is the second time that this mistake has been committed. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday wears hot dresses for the entire film, but is relegated to pants everywhere, 'The Giant Scorpion'. The budget for this movie must have been no more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and I doubt Morrow or Corday would have more than three thousand to do it. Looks like the whole thing was taken from someone's garage.
