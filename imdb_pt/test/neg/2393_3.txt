Black comedy comedy romance with a great cast and a less than stellar script. Brenda Blethyn ("Lovely & Amazing") is the title character "Betty," a woman stuck in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with her beautiful blonde secretary. Guess who's playing this smaller role, yes! Naomi Watts ("Mulholland Drive") must have sandwiched this project before her superstar status was insured with the blockbuster thriller "The Ring." <br /> <br /> On the male side of the cast list, there is the sadly mischievous Alfred. Molina ("Frida"), an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his wishes for "Betty," who have fallen asleep for decades. Maybe Miramax is hoping that Molina's next Spider-Man 2 might spark some interest in this little trinket that belongs to the DVD rental shelf. <br /> <br /> But the prize for the most foolish performance goes to Christopher Walken. ("Catch Me If You Can"), which goes completely to the top as a "modern" funeral home with its Las Vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town. Your character must have fallen into the parachute in the village because there is little reason for him to exist in this script. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you'd like to see some top-notch actors engage in some low-mood humor then this is for you, and if this is not your cup of tea then try renting " Harold and Maude, "the last funeral movie that's still funny to this day.
