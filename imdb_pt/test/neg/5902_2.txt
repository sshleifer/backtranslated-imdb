It's not usually my practice to review movies that I do not like much of. However, once or twice a year, I temporarily set aside my rule to just comment on the things I like to give a word of warning. I find it more enjoyable to comment on something I like and boost it than to shoot bad movies. But some "movies" cry out for the razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. Cinematography is not the only aspect that is blurry and out of focus here. A plot almost indiscernible (certainly incoherent, if there is one) bad acting, tacky script and bad rhythm. These are your main problems. <br /> <br /> I understand, I firmly believe that not all films are created equal and that films should be judged according to their category. It is unreasonable to judge, say, Beach Blanket Bingo against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other films in his weight category. Measured against such films as Emmanuelle or Secrets of a Chambermaid, he really sucks. Even sweet eyes have to be fun and Bilitis definitely is not.
