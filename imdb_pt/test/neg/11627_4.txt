Mickey Rourke is enjoying a renaissance at the moment ... and fair play for him. I've always liked her image and her ability to perform on dishes like Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you're going to get with Rourke - I mean, grumpy, dirty. But this movie gives you so much more - and you do not want most of it. <br /> <br /> First of all - all this does not make sense. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who after killing a student bus fled from Ireland to London. He's running away from the police and his own Army mates. He also promised never to kill again. It seems the bus full of kids finally did it for him. <br /> <br /> However, when he arrives in London, he is pursued by a local mobster (Bates - looking like his eyebrows and hair coming straight from a Burton Mannequin) to kill his main competitor, for his time, for Â£ 50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke reluctantly agrees to do so, but is seen by a priest (Hoskins) and confesses the crime to him in the confessional in order to keep the priest's mouth shut. He thinks it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> A lot of things come up here, which simply do not add up: 1. Why choose Rourke to overcome your competition? As is illustrated by a scene in which an employee is pinned to a wall by a couple of people with what appear to be punches - these London guys are tough enough to do their own murder. 2. Not only that, but the mafioso has a guy to accompany Rourke and witness the murder with his own eyes. Why did not that guy just kill the competitor and save all the trouble of dealing with Rourke? 3. Hoskins sees the murder happen and the police let him out - unprotected, I might add - to make confession? No way. 4. Rourke walks around the church (next to where he carried out the murder) immediately after the crime happens to go to confession. Why are not the police checking the place? 5. Rourke walks around the church and the blind niece of Hoskin in private, days later, without anyone bothering him. What? Is he running away and staying in the same place where he committed another murder? Stupid. 6. The cops actually find Rourke in the church "fixing" the organ and have no idea who he is. Do not they know he's fleeing the school bombing? They do not even check him? 7. Why take Rourke to kill for you and then ask him to wait a few days to board the boat? You think you'd like to get rid of it immediately. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why does Bates's brother suddenly decide to rape the blind niece in the middle of all the waiting? Could not he contain himself for a few days? At least until Rourke was safely surrendered to the United States? Ridiculous. 9. Rourke suddenly has inner turmoil after all her years of murder and beats the blind niece immediately - even after she knows he is a murderer, does she still love him? Again - absolutely ridiculous. And besides - she falls in love with him in record time - a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb thing at the end is just silly from Bates's point of view. 11. Things happen in parts of this movie that just do not make sense or are simply there to help the plot (and I mean it in jest). Bates' houses will stop at a brothel until the boat is ready to sail and Rourke suddenly shows a high ground to respect the house whore - but he will still lay a blind girl. 12. Rourke asks a henchman on the boat where Bates is - and the henchman practically expels every move of his boss in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the guy was telling Rourke a lot more than he himself asked. 13. Hoskin's priest is a former military man and we see him beat up three henchmen behind a pub. Totally no toll and another worthy scene. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stop there in the bad luck of 13 without mentioning Rourke's hair (so fake red that's laughable), his accent (which to be fair is not so bad at times, but deteriorates to a murmur barely heard at other times), his clothes, walk, look at the sky, etc. Nor will I mention the song and the unstable editing style. <br /> <br /> Oooppps - I just mentioned them. Overall - a disaster of a movie with some obvious religious images (Rourke on the cross, preaching in a pulpit) that would embarrass a first year film student, it would not matter star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
