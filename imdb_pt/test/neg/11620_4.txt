There are only 2 reasons to watch this show ... I've invested time in previous episodes and Col Tigh. To all the supposed science fiction fans who love the new BSG, give me some time! Go read some classic science fiction novels from the real big names or watch some of the most important movies and TV shows of the past and you'll see which hacks these BSG writers are. His only trick is "who is the fifth Cylon." Poor writing and really, really no sense of character development. If Adama renounces or tries to take power or cry again or discovers the inner parent, he should have stayed one more time ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is such a boring character that has already been put on board a ship. Out of the camera with her. I could care less if it's another six months before they finish. These aspiring writers were without tricks in the first season. If you do not know this, you just do not know how to write.
