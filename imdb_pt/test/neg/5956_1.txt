Where do I start? The box should have been enough to keep me from this attempt, but I learned early on not to judge a book (or film) by cover, so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can not make a single static image correctly, how vicious will those who move later be? Yes. They were pretty awful. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie seemed totally unaware that they were being filmed, since any expression seemed to get along regardless of the situation in which the characters were or were responding. <br /> <br /> However, a good story can compensate for the declines in low budget productions. A good dialogue can lead to a poorly funded attempt at times. Unfortunately, this was not one of those moments, since the story was as weak and nonexistent as the others demanded elements of good cinema. <br /> <br /> There are simply no words for how bad this was. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get the idea of ​​my rating of -2.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Devil :.
