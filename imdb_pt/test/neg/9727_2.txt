I feel very generous in giving this movie a 2 out of 10. Okay, I noticed that the special effects are 'okay' and Renny Harlin made one of my favorite movies against a genetically altered shark-of-research-station, which you may know as Deep Blue Sea. In addition, the opening credits are very well done with a remix of "more human than human" from WhiteZombie and goes very well with what is in the context of this "movie". It's too much a drug. Since Uwe Boll's film Alone in the Dark, I've never felt that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted. Okay, our story begins with four guys who are descendants of four different families. Each of them possesses a power never fully explained from a never fully explained family background that has made an art never fully explained of witchcraft. Oh, and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, all go to the same school, are all team-bound swimming and everyone, for some reason or another, sit in bed in their shirts, sweating and talking to each other. I have nothing against gays, goths or thirteen years of age, but this is what this movie is intended for .. 13 - year - old goth who question their sexuality. in which they sit on their beds in their panties or whatever, but how come they do not take their shirts off? Hey, that's fair. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18, they will ascend and receive new, almost divine powers. But before going any further, I forgot to mention that when they use their powers, they age slowly and become more addicted to it. This explains why they got people over the age of 20 to play at age 17. Oh, and if something needs to be explained, do not worry, someone will explain everything in a big part of the dialogue. God, this movie sucks ... where was I? Oh, yes, part of the ascension. <br /> <br /> Okay, apparently there was a super-secret-alpha-family that others forgot or something, I do not know, I was dozing off at the moment. But they were written somehow and the new kid at school who is making friends with the group is "secretly" one of those descendants of the fifth family. And I say 'secretly' because anyone who has seen any of the previews in this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. He has greater power than the others because he is older, I think. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (say it out loud) things happen and we got to the final fight in the movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was all set for a battle of witches. You know how Saurmon versus Gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle, because you know, this is about witches and other things. Now, when those two witches fall, it's more like ... how can I say ... a very, very bad version of a Dragonball Z type battle. They throw things at each other, talk, play things, talk, play things, talk, etc. When I say 'throw things' I only say this because I have no idea what the F #% k play at each other. It looks like large drops of viscous water. God, this movie sucks, anyways, when our main witch 'ascends' it does not get too powerful. It just throws bigger drops of viscous water. Things happen and end in a way that you, as the viewer, know that this will end. The good witch wins the bad witch loses. <br /> <br /> You know what a fucking movie is when the thug says something so incredibly stupid as, 'I'm going to make you mine' That's where I wanted to punch I in the face for sitting with this thing all ... <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit, the thought of witches doing battle, using powers in modern days sounds kind of cool, but when the execution is so bad, I really wish they would not make this movie . Maybe if he was classified as R, had had oral sex and thrown more deaths with a pinch of blood, it might have worked ... could have worked. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching, do not buy it or even rent it. Expect it to arrive on TV or borrow from your sucker from a friend who bought it. Just do not waste your time with this movie trick. If you spend some money on this, there's a good chance you'll put an effort toward a sequel to be made by Uwe Boll called The Covenant 2: Alone in the Dark with the House of the Dead.
