Let's start by recognizing that there are, arguably, three types of horror films: good, bad and totally embarrassing, that make the whole genre suffer in every way. Dark Harvest promises great with your Artisan DVD cover, but make sure that's where the show ends. Following a grueling opening montage, we soon discovered that the film consists of a very poorly written, extremely skilled script (even for a start-up movie), disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. Seriously, could anyone pay anything more than a mask to the villain, or did they just think it was good enough for Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, so is it good enough for us? Well, it did not work to create a scary villain. Anyway, this is one of the movies that make you check your watch, sigh and curse your own credulity. The time in each scene is painful, and the whole production has a sense of secondary school (I have come to think of it, I have seen better theatrical productions in high school, even the special effects). I'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train disaster be donated as drink coasters, Frisbees, wind chimes ....... I'd say "go see for yourself," but that would be cruel. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of this producer's reviews and you'll find the same for all of your movies. They claim to honor the contract between the cinema and the audience (ie, please the fans), but all they did was laugh and put a burden on our heads for the money (of which I'm sure they saw very little for that) . <br /> <br /> Sorry people, high ratings and favorable reviews are posted, obviously, by those who are directly or indirectly linked to this farce. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating. Giving up one makes me angry.
