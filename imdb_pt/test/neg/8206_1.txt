If it were possible to give negative stars, I would do for this stinkburger. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good low-quality film. I'm a big fan of movies like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. True classics from B-Cinema. <br /> <br /> But this movie makes Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror look like an Oscar winner! Dialouge is so unnecessarily wordy and misused. (ie "I'm going now Condensed (yes, condensed !!) to your wishes." The acting could have been much better if they had some more logical lines. is he exiled because his wife had leprosy? I'm still not sure about that.A (Rich?) Fleet One and Captian of one of their ships crash on the island? People acting abnormally? OK, I like to camp in b - there's a lot of his charm, but this was just plain stupid ... a salty sea captain who sounds as good as a college professor - a fleet owner who is as clueless as it comes (I felt this guy had no idea how to play , a scene in which he is acting Spanish, the next English / European)? The Count, who is not sure if it is a reincarnation or really DeSade (do not ask me how DeSade fits in, then 4 beers my wife, friend and I I still can not figure it out. <br /> <br /> The fear factor? turkey for my little grandchildren and just worry about them sleeping through it. From the horror movies of the early 60's, and some still have good shocks, but this thing ... never had a fright, or even a hint of fright. <br /> <br /> In the information on the back says: "This film contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will overcome their worst nightmare." The only degradation is watching this movie. It's 90 minutes (the case says it's 74 minutes) of your life that you do not get back. <br /> <br /> I paid only a dollar, yes a dollar, for this and another movie. I still feel that I owe .50 cents for sitting on it. <br /> <br /> In short, Dungeon Of Harrow had no one named Harrow, but had a lovely cardboard dungeon.
