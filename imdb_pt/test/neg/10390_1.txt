OK, I usually do not add comments on movies, but I finally watched a movie that was so full of bullshit and full of incompetence that I had to warn people. The Black Water Valley Exorcist is free to beat / kill / father of wives and this family of horse crazy, and to shorten the story, the youngest daughter who has been molested by the priest, but in love with the farm owned. Along with a heroic god avoiding the Mexican gardener who once participated in an exorcism, the wife's beater / priest manages to save the day, but not before the demon possessed can jump at a prostitute the city sheriff blew up. . In short, this movie is the biggest pile of useless stuff (I could be very descriptive with this part, but why waste my energy with that movie) I've seen. Anyone associated with the making of this film must be sterilized so that it can not pollute the earth with its useless spawning.
