They say David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. That sounds right. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying that Saddam Hussein was not as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw lives in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He pretended to be French all this time. He reveals to his wife that he is really American. For some reason, this comes as a startling revelation for her, despite the fact that she always comments on her husband's American accent. In addition, his son - remember, he was born in France and never knew that his father was American - speaks perfect American English without a touch of French accent. This is just one of several huge holes in this movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is a flashback of Tommy's youth in New York during the 1970s when he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a retarded adult who played terribly with Robin Williams. I assume Duchovny thinks "retarded" is somebody who is kind of dumb, because Pappas comes out only a little slow at times, while at other times he's just Robin Williams. Yes, Williams really fits his impromptu whisper, though it should interpret a person who is mentally slow. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife Tea Leoni, is a nurse who makes pills and is upset. about the recent death of her husband. Leoni does a good job, but she mostly smokes and screams at Tommy for things that do not seem to be very important. The script did not give her much work. Tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls "Lady") who is in prison and offers him advice through his prison window (this detention house is called "House of D", hence the title ). Tommy has no scruples shouting his personal problems out loud on a city street, so this incarcerated criminal can offer him advice, and he does it often without care. <br /> <br /> I do not want to bore you with a full summary of the movie, but there are many holes in this movie that try hard to be touched but it comes off as, well, bad. Too bad. Too bad indeed. Near the end of the train wreck, the script gets fuller and gentler and ends with a ridiculously bad end. <br /> <br /> Critics ripped apart House of D and rightly so. I can not believe that some people really like this movie. It's a painful movie to sit on and I felt weak afterwards - not from emotion, but from how terrible it was.
