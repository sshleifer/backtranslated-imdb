When you watch low budget horror movies as much as I do, you get to where you can tell who was involved in creating the film, as each filmmaker adds their own cheese flavor. Such is the case of Jack-O. When I watched this really horrible movie, I got the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved, maybe not as a director, but somehow, and while I was researching, I discovered that I was right. Only Fred and a handful of others could write something so pathetic, and this movie just smelled like Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God knows why anyone would) avoid that movie. If you're renting a photo of Olen Ray, rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers, you're the only bright star in Olen Ray's dark universe of horrifying movies.
