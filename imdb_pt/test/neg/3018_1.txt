Although it bothers me to some extent that I am bothering to call the commentary table of this new series - mainly because I would hate to give the false impression that there really is any semblance of public interest - I feel compelled to play my chips on this. Simply put, I've never felt so convinced to cheer for the quick and ruthless cancellation of a TV show based solely on the merit of its promotional ads. And, in case you're wondering, I'm a guy. Listen, Comedy Network: Although your original programming is, let's say politely, of a 'questionable' quality (I'm Looking At You, 'Girls Will Be Girls') you really got over it. Whoever has turned on the green light, this thing could not be further from what is happening at the moment. <br /> <br /> Good luck.
