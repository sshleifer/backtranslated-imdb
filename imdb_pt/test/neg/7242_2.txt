The Salena Incident is situated in Arizona where six death row inmates are being transferred from state prison for reasons never explained, while driving along the heavily armed prison bus receives an apartment and the driver is forced off the road . Then two blond birds appear and after seducing the incompetent prison guards manage to get the best of them, the six prisoners are released, but in a shootout their escape car is damaged leaving them all trapped in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to go to the nearest town, Salena several miles away and take the cops with them as hostages. When they arrive in Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely deserted, with no other person in sight. They soon discover that the whole city was killed by flesh aliens and they are firmly placed on the menu ... Also known as Alien Invasion Arizona in the US on DVD and apparently taking the tentative title Terror Town this dirty budget low-budget sci-fi horror film was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redeeming feature, to be frank The Salena Incident is the kind of movie that gives movies a bad name. The film could be divided into two parts, the opening forty or fifty odd minutes focuses on the prisoners in a thriller feeling open, guards and escape, although it is very poorly written and staged material. The dialogue between the two blond birds and the prison guards is so bad that it is not intentionally funny how the two birds fit the two prison guards not so well. Funny things, in fact, unfortunately The Salena incident is supposed to be a science fiction horror movie, not a comedy. So once the cons escaped and their prison guard hostages arrive in Salena, they will enter the science fiction horror mode when the aliens appear and start killing our cliché character, which is good because they are annoying. Look, the whole movie sucks, since it's badly written, thought-out, and done. I really can not be bothered to get into why but trust me The Salena Incident is terrible on all levels. <br /> <br /> In addition to being just a bad, boring and stupid movie The Salena incident is also poorly made. The action scenes are terrible, the aliens look terrible and are never shown on screen at the same time as the human characters and as such sometimes it's hard to tell what's going on. The special effects are also bad, the aliens look like garbage and the effects of computer graphics are absolutely terrible as well. The editing is bad, the cinematography is bad, the sets are cheap and the whole thing is really a monstrosity. There is some blood, there are some gunshot wounds, someone is ripped in half and a severed hand is seen. Obviously shot on a low budget The Salena Incident has low production values ​​and looks cheap from start to finish. Shot in Superior in Arizona. The acting is terrible from anyone I've ever heard of, although the actress who plays the doctor is very pretty. <br /> <br /> The Salena Incident is a science fiction horror movie that is terrible in just about all aspects, not worth 90 minutes of yours, mine or anyone else's.
