So you're a giant mantis and you've been in the Arctic for a while, and you're tired of the Eskimos hitting you with snowballs. What is a giant mutant insect to do? Go to the big city, of course! See the sights, maybe attend a Broadway show. But wait! Only when you find a nice and cozy tunnel to call your own, some annoying humans begin to attack you !! Argh! Time to crush! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a step up in most other giant bug movies because it has pretty decent FX for 1957. But that's about it. Avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things, or see another actor Perry Mason in a B movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
