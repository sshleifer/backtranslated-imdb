This is the worst of Wes Craven! this is the worst horror, if you can call it horror, you will never watch, especially from one of the horror masters Wes Craven, Poor Direction, Poor Operation, Poor Set, Poor Atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of crap ever! the bad guy is totally unconvincing, you could not even feel sorry for the guy! the blood and horror involved in the movie are laughable, it's just rubbish! the only good points I can think of are: It stars Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but not even this cast could prevent it from being out of control and becoming one of the worst horrors of all time. If you still do not watch, do not worry, you'll just hate it.
