I have no idea how this is rated as high as it is (5.8 at the time of writing), but this movie was absolutely horrible. The performance was not all bad, but it really did not make any sense and the overall quality was poor. It's obviously a B movie (or a C if such a thing exists) and it looks like it was done over a weekend at a friends house or something. Im all for low budget movies and I usually watch any that I came across, but this one is actually pretty bad. I mean like "The Fanglys" bad. I do not know what else to say, but trust this as I really sat through this awful horrible movie and I can spare you the effort ... Do not worry. Seriously ... Just do not do it.
