I'm the kind of guy who loves New Jack City cover films for Baby Boy for Killa Season, from grade b to Hollywood. but this movie was something different. I'm no hater and this movie was kind of fun. but some bits were just strangers. Well, the performance was not good, compared to Silkk The Shockers in Hot Boyz (very good) and Ice-T in new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the guy wants to be Jamaican he says something and lights up in flames burning both Ice-T and the other guy, this kills the Jamaican, however Ice-T is unharmed, very similar to the other Ice Urban Threat of the movie (which stars both actors) were Snoops character is supernatural, however, after this, there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) is stabbed in the beginning he fights, but after that he fights normally and is stabbed in the thigh - WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ confesses to killing a policeman because the cop was beating his friend Benny was weird, Benny is not featured in this movie and the scene is not in the movie. He maintains the weight of the fact that the Corrupt wants to kill the MJ, but still makes you scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to the character Miss Jones explaining what happened to them then does not mention what will happen to two other main characters, MJ and Lisa. The film showed that the horror and poverty of the ghetto - which plagues the lives of Latinos and blacks - was a good part of the film, although the clip of the projects has been reused thousands of times. and the scene in which Miles kills his Latino brother, hitting his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running to my Latino brothers car would kill him. the film was similar to the movie Urban Menace and half of the actors were in both the films as well as the production team. Breakfast was ok tho. but I being of poverty I love film covers, however, if you do not like, I do not watch. The only thing that saved me from leaving was to remember the first movie I did, which was made with $ 100, and my love of the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
