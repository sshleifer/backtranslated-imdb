it's just me or I have all the horror movies becoming nothing more than tits, slapstick and a villain who can not be killed. this movie made no sense. what happened to the days of a person being able to escape the killer as in the hostel. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. victor crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. he reminded me of a demon between the quasimodo and the leather face. It was over that while Victor was lying on fire, no one thought of finishing the job. and the finale was the biggest disappointment of all the remnants of the late soprano. I had to agree with the guy behind me when he let slip ... WHAT THE F ***! If I could give the film a negative note, I would have taken care of it.
