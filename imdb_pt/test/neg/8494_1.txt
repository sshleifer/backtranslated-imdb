What the hell is this movie? Well, if I did not know that "son of the mask" is categorized as comedy, I would never have a clue! A comedy? A tragedy, that's the right genre for this even more so-called sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, I watched "Dumb and Dumber," but I never believed anyone would do the real title in Hollywood. Yes, you watch "Son of the Mask" and you think .. 5 minutes - mute ... 10 minutes - Stupid ... 15 - minutes more stupid ... And then, after 16 minutes, there is only one thing to say: / I'm out of here ... <br /> <br /> Sorry, my candidate for Comedy Crap of the Year 2005.
