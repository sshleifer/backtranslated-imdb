Critics fall upon themselves within Weinstein's Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided, and repulsive adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it is based. Minghella's direction of blatantly episodic and bloody odyssey is one of the many misunderstandings of this "civil war love story." They are playing? After Kidman and Mr. Law meet up with zero-screen chemistry in a small town in North Carolina and steal a kiss before heading off to war for Jude and his photo of the girl he left behind is a two-way hours to the kidneys about whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soul mate. Who cares? The amateur scene of Philip S. Hoffman, who plays a disgusting and dull paper, pales with the appearance of Renee Zelweger as a corn-fed dinosaur miraculously explodes over the scene of Kidman's solitary farm to save the day. Rarely does a shouted performance of "look at me, I'm acting" presumptuous. His deafening nerve wakes the strings for a few minutes until the bad mood becomes painfully thin. Launched by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins seemingly have, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won eight Globo nominations for their overblown failure. The resulting crime is that the awards have become meaningless and the small, less powerful and PR-driven films become obscure. Cold Mountain is a conceptual film and a waste of bitter and empty time. Cold indeed !!!
