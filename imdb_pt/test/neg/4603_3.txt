I waited a long time to see this movie. IFC finally ran one night. I thought it would be something like "Barfly" by Barbet Schroeder. Wrong. This movie does not recreate the underworld of colorful, dirty, smoke-filled bars full of characters you associate with your stories. He also fails to capture this attitude of Bukowski that Mickey Rourke did so well in the movie mentioned above. This natural and clever attitude. Charles Bukowski's fans will love to see scenes from his books on the screen, but those who are unfamiliar with his books may have the wrong impression about his works. This movie looks like just another movie of the week about a drunk and their relationships, if you want to get a better idea about the world of Charles Bukowski watch "Barfly".
