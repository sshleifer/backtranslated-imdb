The film contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely stunning to a 56 year old lady, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. Otherwise, he has an unmotivated and pointless script, and the lead actress has no appeal from Deneuve. The director apparently watched a lot of Peter Greenaway films and Pola X appears as an imitation of the Greenaway style by the students, without any inspiration.
