The plot in this movie is very thin and there is not much acting. Val Kilmer - I do not know why he agreed to make this film - he plays a minor role as a gang leader. In short, the film is tedious to watch. <br /> <br /> A guy who looks like an archeology / religion teacher is exploring an underground area of ​​Moscow that has some history connected with railroad construction and the Bolshevik. revolution. A tragedy in the church in that story makes exploration "spiritual," and spirits of malevolent intent haunt subterranean ruins. A friend of the professor decides to meet his friend in the underground and hires two Russian guides. The entire film is based on this plot and contains scenes very repeated of the underground, and some effects of camera; much like those seen in "Day Watch", "Night Watch", etc.
