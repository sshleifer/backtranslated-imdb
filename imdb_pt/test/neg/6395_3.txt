This movie should be called blame in the script. Directed by Stanley Donen of Singin 'in the Rain, this middle-aged crisis is not all that bad. There are some lush scenes from Rio de Janeiro and a lot of half-naked extras playing with the others and playing on the beach with the muffled sounds of samba, but there's something about watching fifty-something Michael Caine can do with the weeping teen Michelle Johnson. to feel ... well, despicable. This plot is a complete stretch as well. No one other than perverted and vain movie veterans in Hollywood could have ignited this embarrassment. Maybe they're just as accustomed to having young bimbos as their arms, forgetting that it's their fat wallets that hold the key to their appeal, not their huge Larry King-style glasses and yellow-stained cigar teeth. It's one thing for a young, fun-loving young woman to have a crush on an older man, but for the father of her best friend who is married? And then throw himself blatantly at him? Ugh! There is nothing interesting about it. It's a bit pathetic and grotesque. Write down the * cough * talent of young Demi Moore.
