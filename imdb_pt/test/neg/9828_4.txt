The prodigious production values ​​you usually find in a Merchant / Ivory movie are all here, but this is an extremely dull approach to what could have been a very lively affair. I agree with an earlier poster that it does not make sense for the story to unfold through the eyes of an African-American family, and yet its own ancestor, Sally Hemmings, has virtually no role to play in the process. There is not much clarity to help the public understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. And I was very annoyed by the accent of various characters. Nancy Marchand looked very British for what she was supposed to be a French nun. And both Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi seemed to experience different accents in various scenes. In fact, Gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. Her role as Thomas Jefferson's daughter, Martha, is written in such a way that we can never understand who she really is. One moment she is slapping a slave, and at another, she deplores the whole system of slavery. Nick Nolte plays the part well enough, but never really makes us care about Jefferson or any of his exploits. Very disappointing all in all.
