I do not remember, at least for the last ten years, a movie that I liked less than Mama Mia. From the nonexistent act to the atrocious song, I was shrinking at least once a minute. I do not believe I can remember a brief segment I tolerated. I know I will never watch this disaster again. I can not believe that with so many expectations due to the talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, that a movie can be a failure. But to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drug-induced dance, and then, horrors of horrors, to hear the singing of Pierce Brosnan (!), I can not see how this movie will not enter the hall of shame. . Definitely a movie that should never have been made, and just in case you missed the first time, one that I will never watch again.
