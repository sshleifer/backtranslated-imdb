And one of them is a bad movie. The title, as seen, refers to a killer of the male human variety, not fish. This is not the "Piranha" led by Dante of 78 (who had the fish) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha". A trio of photographers, two men and one woman, joined a hunter / hunter named Caribe somewhere in the Amazon jungle. Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the curriculum of William Smith, who plays the Caribbean; otherwise, they would immediately know that he is the villain of the play. Smith may also have refused to film the ending or cut before finishing filming (see the end of this comment). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this photo has a lot of fill material - long photos of the local wildlife. (birds) - and the centerpiece, a long-lasting motorcycle race. The reason this gets a second star from me is of course William Smith who can not really save this slime but again proves why he was the guy to 'go to' 30-35 years ago if you needed something really unpleasant. villain; at its best, Smith could be really terrifying. He's the kind that likes to kill, possibly sadistically, and you get that sense of the evil grin he usually puts in when the weather hits him. Physically, he is very imposing and you know that the other 3 characters are doomed within the first half hour. This is what Smith brought to most of his roles; seems impossible to the other characters against this human monster. Unfortunately, the film continues to confuse things to the end, as if a minute of footage was lost - a confusing and incomplete climax.
