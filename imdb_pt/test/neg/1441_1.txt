If you want to see a horror movie that is horrible and very bad taste, this is definitely the movie to watch. This movie begins with two young teenagers having crazy ideas about going into a chat room and going out on blind dates, and quite possibly they'll end up like a lamb for the slaughterhouse. Lots of blood, blood, nudity, handcuffs and all sorts of blood sucking hooks and things you will never dream of that a person is able to accomplish in both men and women. If you like piercing as well, this type of piercing deals with heavy heavy hooks and many tattoos; in addition, many needles and thread to seal things in the human body. I really hope this movie does not give someone sick in this world, the idea of ​​representing these horrors in real life.
