Being a gay man who lived the period of time examined in this tedious documentary, I was eager to see how the subject was treated. Unfortunately, the filmmakers have squandered what might have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our gay collective history. This movie only cares about the period within New York City, ignoring the rest of the country. While I spent a lot of time in New York at the time, I can guarantee there was a gay life out of Manhattan! The men interviewed here are the same "A-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the '70s, and here they are again, taking on a nostalgic and even flirtatious attitude. The film should have at least attempted to cover larger topics such as race, old prejudice, the burgeoning wealth-based gay "caste system," body image and clone rise, subgroup discrimination within the community, and capacity to cultivate a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70's!). Unfortunately, we have nothing of the kind presented, and the recollections of those interviewed are no different from my own memories. If you were there in that decade, you'll enjoy the archive photos and home movies of the bars and nightclubs that haunt us. If you were not there, this movie will no doubt look dull. It should have been much more, but unfortunately it is not. Two stars to run my memory ... I still miss going to Anvil!
