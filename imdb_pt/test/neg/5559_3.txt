This is a parody. This means that there are no characters as such, they are all simple stereotypes, and the film depends entirely on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real stupid. If one expects all dialogues to be absurd, the fun disappears. <br /> <br /> Look, there's American Pie 2, my all time favorite teen movie. It contains many real original characters. Maybe the jokes do not taste, but all people have some kind of life. For example, they feel embarrassed when something embarrassing happens. That's what makes the funny jokes themselves! <br /> <br /> It's not like this movie: every scene is clearly organized as a pure parody, so there are no characters, so there is no room for any sympathy. . Also, if you know the original movies, you know entire scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me from getting completely bored was the fact that the comments of some teenagers in the movie theater where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in one scene. Sigh. She's really cool, she can not be real. Hmm, is it worth a whole movie?
