In a happy home comes the gypsy girl, played by Myrna Loy. With her incredibly wild hair and voice that sounds very sharp and strange, it's hard to believe this is Loy !! She bears no resemblance to the refined and funny character Nora Charles, who played in the Thin Man movies. Instead, she is so overwhelmed that you almost expect her to be in an Ed Wood movie. What a great difference some years made in the quality films she achieved, as well as her acting ability !! On top of the horrendously silly character, the movie also fails because it simply is not interesting or exciting - just very, very stagy and stupid. The only good thing about this is the Vitaphone sound system - making the sound quality of this turkey about the best I've heard of 1929. Heck, it was even better than most 1930s films, so the sound technician, at least, have something to be proud of everyone else, forget it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that even the presenter of Turner Classic Movies called "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! And after seeing it I disagree ... a little. The movie is just plain bad.
