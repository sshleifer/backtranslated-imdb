For a Norris movie this is very tame. For an action movie, it's kind of boring, and as for predictability, my friend and I almost had every turn of that movie preached. It was cool that all of the killer's moves were not telegraphed by the clich√© of the 1980s action movies, but come on, the only unpredictable move challenges the plot and editing. Mainly, it is said very early that the killer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little known actors) only kills women. STILL, it suddenly stops its M.O. and kills men, eh? I think it can be interpreted and rationalized in some way, but why is the movie edited to show that it will kill women? <br /> <br /> Once again, I'm sure there is a reason (ie to create suspense), but why spend time watching when many other thriller movies are far superior. Renegade fans may appreciate the small cameo of Branscombe Richmond as Victor, but his brief appearance can not save the film and even a 4-vote seems generous. <br /> <br />
