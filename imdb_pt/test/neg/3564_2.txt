A depressed and scary teenager does a lot of bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like wearing masks or curtains on her windows. He kneads down several things of her, lurks at her, makes pranks, and does several nasty tricks on her. Oddly, he does not keep any of it a secret from her. At first, she does not seem to care in one way or another that he's bothering. Then, later on, she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel febrile activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical items to watch. One is that the guy lurks the night through a glass panel on the brighter side. In real life, that would not happen. The brighter side of a glass panel acts as a mirror. He would be able to see exactly anything. Also, everyone outside at night would be able to look inside of him sitting in his well-lit room. Another illogical item is that the weird teenager takes a job as a milkman, and his and her only client every morning seems to be the lady he's picking. Easy work if you can. <br /> <br /> I saw a short movie about love in public. In the end, there was not a single eye open in the house. A short movie about love is the foreign language film for those who do not like to read subtitles. There are not a few words spoken in the film, but much of the film is silent. A certain rest in peace.
