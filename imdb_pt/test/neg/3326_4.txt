I thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching. The premise was very silly and predictable. I did not go very far in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see. She's obviously older than the cab driver (unless she's much younger than she looks). He is black and she is white. She makes more money than he (he's just a taxi driver). There are 3 of the statistically most unsuccessful unions in society, all in one, and we must pretend they have a chance in hell. It would be better to marry the guy she does not love. <br /> <br /> I only partially watched because I love MJW as an actor. His performance was excellent. Her, meh! Okay, but the premise is very silly. He did not see the end. I could not get there, so I do not know if it ended differently than I predicted the end would be. I can not imagine any black women liking this movie. There is something disgusting about seeing a black man attending a white woman like that. And an old man in that. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
