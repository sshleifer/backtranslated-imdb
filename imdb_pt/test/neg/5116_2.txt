Looking all 29 years old, Rob Lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation. <br /> <br /> When a society's husband (Leslie Hope) is found dead, police suspect the rich girl may have something to do with it. Enter Rob, who immediately falls in love with the beautiful widow, though he claims he is just trying to be "useful." Rob is such a good cop, he is able to steal some of his incriminating love letters from his coat pocket before accidentally tossing them into the fireplace. Monotonous dark drama with an endless drone of background music. <br /> <br /> This is a good substitute sleeping pill if you run out of Sominex.
