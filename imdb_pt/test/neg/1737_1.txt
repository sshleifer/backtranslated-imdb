Worst.film.ever Nothing more needs to be said. Aaron Carter is totally repulsive and the rest of the cast must fire their agents immediately. It really is a terrible terrible movie from start to finish. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing the many films (oh so many) flaws however I can not be bothered / get too annoyed to form appropriate phrases. <br /> <br /> In short, I absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad its good" half way ... <br /> <br /> It was drek unchanged. <br /> <br /> Gavin
