The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on the DVD Troma is disappointing. This seems to be a censored copy for television. Some of the more violent scenes were edited and parts of the colored language were removed. Anyone who has seen the uncut film will be furious with this toxic version of DVD. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original theatrical cut. However, even when released on DVD, the film is still one of the best representations of bushranger life in nineteenth-century Australia. Once you have visited the Old Melbourne Gaol, with mortuary masks of convicts on display, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.
