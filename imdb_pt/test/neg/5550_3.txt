Say what you want about Gore's "Mage of Gore", Herschell Gordon Lewis, it must be admitted that from his first films (1963 "Blood Feast" and 1964 of the crackerbarrel massacre "Two Thousand Maniacs") to his last Gore Gore ", the man remained faithful to his muse, happily cutting off the bodies of young men and women for the delight of the camera. & Bottoms, and the obnoxious detective Gentry is hired by a novice reporter to assist in the case. The film features extraordinarily irritating and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, lousy acting, disgusting characters, troublesome sound, and of course some of the scenes One of the strippers has his face set in boiling oil, one has a torn head, the other has his face past and his nippies cut, and yet another has his back shipped with a meat tenderizer until your whole ass is covered with what looks like Buitoni tomato sauce. (I might be wrong here, it might have been Ragu.) The movie also casts a bit of humor, though some of the lines are pretty funny. For example, we learned that the real name of the stripper Suzie Creampuff slipper was ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says "Made In Poland" (I do not know why, but I found it funny). And some of the stripes owner's lines, Henny Youngman, are, of course, fun. Still, this is not the movie to show Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. It's one of the sickest you've ever seen, with just a foolproof and enjoyable moment - the title card at the conclusion of the movie that says, "We Pride Announced: This Movie is Over!"
