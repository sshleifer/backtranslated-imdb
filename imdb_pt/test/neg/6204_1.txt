I just do not know how that stupid movie, trash, trash, trash and nothing is a blockbuster. It was so boring with a very, very weak (or not) story line and it was not at all funny. The film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and is helping unhappy and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) to get the girl he wants. I'm not saying I did not like the movie because it was not funny or anything, I accept a movie that is not funny, but it has a decent story. The only two reasons why I can say that it's a super hit are: 1. Salman Khan and Govinda are together on the screen but the first time together was in Salaam and Ishq which was a flop, then it can not be. But it was a very good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan's name is Prem and all of the films by that name were a hit, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard it's a remake of Hitch, I did not see it and I'm glad I did not see it. Music is good, the only good songs are You want a partner, You are my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what is the use of this in a very bad movie, too, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif who dances with two feet left? She totally sucks. Neither does she know how to act, language (her voice is always dubbed by her), dance and always does not impress. I did not like her at all she was up disappointing in Koffee with Karan. General Partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress Katrina Kaif. She'd better be thrown out of Bollywood and never come back.
