I do not know where most of you were, but where I watched the movie we did not have people singing as some said they experienced, we had people laughing, especially in the exaggerated plot, the horrible dance sequences and the singing the likes of Brosnan . The only people in the audience who seemed to be thrilled with the film were the people of the seventies who were somehow reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA show at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September 79, so I liked them and I still do that now. But this movie should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I can not believe that a gym prize winner would go down so much to the point of doing this piece of crap. So save your money, expect it to come out on DVD and maybe spend your money on something better, like junk for cats.
