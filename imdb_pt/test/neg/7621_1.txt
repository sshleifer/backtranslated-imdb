What was Wes thinking of doing this dribble? It did not fit well with any of his other works, but again he seemed to fall into a slight fall after making a Nightmare On Elm Street. This can be seen by its accompaniments 1.Invatation to Hell 2.Chiller 3.Hills Have Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and the rainbow 6.Shocker all these movies were or mediocre our crap, it was not until the people under the stairs he gained his impetus back and started kicking his ass again. Chiller himself does not have any of Craven's regular clients and none of his suspense. The only good scene where the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after getting married to work.
