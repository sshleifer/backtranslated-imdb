the picture is good, the costumes are good, but the editing is bad. The various scenes are cut or interrupted at the wrong times, and the conversations are sudden and tedious. This slowness continues the whole show. It's a very tedious show to watch. . . . I believe more scenes should have been added, but that would make for a longer show. It's very slow. The writers should have done a show for only 1 night and not prolong our agony night after night. There is nothing else, otherwise I would change the channel (the first night). I feel bad for the Indians of the time and I am angry with the whites for what they did to the Indians, but that is our story.
