This movie was terrible not only was the plot weak, but the acting was unbelievable bad, and sometimes pathetic. Dialogs very unrealistic, people in real life do not talk like that and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotonous, except for the almost indistinguishable whisper that constantly occurs. Even the editing is bad, the cuts are terrible. The camera work was sloppy and unsteady in close-ups, even wobbling during the conversations. There is nothing positive about this movie and George Katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he does not need to talk to other humans because he clearly does not know how. How this movie won / was nominated for awards oh my god !!
