The plot of this movie is clich√© and of course it was ripped out of Jurassic Park. The filmmakers did not even try to hide it. It seems like there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy dinosaurs (from a cheap toy store) that move in a very unnatural way. It's funny because it's so bad. The acting is almost as unnatural as the dinosaurs. Nobody seems very excited to be in this movie (which I totally understand). Especially the last half hour is extremely annoying and it is almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. The note of positive comment I would like to make about "Raptor" is that it does not take 90 full minutes.
