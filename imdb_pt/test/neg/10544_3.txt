The Toxic Avenger, a horribly deformed creature of superhuman size and strength, is back in this almost always wrong sequel. Toxie goes to Japan to find his father at the suggestion of his psychiatrist, who is in collusion with an evil corporation who only wants the avenger to strangle Tromaville in his absence. With new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this, a much less somber tone, much more comical, and a storyline that can not hold a candle to the original. Even with the totally uncut version you can only get if you buy the DVD set from the Tox Box, blood is the only thing that goes into this. And if you happen to ANY other version, forget to get some pleasure with this at all. While the first is a low budget classic, this simply is not. <br /> <br /> My notes: D + <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast slip; Phoebe Legere goes topless; a villain is completely naked; and a few extras in a bathroom scene show various amounts of skin.
