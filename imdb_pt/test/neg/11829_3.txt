... and in this series, I was reduced to an annoying athlete with a gay hairstyle. Remember my friend Marco who got all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, his phrases of effect left Mr. Freeze ashamed. Remember our uber-evil enemy, Visser Three? He's a bald guy with insane slogans. Remember Rachel, "Xena, the warrior princess," and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They were turned into irrational bimbos by the 10 (!) Writers who decided that the original characters were not cool enough for TV. Remember the incredible extra-terrestrial Ax, who was cool, smart and really liked cinnamon buns? In this series he is the Alien Token with an extremely annoying voice. Remember the witty joke our staff had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so monotonous and stupid that it is obvious that the writers were approaching the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> So forget everything you think you knew about the Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to becoming, not Rachel, the thoughtful thought is * supposed * to echo, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, or never, appeared as Andalites (no, it has nothing to do with budget!) . <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. The idiots are all around us. And if you're unlucky, one of them can adapt one of your favorite books, or series, or graphic novels, to a really horrible TV show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... television is worth watching." ~ (the very bald) Visser Three <br /> (r # 91)
