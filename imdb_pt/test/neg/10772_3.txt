Having read the books and seen the 1982 version of Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour, I have to say that this is not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is supposed to be a seemingly foppish aristocrat when he's being Percy, and witty and intelligent when he's being the Pimpernel, but here he just seems bored as <br /> Percy and Means like the Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to be the prettiest woman in Europe, not a weary-eyed matroness (she looks middle-aged, probably due to poor makeup). ). Richard E. Grant has done much better, and the performance of Elizabeth McGovern is uninspired and flat. The Wit and the Andrews / Seymour film are replaced here by the vigorous and flashy edition that just does not cut. <br /> <br /> I might add that for a person who has not seen any previous version <br /> <br /> or read the book, it would probably look ok.
