Probably the biggest thing about Wild Rebels that hurts the most is the hero. He has LOSER written on top of him, but that does not stop him from "getting the girl". Probably one of the greatest race drivers imaginable in the world, he decides to stop running after he crashes into his car. Well, his new job is still raging, with a bunch of bikers picking him to drive his escape car while committing crimes. There's nothing that really pleases Rod, even the situation in which he is played is pretty stupid. In the end, at the lighthouse scene, you'll want Rod to be killed with all the motorcyclists. You see, he is shot twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and still manages to climb up the stairs a bit. If only the Jeeter had a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this, unless you're watching the MST3K version.
