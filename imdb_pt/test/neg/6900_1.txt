When my six-year-old son fell asleep at the movies during the movie, that was all confirmation that I needed the film to be stinky. It was boring. The scary parts were boring. The sentimental parts were boring. Even the funny parts - with two minor exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I mention it predictable? Examples: 1) The rude but loving father indulging his or her child. 2) The rude but loving father buying the farm (while singing a song?!). 3) The brat of a child deciding to cut and run, but thanks to his friends, putting things out because they need him. 4) The brat of a kid winning against incredible odds. 5) And a cheeky character expressed by an African-American actress. I have to credit these filmmakers for this originality and for perpetuating this stereotype. I mentioned two funny bits. In both cases, it contributed secondary characters. The mouse jumping on the farmer's wrist was funny. The farm dog victim of his dog weaknesses while competing for leadership was funny. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a movie from the Hip-Thru Committee and make it even more modern by making it a computer animated film, and that was the result. And why make the villainous Batman-villain coyotes stupid to monologize their victims instead of just eating them? Oh yeah. There is no need for blood in this movie for children, already focusing on false alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty mood. And the fuzzy thing-in-a-box? Exactly what exactly was it? A hedgehog? Demon of Tasmania? What, in addition to a really stupid plot device to help Otis the Cow win the mother of all battles? Barnyard is a bomb. And I did not have to mention the udders.
