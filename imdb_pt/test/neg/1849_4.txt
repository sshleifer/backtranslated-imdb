HELL begins with an impressive TVM effect. We are also introduced to a scientist named Heller. You do not understand? Heller, Hell-er, Hell. So I guess someone in the production had some intelligence. However, it becomes increasingly obvious as TVM progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the plot to attract an American TVM audience. <br /> <br /> The story itself is crushed by subplots with many TVM characters like the tough liberal professor who is trying to save a kid at home from a life of crime, the doctor who has lost his medical license, etc. In fact, history focuses much more on these characters than the oncoming disaster, that all the potential for tension and drama that the scenario could have soon will rise in a cloud of smoke, and being a TVM we just know it does not there will be a downbeat ending <br /> <br /> There is a problem on the screen that I noticed and that is every time there is a blast there is a huge fireball that seems ridiculous not to mention physically impossible. Look at the scene where the national guard is in a fight with a gang. A soldier fires a grenade at a tower block and the entire building explodes in a fireball. What a small greanade containing no more than a few grams of high explosive can do it! No you can not. There is also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosives and the same fireball effect is seen. Can the directors please note that the high explosive is not the same as the napalm? Having said that, I found the HELL highly watchable for a TVM and at no time did I find myself wanting to turn it off . It has some potential and lets me repeat that special effects are reasonably good considering the budget and not as bad as TVM, as some people are noticing.
