The main problem of the 9th Company (9 Route) is that you are not sure if you want to be the Rescue of Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. Spielberg's attempts at sentimentality are embarrassing, like the sergeant burley crying in a field of red flowers !!! The training sequences have no intensity or realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Another point of contention is that Afghan combatants are called Ghosts because they attack and are almost never seen. Here they attack a strong strong Russian almost in formation, with no attempt to use cover. I'm sure tactics moved on from Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie has already been seen in other war movies and has been considerably better. <br /> <br /> I have to ask: Why do all talented shooters need to chew a game? <br /> <br /> Finally, I always suspect a movie that begins without any narration. Rate the ending. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no, you did not.
