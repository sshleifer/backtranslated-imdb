I must say I was not impressed, probably because I expected a lot more from that movie. Perhaps an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So if you expect something to think after watching this movie, do not do it. It is more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end, it clarifies a bit and because I have a great respect for the BBC documentaries. There are some very interesting scenes that really made some sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it in a film related to the theory of evolution, pity that this was not the main subject. Oh, I forgot to say that for over an hour, the movie is very boring and, in a way, cruel.
