'Take Fame' and 'You've Got Served' and roughly jam them together and what do you have? This horrible movie of God made for bland teenagers. The plot follows very closely "You have served". Three ghetto afro-teeners, this time living in John Water's Baltimore, not far from Peckers' house, spend their time with low grades in high school and dancing in old buildings of a hundred years with awkward women. To fund their expensive and messy hip-hop tastes, they steal cars and deliver them to the local store - not unlike John Travolta (John Manaro), who worked in a Brooklyn paint shop to buy his polyester clothing. Tyler Gage, one of the three black musketeers, is caught up in destroying the local Fame School and is forced to perform janitorial tasks. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white high school student who discovers he is Irish-American, to the chagrin of his black friends Mac and Skinny. <br /> <br /> As in 'You've Got Served' crime does not pay and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio is shot by a Bad Bad Leroy Brown 'type, but that's not for the song' and end of stop the heart.
