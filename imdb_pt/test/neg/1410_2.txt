I was kind of anxious for Man of the Year, some girls at my job said it was a really good movie, and my mom said she liked it, so I waited for the rent and watched it last night. I have to honestly say that this movie was a big disappointment. I could barely get through this, because to be honest, the beginning was very good and very well paced, but then it got very dark and not in the movie I saw in the trailer. It sounded like a good comedy, then it turned into a very somber drama, which was not all that interesting, considering how many of those kinds of stories we had about government conspiracy. Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a high-profile show and has an act where many people would like him to get involved with politics just because he seems to have good control over what should be improved. So he does this, he runs for president, but many people doubt he can win due to the fact that he is a comedian, but he wins! But Elenore Green, who guarantees that all votes are counted, tries to fix a flaw in the computer, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of it, and Tom soon realizes this may not be the job he does . I wanted. The acting was good, the direction was good, it was just the story that did not work for me. Like I said, this just turned into a dramatic change of genres because if you watch the trailer, you'd think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, it's what you get, but then it turns into a very dark drama and a little scary. I really would not recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> 2/10
