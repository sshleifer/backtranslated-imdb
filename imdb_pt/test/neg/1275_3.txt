I may not get it right. I mean the movie. It does not make me happy or whatever. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, this is a simple family movie with children for actors. Just admit that - all such movies can not pass the 4 out of 10 barrier, no matter who is playing in the movie (eg Antonio Banderas was playing in this type of movies ... two or three of them can not remember the exact count) . I was bored. I almost fall asleep just because the subject is so clich√©d and the game of actors was so predictable. But I'm sure my son will love this movie when he grows up ... Hey, I'm not a monster that I met some hilarious or good moments in the movie. The movie owls were beautiful. The trick with the police windows painted and the blows that the boy received in the head by a golf ball ...
