Another stink of the PM Entertainment group, and thankfully one of their last. Firetrap is effectively a very low budget remake of 'The Towering Inferno' I do not care about low budget B movies as some effort is put into them - there is no effort whatsoever in 'Firetrap' is Dean'Superman'Cain stars who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously he has all the acting skills of a porn star but he turns out to be the best actor here and that is to say something, the rest is just a bunch of hopes given to the boot of various day soaps. Special FX's are just rubbish, photos showing the burning building on the floor are among the worst I've ever seen, the fire looks like someone scrawled an orange pen in front of the camera. plus there's not a character you really crave - you hate everyone and expect everyone to die well before 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing - The red herring is well signposted. "The scene in which the caretaker fights a blazing fire engulfing the building with his broom ... hilarious, or even a janitor entering a room marked 'Dangerous Material', if these scenes were supposed to be tongue in cheek? somehow I doubt <br /> <br /> The only good point and only a positive point was that there was a good deal of action between the daytime dramas that kept my attention, but so little care was taken given to everything in the movie, I can not recommend - Watch 'The Towering Inferno' instead <br /> <br /> 3/10
