This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can watch a Van Damme movie if I have to, since they usually laugh and do not require much attention. This has no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> It has a distinct lack of plot, humor, acting, direction, etc. etc. A true stinker on all levels. <br /> <br /> I never left a movie theater during a movie, even though I got close to here. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
