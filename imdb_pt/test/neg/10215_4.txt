Remember, it's not supposed to be, but it is. Thankfully I watched this movie in the movies (being a great wrestling fighter and a Hulk Hogan fan). All I remember of the night is that we were the only ones in the theater, and I really did not like it very much. I erased the rest, and for good reason. <br /> <br /> A bad movie resembling the big names like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman", "No Holds Barred" is a high stakes set. world of professional wrestling. Well, maybe the stakes are not that high ... and frankly, I feel dirty just calling these people "professional" on anything. And really, except for the first scene, there's no fight to talk about. So I think the movie is about the marginally down world of amateur beating-and-out-of-people. Sounds good, right? Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the WWF champion (Never say Hulk Hogan was typecast, this and movies like Thunder in Paradise showed how he challenged himself with deep roles. That really pushed the limits of his talents. ). Essentially, he is playing alone, but with a more black and blue wardrobe than the red and yellow Hulkster. He also has this hand gesture that he does. It's like the devilish sign of Ozzy that people do at rock shows, except you stick your thumb in the air, and you roll your index finger. My friend said it should look like a "R." Try it and see for yourself. If this looks like an "R", well, then Mars needs women. But anyway. <br /> <br /> Kurt Fuller, with his obviously fritz superintendent, plays a TV executive with his slightly homoerotic heart to get Rip, who is bigger than Elvis, in his network. He does not have any of that (and leaves the office with a triumphant hand gesture for no one but the camera), and so the film follows Fuller trying to increase the audience and return to Rip. He does this when he creates his brilliantly titled "Battle of the Hard Faces". Marketing genius, this guy. From the numerous hand gestures, to the rather idiotic fight scenes (all played as if wrestling were very real and deadly serious) to overacting, to the very frequent Hulk takes on nothing but briefs, this movie has everything you've ever wanted in a silly movie. It is frivolous, not too draining, violent and includes the phrase "What is this smell?" "DOOKIE!" "Dookie?" <br /> <br /> A classic of all time.
