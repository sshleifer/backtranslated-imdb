Sebastian Cabot is a rich idiot who wants to buy all the land because there is oil - although none of the inhabitants are aware of oil. With the help of an evil gunslinger in black, they kill and terrify everyone. When the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to retreat and confront these forces of darkness. <br /> <br /> Wow. While I watched TERROR IN A TOWN TOWN, I felt like I had seen this movie many times before and would probably see something like that again. That's because, in addition to some news (such as Sterling Hayden using a harpoon on the villain), he has a plot that is very familiar. Once again, we have a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to get control of the whole land. And for that, he brought in cops to force people to sell or kill them. I've been there, done that in many movies. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in the movies, but I can not recommend this as anything other than a bad time.
