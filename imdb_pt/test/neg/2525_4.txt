I used to work at the company that originally released this movie, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem that many small independent film companies had, they did not have much money to put into the production values ​​of their films. Not only that money will buy you a good movie. Look at Kevin Costner's Waterworld, for example. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have a talented person doing the acquisitions or the development, you can create your own new talent. But at Vestron, there was no such person and they always saved in some crucial area. In this case, it was the director and the writer. Which makes it very difficult to have a decent movie, even with the great cast that this movie has. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this movie was "Let's put a lot of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens." It's an intriguing idea but it's not worth your time watching . <br /> <br /> Most of the Vestron movies have ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them. My wife and I have developed the ability to identify this quality even in non-Vestron films. We have often been able to detect this quality just by watching the trailer or the TV ad. We sat there watching the trailer or advertisement, and then we turned to each of them, and almost in sync, we said, "Now it's a Vestron movie!" This is a Vestron movie.
