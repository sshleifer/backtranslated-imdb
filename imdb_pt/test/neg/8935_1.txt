At the Beaverview cheerleader camp, the two Lucky Ducks shows must be in collusion with the "tough" cheerleading team of the Demons to defeat the cowardly Falcon team, who always seems to win at this camp, I think. Being this a classic clich√© of the 80's (lame) sexual comedy that you think will win? But what the film does not have in originality is more than offsetting the horror. Oh, and absurdly bad numbers of dancers and mandatory Japanese entrepreneurs who want to buy the camp (provided that the male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays at the camp, of course). Simply terrible, forgettable and, unfortunately, has a surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My Note: F (yes, I really gave it to them)
