Well, at first I did not see "Silence of the Lambs" yet .... but, I think I would have gotten sick if I had seen this before. Not from violent violence, but from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal and I really believed he was as psychotic as he was, but by the reaction of the audience around me, the movie was full of "Silence" clich√©s that left me lost in stitches. <br /> <br /> Now, I heard that the movie would be very creepy and if the director wanted to fight with people ... he did it ... but only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be horrible and I mean, so horrible that you're going to take the movie out of it ... you need more than two sequences ... I always see this as a movie has to become that movie jewel which will ultimately lead you to another place and time, or that goes beyond the top (which most of the time is done with bad taste). But this movie left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep sometimes. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I did not feel that way ... Who cared about the stupid Italian cop? I definitely did not. So, really the movie gets a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is good if you want to see Reader and Starling yet again, but if you are going for a really good thriller .. You will jump once and be collected maybe twice . It depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Thinking about how much money this movie will bring ... there will probably be another "Hannibal" made and this movie will probably not be on video until fall. If you need to see it ... wait and save the $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get video. Do not spend too much money on this movie.
