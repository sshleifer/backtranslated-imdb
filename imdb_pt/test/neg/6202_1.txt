If you're planning to watch 'Partner' and you're in the IMDb reading reviews about him, you've wasted a lot of time on this stupid, stupid and horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy. of the movie 'Hitch'. I chose to ignore all the other bad warnings and criticisms I've heard about this movie, and I missed a precious 20 minutes - I thought after all your David Dhawan who is doing it, and got Govinda - how bad can it be? But after 20 minutes watching this absurd, I could not take it any longer and turned off my computer. Exaggerating for everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total waste of time - I gave it a 1 star Rating because it's the smallest you can do. If I could go lower, I would have given a rating of -100.
