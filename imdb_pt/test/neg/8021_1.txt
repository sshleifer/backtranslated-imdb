I can safely say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I usually love foreign films. The film is nothing more than violent pornography badly made. If you choose to watch it, get ready for endless sexism, free nude scenes and a stupid sensational rape scene, which I'm sure is the main appeal to people who enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot snakes aimlessly and neither character is pleasant. Many scenes are filmed in the woods that surround the river where the girls are, to give a constant sense that someone is chasing them, which was a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of stories to tell. <br /> <br /> Maybe I would not have wasted my time to see the movie if it had been accurately described in the comments.
