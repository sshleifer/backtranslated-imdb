I really hope the creators of these "movies" read these reviews so they know people just do not want their movies. They are just rubbish and an embarrassment to the horror killer clown genre. whether or not this was better than the first, it does not matter, because both are simply terrible. I'm surprised they did not learn the lesson from the first movie. Stop now!! Notice to the horror movie watchers, do not watch, rent or look at the boxes of horror movies "URBAN", and most of all, do not buy them !!!!
