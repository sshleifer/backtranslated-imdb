A pretentious but - in varying degrees - assistive collection of mostly "meaningless" stories. <br /> <br /> But let's start from the top. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If anyone ever wondered what finnish love / romance was like, maybe this little strange thing is an indication. Subjugated feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I think the sequel to this story will be "For our honeymoon we moved from Siberia to Greenland". Aki obviously had no idea what to write for this short film, so he invented a "hundred" non-story centered around a band he particularly likes (or maybe they are his friends) because we can see them and listen to their music more than the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: First, I've never heard of this guy before? And now I know why. Good photography in black and white and virtually nothing else - unless you get bored, silly, can be considered an asset. But you'd be surprised that many film critics and film students love boredom in the movies, so I warmly recommend Erice's 10-minute nap to these two humanoid groups. Herzog: It's not a movie, but probably a slice of your documentaries about tribes in South America. This is not a short film, but a report, but considering how boring the first two were tickets, Herzog's part is almost refreshing and has some interesting moments, and nothing else fits into the film's preposterous concept of "time". Jarmusch: As was almost expected, this filmmaker, who was once interesting (with the brain of a peanut, a talented idiot), serves us another nap of uselessness. He has become lazy and can not bother writing something interesting, whether for his own films or for a collection like TMO. The only bright side to seeing how a vegetarian dumb actress spends 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is portrayed by the lovely Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise, skip this nonsense. Oh, and btw: I do not believe any young actress listens to classical music; Was Jarmusch trying to be surreal by making Chloe listen to that kind of music? Lindsey Lohan might hear opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I to say that they are not?! <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is an idiot. Oh, right ... I already mentioned that ... Wenders: Here's the real shock of the whole movie: Wenders can really do something good !!!!! Everything else I've seen from this overrated charlatan so far has been monotonous and meaningless. However, this little story is made with (atypical) style and is the best part of the movie. It leaves the person wanting to see more of this, although the story has a resolution. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord ?? What can I say here? Lee makes someone look talented in comparison. Like Herzog, he does not choose a story but sends a report? and a left-wing political propaganda report! CNN, but in black and white and unilateral, of course. Of course, "We Wuz Robbed," the retarded title of this little sleep inducer, is about how the poor, gullible, and infinitely idealistic Democrats WUZ ROBBED by Bush and his team of Evil Thieves EVIL. This is by far the most stupid and dull entry in this movie, and I had to use the fast forward button to not doze off. Spike Lee is really a product of Affirmative Action. God knows how many really talented directors (blacks) have never had the chance to make movies, because this pretentious and untalented little man still has the opportunity to do so. And he misses every time! Now that requires some kind of talent, right? <br /> <br /> Kaige: Chinese history has a solid premise. All right, that's all. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are many and much better movies to spend your time, but if your time is not so valuable (as is apparently the case with my own) you can check out this little movie. <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes of certainty can be an eternity in the hands of the anti-cinema masters. - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
