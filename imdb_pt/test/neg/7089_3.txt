Just listen to the Broadway album and the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum, who do wonders for Lerner and Lane's wonderful track. Then, with the beautiful recording of the cast in mind, watch the movie, with Streisand as Streisand, and Yves Montand reading their lines with a French accent so heavy that a chainsaw could not cut it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does for the introductory part of the title song. Listen as he sings / says: Could anyone among us have a hunch or a clue, what spells of witchcraft and voodoo can you do? (This part summarizes the problem of casting "name stars" in movie musicals instead of the talent appropriate for the various roles.) I can see Rex Harrison entering this scene and suggesting that Montand could also learn to do justice. for the beauty of the English language. <br /> <br />
