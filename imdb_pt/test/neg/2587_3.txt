Debra Winger's "Black Widow" in 1987 is MUCH better. <br /> <br /> It's like a lame version, and Jane Seymour usually does it better. <br /> <br /> Chad Allen is also very poor at it. Just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child. <br /> <br /> Maybe the two being Dr. Quinn's should make us get excited. <br /> <br /> If you are, go get a copy of "Black Widow".
