However, it should be said that perhaps more in the United States than in the United Kingdom can still be a sensitive subject. Just look at all the collapse of homosexuals in the militia a few years ago. the USA. It is with 'In and Out' that writer Paul Rudnick addresses the small-town mentality of Central America and how the press in the United States (as well as in the UK) makes a big deal by opening a celebrity. You just need to look when Will Young and Stephen Gately of Boyzone came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> The film is about Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), a high school English teacher in his hometown. People are getting ready for Oscar night as one of the nominees Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) came from his hometown and was a former student of Howards. Cameron, who plays a gay soldier in an epic in Vietnam, wins the only award out as being gay during his acceptance speech. This could not happen at a worse time for Howard who is only a day away from marrying his fiance and colleague Professor Emily. (Joan Cusack). As you'd expect, the media reaction is cataclysmic and turn Howards's life upside down. He does not try to convince his family and friends that he is not gay, but avoids sloppy reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck). <br /> <br /> Although this has been heralded as a crazy comedy, it is clear that Rudnick and director Frank Oz are also trying to be satirists. You just have to look at the earliest scenes of the Oscars ceremonial and how people Bracketts's hometown as well as the school's teaching council react to its exit. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not live up to the promise we see at the beginning of the film. This is a very simple attempt. make social commentary from a crazy comedy. A good cast is sadly wasted on a script that never gives a laugh and is not nearly as insightful as it sounds. <br /> <br /> Kline gives us the same kind of captivating performance he gave us in his previous comedy. Dave ', making Howard an instantly enjoyable character. Cusack is also good value as a groom obsessed with Howard's weight while Tom Selleck plays nicely against the guy as a gay reporter. Bob Newhart is a joy too, as the director of the school where Howard works. It's great to see him in the It 's a shame that was that. <br /> <br /> Performances as good as they can do little can make the movie not a boring affair. While some scenes are not at all fun. Of course the scene inspired by Howard tries to look more virile upon hearing a self-help tape. There is little to enjoy, and when things do not seem to get any worse, Rudnick resorts to a sickly end that balances at the superior feeling. I also could not help but feel that my intelligence was being insulted.Malloy seems to be a very despicable character to become the man who puts his ethics before getting a good story while Cammeron finally comes to the rescue at the climax of the movie looks like first be very self-involved with a character to care about what happens to your former teacher. After all it is that caused all the problems in the first place. <br /> <br /> 'In and Out' is not exactly But when you consider that the likes of Kline work best as 'A fish called Wanda', you can not help but feel that here is a great talent being sadly wasted . <br /> <br /> Robs Rating: * *
