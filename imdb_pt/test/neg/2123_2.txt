A perennial accessory in IMDb Bottom 100, on seeing this, it's not hard to see exactly why it proves to fail miserably in almost every bloody department! <br /> <br /> Take the edit to get started; Calling this busy would be overly complimentary! In fact, if the manufacturers had gotten drunk one night and sliced ​​and chopped the film rolls with scissors and glue for children, then the resulting mess could hardly have been worse than the one we have here. Added to that, futile history drags ruthlessly to what appears to be a tortuous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly dull climax. <br /> <br /> In addition to the ever-game Michael Sopkiw, bad performances from most of the rest of the cast also do not help at all and the beastie that is causing all the hassles is a bit less convincing put it mildly. Yay, in short, that's a complete pile of shit, if ever I've seen one. <br /> <br /> Deary, darling, I .... and think that Lambert Bava directed this to .... tut, tut indeed. <br /> <br /> Note: This was released in the UK under the alternate title of Devouring Waves, despite being devoid of most of its bloody scenes, which ironically are just the only reason why it might be worth watching .
