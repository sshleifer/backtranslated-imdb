First, I admit I did not see Vampires: Los Muertos, but I saw the original Vampires movie and I love it. I rented this movie having heard nothing about it. I did not expect to be impressed. I was not. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​moving action to the Far East, which should have opened many new paths to the action sequences as well as the story line, but not enough. was made of it. The fight scenes and motorbike chases were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts that I liked, as the way the slot machine was not shown as good heroes, as in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting since I saw the old Hammer movie, Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires, a few years ago, someone would someday make another good vampire movie based in Asia. That was not it.
