I saw this movie while I was in France and I must say it confused me. It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who end up in Morocco at the same time, come across and form a connection. Simple enough? Well, the problem is that this is the kind of film that has ambiguity in both chronologies (the film is not played entirely in order) and in reality (what did I just see actually happened, or was it just a dream?). Given these parameters, just like the movie being bilingual, it was very difficult to keep up with, and I was not sure what happened at the end. I imagine that some types of deep arts could better understand this film than I could, and may require more than one visualization to understand.
