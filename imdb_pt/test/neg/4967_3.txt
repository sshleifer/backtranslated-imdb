All the boys seem to be sexually aroused by Mandy Lane. All the girls seem to be jealous of Mandy Lane. But, nothing seems to become this, and this viewer wonders why? Mandy is beautiful and a magnet for every kid she meets, but we've never met Mandy or any of the characters in the movie. Mandy accepts an invitation from her student friends to go to an isolated ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and drug. In the movie, teens drink alcohol like water and take drugs to try out a psychedelic trip. And there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, teenagers disappear one by one. But the others are all drunk and tall. No one, including those who watch the movie, cares or is worried. No one, including the public, seems to give a damn. Emmet, a fellow student, is the instigator of the whole event. There is a security guard, Garth (who is played gracefully and generously by Anson Mount), who protects and protects the ranch. In the middle of the movie, the killer is revealed, the tension is suddenly released as the air blew out a balloon. The events are completely predictable and the movie simply disappears completely. Mandy finds her departure, but we never know why - and at the end of the movie, there is still no sex. Does Mandy hypnotize the boys, or did she simply take all the boys and girls to death? This absolutely confused spectator can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of the female and male competition - killing the manipulative girls and the nasty boys. <br /> <br /> Mandy deserves all the attention? The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but this viewer does not. The skilled cinematographer (Darren Genet) provides some stunning images, but in fact, his focus seems to be on Garth, who is a stallion. Do not all boys love Mandy, or do they love? If you want to get bored enough to find out how this movie ends, my advice is to sleep in the middle of the movie, until you see the crotch of Mandy and Garth. But do not expect anything to happen. Yes, you guessed it. Mandy remains a virgin and there is still no sex. I rate this movie 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Because? Because all the girls love Garth, and all the voyeuristic eyes seem to be in Garth in a compromising position. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this movie never seems to go beyond a disappointing and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to an isolated ranch and nothing sexual happens. The public is taken to horror on a ranch - and can not help but wonder why?
