I'll give you two because there's a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first photo of "Road" I've seen. I was hoping waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of Road movies. If this is true, I do not have to worry about seeing others. The best thing about this movie is that it has many songs in the first half but this is offset by only a number of production with dance throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie. Neither Hope nor Crosby came across very well, their characters were not very charming, the film was not funny at all, most of the dialogue was just a lame filler, there was not much action, there was not much show. <br /> The film was not what I expected. I was expecting more "road", but not much. They quickly arrive at the palace and then most of the film takes place there, until the end. I was also expecting a lot more from the famous "road" style of breaking the fourth wall, where the characters speak directly to the audience or comment the plot. There were only four instances of this. One of them is an example of the humor not funny of this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope recapitulates the plot so far for Crosby) Crosby: I know all of this! I hope so, but the people who came in the middle of the picture did not. Crosby: You mean they lost my music? <br /> <br /> These are two pure lines, but at least they are jokes. Much of the rest of the script does not even have jokes. An example is: <br/> <br/> Crosby: Remind me to give you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirectly calling Hope a mouse). <br /> <br /> This is not funny, it barely qualifies as a joke, but this is the kind of non-play dialogue that carries most of the film. Many of the scenes do not even come so close to a joke, just using a generic and uninteresting dialogue like: Crosby: Hey, why do you accept me? Do you think you can throw me at the dogs? I hope: Well, why not, you did it for me did not you? Crosby: Yeah, but that's because I was looking for us. You are not looking for anyone. I hope so. Well, then why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (The above is only from my memory.) It's not exact, but it illustrates to you what I mean. <br /> <br /> And so on .... just generic dialogue no jokes. <br /> <br /> My note: A waste of time.
