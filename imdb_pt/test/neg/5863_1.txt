This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen - it has no good feature. <br /> <br /> It looked like it was done in about 20 minutes with another time full of title graphics. <br /> <br /> The main male transformed from the death gate to the superman - hey you <br /> <br /> Beyond the totally predictable and nothing interesting. <br /> <br /> I left the cinema feeling cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say I could not reccoemnd this movie to anyone
