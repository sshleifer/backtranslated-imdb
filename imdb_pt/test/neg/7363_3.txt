As a major of Canadian History, my first thing to say: HISTORICAL FACTS ARE NOT ACCURATE! How can a producer do this? The Acadian's deportation was not in 1759 when we see Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can he get through this in the movie? The scenes on the Londo were also useless. So for the story of anyone who reads "Les Anciens Canadians", you have the story line right there. It's the story of La Coriveau, that "witch." Add a love story and a tragic relationship between the end of mother and daughter. Of course, it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then there is the fact that apparently it was raised in Quebec City, but mostly it is filmed in the Forteresse of Louisbourg. Of course it is a historical place and is needed for the time, but it was obvious that the scenes were not all in Quebec City. Overall, if you're looking for a New France documentary, go get Candad: A People's History, a documentary about the history of Canda and France. If you want a love story that will bring you tears, a story set in a wonderful forest, watch New France.
