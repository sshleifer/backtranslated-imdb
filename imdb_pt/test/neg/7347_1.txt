When I first watched this show on Cartoon Network, I found it uninteresting. So I read many good messages about this show and decided to watch it. The show was so annoying. Each episode was predictable. Plus, this show has no logic. Hypersmart girls, who are going to school and sometimes do these stupid things, 99% of episodes start with a monster attacking Townswille, then Mayor (he's a fool, he's not funny, he's so stupid, I can not imagine how he became mayor). Professor, yes, he should be the smartest person on this show, but actually ... He did not even find a difference between the monster and his brother. The narrator's comments also make this show boring. Because they also have similar lines at the beginning of each episode and at the end. Also the animation is very strange. Everything except the main heroes is shown in an ugly way. Also each epsode this show is giving you some life lessons, and that means that it is geared towards small children, but if you look closer, you will see that there is a lot of violence and even blood (!!!) during your battles .
