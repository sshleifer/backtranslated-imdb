This has to be the worst show I've ever seen. I've always liked Chuck Norris in Films, but why do we need to do these shows politically correct by adding a black kick that's as ominous as Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also found that the show was limited because how often you can kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. I know an African-American who looks like this Trivette guy and he gets kicked his butt once a week, he's all attitude. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is the guy and he deserves all the praise he gets, I think this show started well, but he lost his breath over time <br /> <br /> They should have left the Chucks side kick
