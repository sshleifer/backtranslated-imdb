This movie would have been good, probably excellent, if the directors had left the interviews and filming separate. "Into the Void" is great music, and I hate how it's cut in the best part to go on a murmuring interview with Ozzy Osbourne. This should have been at the end of the movie, or located in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is putting them on and letting the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put on and just let it play because the music is continually interrupted. However, there are some strengths to this film; the filming of the concert when it plays is excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures well: Sabbath basically rocks the fans. Fans, of course, have a sweet edge in the movie because they're watching the band live, of course, but they also do not have to put up with the incessant interviews with which DVD viewers are overloaded. What a shame for Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this in the movie! Also, embarrass Wyatt Smith for editing the movie that way.
