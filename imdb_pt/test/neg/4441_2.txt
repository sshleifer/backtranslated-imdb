The previous review is practically on target, which Altman was not with this movie. I have not seen him since its original release, but I rarely spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as I was with this movie. If some pretentious community theater tried a science fiction version of an Ingmar Bergman movie, it could come out that way. I can not give myself to give anything Altman made a "1", but this is probably the nadir of a career that has had some notable ups and downs. I would have left, but as a paid movie critic, I could not. (Think about it the next time you envy movie critics.)
