Wow ... Reading these comments, I see a remarkable socio-cultural conflict emerging between the US and ... the Dutch! The US P.oV. It seems like this is a good little movie, Parker being a nice hero, the story a lively version of what could be a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> All three Dutch critics see the world through a totally different pair of glasses, it seems. They categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree that the film is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Far be it from me to take sides in what seems to be a dispute between cultures, in this item as distant as the ocean that separates them geographically. Still, based on factual observation - I saw the movie with my own eyes - I suspect the Dutch are not far from the truth: "Parker Kane" is badly done, completely boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was undoubtedly wasted on its creation.
