This film was filmed in my hometown and I knew many of the "actors" on small lists. Most of them were students at the local Karate school, and even at the time they were filmed we all knew how bad it was. It was interesting, however, to see this being done. Most of the places where it was filmed do not exist anymore, like the nightclub, the pizzeria, etc. The "world premiere" was held at the Akron Civic Theater and we all laughed hysterically at how it was. I personally believe it is the worst movie ever made, but it brings back many good memories for me. Watch this movie with a word of advice ... enjoy what it is ... a very low budget, poorly made, karate film.
