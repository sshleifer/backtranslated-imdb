The update of the game Clare Booth Luce and the 1939 film is a big disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most individual scenes work, but nothing stays. There is no connection from scene to scene, almost as if the film were worked in parts and then mounted in a vacuum. Granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and harmed by her friends is less shocking now at an age when divorce is so common but at the same time is as timely as ever, I just wish they might have managed to connect all the pieces together because, as it stands now, you really do not feel drawn to the plot. Wait for the cable.
