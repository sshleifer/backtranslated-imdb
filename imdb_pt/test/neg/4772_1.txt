The ruins are for Tourists as Deep Impact went to Armageddon, a worse version of a slightly entertaining movie except a lot worse. One of the characters should go to medical school, so why are they all retarded? "You can not keep cutting." -Best line form this movie. This is a horrible movie. I like horror movies, but I fully appreciate that most of them are terrible, but I had a little high hopes for this movie after seeing the comments on IMDb. The situation in which they are is stupid and how they deal with it makes them stupid. It's awful, the only thing that makes it a little palatable is the cool Australian backdrop, despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the movie in one place.
