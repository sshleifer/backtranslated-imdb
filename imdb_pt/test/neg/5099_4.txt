As the above suggests, I ended up not impressing myself with this movie. It's beautiful to see, the scenery is lush, but the details of the story, in particular the characters, are totally unbelievable. Movies do not have to be believable, but movies like that, with a political edge and social commentary do. <br /> <br /> Similarly, I have no problem with commercialism as such, but again, films like this should not be making selection decisions purely based on box office sweepstakes. This is absolutely the case for Sutherland, who is downright dirty like Doyle. His accent was far from authentic, but he fell into the biggest trap of all, his accent is his performance, and we ended up with a caricature of Irish with no personality outside his nationality. I find it totally implausible that someone involved thought he was the best man for the job. All in all, this is a clear case of commercial interest in quality and when you are trying to be the mission, this kind of thing destroys your chances of success. Speaking of accents, there were a few more problems, one of them being the impressive modernity of Boy's accent, which acted to dispel the sense of being transported to another era. Most surprising was Samantha Morton's much acclaimed Irish accent, which was variable to say the least. His voice snaked between the strong north and the soft south, even in the excesses of voice, where I hoped any discrepancies of this kind would be grasped. <br /> <br /> However, these are minor complaints compared to Sarah's motivation and actions. She never seems at home with the English, and almost instantaneously at home with her son and her tribe, the dilemma between the life she knew and the life she offered only seems like a no-brainer. Maybe a lot was lost in the issue, maybe this was a three-hour movie or a mini-series where those things could have been developed, but I can only judge what I saw. <br /> <br /> Now, the biggest problem, Sarah's (Morton) relationship with Doyle (Sutherland) is incomprehensible. The fact is that her affection for him is not transmitted in any way until she has to choose between him and her son, the conflict she is going through at the moment was downright ridiculous and killed the movie for me. <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed. this movie did not work for me, but it's great to see, you really will not see anything more impressive in terms of scenery, there are some good performances and my wife liked it.
