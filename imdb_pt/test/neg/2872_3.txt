This movie was really bad. has that quality that many independent films have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. Any stubborn BAM magera fan will like this movie, but again, this is probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to watch knowing I'm a Jackass fan and I was a fan of viva la bam, before the nature of the show's script became weak. To explain why this movie does not work, I should just say that the premise itself is staged <br /> <br /> a guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. And pretty much the whole movie you have this Ryan Dunn whining guy and Bam magera jumping around like a good mischief maker. The performance of Dicamillo is strange at best. It's a small, humorous Canadian French accent that's pretty much the extent of your performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then it's like "okay, you're pretending to be a foreigner enough") <br /> <br /> Maybe it would work if they were going to parody, but all they can do is make a movie with an IQ of zero. I love both the bathroom humor and the next, but that's not even lowbrow, it's just plain stupid. The humor that can be obtained from this film is completely inside and the public, even those skilled with Magera and company, are left out of the joke. <br /> <br /> Next time Magera has a bag full of money, let's hope he does not blow it on some bad pet project
