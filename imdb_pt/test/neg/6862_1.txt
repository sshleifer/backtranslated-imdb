I remember seeing this movie when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends had. At the time, it was just a movie, I was about 10 years old and only thought of it as another action movie. <br /> <br /> When I look back now as a complete cinephile, this is an incredibly bad movie. Whoever produced this film, I'm sure they had a short career in Hollywood. Although the lead actor has made some movies according to IMDb, although I have not seen any and I do not remember much of him. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just to say that this movie is really bad, in every way, could be. I would love to see it again though: oD
