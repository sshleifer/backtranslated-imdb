This movie really misses the mark on most fronts. The accents are ridiculously weak, the acting amateur and the comedy weak, at best. <br /> <br /> They have a great idea, it could have been particularly nice, but for the reasons mentioned above. The writer seems to think by putting the word f * ck in every sentence that will make it funnier and the main character seems to just try a little too much. He is not the best of them all, for sure. <br /> <br /> Next time, at least, make a cast that can keep the film's accent. <br /> <br /> It is a crime to compare this with films like The Business, Stock Lockout and Snatch.
