The great Yul Brynner, who won an Oscar and starred in blockbusters as The Ten Commandments among many others, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot films like this, Sartana, and such. Regrettably, in fact. One should be sorry to see him doing his best to leave this stupid thing to one side. Gone are the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Eli Wallach in "The Magnificent Seven," and strolled under the famous soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein. It's hard to live being an actor sometimes.
