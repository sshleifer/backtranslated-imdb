This film is very predictable that Nuff said .... from the scene of the delayed kiss to the inevitable return of Grandpa ... this is a great movie for the age group of 10 to 12 years, but in addition it has no market ... I give him 4/10 only because he achieved exactly what he set out to do and nothing more.
