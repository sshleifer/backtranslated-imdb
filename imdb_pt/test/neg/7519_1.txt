If you loved the version of "The Time Machine" of the early 60's, do not waste your time; as in "Planet of the Apes" last year, this was "reimagined", not for the better. And just as with "Planet ...", its main actor is miserably miscado and lead; Guy Pearce, a great far-reaching actor, is all wrong with this role, giving a performance of a note that causes zero sympathy; he is so austere and serious, and devoid of admiration for the (supposedly) surprising things that he sees that you do not believe for a moment that he is experiencing them. Worse still, whose idea was it to him to resemble the loving son of David Spade and Calista Flockhart? A handsome actor, here he is sickly thin, which is, believe it or not, a great distraction. Frankly, the man looks seriously ill and is photographed cruelly. He shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else. Unfortunately, even with an appropriate protagonist, this movie has no chance of being fatally burdened with a totally inept director - whole scenes are nowhere to be seen and are poorly performed - and a script that is completely inferior, scattered and sometimes incoherent. - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this movie, for the simple fact that there is NOTHING in the way of character development! In the original, you met the Eloi, therefore, felt for them and felt the terror of the Morelocks; here, as the film emphasizes several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. Unless you're a member of PETA, scared sheep are a lot of entertainment stuff! <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba does her best in her film debut but, like everyone else in this mess, most especially Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of the Morelocks Mommy Returns "], why does he look like Edgar Winter's long-lost brother?) IS COMPLETELY WASTED. Money was also wasted on the endless "special" effects, which belied the $ 70 million spent on the film; they are uniformly dull, obvious, and unconvincing. And then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed, his art direction and sets are "there" and his costumes are typical in design. There is no original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. Above all, it's not even fun! (Filmmakers use the now ubiquitous Orlando Jones as "comic relief," but as usual, Jones is annoying, and how does his electric character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?) It is an empty, lifeless, monotonous, sterile and confusing case: you have not REMEMBER "Planet of the Apes" ??? (At least, it had the fortune of some strong performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The final insult (plus a terrible shaking of the head, not to mention convenient, ending)? Not only do they feature the dress store figures, but they also make the time machine itself an anachronistic and garish glass-n-chrome look! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, that's exactly what it would be.) Pathetic ...
