Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson making movies for a long time must pass through this "CBS event." There are about 45 minutes of history filled by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring insipid TV drama cliches. Bad science is a staple for low quality disaster movies, so I will not complain about it. Silly science can be fun to watch if it runs in a fun way. What kills this movie are the 10 subplots ... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot. The only character who is fun to watch in Category 6 is Tornado Tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype. <br /> <br /> Note that I did not bother to comment on special effects either. Its quality should not be a surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
