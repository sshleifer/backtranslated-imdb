Very strange, this seems like a very common movie for me, if not a little less. It is brilliantly filmed, but, along with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, is the only redeeming aspect I found in the film, which consists of two separate parts. <br /> <br /> The first part covers the basic marine training that, watching in 2007, comes out as something that I see a zillion times before in dozens of other films and series and is not particularly exciting. After 30 minutes, I got the idea and wished they could move on. The sergeant is the only credible character, while everyone seems to be just cardboard clipping. The overall performance is disconcertingly depressed and the script is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the screaming sergeant. The boys go through training and end up in Vietnam. Oh, and the fat outsider shoots the sergeant (what a surprise ...), probably in the mistaken belief that he was actually the screenwriter. <br /> <br /> So an hour passed and nothing noteworthy happened. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> So we have the part of Vietnam. <br /> <br /> It starts with a scene where the reporters from Stars and Stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass. The Hour. At first I thought they were reenacting some movie scenes from old movies, it looked pretty bad. But no, they were actually mumbling their script lines. Then the camp is besieged. About 20 vietcongues enter the countryside through the main gate. Too bad for them they are being knocked down like flies because they simply walk into various manned guns without means of cover. Is this normal behavior? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, how come the United States did not win this war during the first two months of involvement? The rest of the film continues with even more illogical war scenes. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole plot is totally useless. Neither character inspires much sympathy and the story is downright monotonous. He shows little more than a few war reporters joining a platoon with some guys being shot for being disobedient idiots and they also seem to think that somehow a hole in the wall will protect him from bullets. <br /> What was the message of this movie .. that people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in situations of war? That if you want to get rid of really dumb people, you send them to a war zone? Or that somehow in concrete Vietnam can really burn? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if this movie deserves a 8.3, then Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
