I read the recent reviews and could not wait to see the movie. however, after going through 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that did not even make me jump and unrealistic villain, I was extremely disappointed. I thought the cartoons were the only movies that were still only 80 minutes long. I thought this might be because of the issues to make it 'R' rated, but the original contained only ten more minutes of blood type 'Kill Bill'. When blood sneezes like hoses, reality loses its appeal. Add the killer who is supposed to be a "ghost," but who can rip someone out of the jaw (King Kong Wing with T-Rex), live through it all and have a similar end to the sopranos finale and you possibly have the most exaggerated from last year. After watching the movie I felt like I had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and also felt very dissatisfied. I do not know what everyone saw in it, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, see Halloween, it's definitely worth $ 10. When it comes to Hatchet, let's hope the next one is based on book.
