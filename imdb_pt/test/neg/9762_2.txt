I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but I was warned because I heard the movie was bad. This is. Fowles wrote the script and I was able to follow it well despite the fact that I read the novel more than thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is execrable - dissonant, raucous and completely inappropriate - breaking any attempt. in mystery or humor in the film. I suspect the director should take a lot of blame, because even Michael Caine sucks at it and he was already doing a great job at ALFIE a few years before. <br /> <br /> The "Mysteries" evoked by the book is not well translated on the screen. I'd love to see someone redo this.
