Following the opening of "Where's Poppa?", George Segal gets up from bed one morning, shaves, bathes, puts on a gorilla suit and goes to his mother's bedroom, we realize later, to give him an attack cardiac disease that will kill her and get her out of his life forever. It is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture: insanity, mixed with what can be considered morbid daring. Segal plays a New York lawyer who lives with his supposedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is even more complicated when, by hiring a nurse to look after the old purse, she meets the girl of her dreams, the delightfully primitive Trish Van Devere , dressed as Florence Nightingale. Her dilemma: how to integrate the lovely nurse into the life of her mother and her traquina. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is the only thing that holds the image together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic timing is almost unmatched (what happened to this guy?); where the film fails is in other areas. Ruth Gordon's characterization is terrible as the mother. At first, you can not find out if your character is senile or only deliberately vague to prevent the child from moving. In the end, it's clear she's crazy. When Segal takes Van Devere home to find her, Gordon's brow furrows and she has a sinister, sinister look. She wants the intruder in her son's life to be removed; she is calculating. This is not the way of a senile person. You're not getting consistent performance over the picture, which is probably the fault of the director (Carl Reiner) as much as Gordon's. Ruth Gordon's old lady in "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because with the kind of insinuating person Ruth Gordon usually plays, the audience responds to her as annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too shy to react, Gordon becomes more boring, his fangs get deeper and we are afraid of Farrow; this kind of imposition is genuinely terrifying. Here, we are being asked to laugh at what we normally find annoying, and if Gordon played him so defenseless all the way, we could. But she is selfish and evil, too, and lessens the little humor that exists. <br /> <br /> There are some good laughs though. A court scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counterculture punk is rather hilarious, and Vincent Gardenia does a good turnaround as a Lombard football coach. There is also a bit of inspiration in that Segal's brother (Ron Liebman) having been stripped by robbers on his way to Segal's house, asks him something to use at home, and he gives him the gorilla suit. <br /> <br /> But much of the script is poorly designed and simply does not make sense. Why is a New York lawyer with his own practice living at home? Why Segal, if his mother is senile, tries to reason with her logically: "If you ruin this for me, I'll punch your heart." Why does Liebman continue to cut the park if he knows he will be robbed? Why does he take a cab after leaving Segal's in a gorilla outfit? Why was not he taking taxis all the time? A little funnier would have been Liebman, like the gorilla, terrorizing the assailants. Why Van Devere keeps coming back - after her first husband was a madman, why does she want to get involved with this gang? I suppose if I put that to Carl Reiner, he would say, "These people are crazy, they do not need to make sense." What a convenient way to excuse a bad script that is full of holes. The moment-by-moment behavior of the characters may not make sense, but their motivations do happen, and that's where "Where's the Poppa?" collapses; situations are created just to have the gag, and the jokes are mostly simple, they create nothing. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty in all this fiasco. How he acquired this vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy intrigues me; Basically, his career has been holding a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks as they speak in funny voices. His son Rob has ten times more ability and intelligence than a director. Under show-biz, Reiner pushes the buttons; a monkey could do his job. And this is more apparent in its framework of action. Why is all of New York City filmed in close-ups, but the scenes in the country are all distant and panoramic? That is the mentality of Carl Reiner's direction, claustrophobic toward the city, spatial to the country. In the last whimsical scene in the old man's house, the camera is so far away that you can not even see what's happening. The abrupt ending suggests a resolution that Segal could easily have reached ninety minutes ago; It also suggests that Reiner could not figure out how to finish the picture. Then he just cut it off, as another example of "madness." Reiner seems to think that the mute is equal to the madness, and the madness without logic is always funny. It's not, and the creators of "Where's Poppa" are just as insane as Ruth Gordon putting Pepsi on their Fruit Loops.
