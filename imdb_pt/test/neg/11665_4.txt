This turned out to be more of a soap-opera romance movie for women than I expected ... just a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were suspenseful, but many of the previous 75s were simply simply tedious. <br /> <br /> Ruter Hauer was a little overwhelmed, not interpreting his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson looks a bit dumb most of the time and her character was very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The story is more or less. It's not as bad as I'm doing, but it sure is nothing I would watch again, and the back of the VHS depicting this movie was misleading.
