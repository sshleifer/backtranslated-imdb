I have to admit that although I am a fan of Shakespeare, I have never been familiar with this play. And what I really can not say is if this is a bad adaptation, or if the piece is just a poor choice for the movie. There are some good deals, but the execution is very awkward and the plot is obvious. The theme of the play is about the nature of debt, using the financial idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional issues. This becomes clear when the question of the rings becomes more important than the dealings with Shylock, which unfortunately descends into the anti-Semitism garden despite the bard's best attempts to save him with some good monologues. <br /> <br /> Of the return worthy of Jeremy Irons, I did not think there was a decent performance in the group. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a slight groan added at the end of each pronouncement, and some of Shylock's best scenes are reduced to variations on the standard scene "Pacino gets angry" that his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is completely embarrassing, to the point that I think they would have tested their screen early on. When she becomes incognito as a man, it is difficult not to laugh at all the things we should not laugh at. With Joseph Fiennes trying to sound sincere and complicated, it's hard not to make devastating comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in "Shakespeare in Love." The big problem, however, is that everything exceeds everything in this film is just a lack of emotional focus. It's really hard to say if this movie is trying to be a rather serious comedy or an oddly silly drama. Certainly, a good performance in the summer stock would rip more laughter from the material than this gloomy production. The actors seem embarrassed to be trying humor, and not knowing where to put dramatic and comedic emphasis. All this is basically the fault of the director, Michael Radford, who seems to think the material is much heavier than it seems to me.
