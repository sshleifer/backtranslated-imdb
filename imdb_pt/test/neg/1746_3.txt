We will see. This movie is a lot of things for different people. For Finns, as shown by the reviews, it can be OK or terrible or boring. For other people, it may be something different. Firstly: if you do not speak Finnish (I), you will understand half of what is happening, since the captions are terrible and even the title is translated incorrectly ("Paha maa" would probably be translated as Badlands in the UK.). <br /> <br /> Why did not I like it? Because it's a Tarantino-style movie: it just takes a very hard reality and throws it back at you, as brutally as possible. I, however, am not an American and so I do not really like this process because all he does is show that the director has nothing new to say. Technical prowess (camera work is brilliant), script (not that not original) does not rescue this movie from the background where it belongs. If you want to watch a Finnish movie, choose one of the Kaurism√§ki brothers' films, which combine with talent and driving skills, with very good actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> This director must review his intentions and priorities: none was intelligible and therefore this film failed. For not watching you will not miss much.
