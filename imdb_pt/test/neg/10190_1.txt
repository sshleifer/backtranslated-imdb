I thought I was going to see a movie about UFOs. Instead, I saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (I) make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to hell. The whole UFO thing was a great red herring !!! The acting was pathetic. In fact, it seemed that some people from an evangelical church came together and decided they wanted to make a movie. All the characters spoke as if they were in church talking to other church members. It was not a real-life dialogue. I wish I had read some reviews before seeing this movie so I would not have wasted my money on this. If, on the other hand, you are in the whole church scene on a large scale, and you want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how restrictive) to other people, then, by all means, go see.
