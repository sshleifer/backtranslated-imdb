I really did not know what to expect from "Future-Kill", but I certainly hoped it was a little better than what I got. I knew the rating was poor and the reviews were unfavorable, but the cover artwork on the Subversive DVD looks way too cool and I can not resist it. For a very long time (really long, actually), this film seemed to be an unofficial sequence of Porky with lame, vulgar and offensive fraternity games. Five mega-dorks, one of them resembling a young Jim Carrey clone, desperately want to become members of a fraternity house, but their final initiation may be a little overdone and dangerous. They are thrown into the center of the city with provocative marks painted on their faces, simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war. It does not take long for them to be confronted with Splatter, a seemingly half-man warrior and half machine, who leads a gang from whom I never really discovered who or what they were. Were they a government experience? Cyborgs? Terminator Imitations of a distant future? Does anyone care? "Future-Kill" is a bizarre amateur movie with a scenario that jumps from one subject to another without any form of logical or narrative connection. The plot lends vital elements of great cinematic cult classics like "The Warriors," "Escape from New York," and "The Terminator," but the end result is a gigantic Sci-Fi monstrosity. The costumes and special effects are quite unfortunate and there is a lot of cheap and free nudity. The acting is terrible, but I'm willing to blame the delayed dialogs instead of the cast members. One to avoid at all costs, despite a very cool DVD art cover. Resist!
