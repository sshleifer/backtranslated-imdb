John Waters owes me two hours of my life back. I saw a preview of this way back in 1990, and I'm still in pain. Not before or since, I've seen such a terrible piece of film junk spat on the screen. There's nothing positive I can say about this movie. Acting - horrible; plot - ridiculous; music - atrocious. After the movie, my friends and I demanded our money back from the theater manager. He explained that since it was a free exhibition, he could not give us anything in return, no matter how much agony we were suffering. Because Johnny Depp's career has survived this disaster of a movie, no one knows.
