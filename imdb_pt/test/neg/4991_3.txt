When I became a father 5.5 years ago, I was prepared for many of the sacrifices I would have to make. I knew I would have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many of Santa's frozen parades, but I was not ready for the kind of sacrifice I did last night. This, in my humble opinion, is a cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> Underdog is bad. It's not quite the bad Karate Dog, but it makes the Shaggy Dog look like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog were a television show, I'd recommend getting started. Not even the presence of Puddy and the voice of Banky Edwards can save him. Arch. Wow. <br /> <br /> It was also just about the best 80 minutes I've ever enjoyed. James was sitting to the right of me and Michelle to the left, and I spent more time observing their reaction to this conversation, flying pooch than watching the screen. At 5 and 3 years old, they were the target audience, and this movie hit the mark. There's a scene where Underdog belches loudly on another dog face and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured in the movies. When Underdog was flying into space, James was literally on the edge of his seat, hypnotized. The kids absolutely loved Underdog, and that's why I was there. That's what it was last night. <br /> <br /> Unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten, you will not have to waste a second of your life watching this brutal movie. But if you're looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old, I will not judge you. I had a blast.
