After the opening credits on a black sheet of paper with white paint spots sprayed on it, oh OK. I will be generous and I will call the field of stars, we will witness an alien spacecraft colliding with a meteorite and being forced to land on the earth. An amazing model ship looks at lands in a terrible looking model field. Three campers nearby investigate. From the flaming spaceship, a reptile like an alien, Nightbeast emerges, OK, so I lied, it's a guy with a rubber monster mask and a silver space suit. Campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast laser cannon, which shoots horrific special effects on people. The cities Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He alerts his assistant Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a group of men to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast killed an unfortunate driver who stopped at the side of the road in search of a leak. His two annoying sons run after help. They approach a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "someones running towards the house". The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by Nightbeast, kills the girl too. So you can kill the two boys with your laser, maybe Nightbeast is not that bad. Once the sheriff and his men arrive on the scene, they have a gun / laser battle with the Night Beast. After possibly the most uninteresting armed struggle in film history, only the sheriff, his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survived. But Nightbeast is still alive, the bullets seem to have no effect on him. The next day, the sheriff visits the city's mayor, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in town. He refuses to say that a party he is holding for the governor (Richard Ruxton) can not be canceled, and that he does not want to create a panic situation. The sheriff evacuates the city anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to scare the Nightbeast and survive. Together with the sheriff, his deputy and Jamie, they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler, this has to be an amateur movie, done with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many Dohler's are involved. For that reason, I should probably take a break, but that still does not stop him, or excuse himself for being an extremely bad movie in every department. There's no story or purpose, things just happen to waste time, what's with Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex-girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many other scenes add nothing to the film. The script also has no logic, why the Nightbeast is around the city since it was supposedly evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect of which an 80s specter would be ashamed. There is not much blood or blood in it, an open stomach, a severed arm, and a decapitation, but all seem predictably poor. Credit where it's due, Nightbeast itself seems right for the most part. There is a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy, which must be seen to be believed, music that even a porn would be ashamed and two really ugly nude people make this a difficult sequence to watch. Less than stellar acting, photography, music, lighting and editing, is a real chore to sit on. And the worst thing about this movie? This compromises the mortal sin of being annoying and not being a bit of fun. Sorry Don mate, but do not give up on the day's work! Definitely one to avoid.
