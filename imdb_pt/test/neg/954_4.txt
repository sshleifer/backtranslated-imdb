This winding tale of mafia revenge is simply not very interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a mature role as the heavy boss. Jim Brown kicks effectively, Gloria Hendry proves that she can bring life even to the poorer roles, and Brock Peters is decent as the cop who plays the book. It is still monotonous and poorly constructed, and even the impression shown on the cable is now emasculated from its original James Brown score.
