It's hard to get deeper into this sort of thing, since there's absolutely no partial reason to watch it, let alone express an opinion about it. I do not know anything about it - watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts. Apparently, it's an unofficial sequel to the 1982 "Killer Party Massacre," which I enjoyed as a fun slasher. "Cheerleader Massacre" looks like a last minute softcore Cinemax movie! And it's not surprising that girls like Nikki Fritz and Samantha Phillips (prolific T & A actresses) are into it. A lot of nekkid boys and not much more ... A group of 20-something cheerleaders, two random boys, and the fat, stupid werewolf of the comic are stranded in the country and find a house where they intend to spend the night. The newly escaped "Slumber Party" killer is in the area and begins to kill them. There is no gore or originality and I would not say that nudity is a real "selling point" since this is a movie as annoying as slasher. Absolutely terrible ...
