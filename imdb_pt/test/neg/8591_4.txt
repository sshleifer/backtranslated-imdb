Beautiful images, propaganda and history as a toy. The ingredients in this movie, good, interesting, but with many shadows. Shadow Policy. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. He is the silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of much of North America. In the movie it's just Superman. The delicate outline of ideas is crushed. The subtle birth of the essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is a basic tool for creating a good picture of American realities. The final, triumphant and false, novel and heroic, is the armed suicide of a story that can be tall with more wisdom. And the war against the "Avatar" is another gray spot. For those who have not heard anything about Jefferson, the film is a good start. For others - let down. It's like the precious silk of a tailor. But the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are just ordinary fabrics. So a sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and the passion of expectation. A movie that should impress. And the ashes of a story that could be magnificent.
