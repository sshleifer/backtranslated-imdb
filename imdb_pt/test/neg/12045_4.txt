I saw this movie when it came out and I hated it. I just saw him again 27 years later. I really enjoyed some ... although Robin Williams was totally wrong for the role ... What I remember most about hating the movie is that it was almost the complete opposite of what I had understood when I read the book. As I have not read it again, I can only give you my impressions of the past - but I am sure of one thing - the film is a hymn to family life, while in the book, almost ALL traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown as straitjackets from which we would be well off. The only positive point in the book is the wonderful nature of the children ... something that only the beginning and the end of the movie really captures (with that incredibly beautiful baby floating in the air. Too bad Williams does not have a tenth of his charm!) low mark is therefore of the fact that the film misrepresents the book. Like a movie on its own, it does it better - but only for some important performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone who saw her would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow as a former football player who made a sex-change operation is fantastic ... he never pitched or made the character anything but commendable - and as such, his performance had incredible integrity. I watched him closely during all his scenes, and never once was he anything but female. Nothing in his performance came close to the performance of a drag queen ... and that made all the difference. In fact, of all the people in the movie, he is the only one who is beyond reproach. It's worth watching this movie just for its performance.
