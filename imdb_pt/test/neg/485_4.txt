This is better than Cronenberg's first horror films, but nothing more than his basic story of what is real. The theme of the video game was said before as well. Nothing original is left except the strange atmosphere of Cronenberg (which is not so strong here) with the funky sexual references and shadowy Shore score. The story never catches your full attention. It just flows forward event after event with boring pace. Overall rating:
