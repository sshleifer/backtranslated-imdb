I saw this movie last night and visited specifically to see if others thought it was as bad as me. <br /> <br /> Of course some people see a lot in this movie that I did not see, so if you're one of those people, fine - good luck to you. But I'm a patient person. I liked extremely long films before. But this was a torture exercise for me. <br /> <br /> I honestly felt that this was one of those movies with little to say, and that was more about style than substance - however, the style too, made me feel like ripping my hair out. Almost everything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens OFF-SCREEN. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a movie entirely from outtakes - the bits that would normally be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a DVD, if they were shown to the public. <br /> <br /> You do not even find out, ANYTHING, about ANYTHING about the main character, François. I had no sympathy for any of the characters in this movie, except perhaps the violinist and his goat, and the old man who believes that the octopuses live up to 300 because they are really smart. Seriously, I was excited when I cut a picture of François holding a gun to his head. I felt so cheated when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be annoying. <br /> <br /> Oh, and where was the editor? Also, do you smoke opium too? I swear, I almost screamed every time I was subjected to an extended shot of absolutely nothing happening, except maybe someone walking back and forth, and then there would FINALLY be a very abrupt cut to the next scene, and it would be ONE YEAR AFTER WE MISS EVERYTHING INTERESTING THAT HAPPENED TO THE MEASURE, AND EVERYONE WAS STILL USING THE SAME BLOODY CLOTHING ....! enjoyed it - great. But this review claims to be an antidote to the adulation "you'll love this movie if you like cinema" I've seen posted here and elsewhere. (See? I hated the movie and I even included a sly flashing reference to your content!)
