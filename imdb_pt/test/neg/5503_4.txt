The original review I had planned for this movie might be a little too hard, so I'll start with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer and pizza movie or sleep pajamas, the kind you watch with a good group of people. people when humor is light and no one is really focused on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful and fun in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching waiting for something to shake with all the lights out. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie "based" on a classic story if you will not even try to stay faithful to the sense, feel, tone or theme of the original? Listen carefully to the misspelled lines of dialogue and you will hear Washington Irving's slow bustle rolling in his grave. I even accept Detective Big-City, but ... Did Ricci draw spells around the bed? Come now. Not only is there nothing vaguely similar to this in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", but it's the historical BUNK. I do not care about the neo-pagan ax you have to grind, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for evil powers; all this cute approach to witchcraft-witch-goddess "an'-it-harm-none" worship of witchcraft goes back historically to the British invasion. (Parties interested in old-school pagan practices are referred to "The Golden Bough" by James Frazer if you do not believe me.) This creates such a discordant element cast in the context of the film that the Sleepy Legend's hollow structure is broken. So we end up with a completely different story. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he had warned us in advance. Besides, I wish he had a better story than the pretty pedestrian I witnessed here. And he might as well have totally abandoned Irving's pretensions. And anyway, the movie is not scary. Not once. Not at all. The deformed tree approached, but it was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the farce of Hessian's comedy. And finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never wanted her to be blonde.
