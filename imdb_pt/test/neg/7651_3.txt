When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie, since Randy Quaid is very funny in comedy movies. However, this movie is not so funny and is a bit annoying as well. You can see the surprise coming a mile away and runs a long time for a movie that is supposed to be only eighty-one minutes long. So I can honestly say it's not a movie that's on my favorite list. It might work for some people, but it just did not work for me, proving to be a bit slow in building with virtually nothing that amused me inside the entire movie. Randy Quaid is lost and the rest of the cast is a list of dull actors and actresses. The premise of the film had potential, as did the cast of Quaid, but all this just stutters and the inclusion of the horror element seems very unnecessary. Surely the sequel to a dream that the boy had when he jumped into bed and suddenly became a whirlwind of blood was very well done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure terror rather than one that list comedy as his first genre.
