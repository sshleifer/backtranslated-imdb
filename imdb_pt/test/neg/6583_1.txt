Much like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still photo - it does not look too bad. But when people start to move, it's absolutely horrifying. Irregular irregular movements, frightening lack of emotion and lack of a feeling of life on the face gives me shivers. The characters do not even look LIVING / organic. <br /> <br /> I watched a preview with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! She was not at all compromised. For the record, I thought she was easily involved in both Pixar films and some of the bad films like Sinbad. The lighting is painful, giving children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. Lip sync is bad - worse than Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> I also seriously questioned Hanks playing five characters ... this was a great distraction throughout the movie. The role of the conductor is mysterious - although in a way I can not identify. It reminds me of my father's false "phone" voice when I greet customers. <br /> <br /> I think that's why multiple roles are distracting - you're aware that the voice is the same, but distinctly different. It gives each character the feeling of being ACTED, as opposed to being real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by Hanks' multiple role. I saw the technique work - la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks can not come close to doing it with one voice, given the creepy animation. <br /> <br /> I would not waste my money on this - expect the rent.
