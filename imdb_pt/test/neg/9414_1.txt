I did not have high hopes for that. Before I saw it, the story shouted "stereotype" to me. <br /> <br /> I mean ... come on! So stupid is the plot about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created him are immoral, so he decides to change everything. <br /> <br /> I had to see him three times. For the first two times I fell asleep because I was incredibly bored with it. It's very rare for movies to bother me so much that I sleep during them. The third time I forced myself to watch it, simply to be able to warn people about it. I have the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess have tried to take away all the legal / legal things. of other sci-fi / action movies, and put them together to make a kick-ass movie! They took the android / robot, lots of action, fine story, stereotype characters and a great fight in the end and played together. Unfortunately, the movie sucks. The acting is so wooden you could build a house, the plot / plot is absolutely laughable, the camera work and editing is horrible, the direction is non existent and, above all, everything is so clich√© and ridiculous that it just annoys the hell out of you. <br /> <br /> I got the feeling that I could have spent time watching this doing something much more creative, like trimming my nails, or watching the grass grow.
