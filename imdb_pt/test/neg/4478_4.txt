I had high hopes when I entered the theater - having seen the trailer, I was as excited as the next person to see great talents participate in creating a story with a beautiful premise. <br /> <br /> However, it is disappointing to see this talent wasted by the poor composition of the songs - the words are thick and full, probably because they were composed with a more Western theme. I would not find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with French or English lyrics. In Mandarin, they sound strange. <br /> <br /> The musical items were cut too - too quickly to be enjoyable, and the scenes of the actors looking anxious lasted a long time. <br /> <br /> Special effects are the next disappointment. Suffice it to say that it is very obvious that special effects begin and stop. <br /> <br /> It's not Moulin Rouge, nor is it In the Mood, despite the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz theme. In total, it's too much time to tell a simple story.
