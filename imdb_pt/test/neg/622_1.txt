Leave Ed Wood alone. To call "Plan 9 from Outer Space," the worst movie of all time would be to deny that this absolutely vile Hollywood stew is its legitimate title. This pretentious fusion of whimsical, whimsical sociopolitical "comments" seems to be formed along the lines of "Plan 9," with poorly staged scenes of depressed actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battles and crowds made of higher budget epics. But while "Plan 9" occasionally manages to be funny when it wants to be and reasonably fun overall, this sticky contest is terribly lacking in basic exhibitionism, with scenes ranging from offensively bland (Groucho Marx's loathsome burlesque stealing Manhattan from the Indians) down (Hedy Lamarr trying to play Joan of Arc hear his "voices") to tedious (Dennis Hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give the worst director trophy to Irwin Allen for turning so much into so little.
