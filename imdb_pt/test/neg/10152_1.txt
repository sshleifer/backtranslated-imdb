I will not even comment on the rubbish that this movie is since it has already been established. However, watching this with my friends, we all laughed out loud when the protagonist made a reference to Shelley Hack while she was on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume he had a fixation of Charlie's Angels at the same time. Based on this reference, we assumed that this movie must have been around Charlie's Angels in 1979 or 1980, but from what I read here, it was done around 1987. You certainly could not say that for the low production values. It looks like it was made by a college student for a movie class. And while I do not expect a low-budget trash festival like this to be politically correct at all, the rednecks in this movie certainly enjoyed directing disparaging remarks from homosexuals to each other. Even so, I would still rate it as the second worst horror movie ever made, second only to "Nail Gun Massacre".
