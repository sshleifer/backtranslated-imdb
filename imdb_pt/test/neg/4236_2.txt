This two and a half hour movie was recently screened at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in a 22 hour show. There was a program scheduled for 1:00 after that, but wondered if anyone would stay awake to see it until 3:30 in the morning. The opening scene is of a man walking on a field and lasts four minutes of film time. It's a sinister sign of what's to come: a good 144 more minutes of it. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. Repeat 15 times, with a very sparse dialogue. Occasionally, these very long, slow sequences are interrupted by shocking photos, such as a close-up of the female genitalia, shown for an entire minute of the movie's time (the audience laughing in the last 20 seconds, so to speak, "what's the message?" ). The story resembles Dostoevsky's novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," in which an asshole falls in love with a woman of easy morality. In one of the rare moments when the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there two hours ago to see nothing happen) was when a statement from a British tourist that he could not see things clearly since the Eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles per hour, was translated by the translator with the automatic switching of units of measurement from the English system to the metric system to "they could not see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour." What was surprising about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals how much money was spent on it. This was not an 8mm cinematic experience. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, assembled. However, I was so little out of it. Some comments on the excruciating details, like the minutae of a keyring hanging from a door that has just been opened. Okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? Some brave people in the audience drifted away after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something going on at the end. There never was. And maybe that's what the movie is about. All movies in the movies are full of action. This one wants to be different. There is nothing happening.
