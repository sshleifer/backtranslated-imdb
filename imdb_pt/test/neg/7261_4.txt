Something strange is happening in remote areas of the Arctic. An Air Force weather station is found wrecked, with its occupants missing. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing vessel disappears. Curious spoors are found in the snow. A four-foot piece of a living organism is found near a destroyed plane. The piece looks like half the claw of a giant Alaskan crab. The military (Craig Stevens as an Air Force officer) and their experts are perplexed. A distinguished scientist (William Hopper) and his beautiful assistant (Alix Taltan) are called New York. Hopper deduces from this fragile evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous mantis. He's right. The handsome assistant looks out of the office window and sees the horrible face with his bulging eyes staring at her. She drops whatever she bears, claps her hands on her cheeks and screams in horror. The mantis begins to fly south along the Gulf Stream, stopping every now and then to attack large population centers like Washington and New York. to knock down buses and eat people. Military weapons do not affect much, but finally Stevens collides with him on his hunt and mortally damages the beast, who comes ashore and occupies the "Manhattan Tunnel" that connects New York and New Jersey. Stevens, having survived the collision, leads his team to the tunnel and kills the large insect with "3RG mines", despite its fierce appearance, ominous behavior and ground-shaking roars. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper laughs and takes the picture of them. <br /> <br /> Ho hum. Like the mortal mantis itself, the formula by now was gasping for air, jumping around, looking for prey not humans, but anything in terms of a new idea or original. As it is, they neglected a clich√©. Hopper should have hastily invented a Super Duper DDT that alone could defeat the insect. This is what 3RG mines should have been filled in, rather than common explosives. <br /> <br /> The working model is very good considering what the budget should have been. Not much money was spent on anything else, because everything else is routine. Craig Stevens is unsightly, a face and style made for a TV series. William Hopper looks right - tall and silver hair - but his instrument has only one note. The beautiful assistant is quite simple considering her role. The part calls Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They too could not act, but they carried with them slight but distinct insinuations of annoyance. Anything could have helped this movie. <br /> <br /> I wish the praying mantis had not screamed so loudly and so often, because you can not roar - you can not even whisper - if you do not have lungs. I did not mind, however, when the monster found its end in the tunnel. A praying mantis is a graceful insect in its own thin way and it is great to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and other things. But when you get to it, they are not very attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when the pair is practically copulating, the female bites the male's head, as well as in humans. But at least human men know when to stop. The male mantis continues copulating for several minutes, although he is headless. We humans do not have stupid males copulating with goal-directed females. We?
