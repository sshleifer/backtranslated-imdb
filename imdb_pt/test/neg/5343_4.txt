As a writing teacher, there are two submissions I never allow my students to use: "So I woke up" and "So I got hit by a truck." Now I'll add, "Then I hit my head." I feel it is totally unfair to use these tricks to cover up the lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could have been treated with some intelligence and skill, however, in this film, they could not or would not. I'm not saying it's totally useless, but it's so predictable in its progress except for the stupid end. There are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy. They should have done it right away. It's just a forgotten horror / science fiction movie with nothing new to offer.
