This movie has to be the worst movie of 2007, it was really too bad and I do not think I've ever seen a movie that is so bad, I mean, what does not really make bad Hollywood movies do they? Hamish really should get singing instead of acting because he just can not act, god, he was so bad, I mean he was so bad in the movie that he did Mallika Sherawat look like a better actress than him, as to his performance, she plays the same role in all the movies, God is so annoying to see her, I mean what do men see in this woman?, yes she has a body of god, but where is that talent ???? I have not seen it yet and at this rate I do not think I ever will. <br /> <br /> Anyway Hamish falls in love with Ria now this 15 year old girl can act, my god she was the best actor in the movie and she does not look 15 at all, to me she seems about 21, but his performance was brilliant in the film. Bless her, she was very good, I hope to see more of her in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himash, but her father wants her to marry someone else, a typical Bollywood movie, anyway, there's a hiccup (it can only happen in a Bollywood movie) and they both get married in the end. Well, I would give the song 10/10, it was superb, it made the movie a hit, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. Anyway, the only thing I can say is go buy the music and not watch the movie.
