quite possibly one of the worst (if not the) movie ever designed, released and acted in the history of cinema. Who in the green earth of God would think of climbing Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like his mother. God forgive me, but I'm being honest. And that was the least of the many problems that afflict this horrible excuse for a movie. It was a horrible statement against women, but at least if you're going to blame women for the world's problems, tell a decent story, not one with so many annoying holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and excitement. Everyone should get the money back to watch in the theaters or buy the DVD.
