I bought a DVD of this movie for a dollar at the big department store. This is probably the best and kindest comment I have to offer. At least I was not fooled by the cost of lunch. <br /> <br /> The problem with the "Chiller" is Craven's problem as a director. The man has his apologists who claim that his travel documents prove that he is a very smart guy and keen conceptualist. But it's no secret that as a director he never possessed a shred of the visual and narrative sense of a Hitchcock. As vigorously attested by "Chiller," he is much closer to the legendary Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven does not have as a director is the main ingredient that would take him from the director of rent to a higher plane of film production. <br /> <br /> Let's be specific. The transition moments of this film are elegant. The shots they set give the impression of quality production. The film looks professionally assembled, in the same way a movie filmed by a commercial TV director would do. (A thought: movies just a visual distinction, these transitions that at least seem professionally handled may well be the work of some second-unit directors.) They are the parts between the bridges and the soft transitions - the drama - that fall. <br /> <br /> The core of the process is invariably handled superficially. The critical shots (after, say, the car that sets off for the camera well positioned, then we cut out the night of a hospital, then into the waiting room and the hallway, then into the telephone booth in the corner that will appear the next piece of action) are quickly dispensed so that we can hurry and get to the next part. Craven never comes close to blowing up dramatic or visual possibilities anytime. The net result of all this misdirected attention to the less important parts and the clumsy race to keep things moving is a film that looks like the work of the young art student who sharpens all his pencils, adjusts the easel and the adjustment of lighting. up, grind all your pigments, stretch and prepare your canvas ... and then you have nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never reaches the hour of exercise. <br /> <br /> For the apologists of Craven who will indicate that this film was made for TV, I will point to the "Duel" of Spielberg and say no. More.
