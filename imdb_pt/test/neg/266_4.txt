I enjoyed Oceans 11, found it very pleasant, helped by the performances and the direction. However, I was disappointed with this movie. Do not get me wrong, it's not a complete failure, thanks to the excellent performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially, and the efficient direction of Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really suffers from a truly lethargic rhythm, some of the movies were so slow that I almost fell asleep between an important touch. Secondly, the plot is very complicated and there are many twists and turns that make tracking difficult. The camera work was not as innovative as in the first film as well. Considering that in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and strange here, and the music was not particularly memorable. The script was also not so witty or entertaining, and the film looked anti-climactic. At the end of the day, everything seemed a bit lazy, despite common sense and direction. So much potential, but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
