Great concept, characterizations and perfect voices, but a complete waste of time. A real shame, once it was set higher, probably would not have been the bomb it was (is); very dependent on eschatological humor, for beginners. I am amazed at comments from "educated" reviewers referring to the "good science" behind this piece of childish garbage. Unlike "Finding Nemo," where (with a little disbelief) the attention to detail was astounding and the science was as good as the context allowed, "Osmose Jones" was totally meaningless; Make no mistake about science. Humor directed at eight-year-olds, but with a theme more appropriate for some unsophisticated teenagers.
