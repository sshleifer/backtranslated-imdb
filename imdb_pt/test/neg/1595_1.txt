if I could evaluate a zero myself, coming from someone who likes shock / exploration films of the time and Waters in general I must say that this is useless. <br /> <br /> He does nothing, serves nothing, an idiot with a camera, and a desire to prove his cunning by rebelling against social standards is all that happens. <br /> <br /> He is entirely amateur, both in principle and in execution, has no meaning, is difficult by disgust, obscene with the wit of a Neanderthal, his useless. Someone said Waters was probably "laughing" at all the bad press and heartbreak that others got with this movie, but why? If I did a short film describing a man in a bathroom taking shit for ten minutes in a row, he would certainly get the same accommodations, but why would I be proud or "laughing" at it? <br /> <br /> It would be because I'm so unintelligent that I have to resort to it so I can say "HA! Catch the censors and the mainstream! I'm so rebellious, I do what I want and film! " No. <br /> <br /> Waters should not be proud of this mess, fans of the waters should not watch, it is useless, that is, without any use. <br /> <br /> even fit the criterion of art for art. <br /> <br /> To like or defend this film is to advocate something that was purposely designed as anti-culture to be taken to the mainstream public in modern terms. This movie is the Hot Topic of the movies. <br /> <br /> Useless and Obsolete. A film of Poser that demands that it be recognized like rebellion.
