If anyone wants a character in a movie to have a disruptive sexual encounter that would embarrass this character in adulthood, the only thing an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now this has been done. Judging by some of the other reviews, even they have not been successful like that. I can not remember a funny scene, although I have to admit, I had to turn it off before I finished. I watched a part of the director's comment and it seems he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was going well. If you want to have the same feeling you get from this movie, but just cheaper, stick your head in a dung heap and breathe deeply.
