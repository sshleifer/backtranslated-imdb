The two most notable things about "I will not play" are: He won an Oscar as the best short two-roll 1944 film; and was directed by the leader of the silent era, Crane Wilbur. The plot of this mediocre short film is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks brilliance, while acting is no better and no worse than found in most Hollywood movies of the 1940s (in other words, it's awful). Of course, there are times when "I Will not Play" is funny - the totally artificial look of Janis Paige and the line delivery are precious - but a laugh in the picture, not with it.
