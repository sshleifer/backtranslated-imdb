In general, I prefer horror movies that scare me so much that I'm afraid of everything for the next day, not those in which people act stupidly and are killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The legend chupacabra is a gray-green, lizard-skinned monster that leaps like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spikes sticking out of its back and sucks the blood of cattle. As in many good and bad horror films, this movie takes liberty with the legend. It not only attacks humans, but eats its intestines and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible, constitution. So tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate the skin when the bullets can not? And why, when the Marines discover that piercing bullets can hurt him, do they separate so the chupacabra can catch them one by one? John Rhys-Davies gives a performance that surpasses the bad movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal deserve credit for their performances as well. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was bad to bad, just like the rest of the movie. My classification is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons, and Neal.
