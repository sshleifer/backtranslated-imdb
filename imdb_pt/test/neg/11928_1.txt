If you're a fan of the original series, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should have been skeptical of the previous ones when Aeon expressed his motives for the murder. In the Aeon series he had no family and no reason for his adventures to save selfish interests. Obviously, the chief editor of chimpanzees had felt that the film needed to attend to "bad guild", making the character mortal, but it has a good reason to kill people. <br /> <br /> You would not have thought of it. possible, but the film is more two-dimensional than the cartoon. The characters are all portrayed as inherently good with some conflict of interest that eventually gets resolved. All the dogs go to the sky, and the same for all the characters that die in this movie. <br /> <br /> The selfish, distorted, perverted, and domineering characters of Aeon and Trevor can not be seen. In the end, they literally thrive on a beautiful couple winging Annie Hall. The only character who remained faithful to the show was Relicle, the machine floating in the sky. I suppose if you thought "Gee, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it were more like any other Hollywood science fiction movie that does not have a face," so you're happy. <br /> <br /> They did not even get the right look. I suppose a black metal bikini was too much to ask for, but the whole scene is wrong. 400 years in the future certainly looks like 30 years in the past. Instead of a distinctly urban post-apocalyptic world, the eyes of the beholder are offended with an egg-shaped furniture, wooden panels, earth tones, and many plants. Bregna was a dystopia, not a utopia. Speaking of Bregna, this is the only city on earth according to the film. The show of course there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, who used to be one. In the movie, the "Monicans" are just freedom fighters from Hollywood stories. They also have as much technology as the Bregnans, which is not the case with the show. <br /> <br /> The only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this movie was a high school kid, and he wrote it. the previous day, was due to studio executives, and he never saw an entire Aeon Flux throughout the process. The sheer amount of inconsistency with the cartoon is disconcerting. In addition to using certain names like Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the film is nothing like the show. <br /> <br /> The actual volume of the film seems to try to mix the colorful plots of green with soybean, blade runner, Logan's run and grave attack, which came out a bland brown mess.
