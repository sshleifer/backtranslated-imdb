Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: This is a power cast of all stars, but "The Box" again proves that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie. The premise seems promising: a couple are visited by a mysterious person who offers them a million dollars. The downside is that someone is going to die, a person they probably will not know. So, what you do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that, the story drifts completely. I wander an uninspired plot about an alien conspiracy involving NASA, nothing is really explained here. <br /> <br /> "The Box" is a disappointment, it could have been so much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story, this explains the errors of continuity.
