When a Stranger Calls belongs to the group of remakes of this year, with films like Poseidon just above the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) is leading this up-to-date version, with many relatively unknown castles, which signals that the death rate is high (it is not), or that the established stars are distancing themselves from a possible turkey. <br /> <br /> With a relatively short time of 87 minutes, it is basically composed of two acts. The first, which takes an entire hour, is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), accumulated 800 minutes of conversation on her cell phone (do the math), and as a lesson in responsibility, her parents confiscated her cell phone and landed her. To pay her debt, she works part-time as a nanny, and caring for the wealthy children of Mandrakis is her first task. <br /> <br /> The huge Mandrakis mansion receives a complete tourist treatment, as that is where all the action will take place. Plenty of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool-sized aquarium-pond (for getting wet, for wet treatment T-shirt), and check it out - motion detector lights, you just know will contribute to the scares with the manipulation of lights and shadows. Of course, excerpts from jokes, red jokes are in large quantity, which defines the time of execution of this act, but most of them fall face to face in the department of suspense. <br /> <br /> There is a small trend emerging, with actors being invisible, providing and acting through their voice in their place. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weaving's V for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen does the honors for the anonymous and nameless psychotic killer, but he just falls flat. Because? The script does not give you much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were of the silent nature (masturbation of the mind), which I thought was a waste - they too could have thrown something unknown, and work will still be done. <br /> <br /> Second act, where the main action happens, is a bit too late. And the bogeyman, well, is purely a bogeyman. Those who expect blood and gore will be disappointed, as it is basically a show of a woman to catch her attention in the first hour (eye candy always succeed), and this act will have her solve everything in double quick time, ala Rachel McAdams in red Eye. Do not expect any form of character development, or subplots that involve you. <br /> <br /> The ending tried to be too clever for its own sake, and it came as an inexpensive way to end the movie. There is not much to point out from this movie - no fright, no emotions, no enigmatic villain and many security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only good thing is to provide a number for 4D.
