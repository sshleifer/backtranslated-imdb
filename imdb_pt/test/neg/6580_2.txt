I think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book for my kids when they were little. I was very disappointed with the movie. A character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of nails on the chalkboard. There is a totally unnecessary train / roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that look scary to young children to whom this movie was made. The scenes of the North Pole with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. It usually does not work to turn a small children's book into a feature film. This movie totally irritates my nerves.
