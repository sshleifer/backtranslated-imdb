I have no idea who these others are, but this movie is horrible. They have to support Joe Pesci when he is a minor character. Bait and swap the movie as the studios did with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I watched claims "that obscure jewelery revolves around JOe Pesci's character MOB who is a hot head starting a war" etc. of Joe, he does not even carry a gun, plays a lugubrious character and gets SPOILER - (knocked). So much for the movie spinning around Pesci. The only half-memorable scene was a bad comedy attempt when they ran gas while they waited for a score. If you watch this movie after reading this, I warned you. Please stop and do not miss 87 minutes of your life.
