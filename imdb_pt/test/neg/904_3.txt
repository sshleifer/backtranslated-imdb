A ten year old boy fed up with his parents arguing decides to plug a hot car and go on a surreal trip across America to find Motorama cards, which is a gas station card game, which if he can find to spell "Motorama "he has the chance to earn 500 million dollars. He knows many bizarre characters along the way. Nobody can do an "instant cult classic," Joe Minion's previous "After Hours" got it by absolute merit and an incredible director, but it was not instantaneous. This movie, on the other hand, is just bizarre just to be bizarre. No rhyme or reason for any of this. The plot is incidental at best and seems to exist only to show several cameos. It's not just a funny or thoughtful film. It's a lot of cover together. I've heard many comparisons between this one and David Lynch's films. This is almost heresy as even Lynch's worst movie (the worst in quotes, since he does not have a bad movie actually) is still miles above that stretch. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is topless very briefly <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Trailer for 'Joe Dirt'
