Michael Caine could have tried to make a character larger than life to a degree of success, but the whole story and character around him were not at all pleasant or interesting. It was all very annoying and a little predictable. Martin Landau, one of my favorite actors, had no role. He was useless. Michael Caine got a little annoyed after a while and the movie could not decide whether it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine struggles a lot, but I felt that direction and history had disappointed him. Do not waste your time. It starts well in the first 10 minutes and then that's it. A Die Hard Caine Fans Only movie. Stay away from him ...
