What can I say? This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are admittedly horrible). The acting was amateur, the sets were boring and the camera work was of poor quality and sophistication. This whole movie looked like a college final project. I had to keep convincing myself that this was done by a teenager to make it look good. The most disturbing factor of the "movie" is that it's not even a movie - it's videotaped. This was extremely disturbing. On top of all that, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot is so basic that it makes my eyes water. Not to mention that they steal at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes. If there were zero stars, this movie would be the result. <br /> <br /> The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it is.
