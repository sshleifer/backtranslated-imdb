How LIVING THE DREAM got into Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood is beyond me, as is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened-in-gasp, Eugene, Oregon-, that this failure of a movie with characters you want to like and feel sorry for your high school exclusion days, but can not, as they are so losers, is so violent and atrocious with the dialogue that is beyond evil. So clich√©, the three high school losers end up in Los Angeles, and this is where the movie could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a real loser in a garage call center that sells magazines. Even the bastard who commands the place has more appeal from the audience than that terrible actor with the horrible foreign accent. And, fraudulently, they get money from an insurance fraud to create an inexperienced executive recruiting company, just showing off "the supposed good life" at night spots in Los Angeles with a cast of actors who are so bad and made of wood, it's better not have SAG cards ... <br /> <br /> I could go on talking about this bad movie, but I ended up leaving the theater, which had at first six people, and when I left there four men were the only ones in the audience. I wanted to like this film, but I could not find a merit in the story, characters, writing, dialogue, nor the actors. Whoever the cast of this movie should retire. Amen ... enough ...
