! SOFT SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The premise is as follows: A shop is set on fire and the assistant Sergio is questioned by the father of the man who started the fire to take the package Sergio agrees to. So far so good, but there is a fair logic lapse involved Sergio agrees to do this for the sum of $ 25,000, but why? Come on guys, if you were a good-looking white kid, would you run the risk of having a long time in a difficult prison (a very real possibility of a criminal arson) for a matter of 25,000? I know I would not like it, and since you would have a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole, so are $ 25,000 for both a lifetime of job checks and social work? There is also something else that seems to have been ignored by the premise, since Mr. Lumpke told Sergio that his son made the fire, he seems to be unaware of the possibility that he may know too much. Were the alarms not ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you completely if they told you something? <br /> <br /> I do not think we need to think of such details since the love story of The PYROMANIAC is not supposed to be a clever thriller, it's a light romantic comedy / girl movie that is probably best apprieciated as a night of the girls in. Looking through this page of comments it is obvious that the film has its advocates but as a cynical man I was not very impressed and William Baldwin goes way beyond the top
