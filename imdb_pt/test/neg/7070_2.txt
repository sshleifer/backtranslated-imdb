I was invited to watch this movie in a small exhibition at the art museum. I had no idea what to expect. I was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle listed. However, after some very disturbing scenes (which did not add much to the advance of the story), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. The trick of the vestigial plot of the crescent arm is never really developed. I waited patiently for this movie to make money. There was a small reward at the end, but having to invest and sit in the endless and gross, gross, sexually perverted, screaming in your face, and a bland cost cost a lot to me (even for a free vision). What were these established actors doing in this horrible movie? The art direction was very convincing and creepy. At the very least, it should only be a 75-minute movie. This is a movie that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would embrace.
