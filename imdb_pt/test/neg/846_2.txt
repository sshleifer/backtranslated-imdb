I give a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came in with his first lines, I thought he was just joking. Cage as an Italian? I'm sorry, but the very wrong actor who is acting is also BAD, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very loose, may have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other scripts. The camera is great, the photography too, but why on earth did you choose Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role? Please, do not get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, he has great movies, but he obviously is not for all roles. It's really a shame that the cast has not been better set because the story has potential.
