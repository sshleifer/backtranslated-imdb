Since I was finishing the book, 'Mrs. Dalloway 'by Virginia Woolf, I was excited to see that I was on one of the movie channels this past weekend. What I found, however, is a film that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensitive. One can not blame the film entirely, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is Virginia Woolf, it is almost entirely written in flow-of-consciousness style with long periods of internalization and little real dialogue , one would surely think that there should not be a movie made from it just because a movie can be made from it. Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor for any of the other actors. It is simply a film that can not be intelligibly made from the story Woolfe wrote, nor should it have been attempted. Do not watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> Shelly
