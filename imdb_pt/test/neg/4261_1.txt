And the worst part was that it could have been good. But something terribly wrong. First, they should not have released Amitabh Bachchan in this movie. He is very much an icon to deal with a subject so delicate and controversial, much less the role itself. <br /> <br /> Second, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed of himself for taking the classic Lolita story and turning it into a pathetic and predictable festive festival. His Lolita is called Jia (played by the newcomer Jiah Khan) and when we meet her, she is devoid of any hint of stolen innocence or that delicate naivete that would normally be associated with the complicated story of the original Lolita that in the original story gradually makes ninfeta. Jia de Varma is already a prostitute with an eye on the prize, even before the camera is found. And he does not exercise chastity in the way his movies are the main nymph. From constant panning shots from his crotch to fixations on his vulgar gestures and mannerisms, Varma makes sure that he has not left a person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic pedophile camera angles. <br /> <br /> Oh, and let's not talk about the nonexistent chemistry between Jia and her friend named Ritu (daughter of Bachchan's character). These girls must be best friends and seem even worse enemies before something goes wrong between them. Nothing they do together is believable until they become enemies. Maybe Varma should have worked on this aspect of his script instead of concentrating on destroying whatever credibility Amitabh Bachchan might have left as an actor. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film is perhaps the subservient portrayal of Bachchan's character's wife character. His role was so underwritten and ridiculously wooden that it is impossible to feel any pity or concern for it. I actually felt like getting on the screen hitting her for not reacting like any normal woman would. Instead, she stood still, looking Irritated and Helpless, as I imagine many of the viewers in this movie could feel after watching a movie disaster. Watch at your own risk.
