Nine out of nine people who saw this have mentally declared themselves with scars for life. No one should have to see this abomination. The English Language is ill-equipped to express how thoroughly, terribly atrocious this "movie" is. It really is not worth the plastic that is made. No greater crime has been committed by the human race throughout the history of creation; there is never likely to be anything worse. It was unanimously agreed that the scene involving Tommy's shrunken head and the girl's blouse was incredibly sick and distorted; in fact many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeal and are currently sitting in the corner of the room swaying, sucking on our thumbs and whimpering. <br /> <br /> The fundamental question in everyone's mouth, however, has to be "Why?". How is it possible for someone to create such a monstrosity and then submit it to so many innocent people? After seeing the trailer, we thought this movie could be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to rid the world of "Shrunken Heads" so that no other poor citizen is exposed to it. . Please, for the good of mankind.
