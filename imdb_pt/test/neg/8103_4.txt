"Black Dragons" is a second propaganda film of World War II, popular at the time. Not as bad as some would like you to believe. <br /> <br /> A secret meeting organized by respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious stranger named Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly afterwards, the meeting participants began to appear murdered, placing their bodies on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspect. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders's niece, Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay), who tries to help him. The reasons behind Colomb's actions are not explained until the end. Until everything is explained in the end, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who by now had been reduced to appearing in a row of low-budget quickies, is really good at it. He is not allowed to act as much as ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director William Nigh. Lugosi's character slides through the shadows and reminds his Dracula to the point of the complete closes of his penetrating eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, a one-dimensional actor at best, would become the Lone Ranger of TV in a few years. Joan Barclay makes a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although a bit dated right now, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
