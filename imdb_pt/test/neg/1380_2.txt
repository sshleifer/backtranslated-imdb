I'm a big fan of comedy. Racial humor is always a bit risky, but the big names like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli, etc. they do everything to perfection. <br /> <br /> They do not overdo it, make the audience uncomfortable or • cough • ROBBY! But I will not dwell on it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor totally unacceptable. His jokes always scream racial humor to the point of not being funny or clever, but it's an insult. I'm not the cold type for racial humor. But his execution of these jokes is sloppy and causes people to recoil in their comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is only surpassed by his presence of stage in annoyance. I feel like he's yelling at me constantly! And he runs around the stage like a maniac. It's just annoying!
