Have you ever wondered what is the worst movie ever made? Stop asking yourself. I'm telling you, Michael is it! <br /> <br /> It's not "comforting", "fun" or "Travolta at its best". Sucks. If I had kids, I'd let them watch Deep Throat before Michael! <br /> <br /> An exhausted John Travolta, a tired and bald William Hurt and about to die at any moment Jean Stapleton this movie shit. <br /> <br /> But wait ... you'll hear Andie McDowell sing! Yes. Hollywood really is on top of us with that!
