Talk about your wildlife. Just a B movie, but what the hay ... brega Sci-Fi and lesbian sex. From the mind of writer and director Cody Jarrett, a piece of extravagant fun. A chemical company is dumping waste that are causing mutants on a fish farm. Kristi Russell's hot star is Dr. Barbara Michaels, an EPA agent sent to investigate this environmental dilemma. She has just entered into a lesbian relationship with bartender Trixie (Ariadne Shaffer) and her love scenes are as good as this movie. A frog the size of a man incites chaos; causing a car crash, raping the chemist's daughter's daughter, raping a girl under the bleachers at a football game, stiffening a runner at the football game, raping a nun ... all before being shot twice in the chest after an antidote was found ready. Special effects ... well, not special; a guy in a rubber frog costume with no genitals to prove himself. Tough Tadpole, do you still want to watch? Go ahead, but bribe any witness to stealth.
