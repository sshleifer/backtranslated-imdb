<br /> <br /> I hosted this movie on June 20, 2001 and watched for about 45 minutes. I concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful in comparison. There was not a single person in the cast for whom I would have shed a tear if hell broke open and engulfed the whole group of them. <br /> <br /> So, I sent out emails to all my friends and friends. relatives warning you, and I'm taking the time to urge everyone who can see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but it's NEVER as bad as that.
