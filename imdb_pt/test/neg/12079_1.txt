It's only when a band tours and only has one original member. Not the same as the classic lineup. All the new actors play the main roles of Rag, Scotty, etc, with Ashby as practically the only face of the first film. And he was just a small note from the first film, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that Scotty was trying to help find women. The film is poorly written, presenting the most idiotic dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a T & A movie, this is a turkey. Not even the low budget films of the 80's, fans would love to watch this movie, which has no plot, and a lot of bad acting. This movie would have been better never being released. Simply bad.
