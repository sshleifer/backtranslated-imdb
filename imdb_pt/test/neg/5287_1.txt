The acting was very insignificant, you had Costas Mandalar acting as the dumbest brother in the Triple H Forest, a lookalike by Scott McMahon as your member that I think you should care about but there is no emotional involvement anywhere. You have the stupid lesbian, Not that I have anything against lesbians, I'm not just stupid who keeps running around like a shirt and a grunge hat that keeps asking if anyone has seen his dead lover. <br /> <br /> The villain can be scary and there is a tale of morality somewhere about trying to fight age and death but is lost in this movie. Hurst Helmsley's back points to the victims soon the way back to the city, while, of course, there are city lights behind him. <br /> <br /> Also a mispronunciation of Ed Gein, but pronounced Gine. As a citizen of Wisconsin. We had our share of Monsters Gein, Dahmer and McCarthy, but if you're going to use it, pronounce it correctly. <br /> <br /> Why do I watch all these terrible movies? Ah yes, I am a punishment glutton and I see it for you not to need.
