If you are at home on a weekend, very bored and lack the will to move with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you can enjoy making fun of this movie. The interpretation, the script and the overall production of the film are not really that bad, and that's why it's possible to get through it. This is definitely a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of premarital sex. Or they can also show you to teach the dangers of very lame music - that the rock band Brian Austin Green is in is really terrible, I think this is a much bigger threat to society than single parents.
