Hi. I watched the first part when it left, and I do not remember leaving such a bad impression on me like this. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is hectic, wooden, unworked, lacking naturalness - I understand that the style of drawing was of some kind 'Atlantean', but could be done with Disney's usual delicacy ... see "Tarzan" to understand what I mean. If I did not see the DISNEY logo in the beginning, I would never say it was a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot was more like a PC game style, like a good old mission. Not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that linked the viewer to the characters and their goals. It was unconvincing, at least. The movie was made for kids, but this was a lot of fun for the kids sometimes. <br /> <br /> Third, the music ... I would say it was inappropriate, but it fits the whole scene with the plot and animation ... <br /> <br /> In general, I think this it was kind of fun, just a kind of project done by several entertainer entertainers, just to fill the Disney movie count. Sorry to hear this from me, a great Disney lover ...
