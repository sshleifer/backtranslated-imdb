I agree with the comment of other users. Hard to believe that this movie actually came out in 1994 because it screams in the mid-'80s. I think it's dubbed because sound and image do not always match. If someone can really say that this is a good movie, they need to be locked. It's as sad as money has so much power over people that they will do anything to get it. I feel like I've lost the intelligence to watch it. I used to have a little respect for Chuck Norris before I watch, but now I feel bad. I bought this as part of a pack of 3 movies for $ 9.99 and I can honestly say it would have been better to throw the money away. Forgive me Jesus.
