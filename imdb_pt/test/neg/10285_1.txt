There is a growing tendency in the media to defame and ridicule men. It is seen in television ads and program graphics. Cheaters is a great example, they could find many female cheaters, but the vast majority shown is of men, why? The main threat to the power of any government lies in the male population, they are less likely to respect authority and are more a physical threat of combat. One way to reduce the threat is to weaken men in society through the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are police dramas filled with self-contained cops, including aggressive, big-chinned women, accusing everyone who questions running over their rights and making these men feel like scum. In Australia, many of the main stars of the sport were recently arrested for dubious attacks and drinking accusations, another example of the government controlling the populous man, arresting his heroes and claiming dominance. Cheaters, in addition to political machinations is an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, moreover, most of these women mug men! If it were otherwise, the men would be in jail !! If it was an honest show, they would be meeting cheating women because they are usually not caught because their male lovers are very glad they do not stick and leave without rocking the boat. The lovers of men want men for themselves and want to possess and control men and thus get men to be caught anyway.
