WHAT WAS THINKING?!?!?! How sad an actor as tremendously talented as Michael Rapaport - who stole our hearts on "Mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town" - sank to this pathetic level. The writing on this sitcom is the crust left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scraped. Shame on everyone involved. There's a trend: big moviegoers who are no longer mercenaries are turning to TV - often with disastrous results (referring to CBS and NBC stinkaroos, however, ABC has a hit with "Boston Legal" ) and great nostalgic use Bill Shatner). Wasting Michael Rapaport in this scam "All In The Family" is an insult to viewers and especially to Michael himself.
