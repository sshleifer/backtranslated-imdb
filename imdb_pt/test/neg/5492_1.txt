I do not care about the strange art film. But when they are full of arcane symbolism and obscure dialogues and when it is obvious that they were made for the filmmaker's ego and not for the benefit of the viewer, I get upset. I'm not a stupid person, but I just did not understand what this movie was trying to say. Or do. Cinema is a magnificent form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it for obfuscation?
