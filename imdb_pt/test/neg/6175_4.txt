There are many different issues with the movie "KillShot". On the one hand, there are too many coincidences. The husband is a hunter and is only hunting on the day the main killer appears, with someone the killer knows. Okay, I'll get this one. The boy calls the real estate agency his wife works for and asks for the money to be ready when he comes to pick him up. Okay, I'll take this too. Before he fetched the money, he decided to rob our murderer, who does not kill him, but decided to go with him at work. It's starting to get very weak. Then they appear, the same day the husband has an interview with the wife's boss. There is no one but the wife and husband who decided to enter the empty office. They make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes they are talking to the right guy. That's only in the first 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this movie that I would like to talk about. Why the killer did not kill everyone at the real estate agency I do not know. Why did not he shoot the woman on his porch, I do not know. Why did he keep letting that stupid kid do all those jerky moves and mess a load of shit, I do not know. Because the girlfriend was in the movie, I do not know. Why he decided not to pockete the gun and leave it on the counter, I do not know. Why they entered the witness protection program, I do not know. What I do know is that the Casting Director did a great job, the Director of Photography did a very good job, the Location Scout chose great locations, and the Production Designer was worth every penny. So, my advice to anyone who chooses a script that is so well worked out by the team, make sure that any attempt to kill someone by the killer is not thwarted by a spike through an open window.
