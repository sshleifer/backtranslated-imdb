NBC should be ashamed. I would not let my children see it. I would definitely tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof of why NBC has always been a third-rate network. Producers, actors and writers should kneel and ask God's forgiveness for doing this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not parade on the deck of the ark. The ark had no deck. Lot was not even born when this event happened. Has anyone connected to this project tried to read the Bible? More than two animals of each type were taken. Read the story in Genesis. How could anyone bring this to any screen, small or large!
