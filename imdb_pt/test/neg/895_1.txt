I know it sounds crazy, but yeah, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated part 3, and then comes part 4. I was like, are you kidding me about it? Kid'n Play is nowhere in this movie, and it would have been nice if they had not titled the House Party 4 movie, as if it were any shape, form or fashion related to its predecessors. . Every time this movie comes late in the US, I shoot my TV with an Rifle. Frankly, it really is so atrocious. As the only remaining Kid 'n Play fan who will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), I was shocked. Remember that stupid kid from the Immature group? They went into House Party 3. Okay, fine and well, but as part 4 might be just about them and nothing else, and it also seems like they're not even the boys of part 3. * Confused! * House Party Fans: Do yourself a favor and follow House Parties 1 and 2 and the Class Act. Plus, the rest is ridiculous.
