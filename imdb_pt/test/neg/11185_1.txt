How do I describe the horrors? !!! First, a few points: first, this review should be taken with a little salt - I saw this more than 20 years ago, when I was a boy, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm giving some scenes and plot points. However, it does not have much plot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not like this kind of art film anyway. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by proto-author Luis Bunuel He was surrealistic and dadaist. These were modernist themes or popular critical movements in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was the art school that made things hyper-real, but often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by a baby - Dada, or father. <br /> <br /> Made in black and white, it was also made by a bunch of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of filmmakers and artists worked on various ideas and symbolic issues in Spain and France between the world wars. <br /> <br /> Dadaism and surrealism have influenced many artists. Police (Doo doo), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melted watches), and even Hitchcock (Psycho). Not Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember most about this movie: a girl finds a cow; his eyes are cut by a razor; men clownish cavort in a meadow. There is, as I said, a lot of a plot, but, again, this should be the point. <br /> <br /> That was attacked like porn at that time, and would be again today. One of the hallmarks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.
