I entered this movie with low expectations, knowing the legacy of Uwe Boll as a film director and screenwriter, and was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every movie in which he is involved in worse and worse. The general concept was not bad, a man bored with his life as stock broker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the movie is that there is no between them, it goes straight from the stockbroker to the serial killer. The film has no known actors, and I can see why, after watching the film, I do not see why any actor with a career would like to be involved in that film. Anyone who refused did a favor to their careers. And if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and do not do it. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony to 3 out of 10
