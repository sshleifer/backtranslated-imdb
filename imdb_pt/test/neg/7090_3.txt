"On a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a New Age update of the story of "Pygmalion" / "My beautiful lady": a teacher tries to turn an ordinary girl into a woman of high society. This time, however, instead of using language skills, the teacher tries to do this through hypnotism and past life regression. <br /> You know that a musical has problems when critics constantly mention scenarios and clothing before mentioning the plot and the music. Songs are instantly forgettable. (Do not "Take Me to the Church in time," I fear.) And the plot does not get anywhere. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is "there" here. The characters wander through history without ever going from point A to point B. Professor Chabot repeatedly states that he will get to the root of Daisy's problems, but never seems to do so. <br /> <br /> All meaningful conflict is avoided. For example, there comes a time when Chabot's university demands that he stop his research on reincarnation or renounce his position. There is conflict now! Will he give up his career for Daisy? There! Nothing comes from this development. One or two scenes later, the university changes its mind and tells Chabot to continue his work. So much for the conflict. <br /> <br /> The talent was certainly set for this film: Directed by Vincente Minnelli. Written in part by Alan Jay Lerner. A cast of Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And yes, yes, starring Barabara Striesand, who was almost at the top of his game at this point in his career. <br /> <br /> But everything falls flat. Lerner's attempt to reincarnate her greatest success, the aforementioned "My Fair Lady," is as doomed as Daisy's attempt to relive the greatness of her own past. <br /> <br /> If you like musical movies, there are far better choices than that.
