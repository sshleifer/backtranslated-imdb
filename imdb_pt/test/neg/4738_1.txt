AVP2 is a horrible movie. The dialogue was useless, the acting was pathetic, there was virtually no plot and you can not tell what the heck is happening in half the time due to continuity errors and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> BUT! You'll love it anyway. Because it pushes the boundaries of violence, death, destruction and chaos. They even kill children, newborns and unborn babies in this movie. You'll be sitting there thinking "Oh my God, this is disgusting" And they surprise you by killing the "sexy girl who always leaves alive" when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospital. It's like the movie industry said "We know what we did in the first Alien Vs. Predator movie was bad, so we're doing it again, but this time we're getting help from psychopaths with vivid imagination." predictable, stupid and meaningless right .... but you'll be thinking about it for a while after seeing it.
