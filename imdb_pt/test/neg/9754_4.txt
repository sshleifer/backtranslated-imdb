I was not really interested in seeing Step Up, but my friend kept bothering me to see this movie, especially because she's so in love with Channing Tatum, I constantly tease her about it, saying how that's the only reason she loved the film. But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance, I should love Step Up, huh, what the hell? I think all movies are somehow right. <br /> <br /> Well, do you know those movies I just mentioned? Dance Direct, Take It Up and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in the blender with a little love and that's what you got. Not to mention if you've seen these movies, well, frankly, you've seen the Step Up. Because Channing is low class with street smarts who just naturally feel the music while that snobby girl must follow step by step, as they go by themselves fall in love if they are so different? After all, this is your chance to "intensify" the passion, mystery and lust of dance! <br /> <br /> OK, that was a silly explanation for the plot, but like I said, since you've seen the movies I mentioned, or even if you just watched the plot, you watch the movie . I do not understand how it actually has a rating of 5.5, I bet they are those Channing lovers! I LAUGHED A LOT! I'm playing with you, but it's okay, I do not think I got what others did with passion, the mystery of dance! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you?! <br /> <br /> 4/10
