I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is something I have not done since - I've never slept in the movies. <br /> <br /> I LOVE the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. This may have been the problem, but I do not think so, because there were some bright spots that showed if done correctly, they could have made this movie work. <br /> <br /> Bette was being used and Anne was finished. used and confused. <br /> <br /> I do not know why English or anyone for that matter has let this come out in that condition. <br /> <br /> They announced it as a Sex in the City, but better? Not a chance I really enjoyed Sex in the City and I was disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br /> So do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this!
