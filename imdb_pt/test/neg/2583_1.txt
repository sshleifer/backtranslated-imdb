I saw this at Inter Toronto. Film Festival in September 2005. The description looked intriguing - how wrong I was! This could easily be the worst movie I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see the director is my age (n. 1948) and I lived with Velvet Underground Nico, which leads us to Andy Warhol, which coincidentally is what I thought while watching - Warhol's more than 24-hour films did not happen . This is not art, this is boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. Okay, maybe ... but what's the purpose here? Certainly they had color in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the captions were blank, of course. I do not think I missed much, but that left about 20% unreadable. <br /> <br /> Next, it is a pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events. What is the purpose of the conversation with the public? old man at the dinner table? Does not add anything to the movie. There were a lot of similar scenes - almost as if someone was picking up a camcorder and shooting random people and putting them together to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Plot? None. The "riot" consists of some figures from a distance, occasionally raising a stone from the screen. Primarily, it is an excruciating period of time to see people (at a distance!) Standing. The repetitive smoking of opium is just as boring as it is. When the main character won a cute girlfriend, I cheered up, but no, she was boring too! This is perhaps the only French movie I've seen where no one takes off their clothes. They were probably too bored to worry. <br /> <br /> Romance? None. The girl seems totally indifferent to everything - maybe her sculpture has some interest, but if that happens, it is not shown. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unpleasant. Maybe that's the reason for all this?
