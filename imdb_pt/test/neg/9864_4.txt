As long as you keep in mind that the production of this film was a copyright maneuver, and does not claim to be a serious release, it is really amazing how absolutely not horrible. I even liked the theme song. <br /> <br /> And if ever a movie called for a treatment done by Joel (or Mike) and the MST3K Bots, that's it! Watch this with a bunch of smart guys and you'll have fun. Have a beer, love some great pretzels, and have fun. <br /> <br /> Of course getting a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you're here in IMDb then you're probably more experienced enough to do it. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part ... where Dr. Doom informs the FF that they have 12 hours to fulfill their desires ... and he actually gestures the number "12" with his finger to do it ... it's like "Street of the Evil Sesame" .... hoo boy. <br /> <br /> ... and of course, Mrs. Storm declaring "Just look at you .. ..the Fanstastic Four" is so comforting .... you will laugh, you will cry ... So, if you love schlocky Sci-Fi, this is fantastic for you!
