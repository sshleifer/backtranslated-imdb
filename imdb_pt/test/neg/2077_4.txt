Carmen is a prostitute who lives seducing and robbing soldiers of the Spanish army; she is undoubtedly the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resists her charming attentions, she decides to do everything to destroy it. In the end, he falls into his web and he will be forced to do all the things he always hated just by being with Carmen. Although Paz Vega is very pretty, she does not look like a gypsy (as Carmen is) and neither her performance nor Sbaraglia's are good. The story is very boring and, at most times, is very absurd, although it pretends to appear true. Likewise, Scenarios and Special Effects, though they are not, are only acceptable and very artificial for a historical film. To summarize, boring and bad, with a very absurd development, there is much more things to watch.
