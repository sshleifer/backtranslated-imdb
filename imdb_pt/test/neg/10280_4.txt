I've always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a long time. I've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert, but for some reason (now quite clear), this movie is never shown on TV or I happen to miss it if it ever shows up. Well, after watching the DVD, now I know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. Actually, I'd say it's a mess. <br /> <br /> The ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was made by a director for the first time and shows. The film is mostly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing. More like a collection of short films randomly tied together. The movie can be reduced to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; introductory credits; cops going to work; crazy face story; police officer finds corpse; cop and boss and girlfriend at the bar; chase scene; The scenes simply do not flow together. They are very distinctively independent of one another and, because of this, the characterization is weak, amateur. The scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene on the farm with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the boss yelling at each other were dignified. I almost stopped the movie during these (terrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is evident throughout the film. The style, like the 70's, is all over the map. The credit entry scenario makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. So he tries to be a friend movie (Big John and Zipper) and then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; A movie does not have to have a specific style to succeed, but I fear that the style of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has been confusing. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateurish, his appearance is extremely (and deceptively) professional. The cinematography is impressive. Each painting is worthy of an exhibition in an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful appearance of the film lends more credibility to the end product than it really deserves. And thanks to the acting of Robert Blake (of a very poorly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, although nothing makes much sense. What is remarkable about the look and composition of the movie is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. The introductory credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was made 13 years later. Scenes of Johnny dressing, with their clothes on the bed, reminded me of the American Gigolo. Strange as it may sound, the ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very contemporary feel due to the impressive visuals, even if the history and philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated. <br /> <br /> So, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it has obviously influenced many future filmmakers when it comes to visual and composition. Very few films claim to have achieved this and the legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall deserves all the credit. But on the other hand, the EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because of the poor characters, the confused history and the confusing direction, and none of them is worth remembering.
