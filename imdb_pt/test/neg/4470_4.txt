Come on, put aside the high school humor we can find in racism and be honest ... not funny. I was shocked that the two main stars would agree to make a film that was so offensive and so damaging to race relations, and I'm not referring to the obvious black and white commentary in the film, but to other ethnicities like the Betty White characterizations of Hispanics. We should just agree with her agreeing to make this film as a sign of senility ... is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotyped trash? Or is it the writers' fault? How about the third makeup assistant? No, it's our fault for perpetuating this kind of crap (under the guise of comedy), that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say that enough is ... racism is real and not a laughing matter. We are all different, let's celebrate this diversity, not mock it and promote division.
