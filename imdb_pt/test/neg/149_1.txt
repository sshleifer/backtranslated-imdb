I just watched this "movie" and it really made me want to write my first comment about the movie, even though I've been a user for over 9 years. The reason I watched this, is because I like splatter movies and sometimes I like to test my limits and see what really still shocks me. First of all, the blood in this movie did not shock me, not even the idea that someone came up with it and did it in a movie - what really shocked me, is that there seems to be a market for that kind of crap. . do not get me wrong - I am against censorship, but this movie seems to me to have been made for some kind of fetish audience that seems to get along with this kind of thing. the same kind of disgust and guilt we feel after watching movies like "August underground". this movie is terrible to watch, but at least you get the impression that filmmakers want to show you how violence is disgusting. in the case of "niku daruma", it seems that it was done strictly to awaken people. I prefer movies that clash because they are well made and thought out like the movies of Gaspar Noe or Takashi Miike or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - these movies will stay with you for a while. this movie I will have forgotten by tomorrow, and the only thing that will stay with me, is the thought, that somewhere out there, there are people getting excited watching this shit. If you read this, please check up at the next hospital or shoot yourself - this obviously does not apply to race dogs who just love splashes. you're cool! Peace
