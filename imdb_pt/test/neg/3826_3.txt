Tim Curry was the reason I wanted to see this movie, and although, of course, his appearance is always fun, he's basically lost in it. The rest of the cast also does not do very well in this remake of a zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary. To quote a popular axiom, sometimes less is more.
