This was perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a very, very long time. Forget it's clear that no research was done on Detroit (forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha !!). The writing was horrible, the premise completely implausible and frankly the characters were embarrassing. I can not, for my life, understand why experienced actors would so embarrass themselves and participate in something so horrible. Now, I've never seen the original and do not know if this movie pays homage to its original form. It is my understanding that the original was not defined in Detroit. Why would they stray from this without researching details about the setting, just telling me that it was more than the cast that was trying to pay the rent. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this junk, unless you're from Detroit and crave some comic relief.
