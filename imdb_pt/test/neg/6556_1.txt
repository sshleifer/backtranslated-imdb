Especially if you love horrible movies. When I started watching him, all I could say was "I hope there's a dance sequence." Imagine my joy when not only the two main characters danced, but the main ghost also began to dance break. And on top of that, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). It makes me a little sad that he got broken because of this movie but I never really liked him as an actor and he really should have known better. Not even the director would take credit for this movie (and you should check out some of the other movies he directed!). <br /> <br /> A note of caution, however, the writer seemed to enjoy jokes about the movie a lot. male lower regions. For example, one of the characters discovers a book called "Groins of the Darker Species". I'm not kidding. And that, to me, is the most disturbing part of the movie. Also, find the most obscure video store in your city, make the movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
