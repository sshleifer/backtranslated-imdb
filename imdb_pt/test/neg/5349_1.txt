Regardless of whether the prevailing social message of this film - of which vigilant justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I was more insulted by McConaughey's final statement. In a court drama, the closing statement of the defense lawyer is basically the crux of the film, and when the matter is as difficult to resolve as this, the statement is actually being delivered to the public as well as to the jury. This basically implies that the audience considers rape of a white girl a crime more horrible than the rape of a black girl. I at least find it very insulting. For the rest, I found the acting reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self (does not work in a court drama), but what is the point at which the movie's message is as bad as it is? like this. Tell him that the guards' justice is good and accuses him of racism if he disagrees.
