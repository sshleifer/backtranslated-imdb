If you've been to Eastern Europe (or even in your military), you may find this film interesting. I do not know why it's called comedy (of course, there are some funny moments), but it's not a good movie if one of the official speakers speaks for 15 minutes about the achievements of socialism at a Christmas dinner, and officers generally act like funny imbeciles, the soldiers are running from the base to meet their girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the commander's daughter. The East German army was known for its abusive and humiliating service from its recruited men, and the comedy was basically not filmed on the premises or with the equipment to make a good film from the East German army and its time is now gone. Despite this, some of the actors and actresses tried to act well, but only appeared in the roles that are known from East German TV and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically annoying and very cheap.
