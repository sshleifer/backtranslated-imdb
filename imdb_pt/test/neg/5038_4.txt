Not only is The Great Rock N Roll Swindle completely inaccurate, but when it comes to that, it's not very interesting or even fun. Malcolm McLaren apparently wasted most of the Sex Pistols' earnings on this film waste, which makes it much more unpleasant. The intention from the outset was to create a monument to the "genius" of McLaren, who to this day takes all the credit for creating punk music, creating the Sex Pistols and sometimes even writing all the songs. Viewers follow McLaren to various configurations, where he tells his story to his partner, a dwarf female, and simply takes credit for one thing after another. A particularly annoying scene has McLaren in an abandoned hangar, waiting for a plane, being chased by reporters and giving them their "great story." The most entertaining elements of the movie are the lively short pieces, yet even the smell of McLaren's self-important arrogance. <br /> <br /> Even as a farce, this movie does not work. Little about this is fun except Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type person. 20 years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the documentary Sex Pistols "The Filth and the Fury". While this movie is much better and more interesting than "Swindle," it's still full of Temple's "artistic flourishes" that just do not work, like interviewing band members in the shadows as if they were some kind of witness trying to hide their identity. An interesting curiosity: film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original screenwriters in the movie "Who Killed Bambi?" Which eventually became "Swindle."
