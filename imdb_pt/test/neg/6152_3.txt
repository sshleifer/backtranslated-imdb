The film has so much potential that it was not developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance and Bill Paxton as well. The scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are perfect. The problem with this movie is that the story is underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. The film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. I give him 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.
