Now I've seen two movies from director Chen Kaige, a very good (Goodbye my concubine), and that bad, The Killer. Both films depict crucial events in Chinese history, the FMC in the twentieth century and the first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the third century BC. FMC succeds with memorable characters, gorgeous cinematography, compelling sets, good acting and an interesting story. The Assassin fails on almost every level (ok, sets are great, cinematography is good, and the few battle scenes are pretty exciting). But ... the pathos. Call me cynical, but a lot is too much. If you felt that Private Ryan's Rescue was very pathetic, stay tuned, this will make you sick. Dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem political, subtle or funny statements this photo is not. The film is dominated by its own pomp. I'm really surprised that the Killer gets such high votes here at imdb. 4/10
