This lame sound film from Harold Lloyd does not laugh much of him, and makes us wonder if this Lloyd is the same that made all those charming and hilarious silences. <br /> <br /> Lloyd's youthful sympathy becomes delicate and soft. when we can hear him speak, and a slow, restrained rhythm replaces the silly antics of his silences. Lloyd plays a young son of a missionary who grows in China and then finds himself transplanted to the contemporary city of New York with no idea how life works outside his Chinese village. He considers himself an unlikely winner in an election for mayor and quickly attracts the ire of all government organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of unbridled corruption. When he is framed in an attempt to overthrow him, he decides to play as dirty as all the others, and enacts a fake execution of each villain in New York as a tactic of fear. This darkly satirical ending seems out of place alongside the rest of the film, but it is the only part of the movie that comes remotely to life. Everything else is boring. <br /> <br /> I do not like to admit that a Harold Lloyd movie fails, because I really like it, but I have no choice with it. Grade: D
