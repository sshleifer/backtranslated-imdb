You could have put the characters on the island for some reason and have the same movie. The first one had an original story, the second stole one from King Kong and, at the end (hopefully) of this trilogy, the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. That was all there was to it. The special effects were decent, but not worth $ 8. If you have a discounted theater in your local area, wait and see for a buck. I would not even bother renting it. That would be a lot of money for this unreal thriller.
