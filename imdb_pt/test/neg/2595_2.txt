Have you seen one of these shows that has become so popular that it could do away with any crude nonsense and repetitive and unenthusiastic tricks that creators can get away with? If you did not see it then you never saw Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show seem to think of it as witty, edgy and poignant. It's nothing like that, it's boring, repetitive, insulting and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The "mood" of the series comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Foolishness irrelevant. The show often has flashbacks of things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and pointless. And then there are the random movie references in which the characters show a scene from a popular movie without effectively parodying it. . . or parody on everything (WHAT'S NOT FUN !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) the same crap that is in every episode of the show. The guy is a sexual deviant with DST, AHA HA! Is not that funny?! Hey, you know what's funny? Making the same joke about it anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode. And do not say this multiple times in a single episode, make sure you drag it out, so that an entire scene is dedicated just to tell the only joke. Now imagine also that this same routine is used repeatedly for practically all the characters of the whole series. The unusual humor of "un-PC" is not as "non-PC" as it would be You believe, mostly they just tell you what idiots think about the latest headlines from newspapers, politicians and random celebrities. <br /> <br /> The series has had its moments, but now I think it's time to take the show off the air and end it. <br /> <br /> You know what's funny? I still like it more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind.
