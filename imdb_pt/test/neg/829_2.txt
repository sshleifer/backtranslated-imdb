When I went to see this movie, let's not say I had high expectations. But merely that I had little hope that this feature would have at least some of the hilarity and humor of "Da Ali G Show" on TV. <br /> <br /> But as you might expect, this can not be translated from a half-hour program into a 90-minute movie. The film had no appeal, and resorted entirely to the sexual humor of children and youth. Basically, I should have abandoned him halfway, but I was foolish enough to think it could somehow improve until the end, how wrong I was. I loved the show, but I hated the movie. This movie is only for those who find fellatio by fun canines ...
