But I can not say how I really feel about this stack of steaming dung. Where to start. The quality of the film, there are none. I've seen sharper pictures in America's Most Intelligent Videos! The acting is inferior, the bloody effects are fine. The clown mask is the best part of this film, the story is repetitive. The same thing over and over again. At least on a Friday, August 13, or HALLOWEEN, we get a main character for the most part. There are no main characters, only victims. Dude, now we get to the worst part of everything. The final survivor kills the clown and discovers that he was one of his friends. So when the police finally arrive, they do not believe her and she's locked in a rubber room. What kind of ending you call that shit, that's it. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, which was just a sloppy writing. The excuse: "It has to end badly, it's a horror movie." or "We need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequence" are just ragged excuses and that's all. I should give CAMP BLOOD a Thanksgiving TURKEY.
