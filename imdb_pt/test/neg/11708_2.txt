I realize that a period piece is expensive to do, and that this style of footage (close-shot camera shots, moving camera, large aperture shots, faded) allows these movies to be made for a price. As a style, it has advantages and disadvantages like any other, it allows more period pieces to be made. As any style has its detractors and supporters - there are probably even those who believe that this type of footage has an artistic basis. <br /> <br /> If only part of the money saved, could have been spent on the script for any style used, a film needs good writing and good acting. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is very good. The least written. It consists of a collection of fragments extracted from the book and much of what is relevant to the plot is left out by making a disjointed collection of scenes with little or no continuity. <br /> <br /> If you read the book, under no circumstances watch it. If you have not read the book, you are easily satisfied and have nothing better to do, it is okay to watch it, but be prepared to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> It could have been so much better.
