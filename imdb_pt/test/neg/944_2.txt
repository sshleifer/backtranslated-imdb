Seriously, I do not understand how Justin Long is becoming more and more popular. He either has the best agent in Hollywood, or recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch on the screen, he has little or no charisma, and terrible comic timing. The only movie he tried to anchor that I liked remotely was Waiting ... and this is almost exclusively because I worked in a restaurant. But I digress. In addition to his terrible leadership, this movie has many other debts. I understand it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that does not mean it has to insult our intelligence completely, and have such an incredibly banal writing that borders the offense. The considerable talent of Lewis Black is also wasted here, since he is more incendiary when he has no restrictions, which the classification of the PG-13 certainly does not allow. The only bright spot in the movie was Jonah Hill (which will seem almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight it lost in the meantime). Their linings were funny at times, but they certainly were not enough to make it anything near bearable. If you just want to completely turn off your brain (or better yet, do not have one) then maybe you'll enjoy this but I can not recommend it at all.
