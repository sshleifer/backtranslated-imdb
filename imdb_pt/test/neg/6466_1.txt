Ladies and Gentlemen, may we present the worst of all Disney remakes. Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it should be "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". The cat did not have really good scenes, the character of Ricci was more boring than funny, Doug E. Doug did not have good lines, nor the role of Dean Jones could save this movie! The only really good characters were the only two mechanics in town, but their scenes were brief. All in all, I'd say if you're thinking of watching this movie, look for something smarter like a Barney video.
