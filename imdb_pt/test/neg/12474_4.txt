One of the first things I realized that allowed this culture to stand out among the others was during the funeral in place of Sole. An aerial shot is used to show Sole being flowered with kisses by a sea of ​​women. I believed this was a comment about the women's closeness to each other in that culture-those who have come together through generations, separations and misunderstandings, yet being able to bond and trust each other. In addition, the film seemed to glorify women as almost perfect individuals. What I mean by flawless is that they did not suffer the consequences of their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is soon after Paula accidentally killed her father. His mother immediately comes to his aid and takes full responsibility for the act, while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she did. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or granddaughter) had the opportunity to reunite with her supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stress that this has probably caused in their family, each one of them still hugs the mother without caring what she did, that is, killing her husband and her lover. In this light, women are portrayed as those who not only love each other independently of character acts, but also those who do not seem at all bothered by the acts their friends / family perform. Another idea that I found intriguing of this culture was in relation to the idea of ​​the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Sole's mother and their inexplicable return, the director builds the public's emotions to believe that this film will incorporate the supernatural. The people portrayed in this culture seem very supernatural, that is, very anxious to believe that life exists beyond the grave. His aunt, long-time friend Augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha believe rumors of the dead return to family members to end the "unfinished business." I believed that this was a mixed reflection of the religious faith of culture (predominantly Catholic), as well as its need to make peace with those who had no chance of being forgiven during mortality. Their belief in the "living" dead was also to give hope to the needy circumstances they suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not supernatural, it is interesting to note the role that the mother continues to play. It is treated as if it were still a ghost (ie, hidden in small cracks (under the bed or inside a trunk of a car)). I believe the director portrayed his mother in that way to augment the existing supernatural beliefs that the city had adopted. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the old belief of the city in the afterlife.
