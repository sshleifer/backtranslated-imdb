There are movies that are not released in theaters, but in videos. This should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way old nitrate film stocks do. No story, inept violence, about acting, poorly written and sad is that the star was not the only bad part in the movie. And I enjoyed and enjoyed some of Siegel's other films.
