I recently watched Ed Wood Jr.'s autobiographical movie, Glen or Glenda, for the first time after hearing so much about it for so many years. Nothing I have read or heard about this movie could prepare me for what I saw. This has to be the most bizarre movie ever made. Stamping out the buffalo, women enslaved, Satan prancing around and Bela Lugosi, wandering just as she can, "Bevare, Bevare ... pull the rope, pull the rope ..." was totally insane. The acting was atrocious and the dialogue was intentionally hilarious, just what you'd expect from an Ed Wood movie. Having said all that, no matter how horrible that movie was, I have to give Wood credit ... he was way ahead of his time. You have to remember that when this movie was made travestis were not even discussed in public, let alone the subject for a movie. I read that Wood was a transvestite in real life, and I'm sure that this movie was based on her own experiences. It was sad to see Bela Lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this movie but it was kind of like Ed Wood Jr. to at least give Lugosi an acting job at a time in Bella's life when he did not have a penny and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood would hire him. If you've never seen this movie then you have to see it, especially if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
