This is another film I missed on Italian TV as a child: notable for its aging star quintet, most of whom had never made a horror movie in their lifetime (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Houseman and Patricia Neal) deals with the long-ago hidden crime of men coming back to haunt them. She takes the form of a dead ghost for the girl they all loved (Alice Krige), but whom they were forced to undo after an unfortunate incident when she humbled their egos! Fairbanks, who was responsible for the action, has twin sons (Craig Wasson) and Krige also takes revenge on them. Soon one of the latter, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman end up dead. So the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to confront the ghost at the crime scene where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister homeless people who somehow make Krige's bid! I was anxious to see these veterans on their last legs (Douglas died before the movie even debuted, however, he had already completed another role, while proving Astaire's inauspicious swan song), but GHOST STORY also went through that. a lot of mood swings - while they keep a slow pace everywhere and emerge too much - are anything but a failed curiosity. Having sex dollops (including Wasson's full frontal nudity!) And macabre makeup effects have ruined even more waters and ruined the old-fashioned elegance inherent in Jack Cardiff's (another long-standing noteworthy) cinematography.
