It's good movie if it would be done by high school kids to your friends. It is below the limits to be called "professional". There is no plot, no set of actors and visual looks like you see through the plastic film. I was so happy that I have FF button on my remote, 32x worked very well. I understand that everyone needs to start somewhere, but there should be no reason to bring it to the public. If you have concerns about quality and budget - "Open Water" was made at $ 60,000 and more than half went to the guy who provided safety in the ocean and trained the sharks. And this movie looks 100 times more professional and was an indy movie event.
