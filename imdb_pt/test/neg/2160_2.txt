Back in the cold and chilling early 90s, a show called "Family Matters" aired and became an instant classic. The trick was to buy a manual in standard family situations and their solutions and insert some attempts to make sarcastic comments on it. a small, lovely steal is wrong, the parents are right. So that worked out well, so Bickley-Warren had a new ambitious plan: to do exactly the same show again. <br /> <br /> Here's the difference: "Family Matters" had Urkel. "Step By Step" has the face of those "Kickboxer" - sequels no one has seen. He says things like "dudette" and "the Dane-meister", and somehow the public still should not hate him. I mean seriously "dudette"? How can you even pass it by your lips? The rest of the people were mostly white versions of the whole Winslow-bunch, combined with some more or less null characters, like the idiot guy (JT. Well, Eddie), the smart girl ( Laura), and a beautiful girl who spends her beautiful days (in theory). The development of the character was horrible in this show. Grover and the Cookie Monster have more depth than the Lambert family. Everyone just milked their stereotypes for what they were worth. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> Driven by a huge tape of laughter and joy stolen from something funny, this show aired for 7 years, which was humiliating for the competition. I have to note that this is the time when family serials were pretty much all big hits, everyone just ignored the crap because, well, it was the 90s, another show of shit did not hurt.
