"Embarassing" is the only word to describe this laughing and horrible production. From the blatant disregard of the source material (certainly to infuriate anyone remotely familiar with mythology) to the predictably inadequate production value, this whole miniseries is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> The cast (which includes some good actors, to whom I'm sorry) convey the illogical dialogue with the same generic "European" accent so common to bad epics. Worse yet is the lack of originality in almost every other aspect, from costumes and scenography (blurring of styles of time and space) to score (which seems to mimic many recognizable classical songs, as well as "The Lord of the Rings"). . The most offensive of all are the visual effects, which, alone, prove that, if you can not afford them, WRITE them. <br /> <br /> I fumbled to see another legendary tale, bastard "cheap" adaptation. Maybe someday someone will do it right.
