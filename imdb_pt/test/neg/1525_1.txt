No one cares to see where this mud comes from before they talk about their supposed revelations? Ask yourself a question: is my skull an open bucket that I allow someone to pour out your advertisement? Do yourself a favor and take a look at the mentality of pathtofreedom.com before wasting your time with this desk. <br /> <br /> This kind of urban fruit cake from Mother Earth / Berkeley People's Republic that openly disregards a way of life just because it does not match theirs must believe that their case fails miserably in facts and objectivity. If not, why resort to intentional distortion and flagrant unilateralism? Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Do not be a sap. Spend two seconds and take a skeptical look before falling for even more "end of the world" hysteria from the types that take a village with a political agenda that is probably on your left. Mi. Moore (in fact, his thoughtless followers) actually opened the floodgates with this kind of unilateral political junk past as a * cough * documentary. But apparently they understand the feeling of an always naive audience: "If it's on a movie screen, it must be true." <br /> <br /> God gave you a brain - act like you know what you should do with it ...
