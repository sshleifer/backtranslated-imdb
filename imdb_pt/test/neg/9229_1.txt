Yes, it's me again! Mr. 'I sit through crap so you do not have to.' <br /> <br /> What do you think it is about this? Could it be about a woman who would call a sex line and arrange a meeting with singles in an isolated area? So your transvestite boyfriend shows up and cuts his throat with a razor before he leaves with his money? Wow, guess what! And if I tell you that the cop who's in charge of the case is forced to join a sexy prosecutor's assistant to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you reach? Do you think the sexy DA will disguise herself in a fragile red dress to try to find the drag queen, but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the independent officer? (who already delivered his gun and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie bored me with tears. Why do people insist on doing this kind of garbage? It is a waste of our time, its time and yet they continue regardless .. filming a movie that no one gives a damn. If it has some redeeming feature, there is the fact that it has some of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen in a movie for a while. I hope they have spent the meager wages they have gained in plenty of botox and colon irrigation. They would look good on the cover of Vogue, or perched atop a bikini car. They should stop acting for the pros (like Shannon Tweed). Talking about future careers, I met the director the other day. He certainly prepares a tasty meal of chicken burger. I must also say that the uniform really suits him. I asked him about 'Party Line', and his eyes went to the floor before he murmured something about extra fries. Well, I guess it did not work. No matter, they're letting him take the drive-thru tomorrow !! Alive! 1/10
