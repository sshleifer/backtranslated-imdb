If you make a thriller, it's important that the "villain" is no more sympathetic than the "victim." And that fails miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to see that I was really moved to register and comment. Okay, so the husband is rich and convinced. There are worse vices, and the boy and the wife of the hut exhibit a great deal. The husband is an idiot because he did not approve of the kid cabin hitting that woman physically - the witch who had absolutely nothing to do with the BTW plot. The boy hut threatens her husband and tries several times to seduce his wife. He then forces himself against her - which the woman finds so hot that she stops thinking of rape and begins to think she wants him. Uh huh. The misogynist and inferiority complex thoughts that the director exhibits are simply revolting. It's one thing when a good movie like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to identify with the villain, but on Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy, but the director did not make him unpleasant and made us hate its victims. What was he thinking?
