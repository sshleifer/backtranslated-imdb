"Death Wish 3" is the cinematic equivalent of a shooting gallery. All characters (except for Paul Kersey of Bronson, of course) exist only to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the villains). The director simply pours on senseless violence (people even burn themselves alive and exploded), turning it into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothered to protect himself from enemy gunfire). Fans of this short thing (and apparently there are many) will enjoy it, others ... be careful. (* 1/2)
