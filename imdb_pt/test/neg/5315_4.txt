In 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a film that ended many of the best critics of the lists by the time the abstracts of the year were being printed in entertainment publications. The film was Get Shorty and gave the star John Travolta his second major success in so many years after Pulp Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi lens. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on the wise Chili Palmer (Travolta) and his attempts to get into the movie business. I, for example, was completely captured by the various characters and by the clear dialogue of the original. So much so that when I knew there would be a sequel, I seemed not to accept my usual tremors that happen when a studio tries to redo what was a good idea ten years later. The sequence, also based on a novel by Leonard, is this time directed by F. Gary Gray, who is Italian Job in 2003 was one of the highest grossing films of the year. Add this to the cast now expanding to include Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric, the Artist, The Rock, Vince Vaughn and James Woods and you have all the ingredients of a great continuity in the exploits of one of the most interesting characters of the 90s . This time we got Chili (Travolta), who is leaving the movie business after being disappointed with both himself and the industry for having participated in the sequel to his first hit movie. Thanks in part to his friend Tommy Athens (Woods) and the misfortune of his death, Chili decides to investigate the lucrative and dangerous music industry. This first leads to the famed Viper club, where Chili meets singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who, as the leader of a beginning trio, can sing songs like Whitney Houston (ie Whitney before Bobby Brown starts bringing small packets of sugar). Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn), who, with her overly-looking gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plans to make sure Linda meets the final five years of her contract, even if it means putting Chili on the ice. So with Linda's future in the balance, Chili creates an interesting web that will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer (Cedric), the Russian mafia, police, Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler and lots of rage. pointing out. Woo-Wheee! That sounds exciting. So why not? Be Cool tries very hard, well, be cool. But the result is a film that, unlike the original, has neither heart nor soul. Be Cool looks like it was directed by a Saturday Night Live producer as there are individual scenes or sketches that do not fit into an entire movie. Take, for example, the scene in which Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, while the Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced and should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead, it is coupled between two other unnecessary chapters that do nothing to push the story forward with any real momentum. The Aerosmith show and The Rock trip to a boot store are also great examples of individual moments that are not very similar when put together. But those are not the only problems with the sequel - it could probably be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2-Way and Diet Pepsi's that seem to look at you with more intensity than the serious look of Chili. The story contains practically every conceivable stereotype and each has enough screen time to become a bit offensive or embarrassing. Whether it's the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy who has a poster of Sylvester Stallone's Strass movie on the wall, no character is above us offering anything we have not seen many times before and in much better movies. With the magic almost gone from the first film, we end up with a lower product that is the second movie in the last six months (Ocean 13 being the other) that sticks a lot of stars into a marquee just to end up like a movie. film that no actor would bring to an open audition. Be Cool was a big disappointment. I really wanted it to be the Get Shorty of the new millennium and I ended up with a movie in which the outlets should have been a gas, but the experience left me with an unpleasant smell.
