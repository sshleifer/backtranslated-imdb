This entry does not contain a spoiler. No need. The film is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the early Alien films was the suspense that something could happen. This was so in the first two Predator movies, although less prevalent. Requiem completely removed the suspense element and replaced it with blood and blood. You know people will die (well, duh, it's an AvsP movie), but you know WHO will die and WHEN they will die, and WHERE they will die before it happens. The directors should take a lesson from Hitchcock, who said, "Suspense is not a time bomb exploding under a table. Suspense is a bomb that DOES NOT go under the table." What's the point of going to the movies when you know exactly what will happen and when? If you really want to watch this movie, wait until it is released on video and then RENT it, but I will never buy it.
