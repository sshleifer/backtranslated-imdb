You have to watch this movie! It's so bad that it's really great. <br /> <br /> You have your crazy but brave captain, who, of course, is having an affair with his worn copulator. And of course, the air collision occurs when the enemy of the captain and his rivals along the ride to the accident. You have your ex-veterinarian from Vietnam who can not handle the pressure of another crash and forced landing. So you have your old crazy colleague from the Army Air Corps who is flying in the plane of the chase and trying well, I can not tell you what he's trying to do. The plane keeps going up, going up and down well and then you have your greedy and immoral corporate engineer and then you have your Cold Ice Station Zebra and then Lucky saves the thug of drowing so they can land the plane! AND IT DOES NOT END --- JUST GO ON AND ON! You have to watch this. It's great! YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING! In fact, they have shown this on commercial television and as this has already been shown on cable.
