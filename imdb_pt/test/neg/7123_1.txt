Grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me wish there were more synonyms for "terrible" in the English language. With a plot full of more holes than a net of trawlers, this film can not make a compulsive fan-view of even the most futile films I am. I felt compelled to stay in the movies until I extracted from him Â£ 5.70p of entertainment, although I was afraid to be there for a few years. A better movie could be made from the release of the first part of The Grudge, although I'm not sure that this is not the result of such an exercise. As expected, what passes for a plot in this terrible example of wasted celluloid ends without any resolution, leaving producers with the option of inflicting "Scream 3" on the public when it comes time to feel another twinge of true hatred for civilization.
