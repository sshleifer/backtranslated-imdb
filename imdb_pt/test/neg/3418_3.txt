Geoffrey Wright, director of "Romper Stomper," transplants Shakespeare's "Macbeth" in the criminal underworld of Melbourne, Australia. The result is a semi-horrible piece of cinema. Sam Worthington is Macbeth, and he walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. Victoria Hill, who wrote the script with Wright, is Lady Macbeth, and she's neither awful nor good. Lachy Hulme, who plays McDuff, is the only cast member to exude any kind of authority. The rest, including Gary Sweet, is wasted and misdirected. Shot in HD by the late Will Gibson, the look of the film has no character. Everything is very clean and very deliberately lit. Wright's direction is not inspired to the extreme and the sequences of action are confusing and inept. Wrongly marketed as "Australia's most violent film of all time," the film is violent at times and fairly bloody, but fails to provide a single moment of impact. Moving slowly and terribly pretentious, this nth silver version of the classic piece is the embodiment of a wrong head.
