his has certainly been one of the worst gay-themed films of all time. Who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures so exaggerated that they defy reality. A nightclub scene with just one actor and nicknamed the crowd scenes. After seeing other low budget movies in the same way I was prepared for something innovative - but not pathetic simple. <br /> <br /> Parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to do such guts. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - No access to the menu; is worse than a VHS tape. Once you get started, you have to watch the whole thing - fortunately, the fast forward button works - with this movie and DVD, nothing else happens.
