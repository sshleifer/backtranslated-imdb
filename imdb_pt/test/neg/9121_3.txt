I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul that I considered the best movie about rock n 'roll, besides being the best teen movie I've ever seen. The first film spawned the careers of George Lucas, who would later make the epic "Star Wars" before making the prequels two decades later, while making Richard Dreyfuss a star in Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Degree and other films. <br /> <br /> Somehow, without these two, the magic died. "More American Graffiti" shows the public what happened to the rest of the characters later in the 1960s when Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) are protesting the Vietnam War while his friend Terry "The Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is at war and trying to leave. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still the racing driver in California, where he never left home. The rest of the supporting actors in Candy Clark's Debbie (Terry's Girlfriend), the members of the Pharaoh gang, along with Harrison Ford and others, really do not do much. The original movie showed teenagers cruising the streets without any bloodshed with Buddy Holly's rock n 'roll music, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and Comets, Buddy Knox and others who brought back nostalgia for music classical. The "More American Graffiti" soundtrack is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie and anything that fits into the climate during the late 60's of protests, drugs, sacrifices and more. After watching "More American Graffiti" it looked like he wanted to show audience members what happened after the epilogue to the title of the four main characters in the first film (with the exception of Dreyfuss's character), where he did not was necessary. This film was not necessary because I was happy to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss moved into bigger and better projects.
