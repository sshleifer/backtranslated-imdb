Is it possible that a movie is worse than that? There are a lot of monkeys wandering, muttering b ******, acting supposedly silly and we should laugh? There is no plot here to keep you in the first place. Even when women finally appear, there is no sign of improvement; the most anticipated things happen and when the movie is over, you may be sleeping. Beware: this is not a useless cult movie, this is crap -period! I can not believe there's even a sequel to it! <br /> <br /> 1
