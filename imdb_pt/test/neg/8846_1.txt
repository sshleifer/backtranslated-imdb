Forget the bad acting, which can be forgiven in this type of film. Or even the terrible and unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles really reflected what was said). Much worse is the glaring absence of a skilled or experienced director who may have taken a vacation with the editor while the film was being produced? Watching the movie, it seems completely outdated, despite being 'only' made 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? I laughed a lot? A dial-up internet connection? Clucky phantom photoshopped images ("Hey! Look there ... is that ... is that a face?" -Marrompe in the face -Oops, the sound breaks -chop- -the next scene-), scenes and sequences are evil edited and as a result do not flow at all. You'll be watching a girl who finds a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later, seeing her again somewhere seemingly unaffected, smiling and walking. <br /> <br /> In addition to the many problems I have with the film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and therefore totally annoying. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Shutter', a well-done Oriental (Thai) horror film.
