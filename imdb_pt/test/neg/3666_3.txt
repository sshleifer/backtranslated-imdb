Darkness Reality is a Saw-like movie that is a bit decrepit. While the plot and story are good, there is a bit of unnecessary nudity too. While I feel that the film was technically well done, the acting was uneven, it was just a little too dark for my mood while I was watching. It basically says there are a lot of missing people out there who will never be found and maybe being tortured by whackos patients. I feel that some information about the captors and their reasons for being so ill would have helped some. It came like a snuff movie, made just for violent content. If you like to see women beaten, tortured and dead, then this is for you. If you are looking for something a little literal and more expressive and grounded, skip this one.
