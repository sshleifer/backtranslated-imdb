As someone who loves movies that appeal to assorted intellectuals as well as those who simply tell stories, this movie should be appealing. But as written and directed by Catherine Breillat, who seems to be playing her own puzzles in filmmaking experiences, this tedious, talismanic film is not of interest. <br /> <br /> The main character Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is the screen of Breillat, a frustrated director in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors (Gr√©goire Colin is The Actor and Roxane Mesquida is actress). The "comic" part is that Jeanne is imposing the use of a vibrator tied up in the actor so that she brings the sex scene to reality, but even this joke goes away quickly and we get a movie inside a movie that looks more like a 'Deleted Scenes' featurette on a DVD than a solid French comedy with class.
