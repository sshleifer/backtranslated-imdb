When Jim Wynorski announced for the first time that he would make a new follow-up to my all-time favorite series, the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, I was in a trance. I've been waiting for a new installment for literally years. Then the production began and very small pieces in the filming and the involved actors were released until the end of the filming. Then the announcement of a title change. This new sequel would no longer be titled "Slumber Party IV Massacre", but "Cheerleader Massacre". I was a bit disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a movie that I had been waiting for so long to happen. I was still extremely intrigued and in the limit of my place to see it. <br /> <br /> Maybe a month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers, who were able to see the film. months before its release date. Some reviews have leaked on the internet and, judging by them, I started to be apprehensive about Jim Wynorski's "Cheerleader Massacre." <br /> <br /> Tonight, I was able to see the movie for the first time in its entirety. I'm still scratching my head. As I read in another review, "Cheerleader Massacre" is definitely not a new installment of the "Slumber Party Massacre" series, but a slasher movie by itself. And a bad thing about it. <br /> <br /> Before going into the details of the movie, let me first say that I am a huge fan of the Jim Wynorski movies that I am. I always thought he was a true camp genius, with a winner almost every time. Yes, your movies are made with tight budgets and do not contain the best acting, but they are fun anyway. They are what they are: exotic movies that you watch when you want to have fun. From "Sorority House Massacre II" to "Hard to Die," through "Chopping Mall," Jim produced the products on more than one occasion. One of the reasons I was excited that this movie would be his latest project. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" does not (in my opinion) reflect any of the films that I had seen this director / writer create in the past. First, the production was extremely cheap and the film was filmed on video, something I had never seen Jim do before. The actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost laughable. The killer is also extremely stupid and remembers his old grandfather rather than a lunatic fugitive. <br /> <br /> Of course the movie is full of female nudity. This is a Jim Wynorski movie we're talking about, folks. But some of the boob shots seen here almost seem to have been made for some time. There is an extremely long shower scene, containing the cheerleader, which seems to last forever and reflects a lot of the shower scene in Jim Sorority House Massacre II. The girl still bathes in much the same way. <br /> <br /> "Cheerleader Massacre" is also extremely clich√©, to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in hundreds of previous horror films. A guy and a girl kissing, about to consummate their relationship when ... you guessed it. They are cut into pieces. <br /> <br /> Brinke Stevens, who I never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place, also gives one of her stiffest and most forced performances in her small special turnout. We are talking about possible tips here. She recalls a few incidents that her character has suffered with the killer seen here for twenty years for the police while filming the original "Killer Party Massacre" ring. Why were the footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new "SPM"? I have no idea. There are also two explosions seen in this movie that I'm pretty sure have been recycled from other movies. <br /> <br /> This film not only recycles movies from past movies but also recycles scores from other movies as well. . Some of the songs used in "Humanoids from the Deep" (which was also recycled before "The Coroner") can be heard throughout the film. There are at least two more also that I can not identify, but I'm sure they've been used before. <br /> <br /> After going through the horrible performance of the movie, ridiculous story, nonexistent blood / special effects and camcorder. Like quality, I'm having some serious concerns about Mr. Wynorski. The man who charmed the audience with movies in the past has finally lost his niche? Only time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget your newest movie. A new installment in the films "Sorority House Massacre", now entitled "Final Exam". I think I'm seeing a pattern here ...
