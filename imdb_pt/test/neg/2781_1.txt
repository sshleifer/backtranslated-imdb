Another stupid "movie." Image quality is correct. Sound also. Music is mean. The guy tries to make music like on Halloween. <br /> <br /> On a rare occasion, producer / director chooses non-anorexic girls. It's because this "movie" takes a week and costs $ 10,000. Does this mean that when the producer has money, he chooses all anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But the girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not good actresses. Not guys either. But maybe it's just because the "story" of this "movie" has no value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we give $ 10,000 to some teens who like movies, and they can create a better movie. <Br /> <br /> Do not waste your time to watch this "thing".
