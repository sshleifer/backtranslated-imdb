I'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but I found it very comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener will fix it. Part exorcism and part novel, you will at least give some laughs. There's the jealous paranoid, the satanic sister, the mother of Valley of the Dolls and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the chasing priest priest fight against the demons of the beloved Isobel. Sometimes it looked like an episode of Jerry Springer, but I actually paid to see it. Instead of the cool head, sailor and crucifix Regan did in The Exorcist; you have a lot of Isobel jumping on the bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in your closet and jumping out of a hay loft. Yeah, it's Chuck E. Cheese went crazy. So if you want to watch a quote from a horror movie worth a few laughs while you wait for the foreseeable end ... this is your movie.
