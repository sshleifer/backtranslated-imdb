This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this movie? A gang of Americans enters Nazi-occupied France and begins killing Germans. You see them scalping their enemies and beating them to death with baseball cleats. While making jokes, of course. <br /> <br /> Some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre. For a parody, it's not clever or funny. Content is zero. It is exceptionally brutal and disgusting. Underneath, there is a subtle political message, because it is again "the good guys" killing "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable if you turn around. Could you imagine a plot where the Nazis (while making jokes) kill everyone in the Warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers? Probably not, but this movie is exactly about it, with the exception that it meets the strange moral expectations of a particular audience: Shooting people is so cool when done by the right people. <br /> <br /> This film only works because of the hidden Nazi ideology underneath. He does not regard the enemy as a people. And if the latter is an element of fun, I'm glad to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another mystery is how this violence can fascinate Americans. crowd while a bit of nudity will scare them. But if a naked body is porn, this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at worst. <br /> <br /> Inglourious Basterds is a waste of time and money useless, boring and tasteless.
