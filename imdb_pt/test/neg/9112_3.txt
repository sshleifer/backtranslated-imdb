This movie suffers terribly from its direction "Julian Grant", and its incompetent leadership, Steve Guttenberg, who is putting a solid effort to win a competition similar to Bruce Willis! Writing is a reckless Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates gave a decent performance. The film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what the Hollywood studios thought, actually giving the nod to the weak director like Grant. And I would tell Sean Bean "what were you even thinking of playing in a movie like this, after movies like GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games?
