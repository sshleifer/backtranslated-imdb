And you'd be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as "Women in Chains", is exactly the kind of useless, low-quality b movie that the premise suggests. Pam Grier was thrown into a prison on a small island with many other women, and this place makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked now looks like a maximum security prison. It is not five minutes in the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line 'strip them and wet them' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles college freshman fantasy than inside a house of brotherhood is like. <br /> <br /> Prisoners lather and scrub and fight with each other in the shower as if it were a Girls Gone Wild shoot, so they all hang out together in their dorm, smoking marijuana openly, and arguing in a large group that would be the best ways to escape. I've never been to prison, but I have the feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing you want to know as few people as possible, prisoners, guards or others. The biggest difference between this prison life and some fraternity life fantasy is that the women in this movie wear orange cardigans (and no pants) that say PRISON in the back. It must be those generic jail gowns that can not afford expensive accessories like the name of the jail or the number of prisoners for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And as you might expect, a prison that can not afford to put the identification of prisoners on the backs of uniforms obviously can not expect to find guards who are interested in keeping prisoners so long how much they are having sex with the prisoners and with each other. <br /> <br /> The film's title conflict refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends most of his time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named Karen because they are running away from the police after escaping from prison. I will not go into detail about how they escape, except to say that you may have seen something similar in The Fugitive if they had been unable to afford a train wreck, and this leads to the confused history of conflicting interests that also pursue these two women for different reasons. Karen and Lee have their own gangs of people, each hoping to rescue their respective fugitive prisoners, and the cops are behind them all the time. <br /> <br /> So, Karen is involved with a bunch of hippies who want to revolutionize life as they know it. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to leave the island, something she's been trying to do for years, and it's not just perfect that every one of them needs to go to completely opposite sides of the island to fulfill their goals. So we have this strange couple, and since they are a strange couple, it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the movie, but they will become friends with each other until the end. In a film with so many competing interests, especially when these competing interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving rival gangs in some point in the movie. Not wanting to leave anyone unsatisfied, they play in a stupid gang stupor at the end of the movie where they all shoot machine guns at each other, killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a small boat . Nice. Better yet, at the end of the film, after a massive massacre in which many people are shot and sprinkled red paint all over the place, the Police Captain looks at the dead masses. criminals covered with horrible and terrible special effects, and learned that he will be a Major before dinner. It's not a bad way to end the movie, the criminals kill each other and the cops get all the credit, but here's the last line of the movie? "It's better to win, is not it?" <br /> <br /> Is that why the captain will be promoted to major? Why did he figure it out ???
