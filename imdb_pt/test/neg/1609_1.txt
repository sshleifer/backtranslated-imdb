I'll start by confessing that I really like action movies (military or other). I'm a guy. But this fall was horrible. I've seen it for free, showtime or hbo and still feel like I paid a lot. It was an extended episode of general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave a 1, just because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why 59 others would rank 5 to 6 confuse my mind. Unless they are all from the family of the cast or crew. <br /> <br /> It may be that this movie has been so bad that many have been rescued ....... and as such have not been invested too much to worry about. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for repeating, but the minimum of 10 lines seems silly, for what essentially boils down to a warning ......... in hopes of saving others the black hole of 2 hours, this movie stands for. Trust me, look at a blank wall, they will be more action.
