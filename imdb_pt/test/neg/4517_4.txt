I found my tape of this long and forgotten 'show'. In addition to the theme song 'DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE'. This show is only watchable. You'll be flipping through channels as well as the couple flipping through the TV channels. This is a parody of the TV. <br /> <br /> The beaver is cool. Homosexual Dracula, the girl discussing her experiences with Peria and the woman with the overly big lips discussing homosexuality show us all that's wrong with TV. It's all wrong. Just like the space beaver that seems to be lost in this new world, so will you. *** outside of *****
