This is my first "horrible" rating on IMDb and I could not think of a more deserving movie to honor him. I expected trash fun and found rubbish of the saddest and dull kind. I found a movie that no one could care a bit, including its creator. <br /> <br /> "Hell Ride," written by and starring Larry "Friend of QT" Bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two biker bands and a horrible murder in 1976 that still has to be avenged. Larry seems ferociously determined not to tell this story, concentrating instead on putting his main character strangely frowning in situations where he can pet women who pretend to like her. He also has a dialogue containing enough horrible puns / metaphors to end the word "fire" through life. <br /> Dennis Hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so lucky. Sometimes they take the road on their bikes, making them feel even more sad by Michael Madsen, as their high straps seem to add insult to injury to have to appear in this movie. There is an abundance of nudity enhanced with silicon, but little action and no humor, making us wonder what kind of audience they had in mind. <br /> <br /> My guess is that most people watch this movie. , including fans of motorcycle movies 60, will feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and get back to seeing real things.
