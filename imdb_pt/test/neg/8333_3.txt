I went to see this because I had never seen Tel Aviv, where the story is set. I was disappointed, as it does not offer many views of Israel's largest metropolis. It's also pretentious - one of those movies that lets you guess the meaning until you finally give up shrugging. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist is Batya, a twenty-year-old woman who works. as a waitress at weddings attended to. Her parents, of course, do not care much about her, and when a girl leaves the sea with an inflatable ring around her, Batya feels compelled to take care of her. The girl does not speak, and Batya can not give her social services because it is the weekend and the agency is closed. So she takes her back to her flat with the flat roof, and when it comes time to work at night, she has to take the little girl with her. The boss is very unhappy with this and other shortcomings in the performance of Batya's work. <br /> <br /> Another main character is Keren, who is getting married. At her wedding party (where Batya, of course, is working), she breaks her leg out of a women's cubicle, whose door does not open, so she and her new husband can not take vacations in the Caribbean they planned. They end up in a dirty hotel by the sea without a view. It smells badly, there is traffic noise, and Keren is complaining all the time. Does your husband find an oddly attractive older woman ?? a writer ?? who is also staying at the hotel, and Keren worries that he has slept with this stranger. <br /> <br /> The third main character is a Filipino woman named Joy, who cares for the elderly. The old woman she is hired to care for is very cranky and does not speak English, only German and Hebrew. Joy speaks English, but not in Hebrew or German. Joy is more concerned about how her son is back in the Philippines and wants to buy a toy boat, as he asked. She finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it. The old lady's daughter, who hired Joy, is an actress who appears in some kind of postmodern adaptation of Hamlet's "physical theater," and does not get along with her mother. <br /> <br /> The way these three intersecting stories momentarily resolve themselves presumably supposed to mean something profound. I did not understand. There is an element of fantasy in Batya's relationship with the little girl, and perhaps Batya's non-existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in that relationship. When Joy sees the toy boat in the shop window, there is a strange effect used where the small candles ripple as if blown by the wind, and do it as if they were on the scale of a real life ship. Keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is in a brochure cover in the hotel room, and a narration of the strange woman's poetry mentions a ship in a bottle. But what does all this mean? I thought about it for a while and realized I was not going to lose any sleep in the process. If someone out there has a clear idea of ​​what it's about, maybe they can fill me out.
