Would you be surprised if my eyes and ears almost bleed from watching this horrible movie? My eyes almost bled from watching the awful and insipid animation, meaningless, empty story. My ears almost bled from hearing the sounds that sounded like they were sung by a howler monkey chorus. Then my brain almost melted because of the complete lack of intelligence in this movie. It is stereotyped every step of the way. Talking about animals is one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep the "dream can come true" schtick? Show a little more faith in the children's intelligence, please. Next to Rock-A-Doodle, this is one of Bluth's worst.
