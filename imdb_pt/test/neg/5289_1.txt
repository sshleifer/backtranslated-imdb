I started watching this because I thought it was a really bad movie. As I continued to watch the only emotion I received from this movie was finding out what the name was so I could look for it and rip it off. I just finished and considered ending my life knowing that someone really made this movie. <br /> <br /> For people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great interpretation, my words of wisdom to you are that you probably do not have friends because you were in the movie. You're probably wishing you had all this time back from your life that you wasted doing this movie. <br /> <br /> There's no such thing as a serious movie. There was an old guy who is stabbed and does not even hurt him. And when all the others are stabbed they fall dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people kill random people and eat them and also go out with an 80 year old man who wanted to put the parts in his body. . <br /> <br /> My favorite part was when the old man found the "hemoglobents" or what you wrote because it made the film look very intellectual and probably helped reach the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What really surprised me that they decided to play in that random scene about college girls going to the forest looking for fake skulls. <br /> <br /> If you try to see this movie, you should probably fill your bathtub and drop your hair dryer on it and be ready to jump in. <br /> <br /> THIS IS A MUST SEE !! ! .... for those who believe that life could not get any worse because this will help you realize that there are people out there (the creators of this movie) who are even more pathetic and do not go where.
