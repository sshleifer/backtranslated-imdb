****** Spoilers inside ******* What a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. The film had no character development: I did not feel empathy for any of the characters (except the little one) and I did not care what happened to any of them. The film had so many clich√©s, or elements stolen from other horror films. <br /> <br /> The film was so predictable. Many a time I'd be saying to myself, "Let me guess, what's next?" Yes, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" on the family was from some man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). Sure, that's what happened (of course, you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). And, of course, another scenario of "evil man". Why was he ill and killing his family? Because he's a man, duh! As someone else stated, this movie can be scary for someone under 13 years of age, or for a 1970s movie, but it is a far cry from being a 'scary' movie by the standards of today. And, like so many other horror films, many of the scares were "fake." Scary music, scary music, scary music and ..... A crow suddenly flies in the window! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old bank guy manage to cross an open lot sometimes without his father seeing him? I thought, sure enough, that the old man was a ghost. No, just a low quality movie. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 2 out of 10 because it kept my attention long enough to stay inside the whole thing.
