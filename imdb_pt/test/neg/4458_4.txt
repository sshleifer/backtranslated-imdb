Being too young to have tried the Hammer movies when they were new and new, I am discovering their horror movies as I find them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry to the Christopher Lee series. The original story of the vampire Hammer had a lot of atmosphere and a fantastic story to engage. Lee was a great Dracula, a vibrant vampire if possible at first, but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character standing around and looking menacing. Modular young people talk like cartoon characters (even though my aunt lived in England during the 1970s and she says people actually talked to those terrible cliches). I had no interest in anyone living or dying among the younger audience. They were all very awful characters anyway. I enjoyed seeing a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but she leaves the story too soon. Lee and his historical rival, Peter Cushing, add an air of authenticity to the film, but can not draw blood from this empty film. It's D.O.A.
