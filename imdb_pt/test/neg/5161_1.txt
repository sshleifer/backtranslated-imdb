This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God I saw it for free. I would have hated spending my money on this. <br /> <br /> First, there is not a character in the movie who is somehow nice. Michael Caine comes close, but even he is very flawed. The rest of the "commands" are made up of disgusting former presidents. There are the two gay Arabs, and three guys who try to rape a Red Cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no problem sending his men to be killed, so he can escape. <br /> <br /> "It's all about suspense, they're about to blow up a fuel tank." It sounds exciting, right? Well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and repairing pierced tires. <br /> <br /> They come to the fuel depot, we have a lot of cars, to discover that it is a decoy.Then nothing to explode.At this time, for some very intricate reason, the British army decides that they no longer need these guys, and radios their whereabouts to the Germans to kill them. So, now at least we're going to have an exciting run for freedom? No, instead, they decide to blow up a different fuel depot, to create a detour.But, when they enter the place, they fire a thread of travel, and the German es come to pick them up - calling their names through the loudspeaker. <br /> <br /> Really strange. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them into the dump before breaking the trap? Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel tank and set all their loads. Yes right. That would happen. <br /> <br /> So they blow up the trash, the leader sells all his men - except for Michael Caine, since he was offered $ 2000 to bring him back alive. <br /> <Well, the men are all betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. British troops arrive with tanks and decide to be rescued. Since they are wearing German uniforms (they used to blow up the dump) they tie a white flag around a stick and get out onto the road. <br /> <br /> Some British guy walks behind them and shrapnel them to die. Credit roll. <br /> <br /> Yes. The two "Heroes" of the film die due to a random act of violence. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided, "That's a wrap. Kill them and we're going home." I've lost 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unreal movie that ended with a graceful bomb.
