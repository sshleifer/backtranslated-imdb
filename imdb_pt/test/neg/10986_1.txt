This is the worst movie I've seen in a looooong time. It reminded me of a Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago - without the athletic. By this I mean that some striking, artistic images appear randomly, without any support structure. The fake Sepia-tinted film is really tacky. This device is almost never justified and certainly not in Tuvalu_. With apologies to Abe Lincoln: You can fool some people all the time.
