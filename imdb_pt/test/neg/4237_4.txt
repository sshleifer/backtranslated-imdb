The premise of the film had a lot to do, however, despite the novelty of models selling someone else's furniture to live the high life, this movie has nothing to do with it. The characters are cardboard. The dialog box is so painfully scripted, it's hard to sit down, and if there were jokes in the movie, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe is entering the walls because she does not want to wear glasses is completely unbelievable and not funny. Grable's stupidity is also very hard to believe. Bacall's gold dig is so forced that it is annoying to listen. Why would anyone want to sit through this is beyond me.
