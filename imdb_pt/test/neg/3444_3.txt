This show disturbs me. occupies nick slots at night that could be reserved for the prince or George Lopez. to full house and Roseanne. they are all better than home improvement. Firstly, Mother Jill annoys me a lot. she's a super sensitive whiner and I really despise her. Brad is a fat frog and also annoying. and the younger brother, I do not even know his name! I do not notice it at all! this is probably not the actor's fault, it's probably from the writers. Tim's just a stupid ass. although Jill is DEFINITELY my least favorite, I do not like any of them. The only reason I gave this stupid three star show is a star going to horny. like the middle son, he's still a pesky little brother but an older brother, and I like his fun character. the other star goes to Al. as the chubby friend, his character is nice. besides Randy and Al, this show sucks.
