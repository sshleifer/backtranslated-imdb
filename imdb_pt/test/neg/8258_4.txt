In "Red Letters," Coyote is in the vortex of a college professor who writes for an inmate and gets more than he expected. There are two reasons to watch this movie ... Kinski is one and Piven the other, although it is difficult for his sparks to shine in such a complete disaster of direction. Everything is wrong with "Red Letters" ... complicated script, lousy, camera, editing, and above all acting that is subpar for Coyote, etc. Battersby took a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateur movie it's worth the time.
