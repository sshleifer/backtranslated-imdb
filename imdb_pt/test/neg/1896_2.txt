I watched the version with pathetic American over-dubs, maybe it did a lot worse, but from what I could see the movie was really bad anyway. It seemed low budget. The visuals reminded me of a second-rate TV movie, random white dog replaced by Dogmatix, embarrassing BBC costumes from the 60s, etc. Mainly, I feel that the characters in the movie did not behave like the characters in the comic book, and as a result, I never felt willing to try to forgive the poor look of the movie. It will always be difficult to capture the feeling of comics in a movie without using animation, and I did not feel that the attempt was worth it.
