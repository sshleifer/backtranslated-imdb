I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it was not very motivating, and did not even address the idea of ​​what a training schedule would be like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of ​​what it would take for them to train and administer one. In fact, there were almost zero technical information. I did not expect this to be an instructive video with a lot of technology, but when that information was close to zero, the film simply was not balanced, and it was not particularly useful for non-marathoners contemplating their first run. <br /> <br /> There were other problems. Some of the first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. Yes, very inspiring Timing was also hard to follow, because it was semi-chronological, but filmmakers rarely gave you good clues as to what point of time you were looking at. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume it's all her training, but then several scenes later they finally give you hints that's why she stumbled on a pine cone in her backyard. Parts were very good, however, as a woman challenging racing officials who wanted the race to be only for men, and coverage of a race in Chicago where two of the runners portrayed previously were contending the first place. At the top of my head, I'm thinking of other chronological documentaries like Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are, and you feel like they've told you everything you wanted to know. <br /> In short, it would not have been difficult to do a better marathon, and as it stands, I can not recommend this to non-marathoners to educate them and motivate them to try one because I do not. I think this will have that effect.
