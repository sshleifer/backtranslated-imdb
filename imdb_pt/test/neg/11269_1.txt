"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere between terribly annoying and awfully painful to watch. As a historical epic, it could have had far more chances to be a rich saga ... but in fact it is no more than just another cheap 70s action movie with a story based on real facts and a Sonny who uses an eye patch. Chiba Before half of this movie, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! The song is like a thousand dogs in their lament in their ears for a song composed by Ennio Morricone (this is not an insult to Morricone). The use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating. And in terms of action, it is nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and "no-no-no-no-no" shocks. What a terrible movie.
