I watch family affairs, coronation end & enders in uktv every week night family affairs is by far the worst, bad plots, bad sequences and worst acting of any soapie, even worse than Americans and who is saying something. <br /> <br /> I find it very frustrating that all these uktv Australia shows "are so far behind the UK and when someone tries to figure out the reason for it, they just give you a story that will show double episodes for capturing It is not unnecessary to say that this ever happens I am very happy that family affairs will make room for something of better quality, but at the same time I would like to know the basic reasons, they finally realized how bad it was "people stopped watch? whatever it was you did not leave us in suspense Why do you think you have to keep everything secret from your fans? or do not you just care? I feel strongly that you should try to keep your audience updated. Family matters are notorious for only when their characters disappear and reappear seemingly without reason, we get involved with people and enjoy following their lives. <br /> <br /> I can understand why family affairs would have to end, even though we are so far away in Australia, it is easy to see that writers are running out of ideas for new plots, so many plots are being repeated and old episodes coming back. I also noticed that as new characters are being introduced, a lot of them are really bad actors, as if you were scraping the bottom of the barrel and ending with Drek.
