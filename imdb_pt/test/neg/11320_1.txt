I've never seen such a terrible movie that I went crazy. It was a huge waste of time to see this low quality movie. There are a lot of things I hate about this movie: The songs are so awful (even a little catchy) I hit my head on the wall (especially the song 'Grandpa will sue Santa's pants' I beat 10 Times * shrinks the shoulders *), the drawing of the character, and that evil cousin, greedy and vile Mel. <br /> <br /> I can not stand her for a second, she has to be one of the most naughty people I've ever seen. Even though I like the southern voice of it. <br /> <br /> The only good side is that Austin Bucks is played by the person who is the voice of Liquid Snake of Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend people watching for the holidays as it was a huge embarrassment for x-mas.
