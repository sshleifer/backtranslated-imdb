When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5.00 at a local store, I should have been well advised that this film was not up to the usual standard of David Selznick Productions. With a cast containing names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard I was looking forward to a real treat. As many other commentators have said, it's a strange mixture of plot and scenes that does not quite convince. However, I'm so glad I saw this movie as I now have the memorable saying "Never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon." live for. That should sum up everyone's life. Choose these seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - your own life.
