To think that it could only get better was the worst guess I've ever made .... Drivvle does not describe this movie properly! <br /> <br /> It's not just the fine plot, but I get more emotional acting with my pet fish! <br /> <br /> It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite, whom I respect as an actor trying to do the best with what little he had to work on ... <br /> <br /> I think a cardboard of Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job, and actually been more excited. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! This can really be dangerous to your health!
