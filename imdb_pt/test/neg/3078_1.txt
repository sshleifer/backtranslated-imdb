More of a character study than a movie, COMPROMISE is just another playful relationship with the trimmings specifically made for a young and target audience. The direction seems very basic, with obvious dramatic irony and a classic case of the lost loser versus the lack of clarity committed. COMMITTED is watchable at times and there is a slight sense of originality from Lisa Krueger. <br /> <br /> COMMITTED is completely aimless for the first twenty minutes. We met Joline, but the movie begins when the husband disappears. Joline goes out to meet him. <br /> <br /> Some parts are strange. Other times the movie drags on. The second half is funnier when we see Joline's spiritual pranks turn to the most intense. The annoying guitar music is horrible, but perhaps a necessary evil as COMMITTED offers very little anyway. An average movie harmed by some completely useless moments, the only COMMITTED asset is Heather Graham and Patricia Velazquez.
