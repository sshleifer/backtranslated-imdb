I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me, no one knows why I did not make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in theaters, I was happy! My agents were driven to madness by the (seemingly for the first time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies as often. Later, they told me that once back in California (filmed in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 and a half hours of footage! Even edited for 90 minutes, it has at least twice the time required. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but on the other hand - what a waste of film!
