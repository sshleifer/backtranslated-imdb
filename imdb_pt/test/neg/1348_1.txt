I was very disappointed with this movie. Ms English, who says she's a fan of the original film, seems to have taken on a great artistic work, and turned it into a "runaway", that you have come a long way to producing babies. I tried to like Mary Haines of Meg Ryan, but she was just annoying. She did not seem to feel anything about her husband's case. There was no emotional struggle, no deep wound. In the original 1939 film, Norma Hanger, Mary Haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused, and irritated. The 2008 production was more on a theme of fake brotherhood (actually my wife's words) and did not make you shed a tear or even laugh. The only notable presentations are Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more from Bette.) There were no protagonists in this movie. Sylvia Fowler's character had many sub-themes for him. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The remake of the department store meeting with Annette Benning, and Miss Mendez was lukewarm Luke. Also the pace was slow too. Obviously, the 1939 version needed to be updated, but that was not it. The reason the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. A subject that is not outdated. The magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes, while you have never seen the men.
