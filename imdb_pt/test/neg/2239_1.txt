Little Quentin seems to have mastered the art of eating the cake and eating it. As usual, pure sadistic viewing can be explained as a clever and thought-provoking way of sending violence back into the public's face. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Tarantino. Violence is Baaad. Sadism is the Baaad. Worth wading to do this. How very bright. <br /> <br /> The youthful part of the audience may not be smart enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness, but I am confident that they will see the light one day. Thanks for making this little world a little better. You deserve a medal.
