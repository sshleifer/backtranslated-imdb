It's ok. I'll admit it. I am a big fan of movies b. Back when Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley and Brinke Stevens ruled the perch. And back then even the bad movies were still good. Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is simply bad. Even a small special guest of Brinke Stevens (reprizing her role as Linda of the "Assassin Party Massacre" 21 years earlier) does not help at all. A group of cheerleaders takes refuge in a fancy cabin after the van breaks down. A psychopath pursues them one by one, catching them in various states of nudity. Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make it really bad! Skip this turkey and go rent the "Slumber Party Massacre". 1/2 *
