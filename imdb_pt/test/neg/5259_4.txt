Bulletproof is clearly a disposable film. The kind where mochos riddled with bullets and thugs are scattered everywhere, so much so that you should not see them as human beings. The yawns between Wayans and Sandler's lines are extensive. They struggle, but unfortunately, the persona itself does not make a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays a nice villain, but he always had that redneck advantage at the ready. My favorite scene is the repeated clips from a TV ad in which Caan reveals that America's virtues can be shown to the world by having two cars in each garage. Also, it's a friends movie with weapons for brains. Go through this one.
