I watched this movie for the hot guy - and even he sucked! He was the worst - well, okay, I also have to support that weird cop rapist guy, he was even worse. The guy was not that cute at the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot who does not support his mother for what he "loves" ever existed. Overall, and if that makes any sense to you, when I go to get movies at the store, I think to myself as I read the back of a movie that looks like, "Well, at least it can not be worse than Carolina Moon ". The most terrible film, and the most terrible writing, acting, plot - all in it made my vomit reflexes want to make backflips. It was the most horrible movie I've ever seen, with Gabriela up there too. I hated it, and trust me, if there was any number under the IMDb 1 for rating, I would pick it in a heartbeat.
