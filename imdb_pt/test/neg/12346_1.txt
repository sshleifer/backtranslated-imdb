A friend and I went to see this movie. We have conflicting opinions about Fujimori, but after watching this movie, we agree with the following: The easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to talk about a foreign country where you were not present when the events happened, no matter how talented or how much you invest in the movie. If you are really interested in learning about the history of other countries, watch something done by natives from that country, otherwise you will not be able to get away from your bubble. And those who try to force their views and opinions on something they do not belong to are actually abusing their power. To make matters even worse, the director chose not to talk about the CIA's embarrassing involvement with the Fujimori regime. She decides to avoid dealing with the only issue that her country has much to explain to Peruvians. But this is not surprising because both the director and the CIA are violating Peru's sovereignty, trying to affect democratic processes at very different levels. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in helping Peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary. In any case, there are numerous documentaries, films and books on the subject made in Peru. These include "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: The Faces of the Mind", "Montesinos: Mighty Knight", etc. The director of the "Fall of Fujimori" must spend it. time analyzing the many problems in his own country or at least his country's involvement in the affairs of other nations.
