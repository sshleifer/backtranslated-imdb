A big disappointment for what was presented as an amazing movie. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if only once did someone play an important role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We really did not learn anything about this character, except that he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We do not know why. Nicholas Cage does an excellent performance as always, but I feel that this role and script frustrated him. And how, after not being able to perform for the whole movie, can he have an erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a shower.
