This sci-fi scream horror of just over 50 years is not totally a loser. It is about a manned space rocket that falls into a remote area. A group of scientists will investigate and find out that the astronaut is in some kind of coma; it is being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in it. Either way, the alien title monster soon raises its head causing widespread havoc, including partial head removal. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie is the rhythm. It takes a long time for Blood Beast to appear, and it actually only appears in the last 20 minutes. He is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation, but this is not a problem since it provides a reasonable amount of comic relief. At the end of the movie, where we have the final impasse and this ridiculous creature begins to speak with the voice of the doctor he has killed before, you will be fine not to have a giggle. Similarly, in the brilliant X-ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating in the astronaut's body - it's very funny for words. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, the fun moments of Night of the Blood Beast come very few and far between. If you're a science fiction crazy 50's, it's worth checking out. Just do not expect too much.
