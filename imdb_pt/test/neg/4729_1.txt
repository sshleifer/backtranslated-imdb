Against my better judgment, I went to see this movie today, and God, I wish I had not seen it. Horrible. The first AVP movie looks like a classic compared to this, it's too bad. These guys really make Paul WS Anderson look like a master storyteller. In fact, this is what I would expect an Alien and / or Predator movie to look like if it were made by Uwe Boll! This movie really offended me, and God knows what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were forced to watch this crap. I can not understand how any fan of any franchise could like this movie. <br /> <br /> I really do not know where to start. I mean, the first AvP was poop, but at least a semi-interesting story and configuration, and occasionally some genuine tension. He did not take himself too seriously and could at least be enjoyed on a purely "leave his brain at home" basis. But this, it seemed to me as if the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece. One after another was an artificial 'suspense' scene in a dark room or hallway with scary music playing, essentially banging his head saying 'Be afraid NOW'. As James Cameron once said, you can not be said to be afraid, you can only have your own senses increased. The guys who made this movie obviously were not paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force it to be afraid rather than let it get to that level. It's a clich√© for the internet nerds to say "God, I was so bored with this movie and wanted to leave," well, that's exactly how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this movie totally seriously, which eliminated any possibility of pleasure. Even the joke about how governments do not lie to their people was thrown without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, I knew that human characters would be completely useless for this. movie, but seriously, if they will be on the screen, at least have them doing something that is relevant to the story. I do not care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend, I do not care about the mother who's "own daughter does not even know her, boo-hoo!" (a pair of night vision goggles for a gift? Give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to have a decent life and set an example for his brother, that guy. Hell, until the obligatory moment of the sexy panties was more artificial than usual. I have the feeling that they expected the public to be so shocked by the ending, as well as seeing treasure hunters get out of children, pregnant mothers getting raped and things like that, that would make up for it. I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> So we move to the movie stars, and again very little to write about it. Were the aliens well-designed? I would not have a clue, because you can never see the damn things. All you see is a mouth, a head, a tail or a really messy CG outline rising up on a wall, and barely enough to actually process what is in fact an alien before Mr. "I cut Marilyn Manson video clips and NIN, think I'll do the same thing here "Editor goes with the slice tool. Also, notice how action directors always define their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm The Predator could be fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time, and I thought some of the new armaments were cool, but that was about it. Also, since when does a predator sound like a dinosaur from the lost world? There were a couple of things I liked though. One of them was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (I also laughed a little bit in "Get to the chopper!"), Although other references were stupid (The main character's name is Dallas, give me some time). I also liked the FX visual for the Predator's vision, as well as the alien hybrid's look (certainly surpassed that of Resurrection). But, in fact, those are the only positive things. Generally, I found this film useless, insulting, and, above all, offensive to the view of the original creators of both creatures. That they left the door open for another leaves me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had any decency, they would remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this film. They did nothing to deserve this.
