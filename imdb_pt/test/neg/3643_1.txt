This is the worst show in Nickelodeon history. First of all, no boarding school has a Sushi Bar, flat-screen TVs, and gives each student a laptop. This makes the program so unreal and annoying. The plots are useless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad, it makes me want to take my own life. I really hate the fact that on the show, Zoey is the most popular girl in school, and the most beautiful, and smarter, and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never has real problems, and every guy wants to go out with her. She is so perfect. There is no one like that. Besides, I hate that everyone does anything for her, and everyone chooses her for each team or club. It's so boring. Quinn is so unpleasant. His experiments are pathetic, meaningless, and false. Chase is a coward. He says he loves Zoey, but if he did, he would ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but he never accomplishes anything. Nichole is so cheerful and screams a lot. She is never seen doing any work or studying, but she is a heterosexual student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she sucks. Need I say more? I think not. For your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.
