I am a big fan of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is not good. The reviewer below is fully correct that the impressive images of the Detroit station are the first and last memorable scene in the film. I really wish it had come out after that, instead of continuing to have hope throughout the movie. Maybe my expectations were very high, but I felt disappointed. <br /> <br /> The score is almost completely a repeat of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you are a fan but there is only one piece. which stood out to me as being fresh. It was nice enough, though, that I would probably still check the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But just keep this in mind if you see this movie: if you realize at some point that you are not liking it, go ahead and divide it - you will not miss a thing because it will not get any better. <br /> <br /> I'll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): Many shots of athletes who look almost good enough for a Nike commercial, photos of smiling, unexplained, and bland people in head of famous wax dolls (WTF were thinking here?!?), some laughing babies (cuuuuute), some "annoying effects, some pictures that suggest a comparison between water flows, information, money and people (I think) ... and then a lot of fast, unrelated scenes of mass violence ... and then a lot of stock footage footage. <br /> <br /> I could redo this movie in 10 seconds. my speech: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy dad with a shaved head and lycra shorts riding a bicycle playing with a child playing with a kitten playing with a rope, 5 seconds of that scene in "Network" where the guy talks about fiddling with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "din heiro flows, money flows out "; 1 second of Reginald Denny being attacked with a brick, and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean jumping on the moon. <br /> <br /> There you go - it's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life that I just saved. Of course, I'd grab a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two, so it would not look as blatantly as it is. If Steven Soderbergh is reading this, hey, I will not even need much money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie about Life as War, I suggest "Bowling for Columbine " rather than. It may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so elegant among the black-necked crowd, but at least it's funny.
