The St. Francisville experiment says "this is not a hike in the woods," a slap in the face of Blair Witch. Where Blair Witch proved to be a movie that overwhelmed the viewer's imagination through a simple suggestion, The St. Francisville Experiement overwhelms the spectator's patience. It should be said, however, that this is meant to be a camp classic. <br /> <br /> Warning: Spoiler is coming !! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at a local theater where the movie's "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor talked about the making of the film. If anyone wants to see this movie without knowing the next information, stop reading here. For those of you who can not resist, read about my friends and everything will be said. Mr. Taylor, a writer of intriguing ghost stories whom he claims to be true, informed the audience in this video presentation that The St. Francisville Experiment was not a documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we did not know ... He informed us that all the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in Louisiana, but in California. All four participants were real actors (note that I did not speak well ...). One of the participants is actually an ER special effects technician. <br /> <br /> What infuriates me in this movie is that it proclaims that everything is true. He weakly tries to overcome the Blair Witch project, claiming it is true, while Blair Witch was a farce. The incredible thing is that nobody could believe this movie for an instant. Filled with terrible acting and hilarious lines like "Surrounding the White Light" and "I Love the Ghosts," The St. Francisville Experiment belongs to the midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can appropriately disrupt, boo and sing "I love ghosts!" <br /> <br /> Talk about misleading advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that it seems the neighborhood Scout troop has set up a haunted house. From the insect on the sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) to the annoying Madison, from the "session" which is nothing more than the quartet playing on an Oujia board for the two rats being found under a bed, The St Francisville Experiement is an embarrassing hoax of a movie. Lion's Gate would be wise to dump this thing on the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be: "The St. Francisville Experiment: A comic look at how not to make a movie."
