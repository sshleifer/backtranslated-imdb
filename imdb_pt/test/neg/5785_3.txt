Note to yourself. Never again has he ever watched a serious movie with Charlie Sheen. Great comedian, horrible stamp. This film makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most military elite in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the reputation of Navy SEAL. Thanks for making an incredibly select group of people look horrible in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is a great story that could be turned into an incredible action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
