One of the worst movies I've ever seen! After watching I leave like, what happened? I'm confused today, can anyone explain this movie, please? both the acting quality and the picture quality are so bad that you think you're watching a school project from someone done with a home video camera. First, I can not believe how some people could give 10 stars for this movie. Because, it's incredibly bad movie! This movie is not scary at all! Nor are there typical clich√©s of terror. The plot and acting of this movie was terrible. It's not fantastic, surreal or scary. It's just a turbulent movie. Finally, there were many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. When I watch 'Gomeda' I fell into so desperate, so sad for the young Turkish filmmaker. Please, please do not do 'cinema' like that!
