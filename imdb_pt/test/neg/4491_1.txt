I suspect this board will soon be filled with comments from super-emotional people praising "Dear John" as a "pearl" and a "roller coaster" and all the other empty words that the movie's target audience usually employs. <br /> I'm definitely not the target audience for this movie, but I also do not like romantic dramas as long as they're well done, so here's my goal about the movie. <br /> <br /> Good. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie either. But the plot snakes, development stagnates where it should be moving forward (right in the middle, to be precise), and as to the end ... it almost seemed like they had run out of ideas, so they suddenly said, "Hey , let's film one last scene pretty fast, put a sentimental soundtrack on top and end it that way. " Even the beauty of Amanda Seyfried could not save it. Channing Tatum also performed well, but you can only do so much with a failed script. <br /> <br /> Speaking of music, it's unbearably predictable and complicated. Since the smoky vocalist annoyingly annoyed high-pitched schtick folk singer (certainly chosen to attract the majority of college-age girls who will watch this movie) to the combo "strings and piano tremendously," it just annoys anyone who pays more attention to the film as a everything and not their own "feelings". The film has a good start and the great conflict that launches us in the second act was very promising. So it was part of the second act itself as the story unfolded. Then the movie just released the ball. Besides, I would have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it also does not work as it should. If you want to see a truly exciting movie about the extended love waiting to be put together, go watch "Notebook" which was really excellent.
