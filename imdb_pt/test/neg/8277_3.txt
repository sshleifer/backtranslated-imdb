This film was a complete, slow and slow torture. Not being a fan of horror movies, and preferring classic horror, I may not be the best judge. Slasher fans may like this as an early entry into the slasher genre. I really like the 90 minutes I spent watching it back. The only reasons to watch this are 1) a young Vanna White (Wheel of Fortune) who takes about 3 minutes total time on the screen. 2) an early role of the screaming queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and the legendary beauty EJ Peaker as secretary of the school, which added some humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, a band from the 80's called Felony makes an appearance, which, although interesting, drags on for a long time. Just like the movie ..... I had to keep checking how much time was left and could not wait to "graduate" for a better movie.
