This and the previous "The Revenge of Toulon" and the next seem to be completely different from the first two films in which the dolls were not so good. It's basically choosing your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one looks a lot like some episodes of cheesy television series to be as good as part three was and I've never had the urge to try to watch part five of the series. Basically, a child picks up the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends their evil puppets to kill, this dark lord looks like some kind of enemy to one of those live Japanese shows like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it, so he has to get credit for not inflicting a very painful movie to watch. Just for many holes and stuff so it's considered a good movie. You get to see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie, so you have a very anti-climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really starts.
