Two years after this short, the last short "Our Gang" was made. After seeing this, you wonder how much longer it lasted. The quality of "Our Gang" disappeared shortly after moving from Hal Roach to MGM, and this short is a perfect example. The jokes are very unfounded and the last sentence of Froggy is the happiest day of his life, which paints a bad image in his mind of what it is like for him the rest of the time. A very poor example of making movies.
