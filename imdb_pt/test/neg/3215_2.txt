El Padrino: The Latin godfather - while this seems to be straightforward to the DVD / video type - my copy of the fullframe obviously looked clipped - so maybe this movie had a limited run. And the title character looks more like a Gringo than Moi (I'm half Honduran). A typical rise and fall of a drug dealer film with the list of actors on the B list - Robert Wagner (anti-drug lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (juror), Tiny Lister (mobster), Gary Busey (child rapist), Brad Dourif (white power prey), Stacey Keach (bereaved governor), Joann Pacula (bereaved Milf), Faye Dunaway (crusader) and Cock Make Canote as a guest of the unclaimed party. This movie is very bad - I just watched to kill the time before the game Skins - the only thing she saved was Jennifer Tilly as a crazy Latino drug dealer - she was exaggerated and sexy - it was fun watching her scenes. Not worth renting or looking for. D +
