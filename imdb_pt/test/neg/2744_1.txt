I admit a secret admiration of the original TV shows "Love Thy Neighbor" - mainly because they exhibit the kind of exuberance and bad taste synonymous with so many programs of their time - but I would be lying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if I pretend that this big-screen spin-off is something other than an abomination. The opening scenes of irresponsible vandalism are not only useless but also disconcerting - it is never explained why the film starts with a trail of people destroying each other's homes - and nothing improves from there. When the film unearths the oldest joke in the book-a mother-in-law's hideous dragon unexpectedly appears to stay-it is followed by the obvious revelation that she is developing a fall for the black neighbor's father, moving her intolerant son to ever greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant fury, most of the most demanding viewers will have shut down. Take that as a warning, unless you're interested in spin-spinning spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction, and the overall comic style of a burning orphanage.
