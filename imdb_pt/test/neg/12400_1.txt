Dire beyond belief. Obviously, it sets in the Isle of Man disguised as USA - very badly - and full of British actors who can not make an American accent. A monster that looks like a disjointed promotional cut to Alien from a movie store, with the most uncompromising feet ever seen. Girls in the shower, undressing, fighting, blah, blah, blah. You got the idea. Do not watch, run, hide, avoid.
