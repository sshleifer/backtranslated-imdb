This is a film that has gained some interest or praise that it received simply by merit of being a lesbian piece of interest. The performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the GLBT genre of interest. The total assistive value of the film is accumulated through modest expectation as to whether and when family members of the partners will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. The best element of the film is probably the beautiful setting of New England, although much of the film is inside. It's hard to imagine how any viewer who watched this movie and did not seek to affirm their GLBT lifestyle or wish to see that of others claiming, even through poorly performed drama, could appreciate Treading Water in any meaningful way. It's a terrible movie.
