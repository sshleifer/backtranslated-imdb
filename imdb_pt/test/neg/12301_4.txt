A fine line of actors and a seemingly pleasant plot - though not original - promised me a good night in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors delivered to the standard (Juliette Lewis cute as always, William Hurt solid but deep down, Shelley Duvall convincing as always), but the story was too thin to keep me involved with the story, and the twist to the end was too obvious It's too late; there was only one character who was cool with him, so guess what ?! So the last turnaround? I do not know what to think of that. The boyfriend and the neighbor? Contract with the devil, or just for her to move? What! The film had a good idea behind it, but the idea was not worked out in detail. It could have been good, but it was not. Many loose ends to tie, said Columbus.
