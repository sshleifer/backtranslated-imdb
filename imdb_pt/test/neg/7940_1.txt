Assault on Precinct 13 is the most idiotic movie I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame is in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they said that this movie is a remake of Rio Bravo, but did the movie's writers really watch Rio Bravo? In addition to the fact that Rio Bravo was a Western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being released by his brother and his gang. No one wants to free anyone in Assault to District 13. They want EVERYONE killed. So my first question should be: WHY NOT JUST BURN ALL THE PLACE OF START? Why "attack" the place? I know the turn of the planned plot should be clever and shocking, but it did not make sense and / or was presented correctly. If the veteran cop was involved from the start, why the need for this whole movie? If the veteran cop suddenly made a deal at the back door during the siege, how would he have the chance? As soon as he appeared at the door, he would have been shot and they would have their point of entry. It's all just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> What part of any city can happen in a police station (complete with helicopters and massive explosions), but no one notices? However, as soon as there is a fire, they have to "leave before the fire department appears" ?????? How did they plan to cover up the chaos that was going on out there? Police fired bullets into the walls, bullet cartridges, footprints, use of equipment, and the fact that there would be no bodies of "bishop's men" to be found? And those police snipers? How could they possibly miss it so much? I like the fact that when the two inmates tried to escape, the snipers were thwarted by two small piles of snow. As if it were not possible to fire a high-powered rifle through a pile of snow. The set up was interesting, albeit ridiculous, but the movie just came out of a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet in the head for absolutely no reason at all. I know the producers of the film were in a state of shock, but all they got was disgust with the public's cruelty and rage. Do not you think that part of the reason this thing is bombarding the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this? This particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (this and the fact that every turn is dumber than dirt). The conclusion remains stupid when the villain pauses to strike a Austin-like diatribe instead of killing the defenseless people he finally captured. I know several people mentioned the final scenes that take place in the woods of the city of Detroit (> snicker <), but why did Ethan's character simply go out into the woods in the first place? Does he even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend escape? They just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods, pistol in hand. GACK. I could go on, but I will not. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
