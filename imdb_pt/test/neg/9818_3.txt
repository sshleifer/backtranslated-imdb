Essentially, an indistinct B movie that is mysteriously directed by one of the top talents of the golden age, Fritz Lang. Even with the stellar names of Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, get ready for a ludic plot, poor performance, patently false assemblies and miscellaneous. For the sake of transparency, I must admit that I am a fervent admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was lucky enough to have found a niche in MGM's artificial dream factory and somehow worked in supporting roles, supporting Greer Garson and others. He's wildly crazy, acting in a chipper, '30s-Ray Milland crazy comedy tone, in a role where his life is in danger, and he's hiding. The cockney accent of Joan Bennett is excessive, but the lacquered hair, the perfect makeup and the elegant clothes hide a girl from the shantytown of Cockney Street. George Sanders is unable to act badly, but disappears after the absurd opening finds Pidgeon pretending to shoot Adolph Hitler. Surprising to Fritz Lang is the tone drop. I found the movie oscillated uncomfortably between occasional moments of suspense-suspense surrounded by light-hearted comic interaction. Hitchcock completely reversed the proportion, using comic relief to occasionally accompany the suspense. There is a reason for this film to be unknown. It has not served or boosted anyone's career or reputation, and is overlooked because it is a surprisingly poor movie from a pedigree group.
