First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a teenager, so all of this is marketed to me, and I can safely say that iCarly's programming is very bad, and the fact of being accepted between both genres leaves me perplexed. It contains some of the worst comedy attempts I've ever seen with mediocre acting. The supposed mood within the show is based on saying the lines of someone again with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, saying bad phrases and, well, you got it. Also, I must mention that I still watch SpongeBob, which I know will have a negative reaction, but this is quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it, the less we forget about something missing iCarly; WIT The show is about a young girl, Carly, doing a web-show with her friends, what I can say is undoubtedly a better version of the internet. Okay, but the show is ... well, not funny, as stated earlier. If this is what children's programming has come up with today, parents, show them something that is REALLY funny; SpongeBob or Rocco's Modern Life would work. <br /> <br /> In addition, compared to his brother show, Drake & Josh, is terrible, which was implied. Seriously, please note something worthwhile. Even for a children's program, it's bad.
