If you are not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, here is the summary: they are some Israeli film and finaciers producers who set up the Cannon film company in the early 1980s. The only Israeli to have a worse press than these two was Menachim Begin. Begin probably deserved the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a god sent to the filmmakers because no matter how bad their script was, they would fund their film and use directors they could not direct and actors who could not act. In fact, you often get the impression that people simply walk up to Yoram and Menahem and ask them for some money, and they force themselves without seeing the director's resume. If only the producers today were so confident. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is not a Cannon movie, but Globus and Golan have financed it and have their signatures everywhere. It is misdirected, misrepresented, poorly edited, but it is the script that jumps and attacks with its horror. It starts with a lot of high school athletes engaging in all kinds of jokes, actually the first 20 minutes of the film unfold as a sex comedy and it's a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS turns into a watcher movie. But it's not just any kind of vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (Note a connection? They are both continuations and they are both watcher films made by Cannon movies), not siree this is a ridiculously bad watchful film about cute boy high school boys and their poodle going on a mission to end scumbags. This movie is proof that Globus and Golan were giving money to people regardless of their film making skills, and you have to worry about people who seem to spend all their reserves on making movies made entirely around watchmen.
