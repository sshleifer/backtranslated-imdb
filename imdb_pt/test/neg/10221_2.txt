I found the first part of the intriguing stop motion animation and the action mostly live short with the girl happening in any country that was kept my interest, but the other 11 short weird ones did not really spark my interest or made me think of something all. The music and 8mm footage seemed so random that everything seemed random. I would not recommend this to anyone unless you can see it for free. <br /> <br /> As for the music being so in tune it was not well received. I rented the DVD because I thought it was all stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short was SMA, the second had a small stop motion mixed mostly with live action. There was a clipping of paper in one, and the rest were outdoor photos of an 8mm camera with the music bed. It just had no meaning for it that I could see.
