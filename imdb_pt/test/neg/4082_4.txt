The creative team behind Evan Almighty really should have been able to make a better movie. Starring one of America's favorite jokers and directed by Detective Ace Ventura director Tom Shadyac, one expects a greater laugh count than the image provides. Hell even Steve Oedekerk who wrote and directed last year Barnyard atrocious, and reaches a written credit here did a better job. The fact is that Evan Almighty is not the worst picture of the summer season, but it may be the most disappointing. The title and creative team behind the board suggest that this is a kind of sequel to Bruce Almighty of 2003. That picture had Jim Carrey in the lead and although Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny, it's the last one that fits best. this type of material. I heard that Carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor refused to see other places for his character to venture out. Thus, Shadyac moved to Carell, which since then a fun play in the original 2003, is preparing for stardom. After sleeping the 40-year-old virgin and Little Miss Sunshine, the man has become a big deal, and so it is he, instead of being rubber, who faces Jim, who takes that production to theaters. The story goes that Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) was elected as a congressman, so he and his troop change house so Evan can succeed with his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children have doubts, but overall show a helping hand for Evan, who himself looks to the future with optimistic eyes. However things start to go belly up quickly, God (Morgan Freeman) appears to Evan stating that a flood is coming and that the politician must build an Ark. Ignoring the encounter initially, Evan quickly gets some beard robes that refuses to be shaved and the animals are starting to appear two by two. Evan then starts putting the boat under construction, but the neighborhood is not happy and neither is a political colleague (John Goodman). Anyone who expects the crazy laughter from some of Tom Shadyac's other films will probably be completely cold with this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and even Bruce Almighty, where mostly very funny pictures, but all these designs have one thing in common and that's the presence of Jim Carrey. Shadyac did not make a worthwhile movie without Carrey in charge, he worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell, but Carrey still seems to merge successfully with Shadyac. Carell, after the disappointing box office and critics, will not be desperate to work with the director again, and with Carrey now doing more serious projects, it would be best for Shadyac to find a new comic book music quickly. Carell himself is quite annoying here, who felt that his piece is part of the first film (Although quite fun) deserved a full length feature should be taken back and shot. I hope after the Bruce Almighty raffle at the box office it's Universal's own studios, but you know that when a quality comedian can not do anything with a character, persona scren is a failure, and that's exactly the case with Evan Almighty . Lauren Graham is not a big shock as Evan's wife, nor do any of the boys play the right note. Freeman lets everything get loose like God in another fun and chilling presentation, but he seems to sporadically take the play. In fact, the most consistent source of laughter is Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and co-worker (Jonah Hill), both of whom made me laugh twice as much as any other character on the project. Oedekerk's writing was worse (Barnyard) but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work in this production. His script has genuinely funny moments, but it's also full of family moments and humor is never weird or offensive enough. The film takes tame and easy thefts to religion when it should tear the concept to pieces, in fact, the church's opening sequence in The Simpsons Movie shakes religion harder than the 95-minute Evan Almighty race. With a little more daring and heart, this could have been a much better image. I do not doubt that the main family audience is slightly entertained by this film, but if they are satisfied it is a completely different matter. There's a line between being watchable and worth it, a line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side. Maybe when you're bored and the movies on the cable channel can watch, but I can think of far better ways to spend my time and, more importantly, my money than tune into this mediocre comedy.
