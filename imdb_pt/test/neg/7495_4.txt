Of course, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We understand. Over and over again. <br /> <br /> What stood out was that the filmmakers were concentrating almost entirely on the more "extreme" characters of these gay bars in the small town; the drag queens, the decadent sleaze of a long-closed bar, and about a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay but had nothing to do with any of the bars that were the focus of this movie. <br /> <br /> There were excerpts from other people's interviews, people that viewers might, perhaps, be more able to relate to. But they were concealed, practically ignored, perhaps glimpsed in the background. <br /> <br /> It would have been more interesting, at least for me, to hear the experiences of the most common gay men and women. who were enriched or not by the experiences of a gay bar in a small town and / or by the absence of that community.
