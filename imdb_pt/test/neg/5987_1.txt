This movie amused me with lots of laughter from the actors who kept the movie moving in all sorts of crazy directions. If you like suggestive language and sexy-looking girls, they were all in the picture and girls and girls who looked exhausted before graduating from high school. There is a scene where teens drive their car on a very fake deer and then proceed to play it on a lake or ocean, which is repeated over and over again. There is no horror for this movie except the word Horrible for the whole picture and Arnold, who plays a plastic cop, is really a sick character. Please do not waste your time watching this movie.
