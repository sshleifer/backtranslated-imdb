The film was slow, the dialogue between the actors / actresses felt "flat" and basically there was no development of the characters in the story. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps sneaks up with a mad look on his face all the time, pouting and basically looking annoyed at everyone. The Danes have no magic on the screen, and the character of Ribisi is a goober that no one would want to leave even if they were paid for it. <br /> <br /> Play the strange scene in which Epps has to dance an old man, and you have what could possibly be the worst movie in film history. I watched on satellite (thank God I did not pay for it), and wished I did not <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and pack your underwear and the sock drawer if you need something to do, but be tempted to watch this movie while on your TV. Horrible movie if you ask me, and I usually have something good to say about any movie out there.
