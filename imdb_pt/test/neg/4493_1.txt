The action scenes were very good. But the plot of the film, I would have to give a score of 1 out of 10. It seems the producers and director of this movie did not think about it carefully? <br /> <br /> Do not give much value and value to viewers, except for their violence. The whole story was about revenge. A kid witnessing rape and murder. I would even recommend that it be banned. Those who watched, you just lost some money. If you are thinking of watching, see something else. I would ask for a refund if I was in a movie theater. So for you and the girls out there by reading this article. Please do not waste time.
