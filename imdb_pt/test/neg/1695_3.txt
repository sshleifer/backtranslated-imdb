Maybe that impressed them in the 50's, but this is one of those films that do not age well. He has that preemptive, outspoken, downbeat man vibe of a second-rate Rod Serling TV broadcast of "Seriado de TV." The "plot" is in the book, the troubled past of the character of the Cassevetes seems a bit affected, and the love interest is not convincing and indifferent. <br /> <br /> Sidney Portier gives a good performance, but he certainly was an irritating and arrogant snot. If I had to work with this guy in a warehouse, I'd probably want to hit him with a hook too. Jack Warden is good, because as usual, he plays Jack Warden. <br /> <br /> Like 90% of the movies classified in IMDb (whether classic, mediocre or crapola), somehow this is rated with 7 points. -Some stars. It is in no way worthy of it. Save your time
