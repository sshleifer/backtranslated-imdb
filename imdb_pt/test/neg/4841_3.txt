It is said that this is the first western Polish and is written and directed by Piotr Uklanski. Known in the USA as BOUNTY DEAD MAN, this movie uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialogue. Val Kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. Some strange visual situations are actually comic in a sickly way. My favorite is a young man building a gallows cut one of his own fingers and actually hang himself by testing the strength of the rope. A cowboy known only as "the Stranger" (Karel Roden) meets a dead man (Kilmer) who he thinks is a wanted man. He takes you to the nearest town to collect the reward. He ends up losing the corpse and potential reward in a game of chance with the city's drunken sheriff (Boguslaw Linda) and has the few villagers in town turned against him when he has a date with the waitress (Katarzyna Figure). He manages to escape from certain death and leads the small group in a dangerous "wild goose hunt." One scene has the stranger tending to a wound on the scalp cauterizing with gunpowder and a match. The corpse rotted on a mooring pole when the sheriff discovers that there is no generosity to be gained. This movie also known as SUMMER LOVE has an amazing theme song sung by John Davidson. However, this western is like watching a train wreck. There's just something that tells you not to look ... but you do.
