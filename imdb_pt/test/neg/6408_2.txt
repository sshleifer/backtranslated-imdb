Not just because of that theme in the movie. Which was one of the tattered excuses for something reminiscent of the plot. No. <br /> <br /> I watched it, knowing I would not like it. I hate numerology. Whenever someone starts talking about patterns with numbers, I feel the urge to slap them. My own brain starts to ache from empathy. And fully aware that this is a movie about this topic, I could not resist the urge to watch it and maybe have a good laugh. But it was not funny. Exactly the stupid kind of "Is not it totally scary and incredibly cool?! I can turn any crap into 23!" dialogue I was afraid of. As soon as the son started screaming, I knew this movie sucked, no matter what. But I almost never stop watching a movie I started. I sat through it. I like pain. <br /> <br /> The film pretends to mock numerology under the guise of showing how obsession can end badly. But he uses this wave as much as he should crush it. I do not see this message. I just see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify. <br /> <br /> Top this with the usual "surprises" - trying to put another twist to throw it away, this does not make sense, and you almost believe it, due to the quality of the narration up there - and you win a hollow piece of footage. It just happens to be centered around the topic that I despise. If only I did not try to be serious and it would have been a hilarious movie with actors that I do not give a damn about. But I was beginning to like Carrey ... although it's not his fault, he's trying. It is not good to even watch with a lot of friends and get the most out of it. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough that someone stumbled into them, but this movie managed to be one of the best. the worst I've ever seen.
