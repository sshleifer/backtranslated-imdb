I just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you, this movie was absolutely cheesy and cheeky. But after a certain point, I started laughing and, to tell the truth, they should classify this movie as comedy, rather than action / adventure. The most hilarious scene comes when Delon and Kennedy are looping in the 360 ​​loop to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy the Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to fire flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles ????? Dumb still funny --- the kicker comes here though --- after a shot, the malfunction of the pistol flare and Kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie . The stupid parts of this movie include the total lack of plot ---- yeah, let's take some action for 25 minutes of landing in Paris and spend ONE HOUR with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. Now let's switch to the saboteur for ten minutes, then a wasted rest from the movie and an airplane that is visually undoing and the PASSENGERS NOT THE SAME WILL SEE IT? YOUR RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES !!!! - --- final rating for this move --- (1/10) of 4 stars if it was action 2 of 4 stars if it was a comedy
