Usually I do not bother commenting on a sequence of horror movies, because it's usually assumed that they're bad, and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and enjoyable to tease / laugh at. However, this chapter of the ongoing Halloween saga came close to spoiling everything the original pictured. In the first movie, Dr. Loomis said (very incisively I might add), that Michael Myers was bad, and this tries to explain why (doing a bad job I might add). In my opinion, he was much more frightening when he was just a madman for blood starvation. The whole gothic / cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve in the Halloween equation. The result was a boring and predictable movie that was not scary or bad enough to be funny.
