... when we all know, nobody likes the BBC. Being an avid fan of that kind of Sunday night watching, I was looking forward to it. How disappointed I was! In the first thirty seconds I did not think it looked promising and after two minutes I was finding it difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> However, my friends and I persist only to find bad intentions and a complete misunderstanding of half the characters. The plot was rushed to the extreme and the makeups and dressy robes and much of the 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style. This modern style may have been placed within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous cinematography, but unfortunately we have not achieved either. The direction seemed decidedly sloppy for both the performance and the choice of shot. <br /> <br /> After 30 minutes, we could not watch and leave renting 'The Prestige' (which is very good) Maybe it's unfair that I judge this as I have watched so little of it but rarely felt so Thank you to warn people not to watch something! However, myself and my friends thought the house and umbrellas were pretty, but this is as good as it gets.
