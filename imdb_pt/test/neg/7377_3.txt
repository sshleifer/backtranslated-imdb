This show was performed live across the country with a wide variety of casts. I saw him for the first time in Provincetown's first summer production in P-town (2001) - before, oddly enough, he was banned from that overwhelmingly gay resort (codes that have resulted in his closure have already changed). I saw this again later in the off-Broadway, long-running production in New York. Strangely, the production of city P was much better than New York's - cooler, fancier, more lively, and funnier - but that was only at the 2001 screening; Subsequent attempts to clone production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were definitely third category. This filmed production features a Los Angeles production cast, and is, as other reviews have suggested, not the best. I would rate it somewhere between the 2001 top-notch production of P-town and the third rate of the P-town show's "Bare Naked Lads" last summer.
