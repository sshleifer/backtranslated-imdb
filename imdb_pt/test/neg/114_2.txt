I saw the Mogul Video VHS of that. This is one of those old distributors of the 1980s whose catalog I would like to have! <br /> <br /> This movie was very poor. Although entitled "Do not look in the attic", the main warning that is repeated is "do not go to the village". Just staying on the grounds of the village is a bad idea. A character does not enter the attic until an hour after the movie, and in fact should have done so earlier because of what is learned there. The movie begins in Turin, Italy, in the 1950s. Two men are struggling, and one woman is saying that the village is making them do it. One man kills the other, then repents, and the woman pulls the knife and stabs him with it. She runs away from the village and, after she leaves, a chair moves by itself (what's the point?), But when in the garden a hand goes up and drags it to the ground. <br /> <br /> From there, it's the present day, thirty years later. There is a session that pops up suddenly and does not seem to have anything to do with the movie. The children of the prologue woman are inheriting the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men in the prologue seems to reappear as another character as well. She is haunted by some warnings not to go to the village, but everyone does it, because if they do not use it, they lose the opportunity. People die. An attorney who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The end is very poor. Why was the family cursed? A sadly boring film. <br /> <br /> There is a small, entertaining caveat on the back of the video box that says, "The scenes depicted on this pack may be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film." film. "In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that more or less accurately represents the aforementioned woman dragged into the underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different. has nothing to do with the movie.I also remember seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie prediction scale, where movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos had at least one point for that.
