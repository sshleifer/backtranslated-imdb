Thank God this was not renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, although popular (God knows why) has a very simple - 'Look I found another body behind the flowers / shrubs / trees / wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time the plot of this series. The dialogue is so simple, it's as if this had been written for children - talking to the viewer and explaining every point in the plot. <br /> <br /> They simply "happen" when someone does something out of the ordinary - and nobody notices them. Every time they investigate and investigate someone's murder, they stand in the way of everyone - messing up everyone's lives - including those completely innocent. <br /> <br /> They break down and enter people's homes, stealing items and evidence (even firearms) by being intrusive and entering people's lives, spying on them and examining their things. They never apologize, are never caught or arrested (and if they do, they can talk about it, even if another character who does the same is put in prison !!!). <br /> <br /> They always come up with trumps. Now I know this is an easy series, but I think realistically this should not have passed the first few episodes! Simply put, it's unrealistic. <br /> <br /> I think they found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the mainland (where they are every two weeks), so I hope it never comes back. The ITV should have some action on the screen instead of all the years of monotony - "someone was murdered at the village fair - again" series of types.
