I think if you like snow boarding you can get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks. but that's all the movie has to offer. the plot is non-existent, and any jokes that may have been in the movie were not funny, even on a sympathetic level. I also did not like the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) did his best, and for a comedy like this does not have to be much, but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this good movie. but I should not be too hard on them, for all I know they can have great skill, but with a screenplay that I could have written in ten minutes, what skills they had were run and hidden for fear of appearing in this movie . . my advice is do not watch, I wish I never did!
