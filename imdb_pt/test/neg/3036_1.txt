Sorry this movie was a bad done for the TV movie. Are the rest of you drugged when you watched? I thought the hair, makeup and characters were poor two-dimensional types. The story is dubious, especially since all the main characters are dead or almost dead. I do not think I'm doing well ... what was with that hair on the head of the Turtles? It looked badly glued, and the ribs looked like they were going to fall at any moment. It did not look like something new was revealed in the band's history and how members met other bands and people. I laughed all the time, Frank Zappa looked stupid, just like Mama Cass, and the Beatles as well. They were meant to look stupid and ridiculous. Also the other people in the band like Jim Morrison, Donovan also had great success in looking stupid as well. Kind of terrible, if that's how you remember those people. It's a poor history lesson about music, it's fictional as it was made.
