All I can say is that this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which means there are no solid characters, no particular style, poor acting on all kinds of sex suggested but no breasts and tushs (because boy, that would just catapult the movie into the depths of the sleaze, would not it?), but sex heavily simulated, well, alright. <br /> <br /> When I watch these movies, I have to ask myself: when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers grow? I think these companies are really behind schedule. They really have no idea what the younger generation is in sync and whether they knew they would require us to change. The main point of many American TV channels like these seems to largely regurgitate the same sanitized and dilute garbage as a generic line of filmmaking. I think it works for them ... or at least it does. Not sure about the future though. <br /> <br /> Do not be bored to death like I did. Look for some TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and does not need to ask a priest what they can or can not show.
