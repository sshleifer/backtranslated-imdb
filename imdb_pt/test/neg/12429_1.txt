Something strange is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, not cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills the Scots! What is this movie?! First, I love reading stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was an inexpensive trait of jaws. No. It was terrible! The story was useless, the acting was 100% rubbish, the only plus side was the mechanical Nessie they wore. It was full of inaccuracy, wrong places and all bad. Not worth it, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) you found. On the second note, this movie was filmed in Cailifornia, not at Loch Ness, a big surprise for Nessie fans.
