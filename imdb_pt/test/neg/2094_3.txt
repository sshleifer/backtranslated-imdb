Not to be confused as Samuel L. Jackson's highly praised vehicle SNAKES ON A PLANE; SNAKES ON A TRAIN is low budget, does not have actors (to speak), but some pretty decent visual effects. An attractive young woman (Julia "Rayanne" Ruiz) does not want to marry someone's choice for her husband; then she is put under a mighty Mayan curse that has snakes brewing inside her body, slowly devouring from the inside out. His only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in Texas. Time is running out for her; and she is put on a train from El Paso to Los Angeles. In a short time, the snakes are leaving their body sinking pain and growing rapidly in size. The passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon will be snacks for the snakes. The final sequel is undoubtedly the best of this 91 minute film. They also receive representation credit: Alby Castro, Al Galvez and Giovanni Bejarno.
