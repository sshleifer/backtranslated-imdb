This is possibly the worst of the worst. I am a big fan of the horror movie industry and I can believe that this movie was allowed to be made. The acting was juvenile and the story completely stupid. The camera work was also juvenile. A scene that comes to mind is out of a store. It's night and you can see the moon, but all the characters have shadows that are thrown at the wall. There was no street light to see. A character is destroyed at one point, but can resurface after withdrawing from a post. Let's go!!! It looked like I was watching a high school play. I kept waiting for the characters to wave to the members of the camera family and the mouth "Hi Mom". I can only give you two positive comments ... it's over and it was good for a laugh. Please do not rent this movie !!!!
