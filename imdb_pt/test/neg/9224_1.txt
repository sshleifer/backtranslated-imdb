This is really a spectacularly bad movie, but it's the rare kind of wickedness that is endlessly entertaining! I want to add to the other comments about this movie. <br /> <br /> The "rock band" on the plane looks like three skinny drunks working casual wearing more wigs. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the serious problem of continuity with the child's plush tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back; is unclean or clean depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! The stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the child (and the writers)! <br /> <br /> The vision of little Jimmy floating in the Amazon in a coffin, grabbing his stuffed and screaming tiger will stay permanently in the coffin. your memory. Listen to one of the most inept sound effects of all time: at the end of the story, when the priest is trying to find Jimmy, the guide demands his monk's robes as payment - the priest falls to his knees on one knee. moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "BONNNNG" of a church bell, but the "ringing" of a bell of a boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is an absolute pio watch.
