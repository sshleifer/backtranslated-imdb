I have to say that this movie was not what I expected. Even though I have not read the book, the fact that plants can be a bait and then waiting for a death to happen just to be dragged from a corpse to lunch is the worst case scenario anyone has ever invented. With the ruins of the title, you would think that, for 3000 years, some kind of deity or animal or ancient god would be to blame. This is like another primeval movie where you would think it was strange that the villagers feared more, but not a crocodile. Anyway, this movie went like this, leads you to think of Mayan or Inca folklore ruins, resulting in awakening and old god or people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect. But plants? .... come on, is not there anything else that producers can invent to impress a crowd. As for this movie, it will hit the 'b' list in no time. I have to say that some of the blood was great to see, but it did not make up for the rest of the movie. And a plant mimicking the sound of a cell phone or the voice of people is too much to be believed. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereotypical fan that depends only on gore or mechanical effects. I rely heavily on suspense and what the next scene will bring for more suspense. It had a better story than that. Even the ring made me jump for more, but the ruins are just that ... ruined for using a plant to persuade the victims to kill or be killed by the villagers. The premise was good for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blowtorch and many napalm can easily do the trick to end the pesky plants with an eating disorder.
