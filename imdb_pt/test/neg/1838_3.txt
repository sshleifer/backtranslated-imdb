I was looking forward to this movie, as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie and finally a European movie. So maybe my expectations were high. <br /> <br /> It starts with a very quiet horror / shock sequence, but leaves you in the following scenes, where the plot begins to be presented, as the acting and the motivation / life of the characters does not reveal itself better than any "made for TV" drama. It continues like this to the end. <br /> <br /> On the horror part of the movie, it's certainly a good idea and different, but ALL the scenes are of the "seen before" type. <br /> <br /> Overall, my idea of ​​this movie is that it had a good concept, which was inserted into a mediocre story, poor acting and less than tolerable plot holes. <br /> <br />
