It's amazing how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being disgusting. For those of you who appreciate meticulous special effects and inconceivable detail in every scene, you'll watch this movie with admiration. Simply because Predator Island does not contain any of that. It's a redundant remake of all the horror monster movies over the last two decades. Now I enjoy the bad horror movies, they have a certain sense of humor in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will therefore be involved in the Worship Hall of Fame, then my first suggestion is to find some imagination / creativity and get some talent. Oh, and a few extra bucks to put on your photo. <br /> <br /> One tradition of the horror film was to shock the public with violent and bloody deaths. However, the shock does not occur for more than a few seconds. To really evoke a satisfactory reaction from the audience, there should be character development, some identifiable traits. I know, you're probably saying that this guy is not providing anything clever to the filmmakers, he's just stating an amateur remark. Well, that shows how amateur these filmmakers are. <br /> <br /> Despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a positive side. Dan Gordon's performance as Chris is splendid. He is given nothing to work on in a screenplay and yet he is able to come out of that movie looking like a star. Of all the actors, he is the only one who believes what he is reciting. It not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with, but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can go through the rest of the movie. Gordon shows a genuine talent and the ability to perform quality work and overcome a huge obstacle, which is the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon will be a star, hopefully sooner or later. I mean, if he can get away from movies like that that will hold him.
