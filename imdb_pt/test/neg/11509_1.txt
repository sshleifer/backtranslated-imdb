Of course Sadie sucks big time, I have no idea what people were thinking when they wrote this crap. That's not funny, it's not handsome in any way or form, it's just disturbing and a waste of money. Sadie is such a bad actor. I lost all my brain cells watching this show, honestly it seemed like this show is forced, it was a huge pile of advertisements. <br /> <br /> This show sucks. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time and money, do not bother to see this crap. The characters are so stupid and ridiculous. In the first season, it's just stupid and stupid, so when I saw Season Two I just could not take it anymore, it made me want to kill Charlotte Arnold. The second season is absolutely a disgrace to Disney. This show is also a racist piece of **
