It is one of the imponderables of independent low budget cinema that so many with so little in terms of real talent imagine themselves scared. The shortage of talent evidenced by these aspiring wannabees is there for the whole world to see. Case in point: FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (or, as I quickly realized, SHITE OF THE LIVING DEAD). There is nothing wrong with paying homage to your heroes. I've done this many times over the years, myself, in many different ways. In fact, in the book xlibris THE NIGHT RIDERS, co-written with M. Kelley, I dedicate it in part to the "six writers whose work still inspires me: Richard Matheson, Harlan Ellison, Shirley Jackson, Edgar Allen Poe, HP Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard. " If it were a movie, I would have dedicated it to the directors whose films inspired me over the years. High on that list would be George Romero. It's nothing short of a shame that the creators of this movie have not been as inspired by Romero as the title suggests.
