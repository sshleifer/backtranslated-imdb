For the past 5 years, I've rented some bad movies ... completely on purpose. You see, I aspire to be a movie critic and, as we all know, there are horrible movies released every year. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented this one. I watched it all the way ... and I cried profusely. This is one of those movies that is so bad it makes you want to vomit. In fact, it put a sick feeling in my stomach. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000, anyone?), But that's what takes the cake. The plot was difficult to follow, the horrible lighting and the almost inaudible sounds. If there was a negative rating on the scale here, this movie would be at -11 for me. This may sound strange, but I strongly recommend it. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but do not say I did not warn you. I do not think this review could get more accurate, so I'm ready now. <br /> <br />
