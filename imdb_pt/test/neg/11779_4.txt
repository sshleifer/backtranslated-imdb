This movie, which I just discovered in the video store, apparently stayed for a few years without a distributor. It's easy to see why. The story of two friends who live in New York looking for their high school friend who is now homeless under the boardwalk on Coney Island has flashes of being a very good movie but ultimately is pondered by the story focusing on Stan and Daniel , instead of his homeless friend Richie. Cryer is, as usual, very good and the film has a pretty cool look with the ghostly images of Coney Island. However, writer Cryer and director Richard Schenkman are very busy dealing with the rather uninteresting lives of Stan and Daniel, instead of concentrating on Richie. A flashback at a music store where Richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this movie could have gone. But in the end, not much. Two scenes drawn from annoyance, such as inside the Skeeball building. RATING 4 out of 10.
