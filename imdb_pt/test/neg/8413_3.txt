For a movie that has gained so much recognition and appreciation, this spinoff for "Rosemarys Baby" is a big mistake. It begins that Andrew / Adrian whatever his name because he is so confused that he does not know who he is more escapes of a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she was the mother his. The acting is terrible, since Andrew grows up at twenty and looks terrible with his face sunk, never having smiled and seen Dukes of Hazard clothes more like a drunk than the son of Satan. In fact, all he does is drink and cling to himself as he tries to deal with his past and with the last memory of his mother driving on a bus shouting at him. He meets a friend who seems to be an angel but he is quickly killed and is electrified in a mountain scene in which he looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew gets cought and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he is really the son of Satan. Your dumb I miss the test and rises from the alter shining with my makeup and heels from the stage of a nightclub and dance like a crack clown !!! This scene is memorable and worth watching. The ending is terrible and a little predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. Do not see this piece of garbage or lose respect for the first part.
