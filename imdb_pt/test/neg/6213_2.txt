This movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. I would not call it film, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished and unfinished stories that are not so funny. There are several characters in the movie who seemed important at the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. He's just trying very hard to fit everything in two and a half hours. I left the show without thinking about what happened to this guy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is just an extended version of "Hitch," with many more characters and dancing. <br /> <If this is the best movie this couple ever made, then I'm sure I'm not interested in any of their previous films.
