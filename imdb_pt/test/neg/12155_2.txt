The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, I always thought something really interesting happened afterwards. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the film touched have beautiful scenery, but the film did not take advantage of that. The jokes are really bad. The narrator, Gingesh himself, could have told a little more about the history of Mongolia, traditions, etc. My co-spectator knew nothing about it, so he was a bit lost. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was very disappointed after all. It was one of the three movies I've seen in the movies, where I thought about leaving before the end.
