Despite the famous cast, this animated version of Dickens's tale is the most important I've ever seen. Enough for me to zapping in the first trade interval. The characters have not attracted me and the animation is looking cheap. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a very low rating. Give me the Disney version anytime.
