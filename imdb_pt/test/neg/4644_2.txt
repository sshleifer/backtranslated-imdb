It is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie - this is no exception. <br /> <br /> I'm not a tug lover, but his incredibly simplistic view of the world and his ability to reduce everything to black and white, as well as making events (even fictitious in novels) fit into an agenda that has little or no relation to complexity of any kind is extremely irritating. <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than what was delivered by this awful film mix. <br /> It's really sad for those who will never read Smith. They will be left with a less than decent portrayal of their Egyptian series, what should be said is gigantic in their exposition. <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones movies were grumpy. To try to replicate this, manipulating Smith's novels in this production, he errs for a rural mile. <br /> <br /> Pathetic, except for photography and Art Malik.
