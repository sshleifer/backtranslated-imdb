Proud to be Dutch, I'm truly shocked by movies like this. Because? Why this cheap acting? Why this storyline that just sucks? Why a dozen sequels? Why the why? they add a lot of hot Dutch girls in an effort to save this movie from redemption, and guess what? all Dutch minor breezergirlies will see. I was forced to attend a party. all the girls were going crazy when Daan Schuurmans came on the screen, everyone grabbed another beer and grumbled ... But what really bothers me is the fact that this type of film is the only kind of film that Dutch filmmakers can do. produce ... (besides "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority in relation to other countries. That adds nothing to our imagination ... It's just F ** ks up to the brains of 13-year-old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you burn forever!
