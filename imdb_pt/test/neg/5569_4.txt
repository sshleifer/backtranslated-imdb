I really wanted to like this movie, because it's refreshingly different from the hordes of day-to-day horror movie clones, and I appreciate that the filmmakers are trying something original. Unfortunately, the storyline simply did not hold together and neither character was pleasant enough for me to really care about them or their destiny. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Toybox was very interesting. The director made a lot of rather risky moves, like adding little pieces of animation (looking like Flash) into parts and actually shocking some of the special effects (like the light of a certain amulet). Sometimes this worked and sometimes did not work, but he deserves praise for the attempt, and cinematography was usually of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when that same approach of throwing too many things on the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot, the results were not very good. The film never finds a tone it likes, moving schizophrenically from the comedy of dark humor to the family novel, to the wizarding movie of the 80s, to nostalgia from childhood to the terror of distressed family. Taken on their own, pieces of each of these elements work reasonably well, but nothing is coherent in a satisfactory whole. Also, large chunks of the plot are never really explained. I'm not a person who likes to have everything for me, and I like movies that let things to the public to decide, but the parts that stayed out of The Toybox seem to have run out of money before they could explain them or they they really would not think of things to begin with. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the director's next project, as I think there's a lot of talent lurking here, but I really can not recommend The Toybox on its own merits.
