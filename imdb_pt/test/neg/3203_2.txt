struggling to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this movie falls into two of them. It really happens in space - but it's neither funny nor scary. The plot is discouraging and the only joke about the computer intellect is exaggerated to the death. Saying that Paul Whitthorne as Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert make the best of their ham script. The homo-schematic relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is suggested, but never explored, while the attempted sexual tension between Frank and Rick is so crude as to be laughable. In short, this is a turkey that is best suited for late night tv, preferably while passing through.
