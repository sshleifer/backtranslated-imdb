The film is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice landscape. The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring bikes race. The end when the Caribbean drowns is a definitive Hollywood proposition. There is no definite plot. It goes from the Venezuelan scenery to an easy rider robbery to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going mad for some reason that succeeds in the end. A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes from Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who made some very good movies. Like all actors, they all need to have at least one bad movie. Do not waste the $ 5.00 on the DVD.
