This is a little movie that is well worth to find and see. <br /> <br /> He really talks about all the worldly choices we all make everyday and (like a story of HG Welles that I can not remember) can live to want back. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly, but just as you begin to think it has become boring = bang = it's over. And, believe me, the 'punch line' is the one you'll remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the producers will make it available for purchase - or available on the web, but anyway you'd be glad you took the time to get a copy - that's for sure.
