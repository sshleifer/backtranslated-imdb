I am obviously disappointed, so I will be brief and will not waste your time. Firstly, the plot was uninspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we are in 2008 for the love of God and it looked like a brighter version of G.I.Joe. I will not bother to characterize actor performance and dialogue. Or maybe I have seen that to post a comment here you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where we were? Ah, yes, the performance, well, it was totally flat, without passion and talent, if you'll excuse me. Now, as for the dialogues, as well as the acting, without memorable quotes, nothing that one would not expect. Let's just hope the movie is decent ... at least.
