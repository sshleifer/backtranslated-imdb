I agree with several of you that this movie was quite annoying and annoying. I found myself disliking the main character and the following actors / actresses who came in the scenes. The camera work was not pleasant in itself. Random shots and unstable movie scenes made me very angry and I hung up the movie. I will make up for my time by looking at the 1999 adaptation and I hope it fits well with Sense and Sensibility; Emma; Becoming Jane; and Pride and Prejudice. I have only a few others to watch beyond these movies, but I believe they were made with great taste. The song was kind of out of place with the movie too, reminding me of another show I had seen this year. It was called Hex and a BBC show. I found one night on the web. I really enjoyed the first season, but the second season was dry and taking things out of nowhere that should stay with the clouds. I found the main male character who was Henry in this movie out of place. Maybe I just do not like the way you talk or your height. Well, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they left it dumb and wanted to see the fashion of the day or the way the houses were kept at the time. Once again I'm going to watch the 1999 version and hope it's better and make Jane Austen some justice to her writing.
