This movie I am not totally funny, and I imagine to be quite offensive to the Jewish people. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? Firstly, the whole movie portrays the protagonist Zucker as a thief / crook running shady deals and deals while his son is gay, his daughter is a lesbian and his niece is a prostitute. Then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family, first his daughter with Joshua and Jana, and then his son with his niece. Two incestuous relationship running with family. I'm surprised they did not add the plot of having a mentally handicapped in the family ... Now this would really complete the sub-human ideal Nazi! (gay, lesbian, Jewish ...) <br /> <br /> Totally disgusting movie. It surprises me that this film has no response from any Jewish community.
