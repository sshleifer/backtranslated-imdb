On a Thursday night at 10:00 PM, my local West Coast ABC affiliate exhibited the pilot episode of "Northern Exposure." The ABC Network usually displays "Men In Trees" at that time, but the program was anticipated for a live sporting event. <br /> <br /> Although both shows are set in Alaska and filmed in the Pacific Northwest (Exposition in Washington State, Trees, Vancouver, BC), re-watching "Northern Exposure" (as well as a few episodes of "Sex and the City") reminds me how disappointed I am with the hybrid "Men in Trees". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right stuff. Unfortunately, her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in Alaska irritates my nerves. Maybe because I think Heche is miscast, I'm not convinced of his "fish out of water" character. <br /> <br /> I also can not help but feel that the support cast fits the typical peculiar stereotypes. The warm-looking place, the gentle bar owner, the jungle pilot, the local cops, the dark but well-meaning radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that may have been broken was the teddy bear. and veteran "ER" actor Abraham Benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women. Considering that one of the executive producers is filmmaker James Mangold, (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" had main characters who were big men), so I'm not surprised because Benrubi was cast for a non-typical role. > <br /> However, I can see why there are many dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It fits in the niche peculiar to the television audience. I wished the show could find its own voice rather than lend ideas to better shows.
