I've seen a lot of horror movies, splatter and monsters in my life. And of course, too many monster movies from the 50s and 60s. When I first hit, I thought this is from the 60s until I recognize it's 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, the character of Jack Brook is interesting and acting is a good splatter movie, but .... I expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about an aggressive maneuver. The movie runs 80 minutes and I think the first death is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, the reason the monsters come in takes at least 3 minutes ... and we have another 20 minutes of boring dialogue and finally, in my opinion, not that well-managed sequence of splatters. Although we have Robert Englund starring here I only recommend this to true hardcore horror fans.
