While watching this movie, I felt as if a plastic bag was closing slowly around my head. The acting was horribly stifling and it was bad acting. The most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play in the coffin of a state-in-a-coffin. I felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. I was hoping that this movie was a real tragedy, with a deep psychological intrigue after the movie. Everything around was stupid, with no beginning, no climax, no end, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. Let's become real here. This is a horrible movie.
