I was an extra in that movie, the part that was filmed at the airport in the first 15 minutes; I was one of the refugees from Bangladesh (mostly Mexicans) running off the runway at Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point, standing around our turbans while we waited for another shot, one of my extras extras turned to me wondered what the move would be. I told him it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just like a musical. There was a long pause, so he replied, "Man, this movie is going to suck." Very perceptive of him, I thought. I had fun and made a little money, but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie, I can not keep the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the movie "The Swarm", you can get the idea. You get to see a lot of famous and talented people squandered on an idea that in the face of it is just BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money into a movie and hire big enough names then a good story and good writing is not necessary. Just turn the big handle and the product comes out. Not worth watching.
