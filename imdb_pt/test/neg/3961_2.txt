The dog may act ... unfortunately, no one else in the cast of this sordid faux child movie can. A mutt, but very clever dog, he insinuates himself into the lives of two sons without a mother, much to the chagrin of his bitter father and cold heart. In what can only be described as Dickensian, the evil widower prohibits his children - who may or may not be mentally challenged - from playing with Benji. Neither the children nor Benji obey. Soon the children are kidnapped and Benji has to help the police find them. It is only then that the old man realizes that Benji is good, not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom Lester, whose only previous acting experience seems to have played the obscure Eb in GREEN ACRES, plays one of the hijackers. . The same goes for the woefully overused Deborah Walley. Walley's previous triumphs include BEACH BLANKET BINGO and the regrettable IT'S A BIKINI WORLD. She has also played with Gidget and Tammy in the past and here she tries to destroy her reputation as a good girl by playing badly! <br /> <br /> Stay away from BENJI ... he's a dog and this movie is a dog!
