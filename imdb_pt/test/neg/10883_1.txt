Seriously folks ... I was getting ready to actually write the Razzie Council and recommend this film as Razzie Champ for 2007 ... until I got on the wiki and realized that its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. Seriously , this movie could easily have been a Razzie champion. This movie sucks! As in the world this crap was neglected, even for a nomination Razzie in 2006 is beyond me, because I could easily have competed with It Stinks, Too for the Razzie Championship of 2006. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie on the recommendation of a neighbor of mine who told me, "Oh my God, after watching this movie, it will be a long time, until I stop at a rest stop again!" I could not believe how scary and horrible this movie was! Possible spoilers below, not that you're missing out on anything. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all ... the problem ... the rest stops. Obviously, the director of this crap does not know anything about women. The bathrooms at that rest stop were on the same level as Trainspotting. I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing I know is that women, for the most part, are total and complete hygiene / pure freaks. Given the choice between taking crap in any of these toilets and possibly picking up something or squatting in the woods, a woman will choose to squat in the woods. I know, because I've been camping with them before, and they have no problem squatting in the woods. So, right there ... big hole in the plot and lie. <br /> <br /> Secondly ... she leaves the parade, and her boyfriend driving the car is nowhere to be found, neither he nor her car. He just left. She starts yelling her name, wondering where he is. Ummm ... hello? You're standing in the wet mud ... has it occurred to you to look at some tire brands? I mean, his car disappeared ... he did not get up and flew away. And, in fact, that makes me wonder ... Actually, I was looking at her feet, and there were no tread marks in the mud. How ... exactly ... did this happen? <br /> <br /> Third ... the Bible beating mobile home family with the dwarf freak in the back taking pictures Polaroid ... Wtf!?!?!? ? They made absolutely no sense, and it's as if the director simply plays them to be weird because of being weird. They made no sense at all and had no place in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fourth ... Oh my God, this ... anyway, ... near the end of the movie. ..she finally sees the exhaust hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop. I'm like, "You ... idiot ... bi ** h. You've been locked in this stopping spot for all this time ... and you just ... now ... see ... the Hatch I mean ... it 's like they played this just because the killer threw gasoline on the floor by the window and was preparing to light a match so she needs to get to a higher place to avoid being burned, and. Oh, look! A perfect reason for her to get to a higher place! An escape hatch on the roof! It's like ... Why did not she go through that first? Most people in that situation would have realized that the from the moment they were locked in that rest stop, they took out the Dodge fuck.When they showed that emergency exit at the end of the movie, I was like, "You have to be kidding me. > Fifth ... what was the agreement with all the people she encountered ... continuing to disappear? The girl in the broom closet in the Did the rest stop? The idiot cop? She at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet itself? This was never explained. Personally, when they did that, I would think to myself, "Oh, Christ on a cookie, it's her." She's the murderess.Marvelous.He killed all these people, does not remember doing that, and the writers of that movie only started a certain French horror film that I can not mention on the wiki or I'll be blacklisted for the ending (that movie sucked, by the way, too, people). "But it was not. She was not the killer, and all the dealing with the dead disappearing was never explained. Oh, for God's sake, people, stay away from this movie! This movie sucked balls, and I now have a serious bone to choose from with my neighbor. It's in the rack of 2 for $ 1 in Family Video, do not even rent it if someone gives it to you for free!
