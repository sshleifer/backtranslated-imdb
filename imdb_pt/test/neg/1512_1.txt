As a Christian, I found this movie completely embarrassing. The actors sucked, writing was a drug, cinematography was a drug, and the story was so typical. I could not say that this is a great testimonial tool because I would be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better things, and that's because they invest the best in it. Christians do the heavy lifting and think it's all right because "it's for you." In the Old Testament, people spent huge sums of money to bring offerings to God. David (or Saul .. I do not remember) spent what would equal about $ 50 billion in cash today in building a temple for God. But nowadays, spending what seems to be about $ 30K in making a movie to "witness" to people is just pathetic. It is the person, not the product that affects someone. Do not waste time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. If you want to make a positive impact with people, show them movies like Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc., movies that have something to say and that really come to you.
