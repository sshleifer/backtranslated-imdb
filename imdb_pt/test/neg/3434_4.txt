So I picked it up at the store where I work before launching (release is 8/21), I just watched it today, and now I'm speechless. They might have had a decent movie here, but they screwed it up in painfully obvious ways. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the parties with John Krasinski were funny, and are the only reason I gave up a 3, but they are broken by bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections on life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better, as a direct comedy, like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it because I think Krasinski is funny and I want to see him doing well. The story was not bad, just not very original. But the direction (and a lot of acting) was terrible. I swear they had trouble keeping people's faces on the scene and just kept up with it anyway. <br /> <br /> Their carelessness is shown when the gun specialist corrects another character and says a "Dirty Harry" weapon is not. 358 magnum, but a 0.45 (it was, as everyone knows, a magnum of 0.44). <br /> <br /> So, watch this if you really like John Krasinski 2. Like to watch low budget (and bad -directed) movies or 3- Have lots of time on your hands (this is me!)
