Mmmm, a previous summary says "if you like aliens and predators you'll enjoy this movie" I could not disagree more, this movie does not respect its weight lineage and reduced two of the most beloved sci fi strands to little more than a movie of teen slasher terror, has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous alien or predator movies and there is no discernible main character, I really do not care about any of the characters and I positively longed to see the stereotyped cast die as soon as possible, in the vain hope that something better would replace them, it takes a huge human incompetence to have two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented and positively fail to make an exciting thrilling movie, just watch this if you want to see how NOT to do it.
