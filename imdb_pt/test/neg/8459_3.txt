Stupid and silly movie that is basically a compilation of clips from horror, science fiction and suspense movies. There are unnecessary shots for an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among the audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror movies. Not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("horror movie helps us deal with the real horror", "you are at the mercy of the filmmaker in a theater") and very banal. Also the clips are shown very quickly and the changes are kind of dissonant. And, out of context, these bits are not too scary. And it's REAL short - I saw it in a theater in 1984 and I was outraged that I paid $ 5.00 for an 84-minute movie! <br /> <br /> Still, he's reasonably well edited and Allen and Pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves. For people who are interested in learning more about terror, this can be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fan (like me), you'll probably get bored. Good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). I give a 3.
