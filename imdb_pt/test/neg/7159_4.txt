This glorified documentary of the discovery channel, part of the Bible study, part of the treasure hunt, any misappropriation, could have fitted well into its television origins, but would become a feature film. From the first magazine cover look, one could cast doubt on the integrity behind this serious subject, shown in the front case relegating the search of Jesus' tomb to a generic source of action that looks more like National Treasure or Tomb Raider then any informed debate and examination of the historical burial site should. Such is the covert way in which the whole process revolves around. <br /> <br /> More curious child than worthy researcher, Simcha Jacobovici's explorations seem self-indulgent while her research proves to be manipulative. Despite all the fascinating revelations that this filmmaker tries to convey to his viewers through alleged evidence, a flurry of repetitive statements reiterating the same research and discoveries proves that The Lost Tomb of Jesus has very little information to back up the swollen yet fascinating assertions. . What this means is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience with the same small factual evidence in support of the authenticity of the tomb, which ironically misrepresents it. While tirelessly uniting many of these mini-coffins found together to support the theory of Jesus of Nazareth, this research offers a comprehensive approach to continuously pursue the unique obsession of this romanticized archaeologist. There may be some startling factual data that help shed some light on many traditional Christian dogmatic beliefs, but essentially the sombre nature of this project made it look like just a piece of exploration, funded at a time when The Da Vinci Code was all the rage. <br /> <br /> In the end, the art of cheese cover was right. Despite my appreciation for the documentary form, The Lost Tomb of Jesus takes an always interesting topic and turns it into a geriatric adventure hunt over time, replacing any relevance and sacredness with the uninspired motivations behind that team. By the time these tomb invaders finished their explorations, reluctantly having to stop the search because of social demands, viewers get the impression that the director insisted on forging this mystery, whether it was there to begin or not. There are some genuinely potent moments in which the corridors of history march through this documentary in unpretentious ways, but all the decoding, exploration and theorizing of the world still leaves that piece of mistaken vanity in an uncomfortable void of apathetic response.
