I watched 40 minutes and could not take it anymore ?? the television shot and I went back to a reading light "Lobotomy for beginners". It was difficult to say which aspect of this production was most unpleasant - a dialogue made entirely of bytes of sound or acting. by numbers. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to determine the period when the drama should happen. There were disposable references to Lord Nelson and to slavery, but Edmund, the future clergyman, played by Blake Ritson, was the only one who could be believed to have lived in the early nineteenth century. The other bright young women had make-up and more appropriate clothing for a 21st-century fantasy party - blonde white blonde Fanny, Billie Piper being the least credible character. <br /> <br /> UK commercial television obviously believes breasts, pouting lips and deep, meaningful looks make a good story. Fortunately, Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> If you want to discover the history of Mansfield Park, buy the DVD of the 1983 miniseries.
