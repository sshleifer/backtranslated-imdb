* POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD * I will only say what has already been said here (and will continue with the rest of WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you're going to have a match for the female title, at least make it interesting, rather than just a squash to put the defending champion. I think Moolah could not handle an intense fight, but they wanted to have the legend in a WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought the Killer Bees were wasted on WrestleManias, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after B. Brian Blair left and Jim Brunzell became a screen back. So I did not realize for a while that they were a top team, even the top candidates. <br /> <br /> But I loved to see Bill Fralic in the royal battle. He actually came to his own here by creating an arrogant heel character in a pre-game interview and even making a elimination in the actual battle. In addition to Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete of my generation with any respect for wrestling (does anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). And what about the ridiculous Hart Foundation green socks?
