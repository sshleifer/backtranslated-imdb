I love most Jet Li movies (except for Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in a VERY cheap package of three with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". While Twin Warriors was very impressive and I was completely intrigued by this, and the master was a little "Karate Kid", but also nice, I thought this movie was terrible. I'm not saying this just because I'm used to better movies. I'm saying I was almost downstairs with "Kazaam." The fighting scenes were terrible (blur cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was his typical "stupid kung-fu plot". If you're going to have such a stupid plot (see 'Man turns into woman to become all-powerful, then falls in love with Jet Li'), you better have a great fight to get on with it. If you are looking for an original movie from HK Jet Li, I suggest you rent "Shaolin Temple 2" (also known as Kids from Shaolin).
