This is the story of a news researcher who hates his work - which proves why actors - though weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and their neighbors are not! <br /> <br /> Let's say - the best moments show some basis for being really funny (not just crazy), keep trying, maybe take some classes and take the time to continue learning how to make a good movie. ("Dude, Where's My Car" and the sequel "Scary Movie" has it all ... college try.) <br /> <br /> Enlightenment was not; the production was not; and the script had moments (the talk of space - very cool trying unconvincingly performed). (This reminded me of "Dark Star" - that's about being "lost in space" - but this movie just got lost.) <br /> <br /> Talent was the bartender (he said 'dog' so annoyingly that I knew he had to be acting ... was not he? ... now this is acting!), Mark Hammond and Marty. I think I gave the film a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
