This movie has to sort down there with Ed Wood movies. A terrible and bad script, bad acting. <br /> <br /> A machine gun in front of windows; minutes pass before someone is hit and no one has cover - not a window breaks. You'd think that after a fire fight like that, the big U-Haul truck could be sifted - not a scratch. <br /> <br /> CIA agents and government contractors = yell = secret information in a cocktail party stand-up party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is not an actor you care about; everyone is superficial and basically unpleasant. <br /> <br /> A Hawaii bound 747 flies from Los Angeles and drops twenty minutes later on the Pacific "... into 100 feet of water ...". Little time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers that only two hours of air remain; on a 747? <br /> <br /> The next day, the rescue crews appear and surprisingly the six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br />
