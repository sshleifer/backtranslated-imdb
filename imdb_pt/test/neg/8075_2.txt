Stephen King TV movies can have 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why give the Stooges only 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a PBS miniseries, but would a couple have killed someone? The film rolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. I want to give a salute to the performances of the stars ... they had a hard job because they did not really look like the Stooges, but the spirit was there. After watching the movie, I took a tape of American Movie Classics that had the real deal and ridiculed me. The film was very difficult emotionally, especially after Curly had the stroke and Moe needed to keep the business going. When Curley started to cry I lost ... Like I said, the movie was good, but it could have been and should have been much, much better. It may be appropriate ... the Stooges were stolen when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
