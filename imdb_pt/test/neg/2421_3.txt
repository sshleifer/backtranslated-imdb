I am from Australia and have observed with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding the rugby union in New Zealand. I can fully appreciate the comments made by Kiwis regarding this movie. It was a total insult to a race of people and to their beloved sport. <br /> <br /> Whoever is involved in the making of this atrocious movie should apologize to anyone who has the misfortune to watch it. Note: people DO NOT kneel and cry as they slowly recite the Hakka. What a pitiful scene that was. <br /> <br /> Should we feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who almost killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from half-brained someone, then apparently saw the light? What a completely unpleasant character (with visits to children's hospitals that do nothing to rescue their despicable personality). <br /> <br /> And why are people even making a movie about Americans playing rugby? They do not even appear in the sport on the world stage, not even to justify an attempt to make a movie about it (yes, Rugby is a 'world sport', other than football and baseball)?
