The DVD of this movie is from Alpha Video - a company that almost always launches the lower quality prints. In Alpha's defense, this is often the only copy available, but the expertise is in public domain and cheap movies. If you can find another print from another company, try it first, since the printing on this film is scratched and faded. Still, compared to most Alpha DVDs, this is great - especially since the sound is pretty clear (and Alpha never seems to include closed captions - even with movies with horrible sound). <br /> <br /> A man has been dating a lady for a long time. One night, he is a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after, he cleans his bride about it, she forgives and they get married. Soon after the wedding, he gets a frantic phone call from the other woman - she NEEDS to see him and has just tried to kill herself. When they meet, he discovers she has a sexually transmitted disease and she wanted him to know he could have her as well. So while there's a nurse there and they're treating her for the suicide attempt, she somehow finds a gun and kills herself! It makes a big mistake. He does not tell the doctor and does not tell his new wife. Some time passes and now she and the baby are infected! At this point the doctor meets the guy and talks about the importance of receiving treatment and shows him rooms full of horribly infected people (in fact, they were just movies of people with STIs that they inserted in the movie - most of whom have syphilis ). <br /> <br /> In a way, the film is very progressive. It addresses a serious issue and it is interesting how the movie encourages couples NOT to expect to get married, but marry fast and indulge in those sexual urges - but only with one another (not bad advice). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it is talking about. They never use the terms STD, VD or similar, nor name the diseases. She is often referring to syphilis but at other times is talking about herpes or other sexually transmitted diseases - the information is not very clear or specific - a problem very common with movies of that time. The audience at the time must have been pretty confused about what they were seeing, and many of the most naive probably needed some of their "faster" friends to explain everything to them! Speaking of "such films" in the 1930s and 1950s, many small filmmakers filmed the dangers of drugs and sex (though often they really wanted to promise a little cheesecake to the public that usually could not see such a sassy fare in Hollywood movies). Many of them are hysterically funny, as they are far outdated and the information is so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both from the same two-bit producer), and compared to how fussy and stupid those two films are, this cheap movie looks like it should be on the Criterion Collection !! <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, there are weird out there (I would definitely be included among them) who like to watch the movies because they are often so bad and so horribly made that they are a lot of fun. This, however, is not so bad, neither the message that is complicated and the film of the victims is not as grotesque as some similar films. Although the message really should have been more explicit and helpful, for a 1933 film it is very good - despite the occasional poor acting and ridiculous suicidal scene. Remember children - just say 'NO' to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh by the way, the "two years of treatment" they talked about in the movie was actually the syphilis rule in 1933. Nowadays it is much more treatable - just like the rest of STDs.
