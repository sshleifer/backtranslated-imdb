Take that from me as a camera man who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and after Warner Bros. and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, that sucks. Of course it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a home party, but trying to sell it on a DVD is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I've seen evil acting in my day, but that's not acting. The hero is almost laughable and he really thinks it's something that judges his comments on the specials. I hate to see your fan club. Old movies did not match action in many of the scenes. What the hell was that garden scene with three of the worst actresses? I've never seen a garden on a ship. They could not even thrill. I would not mind if they could have a single ounce of acting, but the only one was the guy with the Translvanians accent. I'm sorry, but this is not a clever movie, as some people are saying. I think fans of horror movies would be insulted by this piece of film.
