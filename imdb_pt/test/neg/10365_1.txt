This movie is delayed a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for marijuana but none of them is just a bunch of junk Thomas Hayden church should not drive more especially this movie which is a waste of film. People who liked this movie gave good comments, but of all the people here, some are just retarded and do not watch movies, so they think any bad movie is good, the actors suck and the movie sucks. I think a lot of people will be upset because this movie tries to make it look like the definitive weed movie when it's just the worst marijuana movie I've ever seen I hope people prevent the director from driving crap as this even the weed can not make this movie funny or funny.
