When King Kong pulled off his top in the 1976 remake, I was out of breath. I do not know how many times I came back to see the movies expecting to see more. Jessica Lange was not a great actress then (she became one), but she was so hot! I went to see "Sweet Dreams" when she left because at that time, Lange had become a great actress. It sounded like a wonderful story. And it is always exciting to see. <br /> <br /> I never left a movie faster. My wife agreed. When we got in the car, I turned to her and said, "If you'd told me I'd be bored watching Jessica Lange take off her clothes, I would have said I was bored watching Jessica Lange take off her clothes ! How bad is it?
