Three delinquents disturb the tomb of a former sorcerer who, after summoning Jack-O (a pumpkin-threatening figure) to dispatch these thugs, continues in his sworn revenge to kill all the decedents of the family that have slaughtered him. This includes young Sean Kelly and his love family of horror. Of course it's up to Sean to find a way to save the day. <br /> <br /> A film B of such a low budget. The acting is atrocious and the plot is not much better. Add an extremely lame killer, a potential pedophile who laughs too hard, and a stereotyped pair of cardboard "conservatives," and you have that movie in a nutshell. It is not worth saving to see how Linnea is aging. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always good for some T & A and she does not disappoint here with a long bath scene; Rachel Carter also topless (although it can be a double body) <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
