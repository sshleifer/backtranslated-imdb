On paper, this sounds like a good movie. Michael Caine plays a tough and relentless boxing promoter who is the son of a title eliminator. The pity is that when the story is transferred from the paper to the screen of my television, it loses everything. I hoped we could be seen emulating your definitive role in GET CARTER and as the movie progresses it seems to have the qualities of a tough revenge thriller but the whole pitch of the movie jumps so much you'll be confused as to the genre you're trying to fit in. For example, Caine (who you can not believe as Billy "Shiner" Simpson, he's simply Michael Caine) has a chuckle when he refers to someone as "Hattie Jacques" then at a supposedly humorous moment his henchmen break someone's arm . Oh how I laughed. I mean, it's to make a laugh the way you play it, right? But that seems to be at odds with the way the rest of the film unfolds. Obviously, director John Irvin does not know what approach to take with Scott Cherry's screenplay. Irvin is not a bad director and is well regarded by his war films as THE DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but he is ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can not help but feel that he may have been somewhat intimidated by a living legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression that he's just doing it for the money and the familiar faces in supporting roles like Landua and Cranham are basically special appearances that could be interpreted by anyone.
