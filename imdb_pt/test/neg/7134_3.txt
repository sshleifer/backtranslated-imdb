I liked the first The Grudge. This really scared me and there was something that made me want to see it twice. That something was missing in this sequence. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing really in your mind. They are people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says "boo." And most of the time, it was not nearly as scary. <br /> <br /> In terms of scenery, this movie is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but they did not give her anything to do, and Karen's death seemed very unsatisfactory because she came so fast. I was also disappointed with Kayako's mother subplot. I was thinking that she could provide some way to fight the rancor, but she dies in the hands - hair? - Kayako. That was such a stupid twist. In short, it's hard to feel that the characters you know from the first minute will die. All in the same way. And there's nothing they can do. It does not seem like a cruel fate waiting for them. It's just annoying because you know what's going to happen. If they had anything to fight, it would have added suspense, even if they failed. If there were any hope, that would make the scares more justified. Now you're just waiting for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her many times and it took a bit of her. I was still scared during some scenes, but I really got used to the huge eye and the blue face. Manufacturers obviously realized this would happen by adding other scary ghosts. Yes, I was scared at the school psychologist scene - even if I knew where I was going as soon as she said "I've been to the house." A nice touch. Toshio, however, was not at all scary in this movie. I was much more frightened of the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and an empty stare that sometimes appeared in the first film. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters looked really unnecessary - the notorious milk scene with the girl whose name I can not even remember comes to mind. I was not scared, it was just "Huh?" I'm not sure if the students were really needed. Karen could have brought the grudge to the US with her. He could have killed people related to his life, everyone at the funeral or something. Even so, it would have been monotonous to watch all of them die, but being introduced to so many unrelated people was really annoying. He hated the "I will not call you mother" scene. Aubrey's mother's troubles were equally boring. The boy was a moving character, however. <br /> <br /> Ju-On's sequel was far more frightening than this. It had some twists - dreams and reality becoming much more obscure, for example - and even if that made me completely sad, I was also somehow content. I have to think a little and wonder. This movie only provided cheap scares.
