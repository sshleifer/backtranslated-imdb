This is a bad movie. There is no denying it as much as I would like. Tommy Lee Jones is as good as possible with the script they gave him, and he had some decent action sequences that really seemed out of place because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line, someone imagined that all the shortcomings of the script could be counterbalanced if they hired every actor in the job market, unfortunately even truly talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald and Pruitt Taylor Vince. and let's not forget that Mr. Jones himself can not fix the wooden dialogue, and entangle the progression that went absolutely nowhere. <br /> <br /> In fact, at one point I looked up, certain that the movie was running for the last 2 hours only to find out that I was 51 minutes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most painful point of the film has been the subplot on the Confederate soldiers ghosts that seem to be of little or no help to the story. Different from a little retract the confusing business at the end with the image. * If you have not seen this movie disregard this past statement that may sound tempting and you know it is not, you will not understand it better after watching the movie. The most interesting thing about this movie may be that it actually is a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Prisoners," starring Alec Baldwin in the same role played by Tommy Lee Jones in this movie. I may have to watch now, first to see if it's as bad as In The Mist, and secondly because I can not (no matter how hard I try) break my passion for Alec Baldwin.
