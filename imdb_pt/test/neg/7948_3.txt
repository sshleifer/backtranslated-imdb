Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's just forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken completely by their own merits The assault is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are stuck at a decadent police station in Detroit (If the Detroit spot is giving you Robocop's hot and fuzzy stopping now.He could have easily told Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed.In fact, the last bit in the forest would have made more sense.) Around them are our bandits; corrupt cops. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you're thinking. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and the drug cartels busy that weekend? Of course these are not ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of the latest video game Tom Clancy. Yes, we have body armor; helicopters; laser sight; Night vision goggles the works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. members / Special Forces armed to the teeth verses 4 policemen (drunken mind you're new year's eve), 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> So, how do our heroes defend themselves? The truth is they can not. They must all be dead in ten minutes. (Not to mention that the characters inside have an annoying habit of going through the windows.) Now, an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan an esp movie. a B-style action movie. However, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed to be a comic relief. (At least I hope they have been) <br /> <br /> While Ja-Rules and the Leguizamo characters are bad enough. It's Aisha Hind's minstrel show taking the cake. Rarely has a more stereotypical African-American character appeared on the modern screen. His performance resembles a frat boy on the blackface and dragging the acting ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original assault, a gang member takes over an ice cream truck and drives around the neighborhood throwing little girls in the head. I've had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks ever since. After this assault, I have a perfectly rational fear of remakes.
