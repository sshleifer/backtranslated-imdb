This program would be useful for training basic human emotions in hardened criminals. In addition to this purpose, the program has no value other than to fill the bandwidth that would not otherwise be used in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip incessantly draining the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, useful and frequent music tips will tell viewers how they should feel if they can not fully internalize the predictable and superficial plot. I found Amy a superficially positive character as she is an example to young women who can serve in traditionally male fields. Unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by any capricious personal guidelines Amy chooses to employ, resulting in Amy's trials more like appeals to personal mercy from a tribal despot than a true administration of justice. This show is inedible in any amount, although this is somewhat mitigated after two episodes by the god-given filtering processes, by which the program will happily leave the same impression in the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume .
