This film follows a storyboard very similar to The Warriors, only with less intensity and with a bad performance, which is nothing to write. <br /> <br /> The story in general is not so bad, based on a small Australian gang. who are trying to get out of town when one of their members is accused of rape by another gang girl. They then have to fight the streets while being pursued by several rival gangs. On could assume that the writers took a page from The Warriors and rewrote it, but as mentioned above - with not so great intensity. <br /> <br /> The acting as a whole is not very good. in my opinion, and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they're actually acting ... the fight scenes make up for it, but then the poor sound effects that accompany them brings you back down. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing on Once Were Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good story, bad acting, nothing to write.
