The films use vibrant blue-black skin tones to create a noir-ish feel for this movie, unfortunately, do not work. In fact, it is quite annoying, as it obscures demonic characters and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. At least the original had hysterical energy and the bloody ensembles were quite impressive. The black blood is not frightening, nor is the main female devil scary in her attempts to growl and growl at the screen of her best Lugolese style. <br /> <br /> The narrative is grossly disconnected and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch', directed by Russ Meyer, you can appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise, give this film a large circumference. The fans of Bava and Argento - once again - are bitterly disappointed.
