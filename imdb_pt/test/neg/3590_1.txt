I rated this movie a 1/10 and did it in good nature. this movie is not what it seems and I do not understand. Take the first joke, for example. Yours is that sign in the beginning to begin. Well that was OK but then they start having a guy talking about the hood and then he dies then the other guys who talk then he dies after the other guy says people do not get to the birthday without dying . and he gets a cake now. then he dies. <br /> <br /> The jokes are just stupid, they are so smart and I would have thought they would have been better off somebody like the directors of the horror movie: <br /> <br /> Shawn Wayans (written by) and Marlon Wayans (written by) and Phil Beauman (written by) <br /> <br /> but it's horrible and I hope the next time they want to do another comedy, they make good jokes and not lame.
