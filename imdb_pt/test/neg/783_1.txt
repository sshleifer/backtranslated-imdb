How sad that this came from the same mind as Donnie Darko, possibly one of the best films of this genre. Where do I really start? I think one of the most annoying aspects of the film is that we should criticize humanity, and yet we do not see humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film is spent agonizing over the possible death of another human being. These are horrible cardboard cutouts of one of the humans. Unfortunately, this is how they are played with what can only be described as a terrible performance. Is this how Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the reaction of the onlookers, this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity. Why do not the characters in the movie ask the questions that all viewers have? This is not an accusation of humanity. It is an accusation of the straw men that Kelly mounts and who almost bears no resemblance to real humans in this situation. <br /> <br /> For those who say that this was a wonderful thought-provoking movie, for what are you comparing? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare this to Kurosawa's works. How truly private should you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion? For the love of all that is good in the movies! Even the Indecent Proposal is ten times the charge of mankind that this is. There we see truly distressing people about greed and the human condition. Yes, even the Indecent Proposal puts this film in the shame of philosophical discussion, and yet it gets 5.3 vs. 6.0 for this pointless nonsense. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I seen a more pretentious, pontificatory, and self-glorifying film falling so flat on the floor. This has the depth of a high school movie project, and a poor one in that. In fact, this is the level of discussion promoted by this movie. If you want to see a good psychological film, do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If The Box had survived even to that goal, I would be willing to forgive some of the atrocious attitudes, plot holes and a meaningless plot. Unfortunately, this can not be done. <br /> <br /> The real accusation of humanity is that there are people out there who think this movie is a deeply introspective examination of the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is neither Sartre's Cliff Notes version! This is a 9th year article written hastily designed and hack written on Sartre based on some ramblings in the Internet messaging forum. If Sartre were alive, he would sue Kelly for defamation.
