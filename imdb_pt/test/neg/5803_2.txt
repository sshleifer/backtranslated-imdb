Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought "stoner comedy" was just a way of describing more specifically a comedy in which a lot of weed is smoked and people who watch it are more apt to enjoy it. "Grandma's Boy," however, has decided that this is a complete niche and that drug addicts represent a part of the comedy that needs to be achieved. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and Happy Madison's gang were right, but that does not make "Grandma's Boy" any less annoying and boring. They may be completely stoned - but the characters are mostly half-baked. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, a long-time supporting player of Adam Sandler, first-time star) is a professional 30-year-old video game tester. whose roommate expelled them. He could look for a new apartment, but then we do not have a movie. After trying a couple of friends, he ends up living with good old grandmother Lilly (Doris Roberts from "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up at 6 in the morning and does his chores and soon he falls asleep at work and so the new video game sequence may not be completed. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex copes with frustration and eradicates boredom by playing video games or playing loudly or both. Your friends / co-workers do the same thing. Most of them are virgins who live at home, in addition to loving video games. They are all clumsy and all but Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only sometimes) their characters are not funny. Funny if you're on fire ... of course, I suppose, but I can not say from experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe all the lost people like to get stoned, play video games and women awkwardly pay attention to their breasts, but even then, it should not be the driving force of a whole movie. Older women should also not be discharged by accident (I have seen one of them come) or they are just gross sex jokes - but that is what happens when a movie is about nothing. No conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes out of the small problems of being out of the pot, Alex trying to make the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) like him and the guys struggling to finish their levels for the deadline of the video game. <BR> <BR> The characters may be the saving grace of these sinuous movies, but apart from a lovely Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them roommates and skill of Joel Moore in making robot noises there is little character naivety. Covert is a mediocre main character with no comic dimensions, his friend Dante is an inept and wasted time on screen, and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far in the periphery that it does not matter. If you like movies about nothing and watch them in a state of mind and body that highlights that nothingness, "Grandma's Boy" will likely be exactly what you are looking for. Those who need a little more talent and intelligence to participate in a comedy will not be affected. The most I can say for "Grandma's Boy" is that it's watchable, despite its lack of sense. It will not seem like a total waste of time, but you would wish for you to do drugs, so you could at least have made the most of it for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website at www.moviemusereviews.com
