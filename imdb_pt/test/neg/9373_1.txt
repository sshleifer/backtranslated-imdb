The brands in this film, like Suit Supply, draw from the story, because it's supposed to be set in the eighties. It's not a very exciting movie. In addition, Intwine's single on the soundtrack is very bad, has a chorus that is repeated several times, 'like I'm a cruel man, I shot everything, I'm a cruel man, I'm here to stay ..' Jeeez could not those asswipes have come up with something better than that? I think they wrote in a few minutes .. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying as well as placing products in this movie, it fits into the controversy and advertising around a criminal who should not be a celebrity. as it is now made to be, but must be forgotten how the rats should be.
