Low budget horror movie. If you do not raise your expectations very much, you will probably like this small move. Beginning and ending are very good, it drags half a bit at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the crazy goings that add atmosphere but do not advance the conspiracy. A little blood. I liked Bill McGhee's performance, which he made quite believable for such a low budget image, he managed to take the movie at times when nothing seemed to be happening. Nurse Charlotte Beale, played by Jesse Lee, played her character well, so be prepared to slap her to the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes, but that's what makes these low budget movies so good! I would have left that place and would have been five states before she even thought it would be a good idea to leave! If you like this movie, try Committed from 1988, which is basically a steal from this movie.
