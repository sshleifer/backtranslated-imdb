I do not know where to start. Maybe the idea of ​​this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. There's nothing funny about kidnapping. I do not know what was most offensive - the subject or "performance" of David Arquette. It was like watching a bull have his penis cut off, though I think the bull felt better afterwards. The filmmakers must find something about Sinatra besides kidnapping his son to show (as, I do not know, his TALENT AS A SINGER !!!!). His family should not have to relive this horror. Thank God it was only shown on HBO and not released in theaters. Please do not watch this if you have some self-respect.
