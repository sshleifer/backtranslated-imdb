If you are an ordinary guy like me and like good acting, good plot, good scripts, new ideas or have fun, you might want to skip this one. I was honestly bored from the opening credits to the end, but I tried to give the movie a chance, and watched it all the way - just to be disappointed every moment. <br /> <br /> The acting was incredibly sub-par, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are guilty or whether the ridiculous wooden dialogue was horrible along with an even worse script. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped and I think the audience must derive some deeper meaning from it, or be able to see it somehow, but honestly doing it would be a waste of time. <BR> <BR> <BR> The film has a kind of crude sexuality that serves no purpose other than showing some tattoos and lingerie. No one seems to have any motivation except to make money with some sort of "investment" agreement that is never really explained. The connections between the characters are not very clear, and there is little or no character development. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of subculture film intended for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute shit, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's probably not the worst.
