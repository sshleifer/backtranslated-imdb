Great storyteller, director and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal movie, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular at the time this movie was made. (And hello, this is NOT a movie-noir!) The storyless, overly complicated and overpopulated story has no arc, no focus, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose except for a valentine to the alleged and highly dubious cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me hate this movie is when Montalban and Mitchell make a daring escape from their captors, rushing to presumably save Montalban's injured partner from being killed by a fool with a gun driving a piece of Montalban farm says something like: "quick - we should try to save it," but instead of doing so, they lie on their belly down and watch in agony for about 5 minutes of screen time while the machine attacks Murphy and FINALLY hits him (or so we presume - the machine just stops, another bully detects the presence of the two "first responders" and shoots them when they run away again) Cena finished. The whole thing is so horribly filmed and absolutely anticlimactic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (apparently Montalban, although he is off screen for more than half of the film), he does not even try. Jeez, Ricardo, do something! <br /> <br /> I know it's Anthony Mann, but hell, not all of his movies are classics, people. How bad an old movie has to be around here to get something smaller than a rating of 6?
