Totally unfunny "jokes" that fall flat and amateur (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogues that are, at best, mediocre. After watching this movie, one has to imagine how a producer could come across a project like this and think, "I need to make this movie." No wonder he did not get a theatrical release.
