SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I do not go into high tech movies expecting them to be 100% accurate in all things related to the computer. But, somehow, even the average user 'I have a computer' believes that: 1) A computer professional with secret, special data 2) is will keep the primary copy of the data on a 1.44 floppy disk <br /> <br /> 3) and make absolutely no backup of these special secret data <br /> <br /> Even high school students do the Homework For God's sake. <br /> <br /> It is also the worst representation of a computer nerd. Even though she's super cute, we must believe she has no friends, neighbors, family, or co-workers who can identify her. Even the unabomber had a family that could deliver him. <br /> <br /> These are not just minor bugs that do not affect the movie - these are the biggest planes points that fueled the plot. The characterization was awful, the plot totally unacceptable, and if you did not see it, do not bother.
