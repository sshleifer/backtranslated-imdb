A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in a film I recently watched on television: Indecent Proposal. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of Indecent Proposal, David and Diane Murphy, are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. . I'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not doing well, but why should we care so much if those two were together was beyond me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction ?? None of this materialized on the screen in their interactions. Since I knew Robert Redford would eventually appear, it was clear from the outset that the good part, the meat of the movie, would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson could not show any emotion for the film. He seemed to be holding on, worried about his thin indented line. <br /> <br /> OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are to think they can win back the $ 50,000 they owe to the game. No faux pas, just a horribly bad, lazy and unforgivable writing. Of course they lose all their money. Astonished? I know I was not. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the movie)? a romantic man, perhaps emotionally frigid, an updated Gatsby. A very good role, and although not a great actor, close to those two, Redford looks like Olivier. He immediately falls in love and greed with Diane and we, the viewers, for once feel it. This is like loving a woman! Not David's way, swapping gum with Diane's mouth on a slimy pier. (I saw that right?) Like Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes, it is meant to instruct the seemingly brain-dead public that here is a rich man, but he also looks very good, and by then the dead brain public appreciates him! Another symbolism in the wardrobe includes David's now-passed shirts at the end of the film, signifying resolution, joining them after a long interlude of worn clothes. <br /> <br /> And what about the California garden parties, as shown? in Hollywood movies? Suddenly everyone looks British, complete with lacy dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (HATS!) And, of course, the umbrella. Yes, Diane, her transformation to Rich Man's now complete bride, is there at the auction, gently spinning an umbrella. Though she insisted she could not be bought, she finally succumbed to sexual tension. This is where the movie branches into pure Americana. I mean, of course David and Diane are going to end up together, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her walk in the wake of Robert Redford? And I mean for a long time? As she can withdraw from the sexual and romantic bondage of this older, sexy man so easily just because Woody Harrelson brings her thin line to the garden party, she sits down and looks at Demi Moore in the eye. This is not how it happens. He was SO WEAN. <br /> <br /> But we should have our happy ending. We have to swallow the moral lesson. We are not yet sophisticated enough to have otherwise. Director Lyn attempted to make a Fatal Attraction for the group of young reformers. <br /> <br /> In addition to garden parties where there is not even an SUV, T-shirt or baseball cap, these movies also feature a dependable public transport system that connects California's cities and towns. How else to symbolize the return to the middle class or to the life of the working class?
