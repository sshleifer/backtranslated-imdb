is the best film that takes the first place to the most sick and useful film ever made in this poor country. really people still do not know what the word cinema means and you vote for movies, I'm really curious to know how many P.P.P films. or L.Bunuel you have seen. The score of this "failure experiment" reflects a lot on your way of understanding things and recognizing a good quality movie when you see it. We, the Romanian people, have only ONE film and to this day the status has not changed and this film is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I do not waste time thinking about how many of you have seen it. This is a film that respects all the qualities required of a MOVIE. From the script to the pictures and even to the quality / clarity of the picture are still passed on it 41 years. I urge voters to look for better movies and then vote. KuDos will see you later.
