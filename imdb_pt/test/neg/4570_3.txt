Andrew Gurland's "Cheats," is his fictional "true story" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. The quartet are: the arrogant Trevor Fehrman (as Davis), his equally well-matched colleague Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), the chubby school friend Elden Henson (as Sammy) and geekster Martin Starr (as Applebee). ). The adults include Mary Tyler Moore (as Ms. Stark) and Griffin Dunne's father (as Davis). The high curse begins with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence allegedly pissing in a professor's grade book. Put this on the bottom of the pile; and, thank you for not showing up in anyone's permanent record. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
