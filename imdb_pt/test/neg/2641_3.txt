This "horror" movie lacks horror or even mild suspense. Even the blood is not good. The plot would have some promise if it was made by someone who cares what they are writing / filming, but the people who made this film obviously did not. Basically, the film continues in a series of leaps and bounds: The main character insists she is not crazy. <br /> <br /> "Milo" hides in his yellow raincoat or walks in front of a car on his bike. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and talks about her passion as a teacher. <br /> <br /> Someone is killed in an unsatisfactory way. <br /> <br /> The main character insists that she is not crazy and makes some false sobs. <br /> <br /> Are we seeing a pattern here? If you do not, you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look at something else. The budget is low, low, low and shows (contrary to what say, DEAD EVIL, which makes you forget your bad budget), and the acting is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of the caretaker). Overall, the movie is boring, boring, boring. I can not think of a single scene that is well done. In fact, I did not like the movie so much that I actually hung up ten minutes before the end, something I rarely do ... heck, I watched the non-MSTied HANDS, the CLONES, and WILD WILD WEST all the way. 3/10. Save yourself and see PHANTASM again.
