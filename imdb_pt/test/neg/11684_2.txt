Well, the first thing I saw after looking at the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and thought it would be a good rental. Wow, I was wrong! I'm sure there was a good movie here once, but after the incredibly poor value of video game production, it ends up looking like a retarded half-brother to Tron. The first scene sets the overall mood of the entire movie. Five minutes later, you're wondering, "What the hell am I watching?", And it'll just be snowball from there. A horrible soundtrack that makes every song sound like Rob Zombie's "Dragula" completes that miserable piece of crap in a ridiculously bad movie. On a side note, # 3 most romantic quote in a movie - "I think you're the ultimate destination."
