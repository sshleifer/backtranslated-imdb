I rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. <br /> <br /> I got Jack and Lep 4 because they're good bad movies that I've never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie because it matched the "How to find a bad movie" guide on badmovies.org, with no real description, no pictures of the movie on the back, and I had never heard of it, had that be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so bad that it does not matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a real bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are donkeys on purpose, this is stupid despite the best efforts of the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> This "movie" starts much like Evil Dead, even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress. Unlike Evil Dead, it never gains any speed. For a movie "slasher" is pretty bland, in 80 minutes 6 people are dead, but these are scattered so far, it becomes quickly boring. <br /> <br /> The director did lots of boring animal scenes. hunting obviously to go along with the whole theme "Prey", but they do nothing to advance the story and are very boring. The blood is horrible. All these extra shots were to make up for the lack of a script and a story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the movie are mainly shot in slow motion, but it's another way to increase the size of that. The "climax" is such a complete joke, it's hard to laugh at it is so bad. The back of the box says "The end will shock and haunt you." Yes it will shock you that someone could put such a bad plot in the movie and haunt you because you will not believe you paid to watch that crap. is "not human, and has an ax!" One person is killed with an ax across the film and is off the screen. <br /> <br /> A true 1 out of 10. I LOVE laughing at bad movies, but this is so bad that it even has no exaggerated qualities. No bad movie night is to compete without a real character-building movie: P
