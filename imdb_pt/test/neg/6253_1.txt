I saw it on the shelves of the place of rent and rented everything else, so I said why not. Because it's not because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like it was filmed with a home camcorder. I think that's all the budget would allow. There were fewer breasts than I thought there would be. Some people have managed to be lightweight pornography with some murders. The funniest part of the whole movie for me is the extra stuff. There is a point with deleted scenes. Well, there's only one, but it's the dumbest and I think it may have knocked the rest of the movie down. The girls go into a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yeah, it's all over them. Good stuff !!! This movie is really bad. Do not bother yourself.
