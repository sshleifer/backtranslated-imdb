This movie was so horrible that I could not get through the whole thing without hanging up, it was so bad! When I was watching, I thought it looked like a very cheap movie made in the 60's or something like those terrible-looking special effects, but then I realized that this was done in 2001. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and the acting was really very horrible and the plot was almost non-existent. I do not think anyone would ever make movies that look so cheap and old, I'm not sure if they did it on purpose or if they really had no budget for this movie. It really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at a local person's house or something. Maybe they thought they were being retro or something, but that sounds really tacky. <br /> <br /> I really do not know how anyone could really enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5 * 's.
