TART is the worst movie I've ever seen this year, and this includes both the Affleck / J.Lo GIGLI bomb and the borefest Rob Zombie HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I do not know if it's a fair comparison, since TART was made two years earlier and probably has a budget equivalent to half of the 1000 low-budget CORPES. Regardless, all three films suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly do not think there's anything to spoil) <br /> <br /> TART is about a group of super-spoiled private school children. Most of them reside in oversized apartments along hyper-face Park Avenue in New York, thanks to the finances of their careless parents. The film shows the aimless life of one of the female students (Cat) when she dismisses her only true friend (no matter how frivolous she is) in pursuit of the "good life" with the crowd. This, of course, leads to sex, drugs and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll. Everything is overly dramatic in the way that really bad movies are usually. Cat's first sexual experience leads her to be considered a vagabond and marginalized by her newly acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs takes her almost to be dumped on a garbage chute after her teammates believe she is overdose. There are no heavy messages there, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> This is mainly what the plot "seen before 100 times" implies. Other small details, and even less interesting, include a friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from everyone else, a wild child who lives life on the edge (and finally falls for a night at the EAST Hamptons), an antimony. Semitic British girl who ends her friendship with Cat the moment she discovers that Cat has a Jewish father, and Cat's tense relationship with her single mother who unsuccessfully tries to make Cat enjoy the privileged life she has. The thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife. The "wild child" is played as an understated version of one of the Hilton sisters. The British girl disappears from the film after the breakup. The mother / daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the final scene of the film, in which she and her besieged mother have a kind of reconciliation. * yawn *** * * * * * * * * * * * * * About the cast and crew .... Dominique Swain came on the scene with her role as the seducer minor in 1997, LOLITA and FACE / OFF. His performances were strong enough to get her on some "to watch" lists at the time. She was 17 at the time and I hope they are not the best roles of her career. If she does some more roles like what she does in TART, it may very well be. <br /> <br /> I just saw Bijou Phillips in another movie (BULLY) and I swear that her performance in this one movie was almost identical to what she gave here. I'm not sure if she's unable to give varied performances or if it was just a coincidence that her roles in the two were very similar. My guess is that the former is true. I feel that this woman has very little talent as far as acting is concerned. Here, she is the actress appointed to portray the weakened sister Hilton. The fact that she performed so poorly is surprising considering she has grown up and continues to be friends with Hilton's real-life sisters. She's essentially playing a version of herself in this movie, and doing a damn bad job with it. <br /> <br /> As for writer / director Christina Wayne ... I do not know anything about her other than TART being her first, and just the movie project so far. With a first effort like this, it's no wonder that his career in show business has been short.
