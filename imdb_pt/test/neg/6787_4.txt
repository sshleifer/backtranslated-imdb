As a true Canadian, I always avoid Canadian films. However, from time to time I get stuck watching one. This is better than most, which means mediocre. There are many of the usual flaws in Canadian films ... self-conscious acting ... an excess of cinematic tricks and, above all, the discreet Canadian habit of using Canadian cities as American surrogates. I mean, using the historic metropolis of Montreal as a stand for Harrisburg Pennsylvania is just a bit obscene. I was in a good mood. I gave a 4. <br /> <br />
