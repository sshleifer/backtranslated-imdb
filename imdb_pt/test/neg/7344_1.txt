Were the cast and crew drugged before they started filming it? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could have filled it. Since the first scene, when the co-star is late for dinner, was there any question of where he was and what he had just done? The suspense is over. Now it would take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved. I must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how stupid the writer, the director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker, and Stephen Rea could not explain at least how our murderer, who was not a lawyer. , or a police officer, could enter a cell locked in a prison, kill his second victim, and tie him in a loop to look like suicide ??? I wondered if I had fallen asleep out of pure boredom and missed how it happened. If anyone can explain, please do ... and then why, for God's sake, did he kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet someone thought that this movie was worthy of being an official selection at a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I could not laugh.
