I know a lot of people claim that certain movies are "the worst of all time," but I think Redneck makes a claim for that award. A combination of rather terrible performance by Mark Lester and Telly Savales and plot progression that defies belief. <br /> <br /> In Telly Saveles: Was he drunk when he acted on it? He seems to play a lunatic whiner, with no sense of conviction. Maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Mark Lester: A more wooden performance than a carpenter's. His cut British tones do not belong in this film; and her transformation from protected teenage to gangster apprentice in 24 hours is crazy. And the strip scene with Mosquito has no relevance to the plot; Maybe the director likes this sort of thing. Plot Logic: When Memphis and Mosquito ambushed the car in the beginning, why does Mark Lester's mother not do or say anything to get the son out of the car? before the freaks kick him out? She just lets everyone go without saying a word !! On the other hand, Redneck has to be seen - you will not believe how bad the opposite is!
