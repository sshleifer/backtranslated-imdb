We all know that special effects cost money, but it looks like they could have used the money they saved by writing the screenplay to get some better shots. The train is obviously a model in most moving shots, the helicopter is obviously computer generated, the alien looks like that of Spaceballs except that it's a decade later and Spaceballs had an excuse. <br /> <br /> The clever thing they did was blur all the special effects to make them harder to see. <br /> <br /> Not even the actors could make up for a script so poorly written and it's pretty obvious they did not try <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time. Please.
