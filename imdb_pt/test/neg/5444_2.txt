Acting badly and misdirected, "Congo" tries unsuccessfully to recreate the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is that the book was not that good. Still, the first problem of the film is that the character of Tim Curry was added; The second problem is that the talking arm was added; The main problem, though, is that cast members do not create realistic characters. I guarantee this movie will not make you think there are murderous gorillas anywhere on Earth. Also starring Laura Linney (Congratulations Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I'm guessing they do not want to emphasize this movie on their resumes.
