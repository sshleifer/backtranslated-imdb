Every time a movie features a dwarf or a dwarf in a prominent role, chances are 10 to 1 that the director threw him because he did not know what else to do to keep the movie interesting. In this case, the featured face is not that bad - he can maintain his dignity for most of his scenes (except for the part where he drags the protagonist down the dungeon stairs), but the film itself uses it. like a puppy chew toy. <br /> <br /> The problem here is common with low budget films - there is a germ of a decent idea here, but the director and the screenwriter do not know how to develop it. A good director would take the various elements of the story - brain transplants, crazy doctors with secret laboratories and a dungeon, car chases, hand fights, monstrous Frankenstein assistant, mind control, betrayal and conspiracy, etc ... and make a exciting, involving movie full of cheap and fun thrills. <br /> <br /> Instead, what we have here is a lot of people stumbling and arguing in the doctor's lab, then a tacky operation in which the patient bleeds tempura ink, followed by some of the same people stumbling and arguing in the doctor's laboratory a little more, followed by another subgroup of the initial group driving and having an accident, followed by a dungeon getaway scene which is mostly about a woman putting her shoes back followed by a chase on the roof of the movie) , followed by a confusing series of events where everyone in the movie apparently escapes all others, followed by a beautiful walk in the field where everyone either chases, bumps, attacks or escapes from all the other AGAIN, followed by, well, not much more . <br /> <br /> Somewhere here is a blond peroxide dressed in white, a well-meaning heroic type who is kind of handsome, a three-foot lab assistant, a big loaf with a mass of melted rubber on one side of his face, a boy who asks himself in the middle of the film to provide more of the "frankenstein factor," a brunette who half falls in love with the hero for no apparent reason, and the crazy doctor himself, who must be the luckiest man in history evil supervillains because nothing goes according to his plan, but things work for him anyway ... and all because he remembered to stick an electrode into the transplanted brain at one point in the operation. <br /> <br /> This was not the worst movie I've seen, not even the worst exploit film I've ever seen, or even the worst badly made exploration movie I've ever seen, but it just stands there . , exposing the low price and lack of attention to detail at every point, and there's no real reason for even bad moviegoers to watch it.
