A stereotyped story with all the tired cliches. I was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! What a waste! How many ORIGINAL scripts are scattered without being produced? <br /> <br /> In climax, I could predict what will happen in each scene. <br /> <br /> Oh, and do not even tell me about the silly sexual tension between the beautiful cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. OKAY, RIGHT. I can buy this. What's next? Fingers porn?
