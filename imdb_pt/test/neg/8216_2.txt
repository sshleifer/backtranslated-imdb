Okay, make no mistake - this is a horrible movie, but I actually thought I had some scary scenes and got over your pathetic budget once in a while. At the very least, it's unintentionally funny at some points and has a definite air of shiver and discomfort (a face-flaring scene, the part with the bride defaced). <br /> <br /> This baby falls into the category "so bad it's fun" for me, and just for this I would give a star. The effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was filmed in a day. You must also love that toy ship! It brought back childhood memories of seeing this on TV late at night many years ago. While the Alpha DVD copy seems weak and as if it had been recorded directly from an old television broadcast or something, I really enjoyed it in this case!
