This oddity contains touches similar to Bunuel, but does not hold anyone's interest. A 10-year-old wanders a bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while regular cult film suspects (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of the comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the writer delights in making you squirm. I remained unchanged due to the wide acting. You know you're ready for it when Meat Loaf and Flea make the perfumes more attractive. (And how is that kid's screen test? It's unbearable.) Recommended for the dozen fans of SONNY BOY (87).
