Hubie - as Stanely, the troll from A Troll of Bluth in Central Park - does not have the personality spark to be the main character who carries an entire movie. We should like him because he's cool, but that's all he is. <br /> <br /> The design of your character is unpleasant. The top of your head is a kind of dome that is narrower than the greasy half of your head. <br /> <br /> And penguins should not have teeth. I know the parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his little voice (provided by Martin Short), sounds funny with that large set of bites in his beak. Tim Curry, who is usually delightful at being evil, does some kind of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain (may have been a good voice for an accomplice comic relief, not the main supposedly menacing villain). <br /> <br /> The whole plot revolves around the love of the hero and villain for the penguin woman Marina, who is as dull as the two suitors. Worst of all is the pace. We continue to cut the villain to see him threaten Marina a bit more - this time in dialogue, this time in music ... Barry Manilow may be a great composer, but in animated films like this and Thumbelina, your songs seem flaccid and apathetic - especially the ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" from 1930. I read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's will, and that could have caused some of the problems. - although I suspect the real problem is that they did not cut the rest;).
