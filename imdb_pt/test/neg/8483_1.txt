Loki, Norse evil god, creates a mask that endows the user with powers similar to cartoons. Under the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the film looking for the mask so that it does not cause more suffering to humanity. Meanwhile, the mask owner conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. Etc. etc. If this sounds like a very fine plot, it is. Add to that the fact that the film is treated ineptly from beginning to end, and the result is very, very bad. You may find worse movies but you will have to actively seek them out. Most of the time, Son of the Mask is presented at the intellectual level of a preschool, but in light of scenes like the baby-mask urinating copiously in six different directions, including in his father , this premise seems unlikely. I asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the film, and he responded to "convicted criminals," seemingly forgetting for a moment that the Constitution bans cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> A bad movie is not sin, or Hell would be overflowing. What makes a sin is that $ 72 million was spent on this piece of junk. To put things in perspective, one day after watching Son of the Mask, my son and I watched "Good Night, and Good Luck," a movie that received six Oscar nominations (including the best picture), and was brought for $ 7. million. That's right. Only a tenth of the money spent on Son of the Mask. That, then, is sin - releasing good money through the sewer, when it could have been better used in the production of watchable films, or in the feeding of hungry children, or indeed in any other purpose. Producers should really be ashamed.
