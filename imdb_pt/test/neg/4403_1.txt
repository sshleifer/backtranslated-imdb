A Brazilian cable television will present "Yadon Ilaheyya" this month on its "Cult" channel. I saw the trailer and listened to the ad, and decided to watch this movie. In fact, it's crap, boring, absurd and boring and absurd about the conflict in the Middle East, and along with "Soultangler," they are certainly the worst movies I've ever tried to see. I really missed forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap, highly suited to torturing enemies. How can this film be awarded and nominated for prizes included in Cannes? My vote is a (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Divine Intervention" ("Divine Intervention")
