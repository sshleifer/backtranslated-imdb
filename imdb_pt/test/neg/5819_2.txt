This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to a farm to do gardening, and every week, without fail, they somehow encounter a murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a big garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if somehow they ended up facing homicide after murder, would not it be smart to tell the police? You know, the people who can really do something about it ... But every week, these two idiots are out there, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own and in some cases causing more murders. Once they miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer can be condemned. All evidence was sabotaged. And you think the people who are covering up the murders would think about not hiring those two, do not you think? Yay! We solve the murder! Now, like any other week, let's confront the killer and, without support, tell them we know that. There's no putting us in danger, is there? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on television and certainly the most ridiculous.
