I still have to watch STARCRASH (1979) - which notoriously tacky Italian take STAR WARS (1977) - but it can not be much worse than this piece of crap that, just say, does Mel Brooks' so-so SPACEBALLS A true work of art! In fact, the main reason why GALAXINA is remembered today is because of the tragic destiny that its main protagonist - Playboy journalist, Dorothy Stratten, who was killed by her insanely jealous husband - before the film had its official debut ! <br /> <br /> Although Statten (who later had two biopics made on her, where she was portrayed by Jamie Lee Curtis and Mariel Hemingway) plays the title role, in the first half of the film she is reduced to being supported in a chair ostensibly driving a spacecraft on a 27-year voyage to some planet or other; In fact, Galaxina is an all-purpose android that also serves the crazy crew members their snacks, leaves them all warm under the collar and even looks for the Blue Star (hint of choral music) as soon as they land! Having said that, Statten certainly looks bright in her white dress, and even though her role hardly requires much effort from any acting talent she may possess, it is not exactly humiliating. <br /> <br /> Still, it is ironic that a movie that bears her name, she is overshadowed by the extravagant behavior of her colleagues, especially the annoying Captain Cornelius Butt (which gives you the idea of ​​the level of comedy on display here ), a long brave, sporting wingman, smoking marijuana, proverb citing the old Chinese and, best of all (relatively speaking), a furry, noisy, rock-eater alien creature they hold. The villain of the play is a non-entity dressed in metal who, however, has the best laugh in the film when, upon hearing the choral music after each mention of the Blue Star, exclaims: "What is this?" t? There is little point in listing the science fiction classics that are stalked by this stinker in their ridiculous attempts to fake the genre, since they are not only weak but obvious; Amazingly, apparently an alien but ultimately benign alien is played by diminutive Hollywood veteran Angelo Rossitto! <br /> <br /> Why is it worth it, then, the scenes of the planet they visit (which looks more like a Western scenery than a planetary landscape) has a yellowish hue, similar to that of the sun and its inhabitants are "gourmets human "(delicacies on the menu include Skin and Tonic, Scots on the Rocks, Thigh Pies, Cooked Alaskan, etc.), not to mention a gang of motorcyclists who serve their own deity (the Harley Davidson) and when our heroes escape behind they do not dare shoot them for fear of hitting their "Lord." God (terrible) indeed ...
