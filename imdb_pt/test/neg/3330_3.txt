A group of 7 gold prospectors head in a mine that was recently opened back after an earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is there and killing people. This low budget movie ($ 25,000) has a little cult and I do not know exactly why (unless it's because it's so obscure). I'll admit the last half hour is a lot of fun, but the time to get there is pure torture. Lots of walking and conversation and our title weirdness does not appear until 45 minutes inside. Even in extra co-writer Chris Huntley admits he commits the unpardonable sin of being annoying. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC, so I hope they know an exploration film must be exploring. Anyway, like I said, the last half hour is cool, as three survivors fight the monster in stop motion and there's a cool John Carpenter trail. I wanted to see more of the monster, but it's literally on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is not the best, the Code Red DVD has paid such close attention. You have interviews and an audio commentary by director Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-writer Huntley. The tales about how the film was made are quite fascinating and inspiring (like a set of caves being built in a backyard). Even more interesting are the USC student short films by Sawicki and Huntley, which are actually all better than the production of feature films. Huntley was a very talented artist and it's a shame he did not do anything. Sawicki has worked steadily in Hollywood as a face of visual effects and camera. The VHS of the movie is kind of legendary by how dark it was and I'm sure that's a lot better. However, you still have scenes in which the only image are five helmet lights jumping in the dark. It is safe to say that the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "champion of horror films in a mine".
