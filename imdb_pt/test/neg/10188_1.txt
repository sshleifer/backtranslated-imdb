This movie was a great bait and swap. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would be doing in a UFO movie. Well ....... I think she starred in this movie to help a friend, or a friend of a friend. My first hint that this movie was not what it should be was when I witnessed the special effects of encounters with UFOs. Cheesy! As the film progressed, I noticed how the actors were made of plastic. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (There are some exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was disappointed. She is always found at home and does not show the realistic facial expressions of her husband's return to the fold. Does she ever leave the house? <br /> <br /> I had to turn off the movie several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe the message in this movie - believe what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change their love, not fear.
