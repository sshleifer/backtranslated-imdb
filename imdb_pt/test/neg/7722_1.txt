This is one of the most terrible movies I've ever had the misfortune to take. Do not get me wrong, I love a good zombie movie, but this was not one of them. <br /> <br /> ... It could very well (from the opening scenes, at least) be called 'Titty Zombies from Outer Space'. It had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or with the video game (as far as I knew). <br /> <br /> The best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can be covered with so much blood. and remain so confused. I would certainly suggest giving this and losing and getting a more secure zombie like '28 Days Later 'or' Dawn of the Living Dead '(the remake, of course, unless you're into a serious action).
