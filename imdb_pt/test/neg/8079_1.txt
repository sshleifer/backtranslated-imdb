when I watched that crap, I remembered the title of the movie FIRE, which is where this crap belongs, in a fire. I do not even know what to say the acting exploded, the fire looked really fake, Andy, the puppies are not exactly supermodels. And finally I do not know what you guys are complaining I own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me Well I think it could be worse I could be watching left behind 2. And to make matters worse I got the whole set on DVD fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I'm missing is the amazing tornado movie I hear sucking balls. <br /> <br /> Well, until my next piece of peace movie
