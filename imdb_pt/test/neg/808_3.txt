As a South African, living again in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the UK, I regret to say that this film is a big disappointment. The three main problems I had with the film were: a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - interpret the protagonists. This country is full of talent and does not need imports ... b) Gillian Slovo has traded her Struggle credentials for years. She is a very mediocre writer and even her novel does not support Mr. Hooper's flaccid direction ... and (c) Hilary Swank again, a great actor, as proven in Million Dollar Baby (but also Eastwood), dressed here in style contemporary of New York, as it wanders freely around the poverty of the Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the client and director? Yes, the movie is finally moving - how could it not be? - but the general mood in the conclusion is of tremendous disappointment. The heart is in the right place, but it needs a pacemaker.
