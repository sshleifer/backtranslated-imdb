If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot, or the tacky acting, then Backdraft is definitely the only one. <br /> <br /> However, if you like me, you enjoy watching movies that you can believe in, then the Backdraft has some serious flaws. It offers nothing new, and there are hundreds of action films from the 90s that follow identical formulas, though they are not so clumsy. <br /> <br /> After two shootings, I'm thinking, this has to go. Elsewhere, I mean, how many big fires are there in a city? Surely the firemen do other things, how to get the cats out of the trees? Well, I was wrong, and the repetition goes on again and again, to the end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the movie is the fire itself, well filmed, and I must say that I felt very hot while watching this, which suggests that two hours of watching a fire without a story or acting would have been more appropriate to my taste.
