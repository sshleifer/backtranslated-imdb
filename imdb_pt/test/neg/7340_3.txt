I lived in Barstow Ca. in 1968, when the movie The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to make me pay my hard-earned money to watch this movie. I was actually expecting a Bonnie and Clyde movie and had Dick Clark play a nerdy timid guy while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi made an attempt to reintroduce Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why it never came to the video. Even as a child, I got what I took off when I left the theater. After all the best parts where in the movie trailer. The film was boring and virtually meaningless. By the way, Dick Clark is dead so it was not a total disappointment.
