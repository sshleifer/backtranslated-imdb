An assembly prologue, obviously fabricated by the blessed maniacs who actually chose to distribute this thing, tries to convince us that the comic impact of this incredibly incompetent nothingness is entirely deliberate. You do not believe: this is for Lloyd Kaufman as Andy Warhol is for Herschel Gordon Lewis. It is so complete in its project of torturing its hypothetical audience that it seems a sort of misanthropic negationist art facility, but it can not be because it is completely devoid of self-consciousness. As ugly and ugly as "Things" or "Frozen Scream," this manages to raise the bet, recycling itself with a maddening insistence that has to be seen to be believed. A Hitchcock shot-by-shot analysis of, say, the cardio-girls attack can yield twenty issues and maybe three minutes of shooting - only the sequence takes ten minutes! You WANT to believe that this started life as a short subject a bit more bearable, except that if you did the repetition of what was left would be far less fascinating: for example. when the 'devil' enters the room, it only inspires extended, highly apathetic, and utterly empty glances from its impending (off-screen) victims. Repeat this scenario about four times, in slightly varying settings; bridge these with perhaps thirty lines of total dialogue; offer actors even more odious and lethargic than those of the aforementioned classics; and please us with a monster that includes gauze, ketchup and a yellow ear of Spock, and you have a movie that bothers too much to refuse, a functional definition of bad. I am proud to own it!
