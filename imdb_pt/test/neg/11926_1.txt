Upstairs, with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> The premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but unfortunately the whole movie took about 30 seconds. of pure pitch, and this was shown in the 30-second slot of the small screen. <br /> <br /> If you want to write an amateur, second-class effects, ridiculous costumes and a versatile snoozefest by all means, watch this. The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. Too bad too, because coming in I thought it would be bad, but it held out hope. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Do not watch it. <br /> <br /> Unless you have liked it - any of the 3 movies above.
