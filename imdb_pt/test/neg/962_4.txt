Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid) is a college professor who used to have a successful writing career, but this has now gone down the pipe along with his marriage. The initial exposure plants the notion in the viewers that everyone has something against it, so when the revelation comes that it was poisoned, we were not surprised, unless, of course, that you are familiar with the original. Dexter, after being told he has less than 48 hours to live, decides to track his steps with the help of one of his students, Sydney Fuller (Meg Ryan), but they find that they have many obstacles in their way. The film starts promising in black and white as Dexter staggers in the rain toward the local police station where he wants to report a murder ... his own, but the beat of 80 Huey lewis style that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be very bad, is it just a matter of how bad? We are sure to be using the old flashback, but now the film uses the full Technicolor. There are a few brief tributes to Noir, like the couple standing in front of a venetian, but there's nothing here to recommend it, the performances are horrible, Ryan in particular making his usual dumb blonde with a smiling smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put something unnecessary on an already good movie premise, obviously trying to make money with a Body Heat audience, the apparent results are undoubtedly geared towards a teenage audience and certainly they are welcome . 4/10
