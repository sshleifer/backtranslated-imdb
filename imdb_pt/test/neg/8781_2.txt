This movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. Spilsbury does not have the energy to say the least. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us in swords. I've never felt once in this movie that Spilsbury was looking forward to anything. Revenge, love, justice? Not in the portrait of this face. <br /> <br /> There is also no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot does not force them to be friends, you do not have the impression that they want to date together. In addition, the helper has the most interesting personality. Ewww. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The narration is incredibly bad and if you are familiar with the Dukes of Hazzard, you can imagine how it is. I can not believe the director would agree with that. He insulted me as a spectator, explaining every plot I just witnessed. <br /> <br /> Hey, at least the horses and places looked good, maybe that's what happens when you hire a director of photography to be your director. You may be able to watch this for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is.
