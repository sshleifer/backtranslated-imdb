That this movie has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. In our post-Enron era, do we really need more reminders of America's obsession with the creed of greed? The topic has become so politically charged that many viewers will not only not be entertained by movies of this type, but will respond with poorly disguised anger. It was all I could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and breaking it into a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What's really annoying about these types of movies, including "Purpose," is their claim that behind the glow, there's some meaningful message that makes the movie worth it. In "Purpose," I did not find such a meaningful message. What I found was a story that idolized the materialistic traps of capitalist power and wealth. The two main characters, nauseating at their ease, do very little actual work. Instead, they celebrate, play golf, display their coolness, sound "cool" with a direct dialogue from MTV culture: "rock my world" and "Now, get back to the party; it's an order." John is proud, important, superficial and smiles a lot. Robert, who wears funny glasses, is even worse. <br /> <br /> The film includes two young garage geeks, who appear to be in the movie "Antitrust" (2001). Stereotypes are played for all that they are worth, and in this movie also includes computer-looking gadgets, and Barbie doll girls on hand for those occasions when our future billionaires need a little relaxation after all that heavy party . And with the images and dialogues over time that such a story demands, can you imagine what that movie will look like in fifteen years? <br /> <br /> About the best I can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is that it has some beautiful aerial views of San Francisco. The film would have been so much nicer, so much more fun if they had abandoned those hateful characters and this disgusting story, and had simply taken us to the viewers around that little plane for the duration of the movie.
