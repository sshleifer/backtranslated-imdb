This is a stereotyped chart. A young fighter attempts to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and of course he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight. <br /> <br /> The struggles are not of a high standard. They are very "simple" in a way that 1 + 1 is simple for all adults. The fighter trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets kicked in the butt. The coach screams this and does it without success. And after a little more of that ridiculous beating, he suddenly does as he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero took a beating of his life up to that point. Think of Rocky's movies and you'll have a good reference point of how much he really can handle. Fights are also poorly done. <br /> <br /> The last thing that spoils this movie is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys really could have done some quality entertainment, but the director was not up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I do not know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves a rating of 3 out of 10.
