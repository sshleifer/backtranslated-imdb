I have to admit, I chose this film just for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow were - as always - great artists, the rest of the film was a disappointment. It looks like it was set up by a team of teenagers with low-level scripts, ie, shallow screenings, horrible photographed and editing, and hilarious lousy points! I can not believe I was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end ... the sad thing is that this could have really been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a success; that is, two main ingredients are there: a great history of national conspiracies and a great central cast (though many other actors are practically novel quality). But maybe I'm missing out on something; so far it's not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.
