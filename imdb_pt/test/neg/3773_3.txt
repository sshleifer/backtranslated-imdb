What a waste. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserved better than that. To begin with, the JT was terribly miscast in the lead here. The role required someone who could convince him as a broken anti-hero, someone who might seem haunted and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would have fit the bill, or even Al Pacino, but JT is very much alive and seems to be enjoying himself a lot. Also, certainly someone who went through the mill to the extent that the JT character would have suffered some physical effect? The character presented to the audience looked as if he could start with a tight end to the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett had little better role performance. Where was the pain and conflict that must surely be hindering development? And as for the "plot" ... well, none of it makes sense. The characters jump from one state of mind to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. The rhythm of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely the rhythm. This is a very slow movie, not that I have something against slow movies, as long as they are going somewhere. The pace only progresses to the end as it moves from a slow wail to a frantic race to include as many tired cliches as possible. This is successful - the only thing missing is to be something involving a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this purely for the performance of Gabriel Macht - he was the only member of the cast that was a) well released and b) able to convince in his role. All in all, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.
