******** SPOILER ALERT ************** He wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this "movie". First of all, we find it hilarious that the producer took part in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible, incredibly unbelievable accent - what the hell was that, after all, Romanian? And how come nobody in Denmark speaks Danish except the swamp creatures? (Note, the director of the Scottish camp ...). ? And who does the grocery shopping for the swamp creatures? His pants seemed to have been bought at Banana Republic. Nicely dressed for 1200 years. This was worse than the Scarecrow Slayer (we did not think that was possible). We basically spend 75% of the movie looking for bloody / scary moments. No results found. Rent the DVD just to watch 2 hours "Behind the Scenes of Bog Creatures" featurette. Who are these people? Are they serious? And the filmmakers are 60 years old. I think this is your holy grail and that is pathetic enough in itself. hands down: "Not bad for a girl who never went to graduate school ...." My blind grandmother who has Alzheimer's could make a better movie.
