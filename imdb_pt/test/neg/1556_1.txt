This movie smells bad. IMDb needs negative numbers in their rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. The performance is wood or over; the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. Even as a film directed only by the scenes of monsters, these scenes were so disappointing that could inspire no sympathy for the rest of the film. I want the 80 minutes of my life that this movie stole.
