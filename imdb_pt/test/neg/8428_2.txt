Historically horrible. Almost one moment in 4 hours of ridiculousness. You can not keep up with the inconsistencies while watching. As with all track and filed movies, no-one bothers to ask any track consultant. Events and techniques that were not created until the next century are shown. From the shots of runners running 400 meters up to the highly obese actor who represents the high jump and the long jump winner, you do not need to know anything about the track to be slightly entertained. Probably played together in 1984 as a tribute to the games shortly before the Los Angeles Olympics.
