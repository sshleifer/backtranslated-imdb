I bought this movie on DVD despite the stale criticism and that was stupid ... This review was completely correct and I have never seen any worse "erotic" movie in my long life! Even though it was partly filmed and had an interesting atmosphere, plus a good cover ... But my own Extreme Erotica (c) movies are 100 times more erotic (only in the delicate aspect) with probably less than 100 times budget movies! The story has no logical connection to the first movie or the famous book ... Or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except for some very strange and sad developments ... So the main male character - Klaus Kinski - did not seem a bit like the second master of "O" he tries to play ... And not even the lovely Arielle Dombasle, it looked delicious in any scene!
