This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of movies. The unbelievable twist the movie makes - from an extremely bad movie "Alien lifeforms inhabits the land" with a bad acting, to a movie that tries to spread an arch-Christian "The day of judgment is near, to seek Jesus or to burn for eternity the ardent debts of hell "message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. Even religious Christians should be ashamed or angry to observe their beliefs posted in this way. I did not know what to do with myself when I watched the horrible performance that could have been performed by 7-year-old children. Simply disgusting. I am neither a Christian nor a religious. But if I were, I would not be afraid of Hell anymore. Rich Christiano proved to be much worse.
