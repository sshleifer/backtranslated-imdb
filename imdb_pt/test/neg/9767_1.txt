This movie was not good at all. I managed to catch him at a film festival and did not like the content I was forced to watch. It is a well-filmed film about the family that wants to reconnect after the death of the cornerstone of the family (Gabrielle Union). the film stars Billy Dee Williams as the brother of Gabrielle's Union. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams' older sister. This had to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever. He looked like he could not remember his lines in some scenes. He was an unpleasant character, hardly empathic, who begot a daughter when married to a white woman with whom he also had a daughter. The two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) was trying to connect with him, his other daughter did not want anything with him. Billy Dee's character was so pathetic that the only way to get him to fly from Paris to his sister's funeral was to tell him that the funeral was over and his late sister left him with the responsibility of taking care of her paperwork. Why did they have to cheat him? Because he did not like to attend funerals. I know. You're asking, "But did not he want to attend his own sister's funeral, too?" Yes! He claims he did not like being around the forced feelings of emotions that are shared among the people who pay their respects. He wanted nothing to do with it. Now, should we assume empathy with this hole? The rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor did not bother to consider the rhythm of the film. The flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, it seems to be the favorite in black film festivals; a film that glorifies African-American dependence on Caucasians to find a love with which to settle, even if it is a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like that win the best of festivals at the black film festivals, it makes me question the blacks' judgment in the movies. In these same festivals, the only films that win prizes are educational films about African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors. I'm not saying something is wrong with a white person directing stories written to people of color. The problems with these films is that they never argue from both points of view, which are usually the movies that really speak for the masses. These films are often unilateral forms of didacticism. These films fail to execute the powers of both sides of the argument that the film revolves around. Writers and directors never make up the scenes and sequences that contradict their final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always incline the argument. What I'm saying is that people are making these black film festivals judging a film with pure content, which to me means directing, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, etc., or they are judging movies out of the message that is being delivered about African-American culture? Should we expect a movie like Constellation to have a chance in the world against movies like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways?" What happened to the movie being fun? When I refer to entertainment, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy in what is expected to be a satisfying and meaningful emotional experience. Why can not these festivals appreciate movies that convey their messages without preaching? Why can not these black film festivals recognize movies that are well-told and brutally honest, telling the truth? "I believe that we have no responsibility to heal social ills or to renew our faith in humanity, to elevate the spirits of society or even to express our inner being. We have only one responsibility: telling the truth." - Robert McKee. Now this is something I totally agree with. Those same black film festivals put "Hustle and Flo" like that horrible stereotyping black movie. However, it is an honest movie about a pimp with a dream. A pimp can not dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp he was a human being. And are not they pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society as a whole, not just in the black community, but everywhere? The powers of "Black Hollywood" believe movies like this are making African-Americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others did not know there are pimps in the neighborhood. The truth is that until African American people in the movies can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. This movie was awful. The best thing was the cinematography and Zoe.
