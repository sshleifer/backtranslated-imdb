This movie looked like the result of the deleted scenes from a high school movie class experiment. It did not make sense! It was well interpreted, but I just felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear on this slop. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and without creativity, they were crabs! The ill-bred and ill-regarded aliens were the Frisbees with legs. WHERE ARE THE TRIPODS? The editing, made by the director / writer / producer / makeup artist / latt claw, jumps all over the place, with some repeated scenes countless times. Most seemed to have been filmed after Hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. Only in 2005 he produced 11 films! This does not include writing, editing, directing or credits of visual effects in other films. If the rest is like this, he's just making fun of us. That was a drag from the Spielberg movie, that's all. I'm looking forward to "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV" by Latt, "The Hillocks have Eyes".
