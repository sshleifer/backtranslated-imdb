Construction workers interrupt the Native American graveyard of a large skeleton monster crumbling its victims with its touching sword, breath or bone! Resort project chief Krantz (Jim Storm) orders his construction crew to keep his skeletal discoveries for a long time, and would halt continued development if the nearby tribe of Katona captures the remains being unearthed and disturbed. An old Bruce Boxleitner, nice as ever, is Sheriff Evans trying to keep the peace between the crews of Katonas and Krantz. The peace was tense, at best, but with that skeletal monster running wildly causing its victims to disappear without a trace, soon Krantz wants answers to why his crew members are missing ... Evans also begins to lose citizens . Evans is warned by Katona boss Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) that an ancient demon, the Bone Eater, has been released and can only be detained with a sacred war ax (the ax was removed by a worker who found gun jumped inside) now in the backseat of his daughter Kelly (Clara Bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how Daddy's girl has become a very remarkable lady) boyfriend's truck. Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the kill will stop .. and this must occur before the Eclipse or its power will become too strong for anyone to win. <br /> <br /> A solid cast, floundering in an embarrassing horror outlet. . The CGI is not very good, although the monster may have been quite menacing if done with a better budget. He rides a horse made of dust chasing its prey, by Petesake! Some appearances include BUCK ROGERS, Gil Gerard, as Evan's deputy Big Jim, Walter Koenig of STAR TREK as medical examiner, and William Katt of HOUSE as a field doctor attending to the wounds of Evan's deputy. None of these cameos last for more than a minute or more ... Adoni Maropis impresses on a subscribed role as Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use the Bone Eater to drive the white man out of his tribe's land. Jennifer Lee Wiggins plays Kaya, a tasty dish from a Katona woman, who, against Black Hawk's hatred of the white man, wants Evans to follow his native bloodline towards the end of the Bone Eating monster. This may be worth sitting just to see Boxleitner dressed in war paint and Indian costumes. I felt for the actor, to be honest, as Bruce tries to keep a serious face in such a terrible movie. In yet another overworked clich√©, Bruce's sheriff has a distant relationship with his 17-year-old daughter, hot and wanting to date the "bad boy" .. although this ends up as a sub-plot underwritten as most the plot about the skeleton of death and many of the characters poorly developed.
