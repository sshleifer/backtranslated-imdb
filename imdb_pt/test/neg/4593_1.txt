"Speck" apparently purported to be a biopic related to serial killer Richard Speck. However, there is not much to be found in this film, and none of this is explicitly shown. The most disturbing scene in the whole movie may be when Speck crushes one of the eight unhappy nurses in his own bathtub, but even this is only implicit, not shown, except for a few unconvincing impulses down Mr. Speck's leg. The most entertaining part of this movie is probably the narration, which should be a testament to the tediously tedious nature of this movie. Every aspect of this movie is horrible. Unless you have a crush on boredom, do not bother. This movie only reaches 72 minutes, but it seems like forever.
