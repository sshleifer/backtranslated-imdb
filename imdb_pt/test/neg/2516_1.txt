Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) allows the strongest voice to be Helmut Berger's voice! How can be? What a missed opportunity! We come out of this ordeal knowing less than what the great Master did and more about things we should not care at all. The beautiful images belong to the world of Visconti, the embarrassing interviews to the likes of Berger and Zeffirelli to the small world of Adam Low. A must avoid!
