'Ernest Saves Christmas' is the special Christmas film by comedian Ernest. In this film, Ernest has to find a successor to Santa Claus for Christmas to continue. Along the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and who steals something very important from Santa (I will not tell you what it is; you just have to watch the movie for yourself). Like most of Ernest's films, there's a lot of joking humor involved. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's funny, and it has some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not be afraid to show love. It's not the best Christmas movie, but it's good for you to get into the Christmas spirit. It's a bit sad that the movie is a bit outdated now.
