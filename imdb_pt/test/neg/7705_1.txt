This false documentary is flawed on many points, is poorly done, has uninteresting characters, but the biggest problem I have with it is the basic premise. <br /> <br /> This film uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft traveled to Italy and some of his works are based on actual supernatural events he witnessed. I am willing to agree with the notion that he traveled to Italy (only for suspension of disbelief), but that part of his work is based on reality and that the insult exists is total nonsense. all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, where his monsters showed that humans were not so special after all. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an occult specialist, he was not, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So, we end up with a movie about people getting together so much and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad you can not even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love of horror. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Movie Frankenstein Lovecraft said he felt sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt that her work was being massacred. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
