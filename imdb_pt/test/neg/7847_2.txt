An awkward young man returns to West after being instructed in the hotel business through Boston; he quickly discovers that his friends in ancient California, colonized by Spain, expect him to fill his late father's shoes - that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after stealing them. The colorful but silly production of the M-G-M has a lot of talent before and behind the camera, but never takes off. That may have been fun, second-string material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looks lost and embarrassed in the lead. The combination of strident comedy and musical interludes is hampered by poor staging (Sinatra is photographed singing at one point in the mirror, but does not focus on his performance, but realizes how strange the star appears reflected that way!). Kathryn Grayson is the governor's daughter who falls in love with Frank, and her high trilling soprano transforms her singing scenes into self-parody. In addition to Robert Surtees' cinematography and decent art direction, this "bandit" remains without a kiss. * in ****
