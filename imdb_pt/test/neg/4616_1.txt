I've never been out of a movie before. I entertained the idea a few times, but this time I did, I went in to see the end of another film, but I had to go back and see the end of the Fury while waiting for my friends. They told me that I did not lose too much while I was away. I was generally offended by the whole movie in such a grandiose way that I can not even describe it. My instinct told me to leave the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie. The plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible adolescents against others vulnerable and disturbed. There was no ray of light, no reasonable or pleasant person to provide contrast. I found that even the "good guys" in the movie did nothing for me, they were silly, stupid, plaintive or simply ineffective. The repetitive and graphic images of suicide were excessive, unnecessary and disgusting. (Not in a "I'm easily overcrowded" mode, but more in the picture of disrespect for the way of humanity). And in addition to the repetition of this scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects (interesting camera work, etc.) had potential, but sometimes they were annoying. I am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. Generally I can find some good things to counterbalance the not so good of any movie. I'm not saying that this movie did not have anything good, but I'm saying that whatever it was, I can not remember it with all the other crap that drove me crazy. I'm really sorry about that too. Perhaps the best parts were the clips from the classic original.
