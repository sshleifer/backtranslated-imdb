I'm sorry to say that, but this is really one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Due to his name "Darwin's Nightmare," I was hoping for a documentary on the problems pertaining to the perch on the Nile at Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I really saw in this "documentary" is a loose buildup of individual stories, most of which have nothing to do with fish or lakes. And for the most part, you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that do not have a meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Why did this movie waste time: - Showing non-relevant information (for several minutes they are wasted, for example, in their private snapshots of wives and daughters) - I fight for the death of an African child who was bitten by a crocodile (as if this could not have happened without the perch of the Nile) - Showing us about 100 times as planes land and start at the airport - Showing us strange religious events for several minutes - Discussing in detail the life and death of a prostitute at the airport - Talking with children about their mothers, fathers - what they work and / or how they died (well, guess what: some died of HIV - who would have guessed that?) These are just a few examples, I could continue for several pages s ... <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely unfocused, and does not know what the vision er means. If you've never heard of Africa and have no idea that this continent has social / health / HIV / violence / war issues, then this movie may be right for you. If you have not closed your eyes in the last few decades, 90% of what this movie shows will not be new to you - and the way it is presented here will make it possible for you to sleep. <br /> <br /> Maybe my expectations on this movie were high, but I really did not like it, although this is a topic I would generally find interesting. If this movie wants to show how poverty is related to the perch on the Nile, then maybe you should have spent some time discussing this subject ...
