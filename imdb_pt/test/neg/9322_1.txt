Do not get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's films, so it was with sheer excitement that I was able to take part in the Rolling Thunder screening at the Parisian French movie with a surprise film on December 17, 2004. The surprise film was The Exorcist and most people were there for this (I was too). The film was then finished, but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other film I forgot (it was Conan?). Anyway, in addition, the movie has been finalized. The happy few there (perhaps 200 people) were told not to write about the film on the internet or in the magazines, as this could jeopardize their chance of being selected for the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then came the realization that the film could not be selected for the Festival because of its quality: never in my life had I experienced so much strangeness in the audience as people went from skeptics to clearly laughs. in the spectacle full of pity. I could not believe how low the author of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had sunk. <br /> <br /> Forced over-the-top acting complete, stupid end, black and white moral, terrible FXs, The worst part of Schrader's Christianity was never, not even suspense, just boring as hell (no pun intended) ) and nothing amazing! Some good places but unfortunately misused or at least did not meet the initial hopes! In the end, I was 100 times more pleased with the work of Rolling Thunder, written by Schrader, and wished my two hours back. <br /> <br /> Do not believe the hype, even John Boorman's film is more exciting and original. Oh, and the cast of Billy Crawford, the poor boy does his best, but what do you expect? He is now part of the small club of the worst casting mistakes of all time! I give the movie 1/5 just because I did not leave the room, but I should have left.
