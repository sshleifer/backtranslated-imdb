Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), an icon of the Hammy cult, dies of heart disease (not before having an ungrateful assistant and commercial director of TV, both of whom disrespect him with rains of insults). His body is taken from his mausoleum by some movie students (they want to "invite him to dinner" ... they are big fans). What these children (including a young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who have taken him from his resting place. The list of violent acts includes Radzoff pulling the tongue of a guy out, burning a woman, raising a coffin that crushes a woman's face, behead a guy and creates another living subject in a coffin . A really strange soundtrack and pesky haze surrounds the macabre activities of Radzoff. <br /> <br /> Bobo Hokum from Troma is bound by a very, very low budget and slowwwwww pace. The movie seems much longer than it is. The film is not really so bloody and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often very dark. Sometimes Radzoff is a sinister presence, but at other times he seems silly.
