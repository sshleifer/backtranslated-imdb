"De Dominee" is based on the life of a real Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! In the movie he is called Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that the events presented in the film have something to do with what really happened! But that does not really matter! Because you could not get my attention! This movie bored the crap out of me! Lack of substance and style! The part of the substance could have been forgiven if the performance was good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the substance you at least have to bring some decent style or action! Do not we need to have fun? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! It's obvious he did not! Otherwise, he would not have done it the way he did! This movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie so ever! Without this "De Dominee" would never have been successful! I'm sure of that!
