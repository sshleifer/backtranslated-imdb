Apparently, the film has a tough anti-Bush message ... If it does happen (I do not get it), that's all. It's boring and useless, period. <br /> <br /> It's very serious at times being a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, it's not funny, it's not exciting, it's not exciting, it's not movie. It's all too much to be the other way around and vice versa. I was amazed at how bad a movie could suck. Do not even think about watching it. <br /> <br /> I've watched hundreds of movies, and I've never been so compelled to write a notice about IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even "The Making of ..." is painfully boring. It's just people talking nonsense with a lot of inner jokes in front of a camera, more or less like a home movie. There is even a part where a guy takes you on a food tour that was consumed on set by the film crew. Still, hit the movie I think ...
