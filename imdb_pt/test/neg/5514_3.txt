As several "suggested" posters, this is an excuse "Star Wars". Now, if you're going to start "Star Wars", at least do it right; "Battlestar Galactica" did, and there were some other space operas that did not do a bad job, but definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall, the youth leader, is not really that bad, though he exaggerates the "fluffy" factor from time to time. Vince Edwards has not improved much as an actor since his "Ben Casey" days; if anything, it is even more wood than he was ten years old. The other presentations are also nothing to write. Worse still are the special effects; The best you can say about them is that they suck. It is obvious that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex, and the "battle" scenes between Edwards' attackers and the aliens are poorly staged and poorly filmed. A very weak effort from Roger Corman. Skip this.
