You Belong To Me was the final team of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a big screen team and was a movie borrowed from the Fonda for Columbia Pictures. Fonda has signed a contract with 20th Century Fox to obtain Tom Joad's part in The Grapes of Wrath. But after that, it was usually his loan movies that were good as he was thrown into mediocre things on Fox. <br /> <br /> But the rule was broken here. Although the character he plays has some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike from The Lady Eve, this movie is by no means so funny. In fact, feminists would probably be amazed at this. <br /> <br /> In fact, Barbara Stanwyck herself did not like it at all. She was very fond of working with Henry Fonda, but she thought this movie was ridiculous. Just as she should have. Fonda is another millionaire playboy, whom we would now call a fiduciary baby who does not do much with his life. He's a kind of kind idiot who finds Stanwyck on a ski slope and literally falls in love with her trying to show off. It turns out that she is a doctor and they have a fast dating and get married. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that Fonda has a jealous tendency, especially when involving Roger Clark, another millionaire patient of Stanwyck. And he is not understanding his professional obligations. Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, was and is a feminist icon. When she tells Fonda that he should go out into the world of work and live on a salary and see if he can, Fonda leaves and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. She is so proud of him that she will actually give up her medical practice and live with him on her salesman's salary. <br /> <br /> Today NOW would be picketing the movie. Stanwyck did not have much conviction in his performance, probably because he did not believe in any of it. I certainly could not. <br /> <br /> I do not think even at that time the public also believed. But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best, but this was a special Thanksgiving.
