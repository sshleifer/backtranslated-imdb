This is an admirable attempt by the first time filmmaker Ham Tran, offering little-read perspective dealing with the victims of the Vietnam War fighting for liberation, but plays out as a special glorified story. With a clumsy, consciously informative and sub-par performance, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not give life to this meager, yet historically decent, melodrama. Not paying attention to the disconnect that often distracts reality actors from on-screen situations, and you should stick with an informative, if somewhat impersonal, educational lesson in postwar Vietnam history.
