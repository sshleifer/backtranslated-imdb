the worst sequel I've ever seen. really horrible songs that is disturbing considering how fantastic the first soundtrack and story is! Also, what spoils the movie for me is the fact that there is no John Cleese so jean bob could very well be in it and the new villains are terrible. It's really annoying how this old woman-type thing can not tie a simple sentence correctly without repeating its words over and over again. but to be fair Uberta does not shut up is a bit funny. but the fact that it was her fiftieth birthday: why do they call her an 80-year-old girl? I was going to give a 1, but now I think ... I could give a 2, but still the story is not as good as the first movie. is similar without the humor of certain characters. Overall I did not like this movie entirely because of the disappointing music, the serious lack of voice talent: have changed the voice of Prince Derek and jean bob, the new villains, disappointing plot the annoying habits of some characters and the very simple animation .
