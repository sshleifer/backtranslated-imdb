This movie was filmed using a digital camera, and it shows. There were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, also with the help of a terrible score. As if that were not enough, the performance was also terrible. Now, in Hartley movies, acting is always peculiar, but here was just BAD, especially by Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank god) can not say much. After all these external problems, it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not so good. Jokes are predictable and incredibly direct, and events only happen from one incident to another. The so-called book of life with Armageddon inside is not much more than an excuse to watch the actors struggle to speak their lines. After all, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. Thumbs down.
