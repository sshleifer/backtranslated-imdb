I do not remember when I saw a worse movie. The acting was exaggerated, the dialogue trivial to the point of being painful to hear, the special effects of second category and the general story laughable. <br /> <br /> I never wanted to go out on a movie anymore. And if I were alone, that would be what I would have done, about 30 minutes later, and it would save me almost another dozen hours of nausea-inducing dialogues and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese "the size of Texas" I just can not emphasize too much that miserable experience sitting through this colloidal waste of perfectly good celluloid was. <br /> <br />
