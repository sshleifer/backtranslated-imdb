An obvious cash-in on the trick * Insert Monster Here * On A Plane, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you would expect it to be. <br /> <br /> The movie has little or no plot, which is what you would expect from such a movie. Although it's fun in parts, I must say. The zombie action is particularly fun. Once the film picks up, it never stops; the pace is solid. <br /> <br /> Special practical effects are very good, but the CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> The ending seems to leave the movie open to a sequel. Let's hope this does not happen. <br /> <br /> If you are a diehard fan of the sub genre of horror movies, I recommend it to you; worth at least one watch. However, if you are just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
