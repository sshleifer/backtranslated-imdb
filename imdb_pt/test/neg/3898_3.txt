I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his junk movies, but almost every time I see one of them, I see only lost opportunities and plots that do not work well. This film is not, unfortunately, any different. The film certainly had great potential, as Franco fused the intriguing theme of the classic "The Most Dangerous Game" with its usual brand of useless slash, but the plot here is often lost, and it takes an eternity for Franco. to work around the main point of the movie. Being this a later Franco film, you may be forgiven for thinking that the director would have improved, but in fact I found out that the opposite is true; like this one and the terrible 'Killer Barbys' are two of his worst movies. The plot focuses on a stripper and her despicable boyfriend. The couple is invited to a private island by a wealthy woman and her lover. However, they soon discover that they were not invited there for social reasons, as they are "freed" on the island so the rich woman and her friends can hunt them for sport! <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this film was the cover and the fact that it was directed by the sleaze flicks king. You would think then that I would be glad that the movie shows a multitude of sex scenes and general beatings; but I'm not. The reason for this is mainly that the sex and the contempt in the movie are really boring and most of the time served only to give me the condition known as "fast finger forward." However, my inclination to see everything until the end assured that I had to cram it. There was a time when I did not think girl-on-girl could be boring, but I've proven it wrong ever since. The only positive thing I can capture the film is that the soundtrack is quite captivating, and despite being a foreign pop song; really fits in nicely with the sex scenes. I liked the last ten minutes; like when the plot finally began, but it was a case of little too late and unfortunately this is a severely dull movie. Overall, I would only recommend this movie to those who feel they should watch all the films from the franc over 180 years ... everyone should watch Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy.
