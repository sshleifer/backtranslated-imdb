As a great Jim Carey fan, I sat in the movies optimistically. After all, Fun With Dick and Jane seemed to have all the raw materials to make that other success Carey. After the first five minutes of good humor, it looked like the movie would work, but it went awry as soon as the plot began. The idea that a charming and charismatic VIP employee might suddenly find himself working at his nearest supermarket. is so hard to believe, and then to get the round head the fact that this guy also became a master criminal is virtually impossible. The actors also seem confused by the situation. Of course, the stereotyped, rich, indifferent head of the operation does not go the extra mile to achieve its one-dimensional character, but for Carey and others around him, work is much harder. One minute, Dick is seen as a professional arrogant, obsessed with possessions, the next minute he is a mess that can barely join two words and finally he becomes a thief who is able, very happy, to put a gun on another . head of man. Jane is equally confused by her role and her character is never really going. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is so good and it's a shame that this movie has not managed to make it work. The odd moment of loud laughter can be found, but it is usually more physical humor than anything witty or intelligent. Carey tries her best in parts to save a ship that is sinking, but her comedic talent can never flourish in a character who has so many holes in her personality. Carey shines when introduced to a strong and daring character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura) that this movie never presented him, despite his best efforts.
