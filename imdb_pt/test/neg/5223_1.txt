I recently had the idea of ​​doing a short film featuring a man who is run over by a car and wakes up thinking he is Chuck Norris himself. This meant that I would have to do extensive research on Chuck and find out as much as I could about the man. Later, I discover that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With a face like that, who could doubt it? I've watched more Chuck Norris movies in the last four months than anyone should. I am proud to say that Bells of Innocence is right near the top of the worst list ever. I spent most of the movie wondering if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt, which I had bitten not to swallow my own tongue. The biggest reason I chose to buy this movie was that it not only had Chuck but his son Mike. I was anxious to see if Mike was a chip from the old non-acting-out-of-a-paper-wet block. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in movie history for one simple reason. The only character he's ever played is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter the movie, no matter the situation, it is always Chuck Norris. The only thing he maintains about the son is that he is consistent. Mike does not seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter, he seems to be extremely happy! Maybe it's because he pushed his daughter into traffic, as described in one of the strangest flashbacks of all time. His actions confused me throughout the film, making it very difficult for me to focus on the little plot that there was. The other two main actors were as painful to watch as Norris's son. The guy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters who ever graced the Direct to Video screen. The only thing I remember him being in other than this movie, was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes this guy something. The other guy, who is the only name I can think of because he was so forgettable, was his Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, in fact I am one, but this guy was too much for me. To complete the story, you have a crowd of people in town who love to call people "friend", and a couple of villains who do not seem to be able to decide which one is in charge. Not to mention scary kids who remind me of the dollar version of all the other scary kids groups in movies. All in all, the film is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time, at more levels than Chuck Norris can kick the butts of people. Despite being one of the worst actors of all time, I still can not get enough of Chuck. Maybe he really was sent from heaven ...
