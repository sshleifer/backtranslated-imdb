If you value your life in any way, shape or form, you'll do yourself a courtesy and go through that seemingly "interesting" movie on the DVD holder. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking, "I saw the preview and it looked great!" However, buyer beware, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed some reluctance to watch this movie, but I forced her to stay out. Oh, how I regret that decision. <br /> <br /> Like most horror movies, the movie begins happily in a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are drawn to an old Mayan ruin by a resort mate. Upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two people from the jungle who are practically oblivious to their cries of greeting. As if that was not sufficiently ominous, the group of tourists left aside the growth of large plants and declared that an unused path consumed by wildlife is a perfect route to their destination. I do not think it would be much of a movie if they used rational decision-making and turned around at the time, but, well, that was not much of a movie anyway. <br /> After a few hikes, sixsome (the resort patron brought a friend) to stumble over the ruins and for once their doubts are dispelled by their beauty and history. That is, until frantic tribal people come out of the jungle armed with revenge for no reason, screaming in an indecipherable tongue. Since when brutal verbal assaults are soothed by the calm and paternalistic language - do not ask me - but even so, the cast tries anyway, without success obviously. Suddenly, the sixth member of the trail, Dimitri, is pierced with several arrowheads from the Mayans and all hell breaks loose. A shot ends work and horrified travelers quickly retreat to ruin. <br /> <br /> Now, if ever there was a plot for this movie, it ended here. The introduction took at most 20 minutes and unfortunately were the best 20 minutes of the film. At the top of the ruins, the now fifth realizes that they are trapped by murderous places and make countless good decisions, one of which is to use a parched rope to lower one of its members into the bowels of ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously injured and then trapped inside the ruins and the two girlfriends are seriously injured trying to rescue him. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film continues without plot, with no real horror, only blood and blood, as shown when a girl pulls a plant growing inside her, gushing streams of blood and then again when someone's legs are cut, just to have the same claw from inside the girl that strangles him later. <br /> <br /> My only satisfactions in this movie were watching the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, growing more and more worn and distressed and sitting long enough to verify that almost the entire cast dies horribly and horribly . Their simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for how long this movie was. <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the plot says that ruin is an old house of dangerous spirits with an evil plant that feeds on meat to defend itself. and consume unlucky visitors. Unfortunately, I did not get such a warning to scream bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing related to this movie that I'm really horrified about is the screenwriter.
