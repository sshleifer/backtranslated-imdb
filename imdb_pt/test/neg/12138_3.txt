UP AT THE VILLA (2000) ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> WARNING: YOU CAN FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD. It's hard to know what's the point of UP AT THE VILLA, a beautiful but shallow piece of time, one of those made with the sole purpose of winning Oscar nominations for best costumes and art direction (one for cinematography and one for the score are also welcome). It has the same basic idea of ​​thousands of period pieces produced every year: a smart and beautiful woman who tries to find love in a strange place for her. She has many difficulties, but finally finds her happiness in the arms of a man who is not the one with whom she had a feat. In this case, our lady is in Florence, some time before World War II. She is an English widow committed to a rich and elderly man (who, of course, she does not love). One day she meets another man, who has no good reputation, but by whom she falls in love. Of course there is a friend who will help her for good or ill and a third man who commits suicide here in the girl's room, creating a risk situation for her. Guess how the story ends ...? <br /> <br /> UP AT THE VILLA is not a bad movie. I've always been very interested in the story, but I've never been excited. The problem is not the slow pace, but the script. Adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, thrilling, twists and suspense. Every time you think the story will heat up, it gets colder again. If you think there's a conspiracy involving the average Florence police chief, well, there is, but that does not change almost anything in history. It just keeps going and going, until the foreseeable end. <br /> <br /> As I said, UP AT THE VILLA is not bad. If it's a bit bland, it's never too sentimental and sentimental. The acting is a half and a half, but it certainly convinces. Kristin Scott Thomas made some really bad choices after the ENGLISH PATIENT (the romantic drama saaaaaaappy THE HORSE WHISPERER and the dull / irritating RANDOM HEARTS). UP AT THE VILLA is undoubtedly better than these pieces and Kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. Sean Penn is good as always, even if his character is a big guy. Anne Bancroft is an excellent actress (THE GRADUATE, my God!), And here she does not let her character become ridiculous. Now the supporting actors are very bad (Jeremy Davies is sooo annoying!). <br /> <br /> The direction is good, but not audacious. It was interesting to know that the director is the same as ANGELS AND INSECTS (also starring Kristin Scott Thomas), another period drama, but bolder than that. What matters here are visuals. Florence is wonderful, the costumes are great, the scenery, the music ... <br /> <br /> In the end, UP AT THE VILLA is a medium romantic drama, but of course it could have been so much better. It's watchable and interesting, but do not expect a thriller - it's not! This type of film fails because it wants to have some mystery, something to be seen ... However, there is not much to say mainly because of the superficial script. Now, on the Oscar nominations, do not worry, you'll probably catch them.
