I suppose in 1997, Hollywood was not quite on the verge of openly celebrating homosexuality, so someone might want to give some credit to those who put this film together for showing a little courage. You simply want to be credited to them for having organized a really good movie, and in my opinion, "In & Out" does not qualify for that count. It is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - a high school English teacher who, on the eve of his marriage, is expelled by a former student who wins an Oscar and goes through what can only be described as a self-discovery when he accepts to be homosexual. For me, that was the first problem with this movie. Howard really did not have to be gay. The film would have been funnier (and perhaps even more thought-provoking) if Brackett remained defiantly straightforward despite the stereotypically gay aspects of his life and the city's belief after the Oscar speech that he was gay. (Actually, I thought identifying him as gay, given the presence of these stereotypes, might actually have been an insult to the gay community, as well as heterosexual men who like poetry and believe in dressing well!) < Kline was decent enough on paper, and largely held the film. In addition to it, most of the other cast members (though great actors) were people who were not really noticed by their big-screen success. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors, but not big movie stars. I really thought the funniest (if very small) role in the movie was that of Sonya's supermodel, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (speaking of stereotypes, I loved her stereotypical model line). I promised to do that. I have to take bath and vomit! ") In the end, what really discouraged me about this movie was the ridiculous ending, starting with the graduation ceremony (and to be honest, even if someone decided that graduation was really necessary, the movie should have finished there, instead of continuing with the nuptials totally unnecessary at the end. <br /> <br /> Basically, I got some laughs from that, but nothing more.
