It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the unpleasant and brutal murders? Where is the tension that should scare us? This is like watching Sesame Street without the funny characters of Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the writing ... maybe the direction. <br /> <br /> Maybe the acting, maybe the editing, maybe the cinematography, maybe the special effects, maybe the makeup. <br /> <br /> Maybe all this has brought this to something that can barely keep your eyes focused. <br /> <br /> I wanted to be scared ... not bored. <br /> <br /> This did not scare me ... it did not interest me ... I had more fun watching the turn in the microwave instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to buy it .. and if you watch on television for some freak chance, there is no need to bend the sleeping children.
