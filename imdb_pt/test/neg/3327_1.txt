My daughter liked it, but I was horrified that a character in this movie smokes. As if it were not horrible enough to see "product placement" agents like Bruce Willis who smoke in their movies - at least children's films should be more attentive! I ask myself: was this intentional? Did the big tobacco "sponsor" the movie? What does it take to ban smoke from movies? At least films aimed at children and teenagers.
