"Clubbed" is more of a "go-it-to-do"? enter the genre of British brutes and is sure to keep those bettors who are not expecting very moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for those looking for smart and quality entertainment, it is actually best to avoid it. <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes in the terrifying script that even an actor of Colin Salmon's caliber continues to sound crazy. The action is set in the 1980s, but it's never clear why, especially when they failed to get a convincing feel for that decade - it takes more than a few 80s soul albums on the soundtrack, a handful of 30 years old. So we see central characters studying texts like "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu and talking about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem very willing to begin distributing punches with all the unthinking abandonment of testosterone. of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chips. <br /> <br /> Character development does not exist on "Clubbed". Not the irony, the subtlety or the pathos. This is a film that exchanges good memories of Guy Richie's first gangster films, which despite their flaws, certainly had much more intelligence, better editing, quick dialogues and more emotional impact than this fragile saga. They're a decade old now, anyway - is not it time we moved from trying to imitate them?
