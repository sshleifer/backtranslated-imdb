No no no no no no! This is not a movie, it's an excuse to show people dancing. This is not good. Even the dance is slow and not as fun as the mediocre 'Dirty Dancing', let alone any other good dance film. <br /> <br /> Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? It's a comedy? Not that this movie is a bit of everything, it is that this film fails in everything it tries to be. The film ends up being even more meaningless as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible on all sides, the script is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart comes on the scene and you think the film can improve as it illuminates the gloomy atmosphere. For a second.
