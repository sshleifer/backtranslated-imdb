After I could not ignore the hype about the show, I started watching the first season and it sounded pretty good and I got hooked ... for about 5 episodes, then started spiraling down. Because? First, Ethan Suplee is scripted to act as a complete idiot confirming that he is obviously throwing up semi-random things with high expectations that it somehow became the next best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly has stunning visuals, but if she thinks she'll stretch her lips to explore parts of her face that they normally never go to and make strange faces to accentuate everything she says are hilarious, she is off course. Maybe she thought her character would be very boring, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but made a flurry of color, an exaggeration of spices and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes, ears and intellect. <br /> <br /> I really, really wanted to love this show, like I said, the premise is great (comes from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny by Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee is doing a good job here along with some of the other actors, but there's no way I can be sucked in and forget that this is just a show, because the surreal and extreme characters of Pressly and Suplee wake me abruptly when they show up. It's worth noting that their characters and acting would be fine were it not for a 70 something-part series and if they did not have so much time on the screen.
