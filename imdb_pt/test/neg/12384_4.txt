Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees a UFO while trying to fly a plane - but nothing appears on the radar. Then planes and ships begin to disappear and reports of an increase in UFOs. It turns out it is a gigantic monster that is attacking and killing. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> This has all the right elements for a classic. It has a really fun script - I was never really bored. The acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). Morrow does not exaggerate in the act of the male hero and Mara Corday is very good as the female love interest. She is also strong and takes care of herself - even if she can not get food and coffee for everyone during the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God - it's TERRIBLE! It looks like a crazed turkey! It has a long neck, a BEAK hilariously stupid, some teeth, some hair on the head and claws. And - oh yes - it's croaking! Not roaring - quack! The actors had no idea what it looked like - was added after the production. The actors Morrow and Corday were horrified when they finally saw a theater. Morrow said his audience started laughing and he left the movie quickly before the end of the movie! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for that. He wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster of all time. And you can see the wires moving too! This only gets 4 stars because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. There are no stars for the pathetic monster - wait until you see attack what is obviously a toy train! It's worth looking at if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster of all time.
