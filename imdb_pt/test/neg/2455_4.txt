From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre made a number of successful Moto movies. While technically B films, they were much better than typical films of the genre. However, Lorre got tired of making these highly repetitive films and told his friends that he wanted to leave the series. When it was canceled in 1939, Lorre was thrilled, but his plans to get more complicated and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of those films and it is quite obvious that the studio is not putting much effort into the film, since I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins, maybe ... but still the movie made little sense. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy agreeing to be an agent disguised as a government. He must infiltrate an island in the United States where something strange is wrong. Now they could easily have a search warrant to do this. But since the penguins were writing the film, the agent takes rap for a murder he did not commit and spends a year in prison for it. He apparently expects him to be on probation for this island, as many paroles are sent there when his term is over. <br /> <br /> There are some more serious problems with this idea. First, they only make it serve a year before they get paroled - but he was convicted of MURDER and refused to divulge who he really was. They never matched anyone in a case like this. Second, what if he was not on probation for the island? He would have spent a year in jail for nothing! Third, why do not only divers, paratroopers or police officers on boats arrive on the island? Talk about a planned plot! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that the evil Peter Lorre set up his own private prison and hired parolees as slave labor. What about the men who need to report to probation officers? This was never explained, but Lorre used them for the diamonds and they were treated abominably. Now another question I had was that if Lorre was discovering huge diamonds there, he was a very rich man. So why not just pay people to mine for diamonds?! Why mount your own version of Devil's Island and beat and kill men wildly?! <br /> <br /> Eventually, Lorre receives what is his and the slaves of the island are released. Unfortunately, at this point, I did not really care. Overall, watchable, but pretty stupid. Lorre's career only improved when he moved the following year to Warner Brothers. With films like ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN, I could see why his stay at Columbia was short.
