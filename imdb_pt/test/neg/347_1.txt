I watched this movie just because I was under the impression that I would be treated to a cheese horror movie. I mean, look at the slogan, "They're men inside out! And worse ... they're still alive!" Does not that scream cheese horror movie to you? And then there's the title itself - "Screamer." What a perfect title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I was not aware that the actual title was, appropriately translated, "The Isle of Men-Fish." <br /> <br /> So, about an hour to watch this I realized that this was not a tacky horror movie at all - it was a kitschy story of "adventures" about the Atlantis fish minnows. "Men turned inside out"? No. There was nothing of the sort. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn misleading slogans! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!
