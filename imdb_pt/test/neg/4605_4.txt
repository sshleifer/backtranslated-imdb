Perry Mason: The Glass Coffin Case meets Raymond Burr defending David Copperfield / Rick Blaine as the magician Peter Scolari on a murder charge involving one of his assistants. A trick involving a glass coffin suspended in the air goes wrong and Nancy Grahn's body falls off. <br /> Nancy was one of six female assistants who worked on the act and we learned two things about her. First in a moment of drunken weakness, Scolari was seduced by her and she claims she was pregnant. Secondly, she is living under a false name and had a secret from her past. <br /> <br /> Billy Moses, who probably never thought he'd be doing such difficult things in law school, will come across a couple of good things. Older boys when they look for truth in Grahn's hometown. A little more action than usual for Ken Malansky, he almost kills himself. <br /> <br /> One major flaw in this mystery is simple forensics. The coroner's report should have provided concrete evidence that the victim was killed in such a way that Scolari could not have taken the action. The police should be looking for a different direction for the killer. <br /> <br /> When you see who the killer is, you will not blame the individual, but you will also see how investigator James McEachin made a mistake from the beginning. It kind of ruins that special Mason movie.
