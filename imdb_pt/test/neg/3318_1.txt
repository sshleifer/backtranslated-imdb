Even if I had not read Anne Rice's "Queen of the Damned" of the "Vampire Chronicles," I would probably still think this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> It was without taste, without history, it made absolutely no sense. I sat for a while thinking of the unfamiliar plot of the book, and the more I thought about it, the worse it was. Joining him in some way to the previous Chronicles movie is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with the film, let alone the book. The few ideas drawn from Rice's genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" were massacred and ridiculed. <br /> <br /> It's an absolute insult to Anne Rice fans everywhere and a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being the last Aaliyah movie. . Truly, it's an insult to Aaliyah fans as well. <br /> <br /> Possibly the only compliment can be paid for the sound effects as well as some of the graphics. As good as it may be, it's still not enough to regret the time spent watching this movie. In fact, I signed up for this association for the simple reason of communicating with people who bother to look at this movie (7 years after the release, as it may be) so as not to waste their time or wait far beyond disappointment.
