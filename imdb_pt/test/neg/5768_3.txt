The plot is a jumper of complaint made a deal with the devil to find gold, and is forced to protect it forever. A group of friends finds the gold and is convinced by the old miner and they are forced to blow the gold to pieces to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how this movie does not win the movie Oscar of the year? What a compelling plot of late 20s people running a claim jumper straight out of the 1800's. I love how in other movies you can not kill the monster, but they can knock you down ... this movie they write the monster as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film clearly rips Nightmare on Elm Street part 4, but what the heck, did not like that movie was a 5-star classic as well. <br /> <br /> Highlight of the film is when we are introduced to a girl who has never gone to school, never left the city, never learned to read or write .... still speaks perfect English, is smoking hot and uses last fashion. How did Oscar lose that? <br /> <br /> OK, I finished with the bad jokes, this movie is pure and I only watch if you have nothing better to do and all the spices in the rack of spices are already in alphabetical order. /> <br /> 2 of 10
