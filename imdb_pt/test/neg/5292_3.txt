I liked the beautiful landscape in this movie the first time I saw it when I was 9 years old. Dunderklumpen is a kind of cuteness for children in a tacky way. This reminded me of HRPUFFINSTUFF on Saturday mornings, their Swedish scenarios make it easier for the eyes. Do not expect older children to be interested, since live animation is long overdue and most older children will be bored. This is definitely a movie under 10 years old and a bit of memories for those of us who were small. children in 1974.
