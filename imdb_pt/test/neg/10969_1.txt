I have no idea how accurate the portrait of Flynn appears in this film, but even as a work of fiction, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and you leave. You're wondering how he got from one scene to the next - you just do not get the minimal information you need to maintain some continuity and understand your current situation, and it's difficult to understand the motives of Flynn and other characters behind some of their behaviors. Add to that a lot of silly and implausible situations and you have a movie that looks like one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you're sleeping but when you wake up and try to remember It's just weird, totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There are many long and dull musical sections of the film that to me are a bad direction or a bad director trying and not being artistic. <br /> <br /> None of the characters are friendly and the character Flynn comes across as a liar, thug, thief, thief, killer, bear fighter, gigolo and impostor who will do anything and step on someone to promote their own dreams, and somehow, despite all this, great opportunities seem to miraculously fall on his lap. <br /> <br /> This movie is not fun or satisfying anyway and by all accounts not even historically accurate, so why even watch it? To rub salt into the wound, the DVD had one of the worst downloads I've ever seen, it was not even on wide screen or in Dolby 5.1, had terrible oscillation of telecine and many, many artifacts of what appeared to be a roll of film that was putting together dust and scratches somewhere.
