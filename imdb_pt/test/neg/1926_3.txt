To be fair, it's been several years since I've observed the bile compromised with the celluloid known as "Here on Earth," so forgive me if my memory of the film is a bit shallow. I'll stick with the main points that torment the soul of the unhappy viewer. Scene One: Chris Klein, after being expelled from high school (because he looks like a seventeen-year-old) yes, very believable), gives what I suppose to be his orator's speech ... to a field. Let me repeat this for you - a field. I think we should be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he is failing to express. Klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. It is a decent piece of cardboard, but little else. Scene Two: After some pyromaniac jokes, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett do some damage to the local restaurant, of which he is forced. rebuild. Clear. Because who better to help with the construction than some random idiot who collided with him / burnt in the first place. Better yet, let's say the random idiot messes with Josh Hartnett's girl, Miss Sobeski, the girl he likes ... his equally wooden delivery? Scene Three: Chris Klein's character is kissing with the character of Leelee Sobeski and decides to name his various parts of the body after the states on the east coast. My soul cries. Really, how can this scenario work? Surely you must alienate several million people if you insinuate that your house is equivalent to the most ... erm ... female areas of Miss Sobeski. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey provokes some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is actually extremely disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Scene four: Leelee is running. She falls. That gives her ... knee cancer. "We always knew we could go back," says her father (?). Right. Knee cancer. To stumble. Maybe I missed something. Like I said, it's been a few years. I certainly missed something. Did not? For God's sake, please tell me the girl did not get KNEE's cancer to fall. <br /> <br /> That cry that you just heard was my soul dying.
