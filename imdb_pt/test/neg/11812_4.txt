If you think it's nice to be obsessive about who you are passionate about, then I can imagine giving a good rating ... but I can not imagine this subject of obsessiveness and have little respect for others (like the way Paulie treats teachers who try to help you) are all you would like to teach your children. Yes, the way Victoria treated Paulie is also bad, but guess what. This is life. Is not it a more important lesson to learn how to overcome these disappointments and get the best out of your life? Or is a better lesson falling from the roof to teach our children? Secondly, when Mary's father did not show up for dinner, and Paulie helped Mary release her anger, which Mary even said she would like him to be dead ... Somehow I do not think it's a good message that you deal with it. his disappointments of anger.
