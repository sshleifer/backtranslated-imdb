I really do not know why I'm writing this. I think most people agree that this movie is bad. Well, let me just say this: <br /> <br /> When I start to see some movies, I like them. So over time, my opinion changes about the movie. This happened with the end of days. I liked the first time I saw it. I thought it was fun. But a few weeks later my opinion changed. So to solve this, I watched again at a friends house. Well, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm a logical person. If I see a logical hole in a movie, I try to ignore it. If I see two, I start to get bored. More than two and I'm p *** off. End of days made me p *** after my second showing. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is a bit depressing. Everything is sad. Everything from Arnold's acting to the color of the film. But dark movies do not bother me, but something else did ... <br /> <br /> If Satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you kill him in his mortal form? If you shoot him, his skin grows back. If you cut off his head, a new one should pop up again. So, what's the point of trying to kill him? I'll tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain. That's not the devil my friends. This is a human being reminiscent of those Bond villains who give the whole scheme to the hero there. <br /> <br /> Like I said, it's worth a look, but I do not see it twice because it sucks.
