So many fans, so little to show for it. I know, I know, these words will find me in a great minority. Many people really liked the good will to hunt. But seriously, please make great movies, not even close, and we will put the blame where it belongs ... in writing. <br /> <br /> Now, I know they've won an Oscar for it, and man, they look good emoting on the screen. But Good Will Hunting is an ABC special after school, with a lot of curse, and a slightly larger budget. <br /> <br /> What this film shows is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein can take dung, feed you, and make you believe in your bonsai. And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created a buzzing so loud around him that people believed, and wanted to believe so much - that they saw glow where there was none. <br /> <br /> Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I do not think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it more in the middle of the street movies, and also some great movies made for TV (although not HBO movies, HBO movies are exceptionally better than Good Will Hunting would one day be.) It's just a little movie with some good acting, Robin Williams was not good at it, they just gave him the Oscar because they were eager to do it for a while. And of course, Miramax's public relations machine has secured Ben and Matt their Oscar script ... but one person comes ... there are better movies out there, which are GWH.
