I realize why people hate this movie. And I hated the Blair Witch Project, so go find out? This is the most staged possible and yes, they insult your intelligence, trying to make it look real. I really enjoyed the story of Madame Lalaurie, although it is more than likely to have been invented. But the main reason I like this movie is whether or not it's fake when the ghosts start attacking and kidnapping them, I always get chills and I have to look back when it looks like something is there with me. I know it's my imagination but more than half the nonsense that is horror in today's movie theaters and DVDs does not give me shivers, so this makes it a scary delight. Not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it, not for the gorehounds, as with a PG-13 rating there is no gore. And females are very annoying! You will want the ghosts to take them out and try them out before all is said and done. ** outside of *****.
