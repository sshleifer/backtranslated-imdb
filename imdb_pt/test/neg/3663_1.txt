Is not it the best movie in the world ???? That was a euphemism. I personally did not like this movie. Not because of the plot, not because of graphic violence and nudity. Nudity really did not need to be in her, it did nothing for the story, except maybe the girls were going through a difficult time, and getting naked probably messed up even more. But one of the things I hated in the movie was that it was sooo dark. You could not really understand what was happening. I guess if it was not so dark, and you could see where they were, then it might not have been so bad. Everything you know is a basement somewhere. You see no house, no road, no killer on it, all you could see was half your face for about 5 seconds. I want to see some things in a movie. It gets annoying after 20 minutes of darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. Then you'll hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that really stood out to me that was good about the movie, maybe the suspense in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not the suspense of how the movie will end, but the suspense of .. I can see anything in this movie but some naked bodies and several flashing lights. But honestly people, this was an aspiring Saw meets Blair Witch Project. Both of the best movies, and both with the right lighting to figure out what was going on. Forget this movie if you can see .. if you are a blind person .. you may want to rent it to hear the screams if you like that kind of thing. But then again, if you are blind, your probably not reading this either .. so anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
