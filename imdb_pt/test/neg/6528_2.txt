.... and now I'm in episode # 7. I really hoped it was over (not to mention canceled, since everything related to the show - including the actors - was thrown along with some toxic junk in the middle of the ocean in some place, never to be seen again) because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Having this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is, at best, misleading! It's so hard to believe that Ben Elton could write something so bad, maybe this point to many comments from other writers on everything he has been connected to before. In some episodes I did not even laugh once! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can not believe that Ardal O'Hanlon actually stopped making 'My Hero' and started doing that instead, his decision-making skills were obviously impaired that day - maybe he simply could not read, and did not realize how poor the scripts were for the "Blessed." Do not get me wrong, 'My Hero' is not a masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> And just to annoy me even more, I bet this will be released on DVD well, when there are so many great TV shows that are not being released!
