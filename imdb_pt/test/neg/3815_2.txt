A terrible movie that is amateur at almost every level - a boring and derivative script full of stereotyped characters played by shamed actors for a director without the most rudimentary understanding of his craft. The whole thing stinks. It plays like a horror movie from the early eighties, down to low quality punctuation and SFX ketchup, but without the nostalgia of childhood it is necessary to look fondly at such scum. One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen - definitely the worst that has received a mainstream theatrical release. I've never been out of a movie in my life - if I had had the bad luck to see 'Hatchet' in the movies, I would have been the first. Avoid at all costs.
