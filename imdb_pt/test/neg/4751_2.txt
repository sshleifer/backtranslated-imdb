There was a time when the Alien series was a success, even with the third installment, Alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a blockbuster especially due to its history, "on the peak" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator movies were all very successful and created massive followers among movie fans in general and science fiction fans. Undoubtedly Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should signal the end for both franchises, but the studios were not intimidated and saw the opportunity to give in to rumors among the fans and combine the two. Step on Paul W. Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Strauss Brothers (graduates in visual effects, not even directors or writers). The problem was that allowing such deep, revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of a mediocre director and now a beginner toward it led to nothing but profanity, synthesized by incompetence. When witnessing the Alien Vs. Predator Requiem (AVPR), the involuntary fans will feel badly belly down, saying that this series could have gotten worse. <br /> <br /> An example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene. and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an alien arriving at the Predator ship, spurting from the predator's chest, growing to an adult Predalien and knocking down the Predator ship (which now appears to have far fewer predators than at the end). of Alien Vs Predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in the Earth's atmosphere. As the spacecraft collapses, the AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plotting methods and basic narrative conventions, and does not venture to use any of the twists or subversions of the two original films. The tiresome plot progresses with a tedious rhythm, punctuated only by the almost exhilarating conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us, we are treated with a seductive blonde in a bikini or a quick shooting. The AVPR is plagued by an endless series of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation, ie members of the public who surpass an elite military unit or the Predator does not adhere to the laws laid down in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disrespect for its predecessors, breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel, and in doing so, it gives the impression that it is trying to set itself up as an independent resource. Regardless, the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul, and with reference to other films lack even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the narrative about the film, which undermines the basic premise of the first alien. Because if the species had been found before, then those in the first Alien movie would have been more proficient and not so ill-prepared when they encountered them. <br /> <br /> On a film note, the movie is close to being terrible, I felt at some points to light a torch on the screen, the lighting was so bad. Through the use of such dark and gloomy effects can the public feel as if they are being cheated of some action? which ironically is their purpose and also indicates the lack of budget of the films. As with all the science fiction that a scene usually presents as the most memorable in this case, it is probably the scene of impregnation of the hospital, since it is based so tenuously on the themes of the original Alien, literalizing it. The direction is weak, there are weak performances and the script is rotten. AVPR is the product of a film production conveyor belt system in which ideas and techniques are assembled by inefficient people and then the finished product is distributed among the theaters. This is epitomized by the absence of bloody scenes of death and bloody battles because the certification will not allow? lower certification by reaching a larger audience. AVPR was purely a commercial enterprise and nothing more.
