Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays a terminally ill actress. We do not know with what. It's a little precursor to "Love Story" in this regard. <br /> William Bendix is ​​good, as are most of the supporting cast. John Payne must be suffering, but it sounds like sleepwalking. The girl who plays the child he and O'Hara adopt does the best with a planned device: of course! Adopt an orphan. She will live after his wife's death. It's a sweet movie, but it does not sound sincere. I expected to be moved. I was, by O'Hara's gentle performance. But I do not like to feel manipulated.
