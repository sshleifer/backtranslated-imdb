I'm surprised that so many comments on this movie are positive. Having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say very well in this film. If I forget the origins of the story, I may consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course, bringing such a book to the big screen is a task that should not be envied but could be done with class. I can not understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando would probably have made a better Sinuhe, but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to do justice to the book. Remember that Mika Waltari left the Premier of this movie in the middle of the show. That's how much he liked it.
