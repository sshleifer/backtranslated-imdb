I was avoiding this movie for some time ... because I saw it as an unnecessary portion of a series that should have only two parts. But after reading some very favorable comments ... from some IMDB observers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented from my local rental company. I need to go further ... when I say .... that was a lost buck-50. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. First ... I realize that no one wanted to see a 33-year-old Macchio in this movie ..... But, why could not they have had Miyagi read a letter or something from Daniel-san ... maybe explaining what happened with Daniel ... hell, they could at least have made a quick mention of daniel or something. But no ... and to compose the already bad script ... they added these stupid monks ... I thought the monks made a vow of silence ... I think these monks do not take their votes seriously .. . Hehehe. The training the girl spent in the movie was rushed and stupid ... and the paramilitary group of young men ... was a confusing concept to say the least ... this was far from a martial arts movie. .com the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene ... and then she did not even get close to being hit once ... by the male fighting against her ... give me some time ... she would have been hit at least once ... I think the writers and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl being assaulted by a man on this. I could go on and on and on ... but basically ... I'll end up saying that this movie was so bad ... even the girl they chose was not cool nor looky (she was kind of "butch" looking .. .. I can only think of a handful of movies that I've been through ... that compare to how bad this movie was ..... DO NOT WASTE THE TIME IN THIS ONE .. ........
