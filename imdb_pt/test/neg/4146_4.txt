I can not believe this is a movie I did not like. . . I usually think I'm open-minded about all sorts of things. . . but this movie is just, well, bad. <br /> <br /> I could handle the subject if the script and story were better. I could handle the acting if the camera work was better or the characters were better established. . . I think it mostly comes down to script and direction though. <br /> <br /> It was bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give the lowest grade, but. . . I do not believe it, at least this guy got out of his ass to make a movie. . . so it earns four stars (just above the average it has so far)
