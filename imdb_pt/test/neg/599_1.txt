I would have given this MINOR a rating of 1 if it were possible. The whole movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. What a pathetic waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... put together the prettiest cast you can find (which, of course, is in direct proportion to the amount of talent you lack) ... join the finest plot you can unearth ... and rape! An abominable piece of crap that the director and / or producer should be ashamed to put his name on. How much worse can the horror genre? And do not use "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many low budget movies ... in fact, some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget. If you do not have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror movie, then, for God's sake, do not do anything !!!
