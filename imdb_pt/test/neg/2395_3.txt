The love and human remains directed by Denys Arcand is an absurdly pathetic film as it is completely different from the kind of films he has done throughout his career. Making a different movie is not an objectionable issue, what is problematic is the fact that if a master's movie is completely out of tune then it is a really bad event. The film begins with a good note, since there is some suspense created. However, as the film progresses, what is shown is just a futile attempt to create something meaningful, since Arcand shows us half a dozen eccentric eccentric characters whose lives are interwoven with each other. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequence here. What is even more uncomfortable is the sense of guilt related to the characters who are most concerned with their feelings with each other and with sexuality. This movie would be of interest to some who wish to see a film different from Denys Arcand. all, surely there would not be many buyers for this movie.
