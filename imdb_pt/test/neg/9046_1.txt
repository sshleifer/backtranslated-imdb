This movie contains real animals that were killed, like a monkey that was eaten by a snake and a crocible was cut. I find it utterly crazed and sick, and I seriously question the director's mental health. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid and stupid that it has no logic. <br /> There are a lot of breasts and sex in this movie, still do not bother to see this rubbish for this, if you want to see breasts and sex, watch a porn movie instead. There are also rape scenes in this movie, which I found disgusting, like women being raped, sliced ​​and eaten. This movie is for sadists and for those who enjoy themselves, seeing people being cut and eaten. <br /> <br /> Many of the animals, like the monkey that appeared in this movie, there are none in the jungles of New Guinea. The local characters, most of them seemed to be Asian and none seem to come from New Guinea. It looks like this movie was made around a resort, which I bet it was. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this junk, sick and insane.
