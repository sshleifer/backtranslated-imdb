I was eager to see Bruce Willis in this, especially since I remember being mesmerized by the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how filmmakers can have a very good story and dull it until it's just another hype-filled formula from the legendary US / Army law enforcement system VS, (the Russians ... do not regret that the cold war is over, do it with the Russians) AGAINST THE TERRORISTS, similar to probably 50 other films. <br /> <br /> In addition, treats the public like a bunch of idiots. The choice of weapon is well, purely and simply ridiculous, do you seriously expect us to believe that the most feared and experienced assassin / terrorist in the world would choose this for murder? <br /> <br /> The main point of the original story was the dual tense of intellects between the common detective who takes responsibility and the professional who devises a relentless but elegant plan to reach his target and then escape. None of this survived. All we have is the tired old US Army of the CIA / FBI against the evil terrorist plan, we've all seen it a thousand times before. <br /> <br /> But of course the MBA of the film company realized that a new intellectual angle here would lose the small class's attention, so the answer is ...... Bruce Willis, big bangs and a crippled plot. They assume that the American public will not be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesman (where France is on the map, after all), so he's an American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a movie corrupted by the board.
