For this movie, based on a TV show and a serious ending. I thought it was a bad way to end a serious. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, goodbye and Amen' was very good, but not this one. Unless you really love the series (Like me) skip this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a faithful fan of the show. Even Stevens, but the plot was very enigmatic, and Dave Coulier, man, that guy has not. I did not do anything good ... well, never. They should not have used Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pure cheese. I would give it a 4.5 / 10
