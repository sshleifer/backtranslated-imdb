Hey all, I just wanted to give you all some crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Make-up FX artists who helped create the "beast" for this movie and I have to tell you that the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we took the first pictures of the set, we were all talking about how it was a shame that this creature was in a movie that would probably be very bad. <br /> <br /> What really happened was that Jason Palmer did the original make-up for Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to come back and re-shoot the bulk of the creature. The sad part was that Jason passed away a few weeks before that and then the re-created creature was not as close as the original. <br /> <br /> For me, it was very sad because that was the end of Jasons. film, and he kind of was fooled out of his final fame due to bad re-filming. Anyway, I thought you guys might find it a bit interesting, and if you want, you can go to mmmyeah.com and check out some "backstage" photos. <br /> <br /> Later, Jeff
