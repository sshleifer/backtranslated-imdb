I must give Billy Dee credit for trying to do this. Knowing that this was a blaxploitation movie, I started my DVD with some expectation. I knew it would be low-budget ... sub-par performance ... but I hoped some stones would be sprinkled all over. If there were diamonds or gems sprinkled inside this film, they were successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or perhaps exaggerating. As an actor and filmmaker, I often cringed when potent poignant moments were ruined with atrocious performances. However, I must admit, I could not look away. I do not know if this was like a car crash that you can not look away, or some mysterious power in the movie that kept me there. This movie is a good argument for a great story that was told wrong. If Walter Kronkite told the "aristocrats" joke, it would be a total failure, although the joke itself is hilarious. Let Dave Chappelle count, and we're all rolling on the floor laughing. This movie needed a "Chapelle". Now, with that being said, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar that I did, do so. Well worth the money. Maybe I'll get another dollar, buy the rights to that movie and redo it. Who knows ... may not be better, but certainly can not be worse.
