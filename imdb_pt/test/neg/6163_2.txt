An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes an artist and then discovers and returns to the United States so he can fix things with his old friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that people who are evaluating this movie are so well all X Files fans, even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it. Make no mistake, this movie explodes pieces. <br /> <br /> The story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you get an explanation, it does not fit the previous story. What it does is annoy you. For all the acting talent in the film, this is not interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when the sex addict Duchovny was going to hit someone. Maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; they should have filmed it instead. What appears is a story of an obsessed artist worrying about little incidents in their life and wanting to hit them in some way - even if they did not seem wrong to begin with. There is no particularly interesting or shocking revelation, despite the mention of a great secret in the first few minutes. It's just a guy who thinks his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. It is not. <br /> <br /> I saw in the trivia that Duchovny claims he wrote the screenplay in a week, this is totally believable. The guy can act, no doubt, but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood keeps the green light, these stories of self-discovery are beyond me. I find myself in the shower every morning, but I do not bother to make a movie about it. My probably would be better than this, though; at least there would be some nudity.
