When I decided to watch a movie about cryogenic zombies, I did not expect much. That's exactly what I have, let alone. In addition to a shortage of special effects (squibs?) And a serious lack of any acting talent, "The Chilling" also boasts the worst screenplay I've ever seen in a movie. I had to stop the tape several times during the first 45 minutes in order to repair the damage done to my intellect by witnessing such an atrocious dialogue as is found here. <br /> <br /> In addition, the collection of characters is so Formula and one-dimensional is ridiculous: the corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know that she is his "assistant" because he repeatedly refers to her by that title); the newly-widowed businessman with a heart of gold who develops a romantic interest in Blair's character; his criminal son; the alcoholic boyfriend, abusive, unemployed personage of the personage of Blair, to whom we are presented in the most artificial use of a flashback; and, of course, the rough, hard, and bearded security guard who becomes the hero. Apparently, the preservation fluid that some cryogenic labs use in their bodies is highly conductive, resulting naturally in disaster when all the laboratory containers end in an incredible sequence of events during a lightening storm ( on Halloween night, not less). As for the zombies themselves, if you like to see people wearing green latex masks walking in aluminum clothing, then "The Chilling" is the movie for you. The zombie action is very weak at its best; The main killing method of zombies seems to be grabbing people by the shoulders and shaking them to death. Businessman and security do most of the fighting zombies, including a highly suspense scene of freezing the undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you, the scene of the steel mill in "T2" has nothing in "The Chilling" in portraying an enemy getting frozen in their tracks as well. <br /> <br /> How Linda Blair got stuck in the middle of this barrel is indeed a mystery. It's true that her career did not exactly shoot during the 80's (unfortunately), but this movie is a shame to her. The script does not even have the decency to put it to good use. The most your character is allowed to do is shout things like "Here they go," "Do something," "Hurry!". The only thing I can imagine is that poor Linda was compensated for her work on this film in food rations. The hero is played by Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this photo, he faces stiff competition from his beard and dog's safety performance, and he does his best to outdo the two. The only scary part of "The Chilling" is the introduction that brings up the factual elements of the cryogenics and suggests that "the movie you are about to see could happen in your own community." As I was counting the number of times some of the names are repeated in the final credits, I was shocked to see Lucasfilm credited. Fortunately, it was only for the sound production of the film. 1/10
