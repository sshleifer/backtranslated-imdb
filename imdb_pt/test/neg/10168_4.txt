Two years after this movie was made, "The Juror" came out. Do not waste your time on this. See "The Juror" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury" with better acting, better direction and a much more exciting aura about it. William Hurt was not credible as a policeman who was gone, and Armand Assante could not be more different from a mob boss if they had dressed him as a clown. You did not get involved enough with Joann Whalley's character to be upset about what was happening to her. Also, the way she interacted with the jury was not convincing or interesting at all. The role of Kathleen Quinlan as a prostitute / murderer was not enough and, frankly, was unnecessary for the plot.
