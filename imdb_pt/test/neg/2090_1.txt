Last week on Friday, I went to see "Snakes on a Plane" with my friends. It was amazing compared to this horrible movie (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). Basically, a woman has a Mayan curse where she vomits harmless and harmless snakes who, instead of attacking, crawl inside their victims. The girl with the bag of coke is very hot. On the title screen, say "100 Passengers ... 3,000 Venemous Vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Just a couple of junkies and some other losers. It's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the entire train and be sucked into a huge vortex. It's just sad that someone goes so far as to make a fucking movie, just to make a few dollars because of the "Snakes on a Plane" craze.
