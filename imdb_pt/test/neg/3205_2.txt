This is a shame for the name of all the laughable Critters saga. Why do writers feel the need to make the film unbearable to observe by all quality standards? The Critters are cute and adorable as ever, but deadly behavior has been turned into a killer baby. They are not as terrifying, horrifying, or witty and funny as they were portrayed in the previous films. I used to love his hedgehog shots, but now it's hidden as if it were thought to be repetitive and boring. And what is with the killing and not eating. I thought this movie would have been cool, but everything was so wrong. Why does Ug have to be bad and killed by what is known as Charlie? This movie makes me sick. Disgrace! Disgrace! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
