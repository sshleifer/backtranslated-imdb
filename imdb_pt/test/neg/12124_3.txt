I have to say that this is better than most SyFy tours, but that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game that is made from the bones and skin of a dead witch of the Spanish Inquisition (and no one expects the Spanish Inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted midway when the friend who went to the beer race is killed in a way that the game pre-empted. <br /> <br /> What follows is a series of typical deaths from a movie like this, or any of the Final Destination movies. He has the jigsaw puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring his family back ... but on the other hand, it's just a mess.
