According to the article at http://blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one of the actors in the movie, Carina Lau, was forced to appear in this movie for free. She was the victim of an infamous hijacking just before this movie was made, and later her endangered pictures were published in a magazine, which has since been forced to close and her publisher was sent to jail. The actress denies having been attacked, but there was a film leaked into the network that allegedly showed she was raped by gangs. (The Hong Kong press, out of respect for her, declined primarily to report on the incident, but Google will submit some articles on it.)
