"It's as if this city has the power to suck your brain out of your head." -Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenager, bored with her little common town. Bored until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues as to the whereabouts of the poor lady. Now, with the help of your precious cat `D.C. 'and an inept FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) she must find her. <br /> <br /> That damn cat is a bad movie. He is quite foolish and has humor that often falls a lot. There are, however, some talent buttons. Doug E. Doug was good at Cool Runnings. His performance as 'Senga' was very funny. Here he is wasted as the FBI agent. He has a good scene when he imitates the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. Your character must be the most understanding father who ever lived. This poor bastard has his expensive cigar crushed, is arrested for picking up his own cat, and is pissed off with his wife and still does not get mad at his daughter for causing all her problems. I wanted my father to be like this. The only good performance is that of Christina Ricci. She entertains as the always annoyed Patti, but her very bad occasional dialogue pulls her performance down. You can also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old lady of Wings and Cliff from Cheers, in this movie. This is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. Even the cat is not very good ... I really can not recommend 1997's That Darn Cat. Some small children (under 8 years old) may like it a bit, but anyone else should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I suggest the Addams Family Values, the opposite of sex or Sleepy Hollow. If a fun family movie is what you are looking for, try Snow Day. <br /> <br />
