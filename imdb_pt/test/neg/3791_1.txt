Horrible writing, driving and acting! The writer / director portrayed the southerners, especially the southern police, as ignorant, backward, homophobic and racist (a very popular yet ignorant stereotype that the film industry loves to perpetuate). Overacting and writing came as amateurs and low-budget. The plot is the same old Hollywood story about the racist homophobic villagers who are defeated by the enlightened people of "Newwww Yoke Ceety." <br /> <br /> I was raised in the small town of Louisiana. where this film was filmed and eager to see the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the film. The beginning of the movie portrays a gay bar located in the "swamps" of Louisiana. How ridiculous is a concept! There are many gay and gay bars in southern Louisiana, but there are no gay bars in Louisiana's "swamps" or small towns. Then we are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst slurred speech of the south and exaggerated performance of all time. Then there's the scene where local police are watching porn on duty at the police station. I could go on talking about horrible tacky acting or old stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> This director and his staff were welcomed into this friendly little town and showed true southern hospitality. The inhabitants of the city of Lake Arthur and the state of Louisiana would only be insulted and degraded in the final edition. The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and in love with "Hollywood" being in town unaware that in the end they would be portrayed as ignorant, racist and homophobic bumpkins in a low-budget amateur movie that went straight to the DVD. My advice: skip this or watch Cinemax late at night if it does its spin.
