This is nothing at all like the WWF and WWF's 'Attitude Era'. I've always been a dedicated fan of WWF and never got a glimpse of their competition. Now, I'm sorry the day I wanted the WWF to take over. At the very least, WCW would try something new and radical all the time, instead of keeping itself as a mask of the program's real intentions and this holds true for ECW as well. The WWF has always been about Hulk Hogan, Andre The Giant, and other old fighters like this and 'Attitude Era' have only been able to keep up with the radical ideas of the competition. WWE is the same garbage that was before the Age of Attitude, just dumbfounded and demoralized. The wrestlers are terrible, the division of the brand is mentally confused, and the lines and stipulations of the history are nonexistent. WWE is so bad it stops being a shell of itself, pushing characters and fighters into the main event suddenly and holding back barriers of creativity. Of course, the program shakes the brains of sweet, innocent, easy-brainwashing kids, and the thin, crappy, outlandish, stupid people in the Internet Wrestling Community who really think the company is good. Anyone who shudders and rests on the thought that this show and product is good can go straight to hell.
