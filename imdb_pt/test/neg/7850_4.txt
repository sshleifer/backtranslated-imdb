The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film that Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson co-starred in MGM. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and Happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra courted and lost Grayson. I think the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> For romance maybe, but definitely not for the screen picture. Sinatra in his forties films once again plays the good schnook only this time in bullfighter's pants. Poaching in the territory of Tyrone Power, exposed in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who owned the hotel during the day and The Kissing Bandit during the night. He left and left California to study and came back ready to take the place of Dad, but only in the hotel business. And where does he learn the business of the hotel in Boston? <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Dad's former gang members, a little old and potbellied led by J. Carrol Naish, want him to lead the gang again. But Frank just is not prepared for life outside the law. But he makes a good impression on the governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Someone must have gotten Sinatra at MGM to put it on this after the bad reviews he got on Miracle of the Bells. Frank is in a better position for the Red Skelton. But as this was a musical, I think MGM's brain confidence imagined that Kathryn Grayson had to have a singing co-star. <br /> <br /> In fact, the best number in the movie is for her, Love Is Where You Find. Also Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse do a dance specialty that is cool. Frank's songs are good, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In recent years, Sinatra would have shuddered to mention The Kissing Bandit and for good reason.
