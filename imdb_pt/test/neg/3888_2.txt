I was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because I hated it. I stretched to the end, but it was painful - especially having to hear that child's voice. As Socact-1 noted, even if the girl claimed to be from Chicago, she did not have Chicago accents - it was more like she was trying to imitate an NY accent - but she also failed at that. I was so confused that I was waiting for the joke. Of all the wonderful actors who could have interpreted this child, why did they choose this one? And why force her to talk like that? It was not even the accent, it was the script, the monologue created for her. The reason I selected this movie myself was that the plot idea attracted me - this era in history, the kind of characters who are poor and uneducated, the setting - and the love triangle. As far as I'm concerned, it could and should have been much better. I was so relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way I did about this movie.
