Man, man, this was a piece of dog. I read a few comments here after seeing the case in the local video store, and thought to myself ........ Ah this looks like a half decent movie.Vampiros.Swords. Thailand.How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, you can not go wrong. Jesus, if I could pluck out my eyes and not remember this movie, I would be happy. The lead actor had the gayest and most intelligent voice of all time. Man! It was really bad .... "Amandaaaaaaaa ....", "I have to save my girlfriend ..." F * ck off! My friend and I really changed the audio track from DVD to Portuguese just so we did not have to hear the guy's voice. Captions and everything ... and that improved the movie. I'm serious, if you look like me and wondered what this movie was like ... STOP WONDERING. I have the answer. THE WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! No good deed, no good blood, and only the slightest knowledge of nudity. Just plain shit for 90 minutes. Do not rent, buy, think or watch at 3:00 in the morning. Just do not cut the cake ...... at all .... anyway. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You'd have a better time. I'm sure.
