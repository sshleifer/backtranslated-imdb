The cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value, even on so bad your front of entertainment. A friend of mine took the tape from a basket of St. Vincent DePaul clothes. Okay, that may be a bit dishonest, but it was to be a dump, not a low-grade old junk, something that the less fortunate members of our society really do not need to improve their lives. It can be considered a mercy. Watching a movie like Cyclone would only increase your problems. Either way, the basic premise of a woman with a super-powerful motorcycle that armed her teeth with rockets and lasers is not properly exploited. The two high-speed pursuit sequences involve vehicles traveling at speeds of less than 40 mph and a super-fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by an old truck is not so inspiring when you get to it. There is only one scene where bikes are used guns at the climax of the movie, and it is ridiculously ineffective, or just laughable when it is. This includes laser beams that seem to be coming out of the hands of a wicked wizard on a sword and eighty-form witchcraft that produced great outbursts of flames that seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly. The rest of the film is just tedious hard to watch filler. Many bad actors, yes, even Combs and Landau suck it up, most of which seems to have been taken from the porn scene by exchanging a really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to continue the badly coherent plot. There are some badly staged stunts and some comical relief scenes that are extremely bland with some cops and the owner of the motorcycle shop. Comedy of the old sub Benny Hill horny old man can not stop looking at the variety of female breast leads. Basically the 'money' scenes involving the bike actually doing things are few and thighs and the rest is clumsy stuff. Skip this.
