I readily admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I can think of that are as bad as when women had tails. It's a stench of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think hitting someone's head is funny, you might find a chuckle or two. The guys in this movie make the Three Stooges look like high-quality art. And there's just not enough storyline to keep it together. It seems to drag on and so on. <br /> <br /> Well, you may be wondering, "If it's as bad as you say, why did not you rate it below 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First, the film is not without its curiosity value. I find a little interest in an Italian spoof of films like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I will give When Women Had Tails a point for its historical "value." The other two points are for the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? It's the best I can do.
