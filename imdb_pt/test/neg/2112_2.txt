How on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? This is one of the most stylish pieces of junk I've seen in a long time. Not only is it poorly written, it is a poor quality steering and editing product. Cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage is confused with belief. The real ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are all good to start with, but where the production / direction team takes them is a large pit of dirt, which is seen in one episode. And this is a scientific series? I'm a doctor and all I can say is that the science in this movie sucks, almost embarrassing to watch. I really felt bad for the actors involved, since they were all extraordinary.
