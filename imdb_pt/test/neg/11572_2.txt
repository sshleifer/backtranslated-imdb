The imagination must have slipped Jim Wynorski's mind when he wrote the script for this one. I do not care when the animal scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat lines from other movies are going too far. I enjoyed seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert being eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie besides her breasts (feelings of my husbands). Jerri Manthey should stay on the island for survival, her acting is harsh, unbelievable and she is just a simple bastard. I liked the scene in which the snake leaves the ocean eats the face so the added flavor destroys the dirty. At least we know that the next giant snake man komodo kodo before becoming a father of a nest egg. Jerri would be great as her mother charges. sit down with a pact of 6 or a pair of joints. will relieve the pain.
