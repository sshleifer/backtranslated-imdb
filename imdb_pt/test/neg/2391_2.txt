How is it better to describe it than criminals on television? And I do not want to say in the COPS show; here they are really being introduced as protagonists. <br /> <br /> I do not see any corrective value in this program unless you have a perverse propensity for human tragedies. Whitney Houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star that Bobby Brown helped pull from the sky. Bobby Brown is nothing more than a lowlife criminal. Why watch it? Why is Whitney at his side, no matter how despicable he is? This couple should be arrested and it is a shame shame that they are making money and getting a little bit of fame to watch the septic tank that is their lives and the human waste that is their character.
