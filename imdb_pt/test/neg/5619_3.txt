With this film being directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino doing the script, I was sure this would be a joke. I was wrong. I do not hate this movie, but no way I like it. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his incredible leadership in the rules of attraction and his scripts for pulp fiction and silent hill but he made a mistake doing it. I really need to comment on Tarantino, we all know he's a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie is just around a gang robbing a bank, but can not because of silly people participating in the robbery <br /> <I am disappointed with Tarantino and Avery for making this movie, but not drives me crazy for how wonderful they are. everyone makes mistakes ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
