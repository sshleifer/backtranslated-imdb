Times I look back to high school and it surprises me that I've never been shorter than Marvin did in this bad movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character that bad luck only gets worse and worse. Despite his intelligence, he manages to be bullied, exploited, supports his lousy father, and much more goof-ups, including a bold assault that, let's say, does not fully go to plan. Of course the viewer does not feel empathy for anyone in this film, so all this disastrous darkness is reflected as harmless zeta rays. Recommended for those days when you're feeling down, open this movie and you'll smile and say, "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
