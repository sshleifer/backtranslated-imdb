This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still trying to get over how bad it was. Just because it has Godard's name attached to it, it's not great. Apart from the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, we see an absurdly long scene of a traffic jam that is not impressive, unbelievable or anything of the sort. While this long intake of bottling is happening, you will probably feel more like making a pastrami sandwich than continuing to watch. Pieces of a supposed story, idiot and idiotic characters. What message should we draw from this? It offers nothing and is of no use. The director's arrogance to show these insignificant and monotonous Frenchmen to smoke cigarettes and have them sit and talk for hours, and then make this happen, since the art is really amazing.
