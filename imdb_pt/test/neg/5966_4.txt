I really liked this movie. Number 5, the movie's star robot is struck by lightning and something has happened to its circuits. He acts and thinks more like a human. The robot repeats the commercials he learns after watching TV. He then applies these statements to his circumstances. The number 5 is fast and fun. The character imitates voices of stars, tries to dance like John Travolta in Staying Alive and many other things. He has a saying for most of his circumstances that he has memorized. Robots' actions are really good. The number 5 wants to steer, cook and please Stefany with all the characteristics of a human being. The way robots move and line up is really hysterical. I'm disappointed that the writers failed to keep this clean for all viewers. This movie has an amazing ending that you would not expect. I hate movies that swear at them even though I like them I give them a low rating. This movie had swearing. Jesus Christ was used as a profanity that offends me, is used at least 3 times. D'us D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been a wonderful movie with all this offensive language. There is no sex in this movie, some violence like robots exploding cars and machines.
