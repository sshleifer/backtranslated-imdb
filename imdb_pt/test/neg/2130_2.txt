This inexpensive film of exploitation is a genuinely tasteless matter, courtesy of the land director of Spaghetti, Lambert Bava, who wisely left his name out of that garbage. <br /> <br /> The basic core of this exit concerns the discovery of some brutally mutilated individuals being washed ashore in the Caribbean. Initially, authorities believe they are victims of shark attacks, but as the investigation unfolds, it turns out to be much more sinister. <br /> <br /> All this ends up being very little, however, we have here - poor dubbing complemented by a similarly weak script, which usually consists of nonsense gibberish, and actually is of little importance most of the time . Performance can only be described as sub-par, which is even for the course in this instance. Truly loose direction also does not help things. <br /> <br /> Special effect is mainly for numerous close-ups of various bloody bodies that lack limbs, and so on. Of course, there is the obligatory creature that periodically emerges at feeding time, which looks like something of great monster octopus, where its animation consists only of its pointed teeth ascending and descending in rhythmic articulation. Overall, the end result is not overly convincing, for sure, but in fact, it's almost fun in a tacky way. <br /> <br /> It seems the filmmakers were interested in some kind of low-income hybrid. Jaws and Piranha, but the end product is just a bloody mess, much like the corpses shown ceaselessly across the image. I find it difficult to think of any redeeming attributes that would justify this, moreover, strictly for incurable monsters.
