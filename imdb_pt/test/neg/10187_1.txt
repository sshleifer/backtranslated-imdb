This is the worst movie I've ever seen. 85 minutes of extremely bad acting, (half the cast seems to be suffering from Asperger's syndrome), strange wigs, strange makeup (including tide lines around the wig areas) and more holy than the most sacred characters than the dialogue which makes you vomit. A comical aspect of this movie, if you have the patience to watch it, is the large number of costume changes that the unfortunate cast presents from scene to scene - this movie was backed by a manufacturer of catalogs of dishonest pastel casual clothes? Have the cast paid for their efforts? They certainly do not deserve to pay with anything else! This terrifying endeavor of a film offers a disorderly plot in the first half, merging into an equally confusing Christian confession arc in the second. All cast and crew must be burned at the stake or at least crucified!
