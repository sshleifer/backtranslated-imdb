Sex is a remarkable aspect of existence. It is perhaps the most interesting activity that exists between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In fact, worse than being simply boring, seeing 40-year-old nudity is, well, unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I think there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes, that is no longer interesting. Maybe if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more visually engaging. <br /> <br /> THE LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth it.
