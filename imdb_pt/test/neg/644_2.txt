Some Attractive Spoilers Ahead. <br /> <br /> The so-called renaissance of the Nashville Network as "The First Network for Men" is a complete disappointment, as is its adult cartoon block. The new Ren and Stimpy were simply awful, "Gary the Rat" mediocre at best, and "Stripperella" quite unwatchable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if "Ren and Stimpy" suffered from gross exaggeration, "Stripperella" had no decent shock joke, funny jokes, clever jokes, or jokes, period. The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum-superheroine, saves "The City" from a variety of goofy supervillains. This caricature looks like a tribute to parodies of crazy superhero superheroes like "The Black Wing Duck" and "The Tick", but without the wit and good writing of those cartoons - or even a good storyboard. "Agent 0069" tries to hesitate between being goofy and sexy, but she is none, and the failure of this drawing in doing it one or the other brings this series down. <br /> <br /> Watch your recorded episodes of "The Tick" and see how it is a superhero parody cartoon.
