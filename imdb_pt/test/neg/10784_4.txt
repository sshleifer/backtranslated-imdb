Western-style feminism's directions on the various subcultures of India so far have remained virtually non-existent, the two entities belonging to alien realms and threatening (in the name of tradition) never to coincide. Art imitates life (or so the saying goes) and Hindu popular cinema is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny that, unfortunately, forms the basis of much of Indian collective culture. But why? What is it about the female gender that has made it so hateful to culture that women are routinely subjected to the most unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, infanticide, imposed illiteracy, infidelity and the subjugation of the spirit that passes under the name of 'dowry '? Rajkumar Santoshi's latest offer, "Lajja," asks the same complaining question, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes that compose the journey of shame suffered by its protagonist, Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). /> Direction in Santoshi part is not up to the level that history demands. He fails to achieve the necessary sensibility in describing the saga of sadness and confronts the question of misogyny aside, rather than going head-on. Santoshi said recently that he did not make the film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Regrettably, audacity shows, and the film often plunges into the genre of action and blood that Santoshi has specialized in. The film suffers with its jerky and episodic rhythm and its ending is somewhat artificial. <br /> <br /> The female cast receives much nicer and more rounded features than its male counterparts. The protagonist is touched with sensitivity by the beautiful and luminous Manisha Koirala, who proves in Lajja that she is one of the most competent female leaders of our time, and that she has received a proper role and configuration, comes up with a really praiseworthy performance. No wonder she shone brilliantly if the film had been made by a director with proper creative intent and appreciation of the subject matter. Mahima Choudhary performs laudably and continues to show that she is an untapped talent. Broadcast as Janki, Madhuri Dixit presents himself with a fervor and happiness never before seen by what really deserves the name of "acting". The role of an intelligent street performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of a newborn represents the greatest risk in her cannon of music and dance roles that have kept her status prominent over the past decade. Which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this supposed feminist saga, that of the incessantly talented Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film, there can be no doubt about it, but it is Rekha who dominates the process in a performance that digs into her bones and sends echoes of terror through the portals of her heart. Rekha shines like Ramdulari, leaving aside the vanity and complacency to deliver a performance so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of that part of the movie. Comparisons are truly odious, especially when presented in opposition to one of the greatest female leaders in the world, but in the graceful presence of this reigning screen legend, the others disappear in their shadow. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" has none of the sophistication. proto-feminist dramas such as "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar", or even the celebration of the Queen of Hell "Laadla": she fulfills her feminist goals in two initial moments: the loud voice in which Mahima reprimands her in-laws for her abuse of his father who committed no other crime than the birth of a girl. It erupts, leaving the wedding procession in tatters. Seeing her father devastated, she begins to cry, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She regrets, "Why did I say anything? I ruined everything! It's all my fault!" Her grandmother, quietly witnessing the abuse she has endured, comforts her saying, "Why are you crying?" There is no reason for you to be crying, you are not guilty of anything. came before you, because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you said today, there would be no need for you to say anything today. " In this scene, the importance of Feminist Legacy is clearly seen through words. The other, more subtle moment comes very early in the film, when Vaidehi (Manisha) fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents' house in India. To the viewers of Western societies, it may seem perfectly reasonable (indeed natural) that any abused woman would seek the protective custody of her parents; This, however, is a taboo of society in many Eastern cultures, India among them. Once a woman is married, the identity she assumes is that of her husband and her personal property (family, business, children, etc.). Turning her back on those responsibilities is a serious social sin, which she does not really have equivalent for Western women. Thereafter it is seen as contaminated and as "damaged goods," whose value has been wholly nullified by its own actions and by its refusal to submit to the role given to it. She is not so much a person as an emblem of family honor. Her father rebukes her for her actions, worried that her family honor would be irreparably tarnished by the daughter he had already transferred to another man. His main concern is the impending marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a far less likely prospect with an older daughter divorced in the same household. He tells her, no doubt, that she must return to the man to whom she belongs legally, however violent and sadistic he may be. He imposes against it the ancient adage that "the honor of every home is in the hands of his daughter." Silent and pensive, she replies, "Yes, the honor of every home is in the hands of her daughter, but there is no honor for her own daughter."
