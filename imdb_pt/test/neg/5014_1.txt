This movie was a waste of my money. it was disgusting and disturbing. Honestly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Who thinks of a movie where a girl blows her dog? Seriously ... it was a waste of my time. I kept watching the movie, hoping it would get better and a plot would come up, but that never happened. I would rate the film as F-. This movie should have been rated R for its disturbing nature. I would never let kids of any age see this movie. This movie sucks. This movie is horrible. This movie was a waste of my time. I could have spent the night doing something that was worth my time instead of renting this movie. this movie was a waste of gas money to get to the store and definitely a waste of two dollars to watch. basically, no one should watch this movie. this movie must be banned and burned.
