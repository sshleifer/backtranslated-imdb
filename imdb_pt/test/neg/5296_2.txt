I really wanted to like this movie. The previews seemed a little funny, but I realized that they put most of the funny stuff in the previews. In this case, they not only did it, but twisted the clips so that they looked a lot funnier than in the actual movie. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric, the Artist, etc, so I wanted to like this movie but it never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty and did not particularly care about it. Too slow and bland for me. This movie certainly is not better and, if anything, it is worse. There were plenty of opportunities for some good comedic moments, but none of them. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, but even John Travolta seemed weak. Cedric was fine, but he reigned too much to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and Rock were very good and ready to be funny, but they just let everything go. I wish they had a chance to go on with the funny things they set up, but instead they kept coming back to the same thing and just going back to putting Vaughn and Rock to be funny (though they were never allowed to actually deliver that) Punchline or comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was a very disappointing movie and I'm glad I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than the theater.
