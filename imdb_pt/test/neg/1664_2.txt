Linda Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) are enjoying a romantic date when they walk into their father Charles Inslee; furious, he chases Mr. Solter out of the house. Undaunted, he goes to her balcony and begs her to run away. Arvidson is nice and will pack. Then the thief George Gebhardt arrives to steal the place. Although he does not have much in terms of estate, Gebhardt thief manages to use the Arvidson trunk to escape the police? A polite comedy. Note, during the balcony scene, Solter goes off the camera, so the assailant Gebhardt can enter the house undetected. And Arvidson travels very lightly, for there seems to be nothing in his heavy trunk; maybe she just wanted to get a tan on boyfriend Solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are illustrious extras. An Awkward Eloquence (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson and Harry Solter
