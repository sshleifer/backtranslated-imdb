At least it's with this episode. Here we have a time traveler, the teacher of Gilligan's Island, no less, coming back in the time of 1865. What you do - why try to save Lincoln of course! There are no really interesting variations on this old theme. As another reviewer put it, this episode is particularly monotonous and unattractive, with little to suggest that "the teacher" really is back to the 1860s. Budgetary limitations are readily apparent, and the direction is impassive. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark, but remains a very flat production. Many times we feel like we are in scenarios, hoping something clever will happen. There is a slight twist in the end, but I emphasize minor.
