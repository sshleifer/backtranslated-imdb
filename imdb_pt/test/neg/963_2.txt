DANGER: Beware of falling spoilers ... Boy, this was a bad movie. I know they were going for a "true love conquers all" sort of thing but over all this conquered movie was about 3 (which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon that I will never go back. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta, who live in a remote city in a fantasy world. Kai is the very abused messenger at a Gerta's father hotel. At first, Gerta ignores Kai's advances, but she ends up warming to him with disgust (you guessed it!) Gerta's father. As if that obstacle were not enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a piece of glass into Kai's eye and he becomes an evil person who treats Gerta badly. Kai is eventually taken to the fortress of the Snow Queen (which is the same as the ice-covered hotel because the good people of Hallmark like to do everything) and Gerta part on a mission to retrieve Kai. Along the way, she encounters the other three seasons that are evil in their own way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she encounters along the way. (All the time you'll want to turn it off, but you can not force yourself to do it. It's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen) Anyway, I'll spare you the end because Anything you can Think of your head now is probably better than how they ended. So in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly annoying movie that takes the fan out of fantasy.
