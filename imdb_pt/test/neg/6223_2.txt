Everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me get right to the point. <br /> <br /> Forced frivolity. Multiple artists working hard to have fun so you can have fun. The brilliant Meryl Streep gives a great chance. Pierce Brosnan simply embarrassed. Inexplicably set on a Greek island. Many women screaming, squealing. Lots. <br /> <br /> It was a silly musical on stage, now it's a big, splash and badly recorded. If you like ABBA, more or less. If not, an attack on the senses and an insult to any intelligence you have when you leave the theater. I readily admit that I did not really want to see this movie and I went with some friends who did, but for God's sake. Why does my genre scream and scream to convey pleasure? Have you ever sat by a table of women who drink too much and who are absolutely determined to have a great night in the city? That's the feel of this whole project. It just felt so good when it stopped.
