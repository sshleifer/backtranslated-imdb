I saw the movie at the premiere of Lawrence, Kansas. This vacillating story about a group of high school students who ended the killing of the competition for the prom queen was awful. He fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. But mostly, it seemed the filmmakers said to themselves, "Hey, I have money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking about it. Painfully most indie films do not make you suffer just with that mentality. They just do not seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie ... or, in this case, even a watchable movie. With this movie I do not feel embarrassed to say that if I did not know a little of the crew, I would have left. That simple.
