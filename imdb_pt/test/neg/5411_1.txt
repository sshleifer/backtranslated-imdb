To be honest, the movie was so HORRIBLE that I loved it. Never in my life have I seen such a terrible movie. I was in shock. I mean, I do not even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even keep their own weapons, in a minute one guy had an M16 and his friend had an MP5, so in the next scene they traded weapons. (Do not ask, trust me, I know my guns) And I'll never understand how they got out of a place that looked like Vietnam, a highway in Arizona, my yard and then a California chemical factory, that's what would you be scared of a guy in a Halloween mask using a garbage bag for a cape and throwing plastic arrows at you? How scary is that? I wanted to swallow arsenic in the middle of the movie. I love how the "skeleton man" randomly decided to go on a kill on that particular day. But hey, whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed a bunch of fire ants. <br /> <br /> Good morning.
