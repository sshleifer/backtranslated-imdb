Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. However, the dog seems to be drowning when Hunnicutt comes in after him. It becomes evident soon that although Hunnicutt and his dog wander after leaving the water they both died in the water - as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. However, strangely, Hunnicutt is very slow in absorption and it takes a while to understand what they are talking about it! I think this was actually done as upholstery, as there really was not enough material to fill the half-hour interval. <br /> <br /> Later, in the "surprise", it comes to the sky - or at least its concept of the place. He's invited, but since they do not allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, reasonably well represented, but of doubtful spiritual value! No twisting or irony, this episode is a bit boring - not "Twilight Zone-y" enough for my liking.
