Director J.S. Cardone presents something a little scary and a little scary, but nothing more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a house in the mountains of Pennsylvania; then she picks up her two daughters and moves to the immense estate in what looks like the middle of nowhere. But it is somewhere, somewhere ninety and a few years ago, a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of countless children who were forced to work in the dark and damp. The area and especially the property Tunny seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny perverse souls. The legend is that screaming children go out in the moonlight to get their revenge; and you better believe it. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Taylor-Compton Scout, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
