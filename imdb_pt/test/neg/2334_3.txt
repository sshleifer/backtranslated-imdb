The more we persist with this belief, the flaw that, once a director produces a great groundbreaking work, all future work "can not be that bad, after all, he did this and that." Mulholland Drive is a case in point, and it is indeed unmitigated rubbish. The performances are excellent, particularly from Watts and Theroux, but a good movie that they do not necessarily do. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making an unnecessarily strange movie only works when it takes the audience by surprise. When the public expects the film to make no sense, the film must have some substance to keep the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the movie, with the murder mystery set with many twists and red herrings, and then ... plop! The story turns into a swamp of bizarre hallucinations and meaningless follow-ups. Methinks Lynch realized how confusing the film was becoming, and threw the lesbian and mastobatory scenes to the audience awake, and to prevent viewers from getting up and leaving. Watching the film in the preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles, who had no idea what was happening, but I left the theater commenting on the "layers and layers" of the cinema. Lynch. Excuse me, but these people are the same idiots standing in art galleries looking at screens that were painted white commenting on the "courage of the artist to paint such a brave job." <br /> <br /> Films like these are made because (a) Lynch is trading in his previous job; and (b) why people are convinced that unintelligible films are art and therefore must be good. I asked some Lynchophiles what they really liked about the movie and the only answer I got was that the kind of "layered" response was that they liked it when the "girls took the kit". <BR> <BR> Nuff said.
