This movie was very disappointing, and except for a few moments it was not flying at all. More than anything else, she was just being an idiot. Was the song crazy and the plot unfolding like a BYU bowling game? very predictable (avoiding embarrassment by scoring, a late game of touchdowns, a rally that is not good and leads to a defeat). In essence, the half-child / half-naive Will (the film seeker) and his religiously confused brother, Danny (let's call him Democrat), treat Kirby (the movie "Sweet Spirit"), the third member of his group. unhappy Mormon "boy band" as trash until the man and father figure the movie (the stage manager, Jill) has a conversation with Will and straightens it out. Probably Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is instantly the mature, self-conscious leader of the band. This would be a cute, maybe funny, 10-minute road show, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end. My advice ?? Take the money you would normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or throw it in the toilet? more entertainment with much less time commitment. If you want to watch a better movie of the same genre, get Saints and Soldiers? not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (in fact, Kirby has more funny stuff in Saints than in SOP).
