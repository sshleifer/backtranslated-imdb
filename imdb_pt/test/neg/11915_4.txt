Vaguely based on the novels of Earl Derr Biggers, the 20th Century Fox Charlie Chan series proved to be a favorite of the public - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the studio feared that the public would turn against its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took the role of the "poverty line" Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven other films made between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox had considered Chan films as cheap "B" films, but the studio nevertheless took considerable care of them: the plots were often silly, but the rhythm was sharp, the witty dialogue and the castles likes Bela Lugosi) and Ray Milland) always a specialist. The result was a lovely charm that stood the test of time. The monogram was a different subject: the Chan movies were simple and simple "B" movies. Little care was taken with screenplays or cast and the resulting films were flat, at best mediocre, practically unwatchable at worst. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a suitable cast and some interesting plotting devices, THE SHANGHAI COBRA is among the best of the Chan films made by Monogram - but even so he can barely achieve consistent mediocrity. In this particular entry, Chan (Sidney Toler) is called to investigate a killer who kills with what appears to be a snake bite; at the same time, it decides to ensure that a government radio supply hidden in a bank vault, from all places, remains secure. Do these two seemingly unrelated lines come together? Well ... it could be! Sidney Toler is always nice as Chan, but most of her monogrammed performances seemed "phoned" - and this is as true of COBRA as it is of any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the really nice artist is Mantan Mooreland. Changing times led us to consider Moreland's comedy as humiliating for African Americans, but he was an expert and comic actor, and taken in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has tremendous charm and innocence. <br /> <br /> Fans of the 20th Century Fox series are likely to find Chan to feel a significant disappointment, and newcomers who like Monogram's movies will probably consider them third-rate after they come across Fox movies Like other Monogram Chan movies, it's best to leave the SHANGHAI COBRA to certain collectors. Four stars, and that's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
