My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples there and we all left at about the same time. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I've ever gone out on. <br /> <br /> It was painful to sit down. <br /> <br /> The theater really stopped us on the way and asked if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> Never did this happen before or since Pleae did not rent this You're really going to regret I'm really right about the vote summary Maybe personal taste has something to do with it
