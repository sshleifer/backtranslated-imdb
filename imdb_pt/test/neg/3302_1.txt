What can be said about a movie that makes two hours look like three weeks? The hero begins in ninjaville, Japan, undergoes an identity crisis (saving a shinobi), makes a trip to America (saving a slave named Sam) engages in a small wild west action (saving a native French / Japanese named Julie ), will hunt for pirate gold and then return to Japan to fight in a war. The film obviously has no idea where it's going at any moment; I think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he watched. If you are going to watch this movie, I suggest renting the subtitle so that you and your colleagues can openly discuss how dumb the movie is without talking about the movie, potentially losing another stupid twist. <br /> <br /> Movies the director was watching during the making of this movie - An American Tail, Fievel Goes West, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kung Fu, Vampire Hunter D, The Ten Commandments. <br /> <br /> Notes of Interest - Most of the inspiring lines of fear of all time. Approximately 90 minutes (or 19 days) in the film, the main character has just beat an American villain, and as one of them heads to the VCR to end the pain the hero proclaims "Let's go back to Japan," and the agony continues for another week.
