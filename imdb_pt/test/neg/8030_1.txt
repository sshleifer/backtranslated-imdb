It's the only movie I almost quit, and it would have if my friends were not in the movies with me. Normally, even if I do not like a movie, I think it's still worth going through it to the end. That way, you can actually claim to have given the chance to redeem yourself. But with The Million Dollar Hotel, it was so terrible that I just wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. I think I probably would not have been so disappointed if this movie had been made by a smaller director, which I normally did not like so much. But coming from Wenders, it was even more shocking to see. I know Bono, from U2, a good friend of Wenders, wrote the script for this abysmal film, and I wonder why Wenders left him, as friend as the two. "Take the day job, Bono," is a phrase that easily comes to mind as you watch this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a miscellany of all possible stereotypes of contemporary cinema, a naive and transparent attempt to appear crazy and daring, with the most annoying characters I've ever set eyes on, especially the protagonists, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson , none of which I do not usually like. The happiest ending I could have wished would be for a nuclear bomb to be thrown into their collective heads, so as to end it as quickly as possible. On a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely hectic U2 soundtrack. But the opening scenes of the film make the rest of the film (which makes a spectacular dive thereafter) even more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that is never delivered, not even close.
