in general, I do not make negative comments here. But since this is a festival piece, I do not want you to waste your time when you can see something else that may not be playing again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were very bad. For example, they did not play against each other, they waited to RECITE their lines, which were pretty bad to start. The dialogue sounded really stressed. Norman, or whatever his name, tried, at least like that, to look witty and scathing on the lines he chose, but he fell far short. <br /> <br /> After the words, he asked if anyone saw the end coming and some people. they were all "yes," and he almost called them liars. Look, there were so many clues, the biggest being a suitcase full of money for a $ 500 prostitute per hour. I want to say that John gave her at least 20g ... say the sign of the tale. Now, no, you could not see exactly what was going to happen, but by the time the turnaround actually occurred, I at least did not even care. I was happy to get out of there. I asked him which sketch he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he'd wait to shoot up to 15.3 because that needed a lot of work. <br /> <br /> But he seemed to be a pretty cool guy, he's making his own films, he'll probably get better and I hope he does, not in an arrogant way, I mean, I wish him good luck . Just remember, this is just my opinion.
