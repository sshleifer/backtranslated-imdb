For most people, RoboCop 3 is the movie that really is the great disgrace of the Robo series. It has few fans, and most people hate it because of the blatant business approach of PG-13. Now, I will not say that RoboCop 3 is good. Frankly, it's too bad. But in addition to being a film filmed and executed properly, it overcomes this circuitous chaos. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequences for a masterpiece. So what if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a superhero-caricature in an ultra-mainstream production for kids to have fun - at least it's doing it overtly. I do not know where RoboCop 2 begins and ends, I do not know what or who it is, I do not understand what's going on, I do not understand which jokes are deliberate and which ones are not, I'll go crazy if I try to understand the characters, I see nothing of value in anything anyone is saying, I do not believe anyone has looked at the film script and imagined it would work and I can not believe that Irvin Kirshner saw the finished result and imagined he liked what he saw. He probably did not do it on purpose, neither Miller, nor Weller nor Allen. It's not hard to see why. <br /> <br /> Now, RoboCop 2 has its fans, I know that. Primarily, they belong to this league of absolute anti-pretenses, dispensing with anyone who expected some depth, or subject of the first film, as academic apprentices of Roger Ebert Sith. It's a lot of fun, a good deed and great entertainment, argues the argument. Yeah, well, I guess if you just do not listen to what any of the characters are saying, you can fool yourself into thinking we can have Arnold in the suit instead of Weller. Do not get me wrong, I like a good action movie, with pure entertainment value, since it's just - more satisfying - virtue. But RoboCop 2, sir, is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> See the first scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he is just a machine, and then enters that operatic speech about how he could never be a man, after Murphy's wife (who is suing OCP for robot chase) comes out of nowhere. this sad moment with him, and you never hear of it again! I would certainly like to go to this movie scene by scene, because each one has that kind of nonsense in them. It's as if a 12-year-old fan had done the script, the characters acted totally randomly and first said that, then they said it. OCP wants to stop the crime with a new robo, especially with this drug called "nuke", but it seems that they really want to become a big capitalist empire and control the whole city? politics is abandoned I think, understandably, given the comic mayor of relief, The villain (played by Tom Noonan, who made a better version of this in Last Action Hero and is saying a lot) is an addict, but is still used for this machine . The woman behind it all has an agenda that is impossible to understand. Speaking of 12-year-olds, this movie has the infamous role of "Hub", this crazy kid who swears and kills people, played by a child actor. I will not be moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psychotic child in your action movie, go ahead. I do not know how much Frank Miller's original vision was put into it, but the credits at least recognize him as one of the creators of "history." And, if I zoom out, I could see that as being a pretty cool character. It's sad, to be sure, to have a maniac killer boy, but again, this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? All this business with the OCP trying to become this giant monopoly on everything, is appropriately dystopian and good as well. Also, the idea of ​​RoboCop getting in touch with his wife and son, incorporating them into the story in some way - would also be great, and as far as I can see a natural and logical step if they had to do a RoboCop sequel. <br /> <br /> But, of course, these are just ideas. As many people have already said, the script is 100% messy. The kid has a scene (the torture scene), where it is suggested that he is just a messy child stereotype, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and all soft and friendly with his can head. Why does not he just pick up his uzi and try to knock him down with his last breath? Is not that what your character would do? Does he give his life a second thought there on his deathbed? Not necessarily, since your last words are "bad", so why? It really does not make sense, and this can be said about everyone, not everything, in this movie. Is there a strike in the police force? Is RoboCop machine or man? What's wrong with turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, of course, it's pretty funny I do not deny it. But why build it and then discard it? And why the hell is Allen so criminally underutilized? And what is this? Weller has an obvious willingness to express himself with his character, and yes, well, the topics are many and the mess is huge. <br /> <br /> This review is as confusing as the movie. The only reason I give an extra star is because of the actors in the first movie, I'm sure they meant well. I mean, it's relatively stable, some kind of anchor in this sea of ​​bad movies.
