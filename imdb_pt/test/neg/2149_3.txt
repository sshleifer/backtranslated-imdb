Hell to Pay was a disappointment. There was nothing around the substance of a B Western movie, and it was by no means to be compared to a fantastic movie like Silverado. The dialogue was monotonous, the plot was numb, the soundtrack was unnecessarily unnecessary, and the acting was horrible. Even the pros could have taken some lessons from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it showed some of the best marksmen in the country but you can see them in a better light on any SASS video. Merging this feature makes it very appealing, and the preview is decent, but it all ends after that.
