Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) talks to Danny Ocean and his team and demands they pay the money they stole from him (at Oceans 11) plus interest. He retracts from the violent action, however, as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the Night Fox. The team then has to make a series of assaults to pay Benedict back while testing his skills against the Night Fox who wants to keep his position as the greatest thief of all time. Simply put, this movie is a complete mess. The masses can argue that it's "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt did great performances, but these are the same people who subscribe to "Hello" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is complicated, it's not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it's just a complete mess that spreads in multiple directions in the hope that the public thinks it's cool and smart. Any respectable movie observer, however, will see the film for the farce it is. While Oceans 11 was not a great movie, it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It's as if the director and the cast were saying to themselves, hey, this is not really working, let's just laugh! In fact, the cast looks like they're having fun, but I was not. I will not delve into the plot, because its confusing evolution does not justify any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely irritating. The scenes in which Julia Roberts poses as her (with Bruce Willis making a special guest appearance), though slightly amused, seem to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The film is so full of shortcuts that as if Arnie had emptied a 9mm Uzi into the movie studio. The credit can only be given to some scenes in which the Night Fox uses Caopeira to carry out an assault against the fall of some funky songs, but this is not justification to watch the film. The final scene shows the team in a senseless drunken stupor; this sums up precisely the film. Keep the original.
