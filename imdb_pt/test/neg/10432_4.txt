I saw this on a DVD screen a few months before it was released. <br /> <br /> I liked the main characters and the general story, but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. The sets were adequate, but some just looked like remains of Freaks & Geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial made in a middle-class house. It's definitely not what the DVD cover says, "destined to be the next stoner classic," hardly. <br /> <br /> Wardrobe and hairstyles are well made and yes there are some very beautiful girls in it, always nice to see a cast look good. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene contained guitars that just kept ringing. The sound design was a bit poor. I think less would have been better.
