Imagine what it must have been for John Agar. One of the best men in Hollywood. Married to Shirley Temple for five years. He sees himself making movies like that. I remember him in "Tarantula," where he was not half bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this movie. The monster is dumb and uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. Teenagers are boring. The plot is stupid. People run around. There are events that do nothing to advance the plot. There is dance that continues and continues, and there is no attack. There's some idiotic love triangle that no one could care less about. It is neither fancy nor scandalous. Worthless. Hagar might very well have been a post. He gave nothing to do.
