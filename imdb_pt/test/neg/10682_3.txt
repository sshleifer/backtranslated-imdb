The film Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title as well as leading role. Now most may not like this movie for the plot and acting was a bit cheap but this is the appeal of a movie like the Razor Blade Smile. In a way, it was supposed to be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> However, if you watch this movie through to the end, you'll see that it was like I said a cheap vampire movie with a little humor. (Also how they manipulated colors in some scenes is very interesting.) So in conclusion, this movie is a type that you rent and laugh with your friends and have fun with what it is. Because no movie is too bad. <br /> <br /> As Lilith Silver says, "Humans just do not smile enough ..."
