What we have here is the Disney standard straight to the DVD sequence, where I would expect the cribs to be cut in all areas, resulting in a well-run animated film that falls well short of the original. This is not to say that this is a terrible movie, it's just that it's a very mediocre movie full of preaching messages designed to show children the virtues of friendship and to be good to each other and unless done subtly (which is not here) can quickly become irritating for adults. The film has a very fine plot with Kronk trying to gain his father's approval, and eventually finding the true meaning of wealth and success. This has its moments of comedy, but it is not enough to carry a whole movie.
