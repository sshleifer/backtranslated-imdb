Playmania is extremely annoying. This is the basis of the show. Honey or Shandi ask extremely easy questions that a 2-year-old could respond to an extremely slow pace. This show lasts 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period. People may like this program because the hosts are cute, but they are completely destroyed because they are so annoying. <br /> <br /> During the show, they mention that we need more players, a million. times. The top 5 pickups they make will probably take about 20 minutes to get out of the show. This show is probably one of the worst gaming programs ever made. One of the reasons why they probably do not have calls is because the program is so cheap with money. Most of the money I've seen was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this "game show" was canceled at the end of 2006.
