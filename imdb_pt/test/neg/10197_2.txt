Calling this "Sunday School" movie can be generous because, even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I would not want to see it in my church. The message is, "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you will not be left behind in the rapture." There was no love. I think when you get there, I do not believe in the god portrayed in this movie. The guy who should have had all the spiritual answers encountered Count Dracula. In addition to the spiritual / religious element, the script was tedious - saying the same thing over and over again. This may have been offsetting part of the performance, which was unable to present a convincing line the first time, so they said the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I liked the final scenes. I thought that made sense without knocking on someone's head or leaning toward a Sunday School formula. The movie was not all bad, just the bulk of it. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of cleaner films that are well made and that present the truth in a nonpregatory way. This was not one of those, I'm sorry to say. I took my family to this movie, wanting to support this kind of movie. Now I would like my money back.
