I like Ali G's show, I believe the guy has comedic instinct but has not yet developed it for a talent. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit worse than I expected. I do not find Ali-G offensive, just stupid. Jokes for children 5 years old, some good, some terrible. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that looks "offensive," but it's really funny, see Tom Green's "Freddy Got Fingered." /> <br /> 2/10
