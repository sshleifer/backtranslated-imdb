Just to save money and time I go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the game and gas would need to burn it. Do not waste your time. In fact, it would be better to forget that you thought about watching it. I've seriously seen better B movies in a language I can not understand. Anyone who has already given permission to do so needs to be sewn. The only positive thing I can say for this film is that with a new script, the director and the right actors, can be a great story. Let me break it; A virgin impregnates a demon while the baby inside her womb wants to feed on people. They try to compensate for the fact that this is possibly the worst film ever made with nonsense curse and nudity. All in all Totally not worth the dollar took me to rent it.
