This is one of those classic B movie after the exploits of 2 hobos. It is actually made of Big Stupid cheese and fleeing from a line like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals all the scenes in which he is as creepazoid Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the multitude of lynchers and the father's voice rising 10 octaves ("Did you love her?"). Danny, the protégé of Big Stupid, is surprisingly stupider, but not as repulsive as our protagonist. There is also a picturesque scene of a guy tormenting the restaurant. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive girl and probably the least boring. And those yellow frills (RAWR!). Oh, and drink is bad according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Watch the cover of the MST and the wonderful homage of Crow Elam!
