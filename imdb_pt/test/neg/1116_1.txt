Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this movie beyond horrible. It was a big disappointment since it was presented as one of the eight Horrorfest movies. I can only hope the other seven are better. I was really embarrassed by the friends that I managed to persuade to see this, and these are the same friends I made watching the remake of The Wicker Man. It has all the clichés in the book. In fact, it was very complicated to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of a young maiden in distress, we have three: the single mother with two daughters ?? a brainless, dismembered teenager and a cute but at the same time frightening girl who you know will have special abilities including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The girl is the same one who was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a bit annoying, but not as irritating as Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> In general, these characters looked like fugitives from a Lifetime movie. I thought maybe the horror films had come out of the scenes where the female characters lie down completely in makeup and run in the dark, announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this one. I also find it inconceivable that neither of them could bother to ensure that the front door was opened arbitrarily day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how I was not involved with these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set, because everyone was wearing their overcoats, even in their homes, and their teeth were white. /> <br /> Despite all stereotypical plotting, the film does not build any suspense except to imagine when it will end. There is more atmosphere in the Giant spot in the middle of the more mundane afternoons Monday through Friday. As for the dialogue, I could have proven quotations from ten other films and mended a better and more convincing speech. The blood level, the eye candy for horror fans, was minimal at best. Without their tiny weapons, the 'zombies' were not threatening. You could probably kick some of them across the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills is its banality. Horror movies, more than any other genre, can not survive mediocrity without inspiration. Give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously exaggerated. I can even get the new ones with their inducing tortures. From time to time I enjoyed a truly scary thing, anything but that.
