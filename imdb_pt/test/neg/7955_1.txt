Pathetic NRI Crap ..... Appeal to all who are not Indians .... This is the WORST of Indian cinema, made by the worst piece of trash NRI ..... The story is boring and clich√© (the way NRIs and the Westerners see India) ... If you want to be bored to death. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the situation of widows in India before independence. Much of this is true even now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent portrayed (perhaps because it is a period film) ..... There are many other Indian films directed by directors extremely talented people that are worth savoring. ..This is a definite lack ... Watch a documentary or research information on the Internet if you are genuinely interested in the plight of the oppressed of India. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time.
