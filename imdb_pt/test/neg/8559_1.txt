I've spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently I found myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real shame because I like these people, I just can not believe ANYONE could do something so bad such that? ! That was crap from every possible angle. From camera work to dialogue, to costume design and production design, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in this movie appeared to have been drawn directly from a pornography that was being filmed in the San Fernando Valley and mounted on a set with an even less talented crew. <br /> <br /> Can not I get over the fact that I'm sitting on some of the best materials I've ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit all the possible locks? However, the people behind this show from a movie have no problem putting it together and, in fact, sleeping well after it is released. <br /> <br /> Life, what a journey!
