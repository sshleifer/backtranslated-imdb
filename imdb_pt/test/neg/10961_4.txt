Well, here we have a zombie movie that may not even be much of a zombie movie. The whole movie is set in the near future infested with zombies, but still the film does very little with this concept. Instead, he focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to take revenge and his money back from a bunch of other bounty hunters. That money is worth, anyway, when almost everyone went to hell and the cities are almost deserted. And why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place? As if people did not continue to kill these menacing dangerous monsters when they are not being paid. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the story of "The Fast and the Undying" is far from fair. Of course, it's also not being filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogues. <br /> <br /> It's still not quite a horrible movie. It certainly is not as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. It's quite beautiful, or rather, the movie at least does not look cheap. Its effects may be a bit overused, but even then they are pretty much as well as the makeup effects as well. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie was not what I expected. Its title may suggest that the film is set in the wild and wild west during the days of the cowboys, but its title is only misleading, no doubt chosen to profit from it. I fell in love with it, hoping this movie was a combination of a zombie-horrified western horror movie. <br /> <br /> For fans of zombie movies, this movie will be a disappointment to watch. Of course it does not add anything new to the genre, but it also does not have enough of the genre itself to be considered a good one to watch. <br /> <br /> Not totally unwatchable, but also far from a recommendable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
