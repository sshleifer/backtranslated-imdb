(Richard Yearbook), Sheldon (Jeffrey Douglas) and Junior (Jason Jones) are about to unplug the electrical from an unused building scheduled for demolition . While researching the relevant cables and materials, they are faced with a set of doors that, according to the buildings, the blue prints should not be there, being nosy and anything that forces them to open their doors to look around and find a full room computers and scientific machinery. While they move on a few buttons, a portal to a parallel universe opens, Dean and Junior accidentally "fall" with Ray & Sheldon soon after in search of their friends. Unfortunately they all ended up in an exact parallel Earth that was taken by a mutant spider thing that either eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with which she uses to protect herself and do what she really wants. In a desperate attempt to survive, they join some of the last remaining humans, including the original inventor of the portal Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who says that with the help of our electricians he can (yes) portal to take them back home ... <br /> <br /> Edited and directed by David Wu I thought the Webs was really bad, it's as simple and straightforward as that. The screenplay by Grenville Case & Robinson Young is absurd, to say the least, and has holes that you can drive a tank, for example, this movie is really trying to suggest that some mutant spiders are not larger than two people. size took over a whole world? How did they do it? If this parallel land were the same as ours, where the hell was the army? The police? All our weapons? Some things fragile spider against literally billions of humans?! The whole faulty concept, stupid and frankly insecure constantly bothered me throughout the movie. We can not forget that there is an interdimensional portal to a parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have remained intact for decades and remain in perfect working order, right? Then there's the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact that an electrician can make it work perfectly by accident as he randomly squeezes a few buttons in a room that probably had 100 scattered by dozens of equipment and the wonderful guy who sets a trap bobby explosive at his base without telling anyone, and if one of his friends had shut him down and found himself in pieces by his companions' homemade bomb? Would not you be very pleased with yourself? It's the food? Do they grow on small plant patches? I could go on all day about how flaws, ill-conceived and poorly written are, but I can not be bothered. The characters are clich√©s and annoying, just like the movie as a whole, which obviously does not help. The only decent thing I can say about networking is that it's short and moves at a fair pace, but when all that said and done is still crap. <br /> <br /> Director Wu has to take a big part of the job. blaming here for starters, the movie looks cheap and the issue that it is credited with is terrible. There are many inappropriate and annoying slow motion scenes that pop up from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical and become incredibly boring very quickly. He uses this highly annoying quickcut technique along with a little bit of the old camera movement, now I do not know about anyone else, but I hate this editing style as it seems like a complete and incoherent mess. In fact, I do not know a single person who likes this sort of thing and I'm confused about why filmmakers think people like it. Forget any blood, just some shotguns for the zombie-spider soldiers and they do not have red blood, so this does not relate to reality in my mind. <br /> <br /> Webs was made for -TV, the American Sci-Fi Channel I think & looks as cheap, low budget and rushed as you'd expect. It's all so bland, forgettable, flat and bland. The special effects are far from special and the spider thing has no imagination when finally revealed. The performance was OK, considering that everything else was so bad and I still can not believe the sweater Grieco wore. <br /> <br /> Webs sucks, I can not say anything good about this other than I've already sat through worse movies and that's the only reason I'm not giving 1 star and a quick look at the IMDb user ratings for Webs confirms what I already knew has more votes '1' than any other and there is very good reason why ...
