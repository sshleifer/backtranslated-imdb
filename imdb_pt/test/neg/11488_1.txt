I'd like to say something different about this movie. I have seen comments about how beautiful Russia is and Russia's views have been great. Hey folks, this is not Russia, it's more specific to Bulgaria's capital Sofia. So this is not Russia, it's my country. About the film - well in Bulgaria, maybe with the exception of the Gray Zone - all American director films are in a horrible word like this, of course. It's a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play such cheap movies. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but really this movie has no twist in history has no energy what can I say - weak and boring movie a clich√© no more. Hey, people remember that it's not Russia, it's actually Bulgaria.
