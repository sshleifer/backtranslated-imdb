Please do not waste your time and money on this turkey stench. <br /> <br /> This is an exaggerated melodramatic love story in the context of New France (also known as Quebec in the eighteenth century). . Or is it a historical saga of New France with an epic romance? I do not know, and at this point I do not care anymore. <br /> <br /> There is a rich story to tell about the intrepid French adventurers, thugs and other miscellaneous characters who settled in Canada and Canada. parts of the USA. Is not it. The characters are total cliches, the story is exaggerated, breathless and devoid of any charm, and in a short time everything the spectator wants to do is get out of the theater, have his head checked and get hold of him. Anger for being taken over by hype. <br /> <br /> This film was the biggest disappointment of my year in terms of film, especially since, as a historian and a French Canadian or Canadian of French descent (or anything else) I am a) a believer in the fact that the history of my people in this country still has to be told as well as it could in the movie b) interested in this subject c) a film lover who thinks cinema these days could do wonders with this grand and tragic story. <br /> <br /> As I said, do not waste your time with this frustrating piece of claptrap.
