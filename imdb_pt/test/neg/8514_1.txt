When a friend and I saw this in the latest releases, we decided to get it despite the fact that none of us had ever heard of it before. We both liked Costas Mandylor and had James Coburn, so we figured it could not be that bad. We were wrong. That was it. It was really so bad. No actor or actress could have made this movie worth it. It was like getting Titanic, The Poseidon Adventure and a nuclear bomb movie and trying to cut and paste it all together. <br /> <br /> I must admit there was some laughter. I laughed when the head of the booth was asking Alan (Costas Mandylor) if he was some "sea pussy." The other laughs in this film had nothing to do with writing. I would love to know how the people who make this movie thought you could have a cruise ship turned upside down and keep it steady. It's not tip or anything. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something to watch Costas Mandylor, James Coburn or any other cast, move on. Find something good they did.
