Ramsay ?? the kings of comedy (or horror, whatever it is) wake up after years of hibernation. And yes, I was scared. No, not because of the element of terror (of course I'm not that fussy), but because the rats danced constantly standing in the khatmal-chaap theater (where else these films are shown). <br /> <br /> the plot. A man is repeatedly stabbed, suffocated to death, stuffed into plastic and thrown into a pool. But he still returns for revenge. Now the movie was a thriller or a horror? This in itself is the suspense for you to discover. And the ending turns out to be another mask mystery. Remember those secret agents trademark Ramsay? men wearing some stupid horror masks. Only here the mask is of a human. I suppose, no further detail is needed to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay tends to be super dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between the soaps of film and TV. A cheap and poorly dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick seems ... (you know what). <br /> <br /> The background score is a direct sequence from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Not a single department of the film, whether technical or creative, is worth commenting on. The novelty lacks both history and execution. <br /> <br /> Dhund certainly fogs your senses.
