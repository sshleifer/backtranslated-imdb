A friend warned me that this was the worst film he had ever seen. I was curious because I had developed some cult status. I like a lot of weird indie cult movies so I gave it a try. I have to agree with my friend. It's a smoking pile of manure. I am sorry people who love this movie, but I can recommend much better things if you want to watch an indie cult movie. Try Dead Alive by Peter Jackson (also known as Braindead), Cemetery Man (also known as Dellamorte Dellamore), or modern vampires.
