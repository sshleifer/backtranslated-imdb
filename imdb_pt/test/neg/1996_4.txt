"Odor-capable Kitty" by Chuck Jones is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world? kind of. There are some fundamental differences between Pepe that we know and love (or hate in the case of some people) and the character of this cartoon. On the one hand, the disguised cat that Pepe chases lovingly in 'Odor-capable Kitty' is distinctly masculine. In addition, Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the climax of the cartoon, his French accent disappearing when his wife and family appear. Pepe is not even the main character here, the focus favoring the cat that disguises itself as a possum to scare off its enemies. Most of the time, the plot largely follows the usual cartoon format of Pepe Le Pew, but Pepe's aggressive dating does not have the usual jokes and direct camera addresses that make him such a good character. He too is not as handsome as he would become and somewhat awkwardly excited. In fact, 'Odor-capable Kitty' is a rather ugly and clumsy cartoon all over. His main source of appeal comes from his concept that was original at this stage before becoming the model for all of Pepe Le Pew's cartoons that followed. This subsequent development stole "Odor-capable Kitty" from any impact and for modern viewers it just seems like a Pepe Le Pew a bit boring short with a strange surprise ending. As a kid, I hated Pepe Le Pew. As an adult, able to enjoy his more sophisticated, verbal and rispe humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. 'Odor-capable Kitty' makes me feel like a kid again!
