Savage Guns (video title) is a cheap western, where the survivor of a massacre hunts the thugs who killed his brother and left him to die, reaching them in a city controlled by his devious chief. <br /> <br /> Despite much violence, this can be both monotonous and colorless, with poor characterization and almost no imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> The lead actor Robert Woods lives up to his name with an uncharismatic and woody performance that does not generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever. In other words, the viewer never really wrings to him despite the fact that he is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the scene of the annoying dance hall where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly German unsexy accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst scene here!
