Sci-Fi Channel films have become tediously predictable. It seems low budget, originality and plot. <br /> <br /> In this creation, the government is willing to get a lot of telekinesis and recruits a poor soul by tortuous means to help. There are many twists and turns on the subject of government organization. black coats, shadows, short, meaningless lines make these one-dimensional drawings. <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. It brings a bit of the style of your character "Angel" to the role. It's hard to miss the link that your character "Crusade" was a telepath and this is a movie about telekinetics. Was this a sci-fi selection move to try to attract fans of the other show? Who knows. Fortunately he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely low budget. It reflects the current Canadian location model of The Sci-Fi Channels, some well-known characters, few effects and a terribly awful plot and character development. One would think that they believe that science fiction fans will see anything called "science fiction". If you want a good telekinesis movie, check out "The Fury" (1978).
