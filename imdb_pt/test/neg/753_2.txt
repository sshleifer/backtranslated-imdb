Poor Jane Austen should be glad she was not around to see this terrible disaster of adaptation. So many great Jane Austen films have emerged recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other films that I despise - The Man in Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book. Jane Austen was mocking the gothic craze in her society, and much of the novel is ironic. The film, however, is serious and presents itself terribly melodramatically. The carefree and entertaining flavor of Austen's writing is total and conspicuously absent from this heavy incursion into which horror meets the period drama. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are gratuitous and uninteresting. In addition, Henry Tilney is terribly unattractive. Why, I ask, would anyone fall in love with him? If you're looking for a fun Jane Austen night, check out Emma!
