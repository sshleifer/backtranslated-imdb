I saw this Hallmark television movie when it originally aired. I lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch. I just was not in the right mood to watch this movie. But Hallmark represents the best quality films. Now, there is a reason to give this movie a second look. Clive Owen, who plays "Damon Wildeve," may have the chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes him. Clive Owen may have to wait until the year 2008. The other reason is that the female lead is Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was an unknown at the time) and became an Oscar winner of Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003 Plowright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this movie. I like the opening line in this movie: "Deliver my heart from this hideous and lonely place. Send me a great love from somewhere or else I will die, truly I will die."
