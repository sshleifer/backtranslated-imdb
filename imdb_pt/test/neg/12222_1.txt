This is possibly the worst documentary I've ever seen. He looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of the directors of the War Room, which was a great movie (albeit a bit one-sided), but it was beautiful. Startup.com looked like it was filmed in a guy's basement. The quality was so unfortunate that I could not take it anymore. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to Blockbuster and get something else. I can not understand how something so amateurish about someone like Chris Hegedus. How the heck did that win some prizes to get ??? The War Room definitely deserved an award, as did another great documentary called Ameragosa (both won awards). This documentary looked like it was made by Uncle Joe, who also does weddings on weekends. Illumination shimmering, dimly lit, unfavorable, bad sound, a 10 year old could make a better movie than that guy.
