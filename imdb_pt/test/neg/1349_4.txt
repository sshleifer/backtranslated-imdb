I've never seen the original movie that others commented on, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison. <br /> <br /> I thought the message of the movie was: if you only care about yourself, everything will be right with the world, everything will fit, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and like more of you, your employers will want more, pay more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message reprehensible and totally false. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on the very funny birth scene at the end; there is not a mother out there who does not laugh during that scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very disappointing movie plot. I did not find myself wringing someone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic self-absorbed that I just did not care what happened to them and this is not a movie that people want to see.
