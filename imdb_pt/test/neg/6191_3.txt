Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal brain wanted in several European countries, and to be free he hides in Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until A superior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all. For Le Moko, although Casbah allows him to remain outside the custody of the police, he also becomes a kind of prison at the same time - a place he can not leave, because the moment he does, he knows he will be arrested . Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. It captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very elegant at the same time. The film itself, unfortunately, was quite disappointing. Several parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I shall mention two. First was the idea that the police would not enter the Casbah. This was clearly stated at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and even repeated references in the film suggest that, in fact, the police entered the Casbah regularly. Thus, neither Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police did not enter, nor Inspector Slimane's (also a decent performance of Joseph Calleia) statement that they could enter the Casbah, but not outside, seemed to make a lot of sense. I also found it hard to believe that le Moko - the hardened crime mentor he was - could be quickly beaten by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point that he entertained local people by singing love songs and then leaving the Casbah. to find it, essentially surrendering. I understand the irony of the few final scenes, of course, as Pepe leaves the freedom of his imprisonment (the Casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he is shot and killed by the police). I just thought impossible. I think someone like Le Moko would fall into such a trap. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting Boyer and, to a lesser extent, Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10
