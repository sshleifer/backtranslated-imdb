I saw this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival and would not recommend it. It is two and a half hours long, during which nothing happens in a rhythm of porridge. <br /> <br /> The main characters are imbeciles and lacking charisma or personality. No one smiles during the movie (even if I had their lives), and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite, she does not seem to like sex. <br /> <br /> The whole experience is depressing and heavy, the director lingering in every scene in a way that drove me crazy, instead of impressing me with the beauty of his technique. Many questions remained in my mind: why did he smell the Algerian man's head? Why does he levitate? What is he looking at about the sharing fence? Why does he kiss Joseph? Why did we go see this rubbish instead of ordering another bottle of wine at Bouzy Rouge?
