This movie tries to be more than it is. First of all, the acting is horrible. You have to go through the incredibly poor delivery of lines and terrible emoticons. The plot is quite interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made of ropes and balsa wood), and a couple of guys lies ashore. If that was not enough, a guy named Count de Sade is also living there. He lives in fear of pirates and went completely insane. Anyway, he has a big slave, a young woman and a few dogs. There is another woman who does not speak and her wife, who is leprous. Either way, things go bad when these men have to deal with this crazy. He is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. The rest of the film involves an attempt to escape. It has an ironic ending that I will not reveal and kind of rescues the movie. I would not bother if I were you.
