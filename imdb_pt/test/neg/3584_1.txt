Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Monotonous, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the kind of film the Irish film industry should not be doing. And with the added advantage of a treacle coated finish. A disgusting example of how talent and originality have shifted in favor of almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes - children are sweet. Yes, it almost looks like it's done professionally. But that is making movies by numbers, a direct hit and grabbing what the director obviously thinks is "success" - a film that sponsors and scorns the public. It's amazing that Working Title puts 3 million pounds into this rubbish. But then, they paid for Love Actually. Do not waste your money.
