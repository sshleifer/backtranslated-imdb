I can imagine what happened to the movie: a lot of studio guys are sitting, drinking gin and tonic, maybe a tune up, and one of them has the idea that it would be great if they could find a movie that would bridge the gap between generations, who at the time was as distant as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-aged rebels and their parents would find equally interesting - for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What interests hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism and wild scenarios and fantasies. What interests your parents? Musicals, eye drops, a script to feel good and nostalgia. Alright then, "Lost Horizon," the old classic, like a musical, in color. You can not lose, right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad romance. Broadly, he outlines a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The Valley of the Blue Moon," near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully satisfied villagers who serve an abbey of long-lived monks. To meddle in paradise is a glider of strangers (a veteran of World War I, a missionary, etc.) like Gilligan's Island, each with its own twist in the situation - the plot that exists relates to the reaction of each of them to be presented with a choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century. Taken on its own terms, it's soft, pop-fluff lit, presenting Hilton's own conservative British views on "Oriental" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captives honored guests of the monks, castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never pressed for labor or prayer (not that the monks make much of themselves), treated royally, and given simple but luxurious accommodations - wanted to escape? In this Middle-earth paradise, the monks are cultured and wise, the weather is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are quaint natives and nothing changes. Nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look beautiful, and even flirt a little (the reason given is one of the most hilarious and inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is not menacing: revealed as a mixture of the best worlds of Christianity and Buddhism, it has hardly offended anyone but the most fundamentalist or eccentric diehards who really knew something about Tibet (which in the early 1930s was very small number). Like a Capra movie focusing on the angles of adventure / character interaction, it was charming; and maybe Steven Spielburg could have flown if he was around. As a Hollywood product of the '70s, the adventure was too quick, and the updated list of very bland characters impressed quite a bit. Deprived of the sketched and suggestive qualities of classic B & W, the monastery is reminiscent of a luxurious beauty spa in white and pale blue, and though at least some of the monks' robes have attempted historical accuracy, most of the rest seemed on their way to a morning massage and mud bath, with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim could have restored the story, explaining the very real conflict within each character's reaction; just five years later, Brian Eno would have captured the laid-back atmosphere for a T; instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs, which marry Muzak-like tunes, with some of New Agey's newest lyrics already written. Very naturally for the time, all the songs ask for a number of dance, that goes from the merely forgettable to the completely boring, and so it is the script, that does not have a line that is worth mentioning. Tie-ins with this movie had legion-there was everything from cookery books to posters designed to promote this movie, and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. The only good thing I can say is that I was impressed enough to write this review completely from memory almost thirty years later - the following month I read Aldous Huxley, I bought a copy of Bardo Thadol, and therefore learned about the true Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
