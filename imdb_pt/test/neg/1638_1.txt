Credits come from the sewing work of Sandy Frank that was made to turn this film into Cave Dwellers for re-release. Now that this is clear ... oh! Excruciating and blinding pain. Blade Master bounces shamelessly on the sword bandwagon and witchcraft started by the Conan movies ... except that the bandwagon never left the garage anyway. As such, this Italian film is a failure trying to steal a box office failure with predictable results. However, this would give very little credit to the director and the writers, who make no effort to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any semblance of precise continuity of the era. Miles O'Keefe is not a protagonist, now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved this, if Actor did not). Just an unlikely picture and a chore to watch.
