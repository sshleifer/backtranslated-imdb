This is one of those movies with great potential. Brilliant actors, a debut from a very interesting director and an astonishing plot of "Survivor." <br /> <br /> But it does not work at all. <br /> <br /> To start with the good thing: The cinematography is impressive. The beauty of the desert of Namibia shows itself as a merciless environment, also in the images. And then there's the acting. It's all right. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts". <br /> <br /> Then the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why the hell does Levring choose "Lear" for his play? The idea of ​​letting Shakespeare articulate his despair and inner longing does not work. It looks like a facade. And of course the tragedies happen because of the choice of "Lear". They just need to fit the script of Levring and Oscar winner Anders Thomas Jensen. <br /> <br /> And sex. It takes about three days, then more or less all the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easiest way when you are in need of a crisis in a plot. Janet McTeer's part falls apart, mostly because of this ridiculous idea. Sex makes the plot fall promptly on the floor. Instead, they could focus on dialogue. There must have been talk between all the characters, but mostly we see them talking in smaller groups. Their conversation is as fake as "Lear" and the rest of the movie. "The King Is Alive" is not yet the worst Danish dogmatic film of 95 years. But compared to Lone Scherfig's most recent home-made film 'Italiensk for begyndere', this one fails. Not a good movie. It is an evil. But it's beautiful.
