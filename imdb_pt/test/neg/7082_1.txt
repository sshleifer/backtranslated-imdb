I am not from America, I usually watch this program on AXN channel, I do not know why this channel respected, like prime time suction program. Creation of the Hollywood Money Bank Jerry Bruckheimer, this time he is spending a great deal of money on the small screen. In each episode, a group of people who have two team members travel from one country to another for a large sum of money; where filmmakers film their travels. I do not know who the hell gave this stupid idea to the show. It has nothing to do, in every episode we see people running like beggars, sometimes screaming, crying, honking, spasmodic camera work .. it is harmful to the eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the race is that spectators finally know that each of the team members can not enjoy their racing / travel experience. Even so, to sum up the ratings, the producers created the ideas of including Gays in a show, sucking the American reality show. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to note, better move to other channels. <BR> The incredible race = the disgusting show.
