This is just one of those movies that can not justify much of anything that happens. These people are going on a hike: the young girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I think the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. Either way, there are many animals and there is a lot of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where this is going. Near the end, there is a lot of action and a rape thrown in. Someone must pay, and they do. It would have been nice to have some piranhas to fill the thing. There were many monkeys. If you advance quickly through the dull parts, you will have a tight five minutes.
