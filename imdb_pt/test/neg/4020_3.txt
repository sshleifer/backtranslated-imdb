This film earns its 3 by bad writing, technical problems of merit and continuity. Some people gave this movie a 10 - and maybe it's okay if you're just marking the movie for its fun factor. However, technically, this is an inept serial of movies from beginning to end - produced by writers, actors and 3rd category staff. This really applied to almost all the serials, because they were meant for low-level entertainment especially aimed at children. And there's nothing wrong with that, but "high art" is not !! Spy Smasher earns a lower than average score compared to other series because it is of even lower quality and has MAJOR continuity issues - even for a serial. It was common for a serial to have a cliff hanger - that is, a moment at the end of the episode that looked like the good guy dies but miraculously survives when the next episode began. BUT, in this movie, it is much more heinous and ridiculous. You would literally see the hero dying in the last episode, but in the next, they re-filmed the scene and showed that he did not really die (even though they clearly showed him buying the last farm)! Again and again in SPY SMASHER he seems to die, but in the next episode they show from a different angle and he somehow avoided death - even if he fell 1,500 feet into a river, fell into a saw or something. Watch this movie not for its quality, but also for a good laugh or for learning what it was like to go to the movies on Saturday mornings, decades ago.
