This movie is painful. That's probably the best way to describe it. It's 93 minutes of your life that you'll never get back. Well, actually it's another 86 minutes because there's no way anyone's going to get the credits on that stinky pile of dog feces. Immediately you can say that the film is from the producer of "Mortal Kombat" due to its techno soundtrack. This drains the few fun moments that this movie can give you. The rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters, the acting skills of everyone involved (including Christopher Lambert's miscast), and the nonexistent direction. Did I leave anything out? Of course yes. Let us not forget the suicide-inducing script, with its unitary (funny) dialogue. Oh yeah, and let's also talk about how they embarrassed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. The costumes and guns (were those giant pizza cutters I kept seeing?!?!) They're just stupid, that's the best way I can describe them. And the last culprit of the night is the always horrible CGI. When will filmmakers learn that CGI is a drug? When will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80's? Probably never, but movies like this and "Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace" make us wish they'd bring them back. To top it off, avoid this movie as the newest Freddie Prinze, Jr. movie. So again, if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr. movies, then you deserve to sit through this horrible movie excuse.
