If it were not for swearing and a superimposed blur when a character would give another finger, it would be easy to confuse this low-budget snoozer with a sci-fi channel pilot. The plot about the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously with the hero himself, talented, in search of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge. Unfortunately, the film is interesting, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. Louis Gossett Jr., senior, plays a minor role as the government bureaucrat who created the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. He walks by the side and it's hard to understand why he bothered. Other cast members do a decent job with a script that requires little.
