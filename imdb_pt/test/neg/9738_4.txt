Maybe it's just me, but this movie looked more like a sequel or follow-up than the separate project. Because? When it was filmed (a few years after the war), most viewers probably knew why Rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to the Allies, why he was Hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years then it is not. t so obvious anymore. "Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel" is a decent war movie, but it's by no means explained how Rommel got his nickname, what he was doing. The Allies regarded him as his best General, why were his soldiers so afraid of Afrika Korps? It's what's missing in this movie - we see its fame, its character, its way of dealing with soldiers and enemies, but e. we also see that Hitler was complaining about his achievements in Africa, calling him a coward, etc. So we're missing the big picture here - it's "The Story of Rommel," but unfortunately the "Desert Fox" part is missing.
