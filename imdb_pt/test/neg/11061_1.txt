If you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time, you should try this. I've wasted enough time watching myself, so I'm not going to waste anymore explaining why it's so horrible. Be warned!!! Oh, I see I have to fill 10 lines or more. Here we go: every year or so some people find it fun to start filming a low budget movie about the scary monsters of the underworld, which we hope will be a kind of success. The Cave is one of those. I did not have high expectations about this, but the acting is so bad and the production so bad that I am seriously considering asking for a refund. Phewww ... plus a line about a useless movie ... Oh, I'm done.
