Blake Edwards' legendary fiasco begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed, Star !, Oh! What a Lovely War !, and Edwards's Pink Panther films, Darling Lili, never involve the viewer; aerial sequences, musical numbers, romance, comedy and espionage are all ho-hum. At what point should the viewer give a damn? This disaster changes tone, never decides what it wants to be, and apparently thinks it's a fake, but it's pathetically and blatantly square. Outdated in the worst sense, the public understandably stayed away in droves. It's awful. James Garner would have been a big improvement over Hudson, who is just cardboard, and he does not connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson do not seem to have joked and come away with a miscalculated miscalculation. Blake Edwards' SOB is not much more than OK, but it's the only good that's ever come out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional look of much of Darling Lili just makes everything much harder to bear. To quote Paramount boss Robert Evans, "$ 24 million in movies and no photo."
