in a Saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12 years old) and my mother let me go because she thought the movie would be OK (it is rated G). I was assaulted by loud music, STRANGE pictures, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense. We left halfway because we were bored, frustrated and our ears ached. <br /> <br /> I saw 22 years later in a renaissance theater. My opinion has changed - it's even worse! Basically, everything I hated was still there and the movie was MUCH 60 years old ... and already gone awry. I got all the little jokes ... really bad, they were not funny. The constant pitch changes have quickly become annoying and there is absolutely nothing to hold on to. Some people will love this. I found this frustrating ... at the end of the movie, I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> In addition, all of Monkees' songs in this movie are SUCK (and I like them). <br /> For ex-hippies only ... or if you're stoned. I give this a 1.
