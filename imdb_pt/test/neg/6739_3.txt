When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect a good deed. You expect to fight, not just a lot of filming like in this movie. And you expect a rather simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story even though it's a Seagal movie. But this one, I do not know what to say. It's very, very confusing indeed. At the end of the movie, I had big problems figuring out what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story does not have much information and is so full of holes that it is almost impossible to follow what is happening in the movie. There are many people in the movie, people change sides all the time and change places very often. Terrible. I just do not understand why it looks like Seagal is making a kind of sequel to this one.
