Jesus Franco is a hit or miss in his films and I would say that was a lack, that is, unless you are in total slouch. I'll say the man has an eye for a good shot, even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean. This is totally ridiculous and the acting is awful, but the acting is the smallest it is. And what is this? Well, there are about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking up and wiping the hot sun for no apparent reason, and almost as much as you can bear and maybe a little. The most remarkable (?) It is a scene involving a young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently loving German shepherd, and while what is happening is merely implied (still good) it is probably a scenario that I could have gone through without she. I would rate this with Tender Flesh as one of Franco's films that I would rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yes.
