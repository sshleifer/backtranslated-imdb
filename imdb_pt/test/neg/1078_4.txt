I was very disappointed with this movie. Great actors, and potentially a great plot, but it just seemed to flow together. Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her screen work was in car chases made with Austin Minis. The placement of products went wrong, very wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction was also wrong. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera went through it, it took too long and Norton made a face or something. Come on, Hollywood, give us some credit! It's okay to be surprised at a plot twist without having to wire. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was below average. I always enjoyed enjoying the work and talent that comes into a movie, but that was not enough.
