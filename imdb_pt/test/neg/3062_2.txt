Wow, incredible that something so bad could be done. I'm giving this movie a 2 because it's so bad it has a certain kind of appeal. It's so bad it's comical and it has a certain entertaining value. Also, there is a bit of free nudity and this is always welcome. <br /> <br /> So, where do I start. The acting is beyond horrible, it's like you're watching a high school play being filmed. Theresa Russell must have done something really bad for being forced to make this movie and her acting reflects how happy she is to be in the middle of this mess. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is simply silly with the cast of Dan Cortese as an FBI agent, the cherry on top of this piece of junk. His performance really made me laugh out loud. As for the script and the direction, C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester should simply be taken out and shot.
