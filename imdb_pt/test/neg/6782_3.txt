Some folk friends have recommended this, but as a film it is really lacking in originality. I have discovered that the characters are unfavorable stereotypes, and the plot is predictable from the beginning. However, if you enjoy traditional English / Appalachian ballads, you will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. I also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music of the movie, with professional musicians filling the actors.
