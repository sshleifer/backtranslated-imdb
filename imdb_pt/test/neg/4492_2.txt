It may contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> An innocent trailer park or perhaps the white boy from 'Compton' LA witnesses a terrible tragedy in childhood related to drugs and violence. Unprofessional but dedicated police partners try to overturn a sophisticated and sophisticated club ring of drugs just to be fired and extorted by high-priced drug lords. The plot thickens as more people return to seek revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only memorable part was a walk-on by Ron Jeremy. <br /> <br /> If I were in a movie theater I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry for the poor actors in this movie. It was horrible and painful to watch. The worst part was cinematography, where the director was blinking in the same scene, so the sound did not match. And NO, it was not a codec or DVD problem, but an intentional technique. Ughh Two stars.
