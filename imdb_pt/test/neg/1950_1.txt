I had noticed that this movie was a lot on Cinemax lately, so this morning, I decided to watch it. I had just finished Infiltrator, which is a great movie, and I thought that also looked good. By the way, the cable had, at least. This movie was awful. It's slow, the pace is horrible, it seems like it lasts 4 hours. There is no real plot to speak of ... agh! How can anyone say anything good about this movie? Rickman is good ... but he always is ... the other two characters work well, but there is no real story to bear any of this. After 2 hours, and you sitting there wondering what is happening on Earth, where the earth is the plot - this ends with a surprise that, frankly, ended up making me sick. Do not bother with that.
