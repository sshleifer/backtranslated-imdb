First of all, the genre of this movie is not comedy, it's more of a drama. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations in the movie, and yet they did not show up. As some of the other reviews point out, there is good music in the movie. But if you want to hear good music, I suggest you spend some time looking at some recordings of shows with Bon Jovi, or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be more quality time. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
