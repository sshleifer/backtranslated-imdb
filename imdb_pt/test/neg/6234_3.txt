I'm sorry, but I do not understand how the studio goes away with this. The movie is not worth it. Maybe like a theater, but certainly not like a movie! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Offcource's acting is good, but I expect nothing less from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as the "bad guy". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me;). I'm also a fan of your British detectives. Still, they just can not save this movie so boring, sorry. I hope we do not have many more movies with this director "Pieter Jan Brugge" because he obviously does not understand the meaning of the words "suspense and suspense".
