Danny De Vito shows us here that he is definitely, indeed infinitely, a better on-screen interpreter than off. He plays the role of Owen, a miserable writer with an old and moody mother (deliciously played by Anne Ramsey) that he would like to see dead. Billy Crystal is Larry, a very frustrated writing teacher who has a distant wife who feels the same. So, Owen, after seeing Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train," suggests that they swap murders. As a director, De Vito's control is incoherent when he misses this clever idea, while his movie shakes with great humor. for the very bland. He and Crystal are well in the lead roles, but the show belongs to Anne Ramsey as the grumpy Mrs. Lift. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 20, 1992 - Video
