This movie is surprisingly poor. It was on television when I tuned in during an action scene and laughed at the sexist dialogue, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a few minutes to realize that it was not really a comedy, it should be taken seriously. What has to be remembered is that someone actually sat down and wrote this movie, and worse still - other people financed it and gave it the go-ahead. Rutger Hauer obviously does not read movie scripts before he signs up, or that he or he has some seriously bad debts to pay. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this movie is so bad that you find yourself looking at it, wondering how it really was financed, and how a TV channel should have paid money for the rights to display it. The dialogue between the hero and the villain while trying to shoot each other from the sky is particularly painful, with the dialogue sounding as if it were generated by a Texas Instruments Speak & Spell. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood money machine is the worst. Funny though.
