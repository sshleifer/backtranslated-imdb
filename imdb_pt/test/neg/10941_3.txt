O my God. I would never have thought it was possible for me to see a worse thriller than Domestic Disturbance anytime soon, but here it is. Armed with rotten plot, terrible editing, forced acting and 'style' headache inducer (sorry, I have no other words for that), Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to reevaluate an entire genre; that is, this movie is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now look a little better. <br /> <br /> Now, not only is Sanctimony a terrible movie in itself, but it also achieves the difficult task. to rip off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. From the main titles - nothing more than a blatant attempt to replicate Se7en's - I was under the impression that something did not smell right. As the movie began with a series of quick cuts, filled with bloody images and bombastic colors, I knew where that smell came from. Police Officer Jim Renart (Michael Par√©) and police officer Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin) are investigating a series of murders in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as "Monkey Killer" (that scary and creepy nickname, uh?) By his methods of work, he has already killed many people. You see, this nut apparently works by following the proverb "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" and cut off the eyes, ears and tongues of its victims. So far, six eyes, six ears and three tongues. In a very ingenious way, Renart and Smith discover that Monkey Killer is likely to kill three other people ... well, because he probably wants to complete the number 666. Then suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien) . , a young, successful, good-looking businessman with a terrible temper. And that's where the theft of the American Psycho enters the picture. <br /> <br /> So we follow the life of the two cops and the young psychopath, none of which is interesting, until finally they meet. Along the way, a disco where Renart misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes after the club because ... well, just because the script tells us he's a suspect Place, put on; then with a single punch in the stomach, Renard gets rid of a big guard blocking the way, and the guard is never heard again? Does this scene seem so unrealistic to anyone? <br /> <br /> Anyway, after another murder, Gerrick appears as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart suspect that he may be the killer. In the typical Wild Instinct fashion, Smith gets some dates with the young entrepreneur, under the assumption that she can discover her true identity. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the end, but it is, simply, an embarrassment; there are contradictions, some plot holes, issues that are never resolved, and especially there is one last scene in which a brutal mass murder, supposedly shocking and sad, seems so ridiculously exaggerated and absurd that I honestly can not imagine how anyone could laugh of this. <br /> <br /> In the 87th minute, Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about a single character because they are all so flat (not to speak boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you know them. You are never drawn to the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when they are not absolutely unnecessary and out of place. The acting ranges from medium (Van Dien) to downright atrocious (Rubin, and most of the supporting cast); music is technically generic and photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco of the genre, we have some free nudity. <br /> <br /> 3/10
