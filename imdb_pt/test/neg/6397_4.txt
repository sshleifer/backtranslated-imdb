All in all, do not expect too much and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, this will do it for sure. The only reason I gave this film 2 more points than it deserves is for 2 reasons: Michael Caine # 1. # 2. People, points <br /> <br /> The film is almost fully loaded by Caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of turning it into a viable and semi-believable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper are insufficient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is pure class, as always. In addition to being a talented comic and classic actor, Caine brings a mix of insight, malice and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm to his role in Alfie ... and the reason he won the prize. Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he is tenderly seductive ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholy and sentimental ... and beyond the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the ONLY reason not to seek a better form of entertainment. Well maybe a glimpse of the two adorable young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But look is all you can do in Michelle (though her look looks very dated) ... there could not be a movie experience more painful than watching her "try" to act (most of her dialogue seems overdubbed as well ). Demi is acting and she seems to hold out 100 times better and you could transplant her easily, just like in any movie today (she does not look too different to be honest). Ms. Moore is certainly underused, especially considering she was the biggest star of 2. <br /> <br /> Save the fact that it's a silly farce in the end, I really like the maturity with which all these people deal with this scandalous situation ... that does not end with friendships or marriages and that a case, even with the smaller daughter of his best friend, can be forgiven and everyone can move on. The injured parties show anger and disappointment at what happened, but everything works out for the better ... a little unreal, for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. I hope it always is.
