O'Brien and taxi driver Frank Jenks (as Egbert "Romeo" Egglehoffer) would have made an excellent team of TV detectives from the 1950s.

Unfortunately, the story becomes winding and anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> The Phantom of the Street 42 (5/2/45) Albert Herman ~ Dave O'Brien, Kay Aldridge, Frank Jenks
