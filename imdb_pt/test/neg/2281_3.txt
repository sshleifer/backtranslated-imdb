By-the-numbers, Oscar-hungry biopic about the late and great singer Ray Charles. There is one - exactly one - big scene in * Ray *. It occurs during a flashback of Charles's youth, after the boy was completely blind. Running to the house of the farmer that he shares with his mother, he stumbles on a chair and spreads on the ground. He cries out for his mother; she, following her philosophy that a person should "walk alone," silently and thoughtfully observes from the kitchen, waiting to see if the boy can draw upon his own resources. The boy proves to be up to the challenge, using his ears and memory to locate a kettle on a stove, a nearby fire, the grass blowing in the wind outside a window, the sinking of a cricket on the board floor. floor. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a break here; it expands; breathe - even for only 40 seconds. The scene is a much needed respite from Taylor Hackford's noisy movie. By "noisy" I am not referring to music, which is, of course, excellent. I am referring to the sound effects (big BOOMS! First of all a flashback) and to the inane dialog ("I am talking to you as a FRIEND, Ray", etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is equally and unnecessarily flashy: sepia color filters on camera lenses during flashbacks; rotating-dervish 360s from camera-crane, etc. etc. All modern facilities. What a horrible cinematic style is displayed on * Ray *! - a style very common in "major" movies of the last decade (Scorsese's * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to this movie). These tricks are employed to obfuscate the cliche script. Some of us are not fooled. <br /> <br /> Some of us, too, are not prepared to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything but superb mimicry. It is true that Foxx strangely resembles Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, speaks like Charles and even sings like Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during the live performance is technically perfect. I'm not envying Mr. Foxx for his Oscar; He deserved. (It was a pretty weak field this year, anyway.) But one wonders if Foxx really understands Charles. The actor reaches a great moment in which he insists on trying the slap that his bandmates are doing: he registers, even for a brief moment, a disgust for the injustice of being blind and a life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Carlos between the brilliant salvation of music and the forgetfulness of the heroine, with its blindness as the battlefield between these two compulsions. But the damn movie simply will not take long: it jumps from triumph to triumph, never stopping to get a view of man. You must STRETCH to find the dramatic tension; you must provide the drama for the film. One must, in other words, imagine a better film than this. <br /> <br /> In his race to a glorious conclusion, * Ray * presents, then dodges, several great ideas for a movie: his early days at the "Chitlin Circuit"; his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic seal; the problem of his heroin addiction; the inevitable artistic commitments that accompany overwhelming success; the importance of man for the fight for civil rights (played in the film by, ah, about 3 minutes of screen time), and more. Filmmakers are too lazy to focus on any of these elements. Two and a half hours of seeing a man overcome one adversary after another can make us feel good, but this film is not necessarily a great work of art. This kind of approach certainly does not provide a deeper insight into the subject of the film - and should not that be the real goal of a film like this? If I wanted a list of articles about Ray Charles's accomplishments, I would have simply researched Google with him. <br /> <br /> 3 stars in 10 - the 2 extra stars strictly for music.
