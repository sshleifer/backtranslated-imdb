The IMDB plot summary mistakenly makes it look like Noah Taylor's movie when Fairuza Balk is the central character. It's unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in an amateur, meaningless, film-less film. Balk ends up with boyfriend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I think - played by Dempsey) and accidentally kills Taylor - who follows her into the rest of the movie as a ghost. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen.
