It's great to hear the 3 or more comments, which point to what 'Footballers Wives' means to women. The title alone eliminates any supposed equality that women have in the media industry or in society, reducing them to two-dimensional cartoon cartoons about how men think women should behave. It's a stupid postmodern farce. It can also be called "Wifey footballers staying at home and knows their place". <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it may be a kind of parody in the UK's representation of the junk press. of celebrities and their role in maintaining a patriarchal society. Thus, women can undermine stereotypes, acting like these stereotypes and possessing the image created by men's desire. No, that would be ironic and intelligent. I also think I should be complimenting. <br /> <br /> Zoe Lucker is simply too much to camp and overdo to be taken seriously. Just like a Cruella De Ville even cheaper. She just needs a manic, condescending, but at the same time self-evaluating laugh to show her true range of acting. Oh does she? Right. Anyway, it boils down to just who this is meant to be. Or 'smart' smart, who thinks it's a response of proportions of vaudevillian, or people who think it's 'real'. "Best actors"? OMG!! Stop seeing this mestizaje of a pantomime and earn a living. <br /> <br /> She is totally sexist and has such a low quality that perhaps those who appreciate her think that they are "involved" in the "joke". Do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? It's so humiliating for women and men. They are not all idiots, selfish, lovers of materialistic football, who think women are nothing more than another trophy to be put on display for the public. It's so humiliating. I'm sure Mrs. Lucker would easily face them in her "real" life, and twist them around her finger as so easily done in "Footballers' Wives". <br /> <br /> But of course, it does not really matter. I mean, it's just a TV show after all. So please, let him stay out. It is horrible and will only be remembered in the same disbelief by which 'Prisoner Cell Block H' was so lovingly remembered. <br /> <br /> How did this come into being? It is certainly not subtle or complex. It could only come from the same mentality that reads FHM magazine, and think it's okay to watch soft porn, and "make" as many women bow to their "testament" and sing patriotic and racist comments whenever "their" football losses / victories. It's totally rude.
