I like vampire movies, I like B movies, I love B vampire movies. But this one has almost nothing for it. Some of the performances are horrible, especially by 3 of the male protagonists. The story is not particularly interesting. In a short relative of 88 minutes, it still seems very long and you will see yourself accelerating a lot. There are a lot of kung-fu vampire attacks. Looks cool? It's not when it's done on a low budget. It gets repetitive very quickly. There is a little blood and blood, nothing to get excited about. There is some good wire work where you can see the wires. There are some good landscapes being filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> It's not worth the rent
