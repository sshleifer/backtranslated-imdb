I rented this by accident. I lifted the video and looked back and thought "shameless Blair Witch rip-off". Then, in a moment of carelessness, I picked up 'The Francisville Experiment' thinking it was something else. My horror of coming home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this movie could offer. Flat characters, bad acting and a sense of 'we've seen the Blair Witch Project and we could do the same' will permeate the action to the point where watching in the fast-forward will get you straight to the credits. I am not to blame the filmmakers for being lazy or desperate, but after this yawn, I felt the need to warn everyone: do not waste your time, you have a life.
