The price of a dream - and some dreams can be "very" expensive. <br /> <br /> Only seeing the translated version of English is perhaps the reason for a low rating of this viewer. <br /> <br /> It has made the film in general poorer than the material of the story suggested ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments seem to suggest that the subtitled version would be better. <br /> <br /> But some elements of the plot remained unexplained, leaving an unfinished sensation. <br /> <br /> It also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?". <br /> <br /> Pity there is not more (at least at this stage, at least).
