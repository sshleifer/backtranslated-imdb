Some teenagers go to an old abandoned farmhouse left to one of them by their dead grandfather, unaware that there were several murders there decades earlier, because his grandfather made a pact with the devil for a good harvest - could not the guy thought of something better to sell your soul? The grandson of man and his friends are prepared to be the next sacrifice, for reasons that are never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, the black guy with a white girlfriend and the two lesbians have to fight with three murderous scarecrows - but, do not be fooled like me, this is not as much fun as it sounds. It's mostly just a lot of small talk about kicking the ball, smoking drug, and the main actor complaining about never knowing his parents. The camera's work is atrocious and unstable, perhaps made in a handheld in some scenes, which is perhaps a good thing since the scarecrows have just left a boy's birthday party, and apparently they could only hire two people to play all three. scarecrows Some of the best movies I've seen were these independent, low budget horror movies, but this is just pathetic. The cast and crew seem to have been made up of a bunch of people who knew each other, had never acted before and had no intention of acting again, and had a few thousand dollars (I can not believe this movie cost $ 130,000 to do) and a weekend of free time on your hands, even the skinny lesbian dipping scene is lame. <br /> <br /> I think it's fun too, that from this writing, there is a sequel to this movie that did not even bother to add to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * off the dick, and I just rate it just fine just because of the skinny dipping scene, no matter how bad it may be.
