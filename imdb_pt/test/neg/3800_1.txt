Miserable Talk about mistakes. BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE is bad in every respect. Salvagers Michael Caine and Karl Malden decide to tow the wreck of the transatlantic of the same name with a really gritty tugboat. They are challenged by the relentless Telly Savalas and his gang of gunmen armed with machine guns. This sequel part, part of the remake, has Caine, Malden and ANOTHER group of survivors from Poseidon making an equally dangerous journey out of the sinking ship. Among this group are Shirley Jones, Slim Pickens, Peter Boyle, Shirley Knight and Slim Pickens. Jack Warden plays a blind man. Surely, you wish you were blind after seeing this mess. Sally Field is particularly annoying as a clandestine aboard Caine's tugboat. <br /> <br /> Disaster master Irwin Allen not only produced this but also decided to direct it.
