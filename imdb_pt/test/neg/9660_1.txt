Just in case the title is not revealed - this movie is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Short review? Yes. <br /> <br /> I decided to spend the longest time writing this review, since Hollywood probably decided to put it in the script. I doubt it will be published, considering how badly I've written it all, but if it is so and anyone reads - save the first Sandlot movie. It completely overcomes its predecessors in every way. The sequences are not worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in doing them should be ashamed to ruin what has to be one of the most classic and original films of our childhood.
