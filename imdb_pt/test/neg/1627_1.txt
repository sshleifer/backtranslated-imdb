Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever it is called, is in one word: VILE! I saw this on the MST and I laughed not only at the great comment but with the inept movie that was demonstrated. Sunglasses, tire marks and where the Actor got a hang glider? So they take some pictures from another movie, Where Eagles Dare as Tom Servo points out. To show how this film is really cheap, watch the scene in which Actor and Thong fight invisible swordsmen. Or better yet, look for the giant hose dressed like a snake that Actor must fight! And what exactly do these credit scenes have to do with the movie?
