this movie, although it may be considered a comedy attempt, is not what the previous ones did. the first half is made up of rugged material typical of Williams, though he did not really make many voices; he's always been great at poker linings and queues ... somewhere during the election there's a problem with the computer program used in the election. this is where the net 3 comes in ... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and that the evil corporation wants to shut her up ** spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them, although this is neither a bit revealed ... this movie could have been one of political brilliance (perhaps with sorken in the reigns), but falls short of a stew made by many chefs
