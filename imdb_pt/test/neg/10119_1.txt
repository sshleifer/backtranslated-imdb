First of all, I really can not understand how some people "liked" this movie. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the actors seem to be bored ... and I think that says it all! <br /> <br /> However, I have to give my applause to the creators of opening credits - this team seems to have a really good future. That's why I recommend large studios to watch ONLY opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if watched outside the movie, it almost looks like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Better luck (or judgment) next time to the producers of this, this ... this "thing!".
