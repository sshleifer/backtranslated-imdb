This movie was highly recommended, but I do not know why. I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, except in 50 First Dates, where he moves away from his usual angry routine. Damon Wayans is an undercover cop and Adam Sandler is the guy with whom he pretended to be friends for a year to finish him off. Of course, Sandler is quite angry with this betrayal. Cue cries of rage and silly facials of the king of variety. They end up running away and of course become friends again after a big misunderstanding (involving Sandler shooting at Wayans in the head - he survives therefore is bulletproof). Do I need to go ahead? You will find out what will happen if you watch anyway. When our DVD player continued to pause (hey, it was $ 80 from the supermarket OK?), It was commented that the player knew the movie was annoying and refused to play it.
