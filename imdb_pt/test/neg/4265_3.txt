There is nothing wrong with showing an old man falling in love with a young woman. Lolita did it. American Beauty did that. <br /> But. They did it subtly. They have not made it so clear from the outset that the director is getting ready to make them fall in love with each other. Not as naturally as two people would (Age in the bar), but forcing them to stand around each other as if they were supposed to fall in love. <br /> <br /> In all, there should have been chemistry. That would have solved the biggest problem. People with reservations against the subject also would have been absorbed and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, no matter impracticability. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe in Jia's character at times. What I found harder to understand, is why Vijay - a photographer and an artist, who looks serious - would have an interest in such a frivolous girl. Unless he himself has some frivolity hidden in himself, which did not come out at all. <br /> <br /> There is much use of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is usually used to show something unnatural or something that can lead to something that is not right. So the RGV itself calls the relation of non-natural. <br /> <br /> Camera angles, background punctuation, editing and even juxtaposition of plans and symbology emphasize and overemphasize the relationship between them. Is the Indian public so dumb that we need to tell us something in 10 different ways to understand? Especially when the two of them were dancing together ... it was clear what was happening. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel that the subject was very well chosen. But Verma should not have made the film with the fact in mind that this is a controversial subject. If it is, then gently handle, why do not you?
