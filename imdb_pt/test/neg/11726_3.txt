Incredibly in a whole new way, ANYTHING, BUT LOVE, is probably to be seen by moviegoers - albeit only as a precautionary measure that proves all that can go wrong with a "vanity" production. I'm guessing a production of vanity, since there is no other reason in God's green land to cast as free of talents and not particularly attractive non-singer / actress as Isabel Gold in the starring role - still disputed by tastes of "spectators "like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy - except she also helped write this bizarre little movie. Her singing leaves a lot to be desired, and yet, unbelievable as it is, every other person in the movie thinks she's great. There are some moments here of real charm or humor, but very few. Otherwise, this is a silly and sad fiasco that goes from painting to ink numbering to wrong numbers. You know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "My son can do better than this!" Well, this is a movie, the kind your kid - or anyone else - can do better.
