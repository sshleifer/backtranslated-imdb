I can not believe! Were they crazy about filming a movie about Connecticut in Southern California? For god's sake, there is Palm Tree everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, a guy says "Welcome to Connecticut" and plays a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut does not have a "Herald", has a "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate AND THE GREENWICH TIMES". (Referring to Stamford, Connecticut newspaper). Maybe the filmmakers should have done a little research, I mean, my god, at least have the correct newspaper name, or film in places that look remotely to Connecticut.
