I've never done one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad I had to say something about it. <br /> <br /> I am all for independent cinema as last year has seen the worst (in my opinion) of the Hollywood exhibitions, the mainstream seems to have lost contact with what it is to make good movies. That being said, movies like this really give the independent movie a bad name. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and stupid enough to empathize. The direction is horrible, the conspiracy is horrible, the plot itself is awful, stay away, far away. Just a brief scene featuring a woman's bare breasts, and even that was not worth a second look. <br /> <br /> The scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ​​having to watch it again. I gave a 2 rather than a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it gets a point for each of those traits.
