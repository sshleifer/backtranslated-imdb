Macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in the cinema and often translated into numerous theater and celluloid scenarios. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of treason between royalty and the pursuit of a man for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries to upgrade Macbeth by putting him in the contemporary underworld of Melbourne. A film where the characters replace swords for weapons (Romeo and Juliet, wing Baz Luhrman) and real vassals for bandits, Macbeth is a violent, violent, but critically flawed film. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being raised to the Thane of Glamis by the King (as prophesied to Macbeth by three witches), Macbeth begins to fix his eyes on the throne. One night the king comes to stay at Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) tells him to kill the king to take over. Macbeth kills his master and then takes his crown. But success has its drawback, as Macbeth soon discovers, when he has to go to hideous fears to protect his murderous secret. <br /> <br /> OK, first things first. The biggest flaw in the movie is Sam Worthington. His interpretation of Macbeth is in one word ... boring. I honestly did not care about Macbeth while watching the movie. I had more sympathy for Lady Macbeth than Victoria Hill because she bothered to act at least. Worthington sits grumpily and wooden throughout the film. I felt he was making his best impression of George Jung's character from Johnny Deep's Blow ... but without the charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a movie before, so I'm not sure if it was his or her fault, but anyway the glue that should have tied it all together in a cohesive unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialog box is fine, but when combined with Geoffrey Wright's Australian Motif Gangster it seems a bit out of place. Freely stimulated action sequences mixed with Shaksperian's long reflections create a rhythm conflict within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But hard and fast action scenes after a three-minute soliloquy tend to be annoying, if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> Camera work is highly stylized and, most of the time, works well. One thing I found annoying was how the camera moved slowly back and forth, almost constantly. I do not care about shots like that, it's just an exaggeration. It goes beyond the realm of being cool and elegant and instead becomes annoying. Other than that, the art direction and the cinematography are pretty well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities that Macbeth possesses; elegant direction, Shakespearean dialogue, a strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (the weird sisters) and good aids of brutal and bloody violence. All these forces are forgotten when one considers the uninspired portrait of Sam Worthington of Macbeth. Macbeth's role was essential to unite everything, and in this respect Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth a forgettable incursion into Shakespeare.
