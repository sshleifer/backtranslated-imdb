I've seen CÃ©dric Klapisch's previous films and therefore expected a quality film with psychological depth. Having been a student of Erasmus and having visited several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and to mix with different cultures at the same time. Yes, it's a lot of fun! Because of that I thought I should not miss this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed to discover that L'Auberge Espagnol can not satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the events are banal and the story is superficial. While there are some familiar situations, they are annoyingly cliche and do not go beyond trivial events. It made the film uninteresting to watch, and gave me a strong "was-there-done-you-did-have-some-thing-to-add?" feeling myself. In addition, the film does not have a firm history. Sometimes it looks more like a documentary or a "real life" show than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> However, I can imagine that if you have not studied or traveled abroad, it can be fun to watch.
