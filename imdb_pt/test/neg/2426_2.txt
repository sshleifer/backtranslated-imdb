This movie is horrible. The acting is tacky and laughable. If you know anything about Rugby, the action is boring. In fact, any episode of Power Rangers contains more realism than this movie. The 'action' consists of no more than a pass and a face kick landing on the try line or being knocked down without possession of the ball and the shaken hand of who knows what. It is impossible to say. There is nothing of the excitement, skill and construction to try to score that the real Rugby contains. As for the haka, this is a lot of tugs trying to imitate a tradition that they do not know, much like the white rasta character who should have been left out of the movie. The next time a Rugby movie is made, we can only hope people who know Rugby do.
