An antiquity proprietor in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston) is placed on a U.S. District Court jury in a trial of a Mafioso Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow movie revolves around attempts of Pirone trying to convince Whalley to absolve him of murder, threatening to kill his son and herself. Much action begins, involving gruesome mass looting, mistaken for Willam Hurt as the middleman. Much of this silly and disjointed mess involves Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, court scenes that we've all seen many times and an unbelievable ending. 3/10 is probably going easy on this loss of time.
