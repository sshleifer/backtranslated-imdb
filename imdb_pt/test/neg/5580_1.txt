From time to time it's nice to see a really bad movie like this, just so you know how decent an actor Keanu Reeves is by comparison. The premise of this story is good: teens go out on a boat, meteor falls in the water, aliens kill teenagers. What's not to love about it, if you like thrillers? But I should have known something was happening when I read that it was only 75 minutes long. I thought, "I hate judging movies for how long they are. Who says a movie has to be 90 minutes?" But once I took the DVD to BBuster's house, I was shocked by the poor quality of production, acting, directing this garbage completely amateurish. The only reason I watched until the end was because I do not have cable, and I already paid four dollars for it. However, there was a ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is actually decent and far exceeds that point. First, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. So the aliens - the costumes looked interesting (rubber suits), but since most of the film happens in the dark, you can not see them! And almost none of the actors was convincing enough to suspend disbelief. Finally, I must say that the DVD jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself, which seemed like a rip off, so be careful when renting other DVDs. Save your $ 4 and buy a mug of beer .
