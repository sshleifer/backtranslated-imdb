I'm sitting here watching the movie, Tango and Cash. This led to a discussion about other great films of the '80s. The ridiculous Tunrer and Hooch, K9 connection came about. <br /> <br /> Granted I've never seen K9PI and if I still value my life, I never will. Joshua cites this as his movie of the year. Wow. Wow. I'm completely surprised that this movie exists. But much more than that, the fact that Joshua likes this movement disturbs me deeply. I think Joshua is an interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> K9
