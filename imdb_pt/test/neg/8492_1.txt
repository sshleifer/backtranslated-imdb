My wife received tickets to our family to attend the premier of this film from her employer for free. I just regret the price of the popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this garbage film. <br /> <br /> I own the original Mask DVD and enjoyed it a lot. I expected a remake away from the original in production or writing values ​​... but I was not prepared for that ordinary pile of junk. Poor acting, poor plot, a bad baby CGI passing gas and urinating in hyper "mask mode" .. a woman turned into a giant nose, vomiting mucous .. Fun huh? My eight-year-old son loves movies like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Star Wars. After that, I asked him what he thought. Your exact words; "I hate it, it's like the Scooby Doo movie, they get something good and they have to put all those nasty things in." My twelve-year-old daughter and wife hated it, too. My wife later told me that my son asked twice during the trip if we could leave. He's never done this before. I'm proud of him. Lest you think I'm some kind of puritan, the moaning and the lack of laughter I heard in the movies, I think most of the customers agreed with me. <br /> <br /> This movie represents everything bad about children. entertainment today, and any positive review MUST be of people financially attached to the film.
