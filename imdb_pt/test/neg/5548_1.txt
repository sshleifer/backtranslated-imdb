Well, that undressed my nerves, they got it right. I rented this movie for the first time in the 1980s when my friend opened a video store that carried all the rare movies he encountered. He also carried all the shock, horror and exploit movies he managed to dig up, and I went through almost all of them. Previously I had seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs and the Wizard of Gore. They were horrible (especially for the time period), and the Mage of Gore was very unpleasant. The Gore-Gore Girls, however, was the one I most remember as being the most bloody nasty. <br /> <br /> I rented on DVD not long ago because I wanted to hear the comment, and thought I might have some cool dancing and clothes. I forgot it was made in the early 70's, so the fashions had kind of slowed down by then. I also realized that this was a movie that I really did not need to see more than once. It had fun parts, but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I'm really tired of the movie, but sometimes I got really annoyed and had to look away. This was not a good choice of film to put on DVD all clear and clean with better sound and image quality. The commentary is fun in parts, and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $ 6100.00). Maybe HG Lewis was not feeling well that day, but he seemed tired overall and also had the guts to be offended when the interviewer Something Wild compared him to Ed Wood Jr. Sorry, buddy, but you're not exactly Martin Scorsese himself. <br /> <br /> The extremely fine plot is about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A cute reporter and an unattractive team of private detectives (sort, it seems he can not stand) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A lot of really ugly murders happen. <br /> <br /> I'll excuse myself in advance because I do not want to sound like I need to calm down, but this movie was so misogynistic that it pumped me more than the "Company of Men." Mainly because the extreme dislike of the main character and the director by the women - and by the audience - just trickles out of every frame. It's not just the murders. The highly uninteresting detective goes out of his way to treat the reporter doggy at all times for no apparent reason (he is not exactly a threat to George Clooney, as I have said) and she still follows him like a puppy. She faints at seeing a horribly mutilated body and he looks with dislike to her, then dumps cold soda from a can on her face to wake her. Later he calls the police to report the crime "No ... no hurry ... she just seems to ... lose face". This guy is the hero. You can imagine how the other characters feel about women. I could go on and on but you understood. Please note that I am making this film seem a lot more politically correct (and a lot more fun) than it really is. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast is the kind of actors you pray to never take off your clothes. it's not too easy for the eyes, so do not watch the movie just to see nudity unless you're not too picky. The go-go dancers look like they desperately want the scene to end so they can receive their $ 10 or whatever the fee HG paid them and get their medicine. Okay, not so bad, there was a dancer who looked like she could have been a pro and also another cool dancer with a huge afro who did not look as miserable as the rest but still not very happy. The only mildly amusing things were a few moments of unintentional short humor, like when a police officer in charge of a crime scene screams angrily: "Get out of here before I have all arrested!" not to a bunch of reporters, but to some other police officer who quietly takes care of their work (they murmur and move away, though). Henny Youngman is kind of funny, as Lewis says, he said his lines were so fast they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to finish all day in a hurry so he could get paid and get out of there , although he did not seem to care that he saw some naked girls). <br /> <br /> It might be worth seeing just for morbid curiosity - by the time the movie was made, it was probably the most horrible thing in the movie at the time, or if you're really big fan HG Lewis and find it or make low budget movies by anyone fascinating. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've already seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more fun low-budget films from the early '70s ... this movie does not even come close, let's say, "Pink Flamingos" when is the skip-the-popcorn factor. If you have never seen a HG Lewis movie, I recommend you try "Blood Feast" first, instead you will have a much better time. <br /> <br />
