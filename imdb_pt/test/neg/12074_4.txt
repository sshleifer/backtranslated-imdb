This film follows the life of a great guitarist, who wants to become great, but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I was expecting Woody Allen's usual witty dialogues, sarcasm and humor, but "Sweet and Lowdown" could not provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible, and hurt man. He is so unpleasant that I do not want it now on him, nor do I care about him. I wonder why a movie about it has to be done. The pace of the story is slow, making the movie a terrible hassle. Even the great acting of Sean Penn does not revive the film to an assist level. <br /> <br /> I really like Woody Allen's films, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
