Childish plot ripped from a Hollywood movie, a terrible performance, a tacky dialogue, and not much of a sex scene. That's right another great softcore parody! I really liked this movie! Of course the acting is terrible, but this part of the fun! The plot is ridiculous, but some things should be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around the sex scenes of girls. And because it's just softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a bit bland. But it's as if the great softcore god Russ Meyers has said "who really cares about what lies below the waist". I do not know if I would agree with Mr. Meyers on this, but damn it ... the movie entertained me for an hour and a half. I would give a C +, would have been a solid B if they could pitch more of the girls to resemble Russ Meyers actresses. VaVoom! VaVoom! ~
