An elite American military team that, of course, includes two good-looking women and a guy who can not understand teamwork, many batons, some terrorists, and a Spetznaz team that acts like a gang that can not fire directly. all thrown together in a confused plot with mediocre acting. This has nothing much to it. The characters are not convincing. Even the scenery, which has great possibilities, seems somewhat out of the middle of rural Pennsylvania, and not an exotic boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Bats have a really ferocious appearance. Can they even catch a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpies?) Or cut off an arm. You see the force of the Delta surrounded by hundreds of bats with one face firing with assault rifles and pistols at them and the bat falling to the ground. It would be like trying to shoot the shot with a rifle at a distance of 3 feet. Totally clueless. The dialogue is rancidly unrealistic, with jokes of boys / girls and flirtations among tense parts of the mission. One of the team members is blown up by a mine and the first on the scene just looks sadly at his body, stunned, without even bothering to protect or protect the area. In fact, after the rest of the group appears, he talks about how the area is laid out as a minefield - thanks for the heads-up bub. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well in a low budget outpost. Harvesting is not the movie you want to see. Actually, I think I'll give two instead of three if I can make it in the second half. It seems unlikely right now.
