I only saw the episode of the minimum wage still have no intention of watching others, how can this be? Morgan begins to complain theatrically about his terrible situation living with minimum wage at the beginning of the episode and the complaint never stops. Ever. Luckily for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). <br /> <br /> And to complete, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2.50. and after that go to a restaurant eating out the whole time they naturally * drumroll * complain about being poor. <br /> <br /> I do not care if the other episodes may or may not be better than that. No one should be forced to watch this crap.
