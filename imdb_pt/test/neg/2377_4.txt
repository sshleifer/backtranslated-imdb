This movie is a perfect example of what a movie can not be successful with only a high budget. Of course there was a lot of time and effort dedicated to this: the animation is fluid, detailed and superb - the soundtrack is not very memorable, except for Celine Dion's final song (at least I think it was her). The musical score is a powerful full orchestra material. Lots of compliments to animators and songwriters! 9/10 However, the story and the characters fall. It seems very 'been there, done that', predictable and uninteresting. The characters have distinct personalities, but nothing very pleasant. They bothered me endlessly. I struggled to like this, but I did not care about the story - it was a cliché plan of action and adventure. There were 'jokes' that were not funny. It was induction of predictable vomiting from start to finish. The dialogue was cliché and horrible - especially the last sentence "It's not ... it gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it was, I remember shrinking. I was longing for him to hurry up and finish. I was not the only one myself - the people I passed with thought it was boring. Please watch the Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra movie if you are watching some. That was a waste of time.
