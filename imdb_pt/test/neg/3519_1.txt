I recently watched this movie because I'm a big Kinski fan. But my god. Do not misunderstand me. I love that guy. But in this movie all his acting is simply a refusal to work! But luckily he is not the only one to blame. First of all, the whole plot is totally weak, dealing with an armed man looking for a killer, while Kinski is arrested for a crime he did not commit. That is all. All the dialogues and characters are so bad that you keep yelling. But maybe it's the fun of it all. If you know the Kinski-Biography, it is obvious that Kinski did not care about these films. Especially all his Italian-Western roles. He just took the money and that's it. again, this whole movie is totally weird. Only for hardcore fans of the genre.
