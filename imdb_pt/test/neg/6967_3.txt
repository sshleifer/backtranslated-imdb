As many know, this is the movie premiere of Edward D. Wood Jr. as a writer / producer / director / actor. I've been a fan of Ed Wood for several years. Although I do not like it that much about some of his other films, it was probably the greatest insight that cinematography goes public throughout his life. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This movie is about sex change and how being a transvestite can create conflicts in relationships with loved ones. This movie is way ahead of its time to deal with this subject and how it handles this. However, the film still contains the usual pitfalls of bad dialogue, nonsensical images, and weird Wood special effects. Shoot Bela Lugosi's usual overdose and you'll get Wood's first attempt at being a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a police inspector goes to the doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems along these lines. The doctor tells the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but can not talk about her secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan, who suffers a sex change because he is better suited to be a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of commentary on what's going on (Lugosi's part is not well-defined and proves to be a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi to get some cash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In all, the film shows the marks of Wood's career. <br /> <br /> It was obviously filmed on a very low budget and has a few things thrown in. It definitely feels like "it's so bad, it's good." However, I have to applaud Ed in his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestism and sexual changes were not overly open subjects in the early 1950s. Wood took a big risk in making a movie that depicts transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and that put a more human face on transvestism.
