I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say that I was disappointed with this first sequence would be a euphemism. <br /> <br /> The problems are many. <br /> Although the film may look bright, there are many mistakes on the screen for everyone to see, wires, cameras etc., something I find completely unacceptable to someone in Irvin Kreshner's pedigree. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here. A real disappointment when one considers that his "soul" returned to the end of the first film. Here his attitude shows no human side and makes it difficult to sympathize with him. <br /> <br /> Caine is a poor villain. Okay, I know Boddiker from the first film was better than average, mostly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but the generally solid Tom Noonan creates a character you could not care less about in one way or another. <br /> /> What happened to the Old Man ???? I appreciate that he has not gotten to where he's being "cool", but the change in his character here is nothing less than stupefying. In the first film, it was clear that he despises the tactics and attitudes of Dick Jone and yet here he is no better than Jones. Does not make sense. Doctor Faxx is a poor substitute for Bob Morton's charismatic, if unpleasant, resident genius. <br /> <br /> The action sequences, save the sequence in which Murphy is stuck next to Caine's truck, are tough and unpleasant and repel rather than entertain. <br /> <br /> And finally. What's with the music score? Do not tell me that Poledouris could not have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time. A series of soundtracks (TV or film) is part of his personality. Part of your character. When you remove it, this undermines the familiarity of the characters we are watching. So bad enough, but it's a shame for Leonard Rosenman. Your punctuation here is shocking, camping and simply spoiling dignified. <br /> <br /> History has its moments to be fair. There's a lot of originality here. But he tries many new things to absorb with a movie. Hob is a well-rounded villain and the only "villain" really dissonant in the move, Thumbs up to Gabriel Damon there. <br /> <br /> The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <BR> <BR> But, for the vast majority of its overtime, this is a big disappointment.
