Let me first say that in the past I am a big fan of carlin. I think George is one of the smartest and best comedians on the planet. What made George so great in the past was his ability to see things in his own distorted way, and give us his unique perspective on these things. it was not always meant to be funny, but you always respected their opinions because they were presented so cleverly. but you're all sick is just a long outburst. it does not give us any single perspective on anything, it just gives us a long list of things that it is p.o. there is no insight, cunning, just an old man who complains for an hour about things we all claim. and on top of that, it was not even funny. all of you are sick, you attract stupid people who can not handle anything more advanced than something simple and straightforward. I do not care about the comedy driven by anger, but george could have done a lot better. I really hope the upcoming George Carlin show will live up to the quality George has shown in the past.
