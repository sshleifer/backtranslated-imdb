This is probably Wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he played a leading role. It's unbelievably bad. The editing is especially horrible; it really seems like the publisher (if there was one) literally took pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together. The opening has to be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have cringed every time he was mentioned! I know there are "B" movies - but are there "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say this as a devoted fan of Jehovah's Witnesses.
