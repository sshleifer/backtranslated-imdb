Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. His acting as a supposed beach boy Duke Slusarski will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a nerd who has just hit the beach hoping to honor the dreams of his dead brother. What he gets is lame surfing hijinks. Guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surfing documentaries with the whole of Los Angeles on a Friday night. Duke takes the nerd and tries to teach him how to play volleyball is like touching a woman. The next time my wife talks back, I'm going to pretend I'm nailing the ball. <br /> <br /> Back to Seymour Cassel. The ending of the film turns into a good drama, since the first half of the movie really did not make sense. Duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball, the best he has played in over ten years. The way the scene is filmed is beautiful. You can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach. Those five minutes will end up as one of my all time favorites. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was lame.
