Words can not describe how assinina, juvenile, and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is. It is based on 3 things: 1. Constant 80s pop culture references 2. the tired "stretch a joke to the point of embarrassment" bit, and 3. at least 3 or 4 nonsense flashbacks per episode. The only reason I can see for this crap festival is as popular as it is to the constant pop culture references I suppose to provoke a "OMG LOL THIS OF SUPERFRIENDS !! THAT IS SO TOTALLY IRONIC, AND I AM SO EDGY AND SMART TO STAY THIS !! " response from the viewer. Writing is more than lazy and favors viewers, especially in their 20s and 30s. In addition, there is the character design, which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn repeatedly, but with different skin colors and maybe a different thread occasionally. Insulting crap.
