Rebecca De Mornay may be a beautiful actress fascinating, but as for the parts she has to play, if you can not say something good ... <br /> <br /> De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly bear now that she is an adult and has become, of course, brilliant. She has an affair with Banderas, whom we suspect to be (alas! As original!) A serial killer. Sometimes she remembers Banderas' mother. -in-law character of Tippi Hedren in "Marnie". But I would not count on this: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him. Here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected ending, but this ending is so absurd that it is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes the obligatory "conversations with a serial killer" in the tradition of "the silence of the lamb", murders (humans and cats), divided personality and open end if the crowds need more. Apparently not, and they were right.
