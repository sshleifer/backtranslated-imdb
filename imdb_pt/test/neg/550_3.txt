The last part of the Karate Kid series is predictable, poorly represented and so bad that it borders on pleasure. But not completely, it's just bad. In this part, Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is missing, having already been in many of the episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Miyogi's WWII friends. Her parents died recently and her grandmother is trying, unsuccessfully, to create this young hell. In stages Mr. Miyogi to get things right. True to the formula, there is a group of neo-fascist bullies, called alpha soldiers who must be put in their place and a new karate movement, called Praying Mantis. As I said before, this movie is a mess and should be avoided.
