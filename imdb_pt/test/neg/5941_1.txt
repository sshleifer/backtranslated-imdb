I loved this movie! It is the best parody of Russian cinema to this day. Who else, besides Sokurov, could satirize Tarkovsky so brilliantly. Did you think "Stalker" was slow? Well, go to the plate. "Mat i Syn" makes "Stalker" look like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". No way you should miss this movie! There are no excuses - even if you live a hectic life, you can still make the most of this movie by pressing the forward button on your VCR. Sokurov gave us the first feature that can be enjoyed in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I suppose the next great masterpiece of form will come when someone has the vision and the courage to display a movie that consists of no sound or image at all - 45 minutes of a black and silent screen was no longer explored in "In The Soup"?). <br /> <br /> Apparently, the filmmaker (and the fans) have forgotten that "movement" is the first word of "movie". <br /> <br /> !!! SPOILERS MAJOR TO THE FRONT !!! <br /> <br /> Want to reach the heights of genius that this movie achieved? Here is a step-by-step guide: 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some subjects and an adequately picturesque landscape (think of Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, watch some luxury car or perfume sales. <br /> <br /> 3. Photograph about 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop the results to play with saturation, blur and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now just get your camera, shoot 40 of the best pictures and make your "actors" mutter your speech off the screen. Do not worry about writing before - just let the actors say whatever they want (phrases like "do you want a drink?" And "let's eat something" are really all you need to fill 8 minutes or more). If you can not think of enough dialogue - no problem! Just ask them to repeat what they say a few times. If that still is not enough, let the camera work anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! Static images will compress into nothing with standard mpeg encoding - a 73-minute movie would probably have about 2 to 3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.
