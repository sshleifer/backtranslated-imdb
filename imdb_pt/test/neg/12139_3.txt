Let me be clear. I hate this kind of movie. I do not like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeois English. I find this kind of literature and film very pretentious. You will never make me read a Jane Austen book willingly. That said, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and watched the next film was for a class. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful Englishwoman living in a villa lent in Florence. before World War II. One evening, after dining with some of her wealthy royalty-related friends, she willingly catches an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and leaves him, and then he kills himself. As the movie goes further and further, you really do not like Mary. <br /> <br /> What a crap that movie was. First of all, there were many subplots and characters invented in the movie that were not even in the book. I very much doubt that the late Mr. Maugham appreciated them. The characters, though rich, were some of the most superficial and egocentric people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave no less than three stars was because acting was the only thing redeemable. The always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for the role of Mary. In fact, I could not imagine anyone else filling their shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also had supporting roles, which were as good as the leader. <br /> <br /> Save the pain from watching this movie.
