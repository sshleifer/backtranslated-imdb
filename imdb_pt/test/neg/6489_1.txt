the real plot ... <br /> <br /> A group of post-Civil War prostitutes look for alternative housing in FORT BOOM. Lacy Everett and a close family of program girls have been eating sausages for days and planning to move to the former Fort McMillian. Residents warn women to eat more dated sausage. Because there is a cruel piromaniac loose in the area and he refuses to take them to the property. When they finally reach their destination, they discover that their stomach is full of gas after all the bad sausage. It does not take long for them to know why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
