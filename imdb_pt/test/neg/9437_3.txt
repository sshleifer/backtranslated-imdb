This has to be considered one of the most shocking TV shows in a long time. <br /> <br /> Jose Ferrer played the title character, Nemo. He did the part justice and certainly looked like the part. But nowadays, it seems to me that the Nemo he invented was more than a passing resemblance to Captain Bird's Eye of the TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. <br /> <br /> Your enemy, Professor Cunningham, was brilliantly surpassed by Burgess Meredith. He never seemed to get over his "Penguin" days of Batman. Although he does not make his penguin "charlatan" here, he is unparalleled as the manic teacher. Only John Colicos, famous for Battlestar Galactica, chewed the scene better as a maniac despot. <br /> <br /> I never remember the grudge between Nemo and Cunningham, but it must have been severe, since Prof. I've never missed a chance to try to destroy Nemo, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The effects were nothing special, although the submarine of Prof. Cunningham was much better than Nemo's. It also had a crew of strange fishlike amphibians who served Cunningham and made all their requests. <br /> <br /> However, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was Prof. Cunningham. The Delta Beam! He was always saying "Fire Delta Beam!", After which a grumpy crewman would hesitate to ignore the movement of firing the gun using a shrug. Truly priceless! They do not do it like that anymore, and maybe as well. But like other series of this era, for those who remember, it will always have an affectionate place, if cheddar-covered, in our hearts.
