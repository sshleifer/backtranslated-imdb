I do not know of any idiot rock'n'roll clich√© not used in this movie. Ouffcourz, rock signing up life is just sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to walk you. Tell that to stupid young men. The filmmakers seemed to have read a lot of Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories. I've seen the everyday life of the usual rock band and there's nothing to do with the reality in this movie. If you are successful enough, your life is on tour tour. That means you're mostly on a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be cool, sober and clean at night. After living you have a little time to unload your excitement on stage. So you have a little time to have fun. But it's no luxury or dream. Artistically this movie was zero. Stupid characters and idiot dialogues. The ending of the movie was funny - the main character left the heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yes, that's moral. Real from the 90s
