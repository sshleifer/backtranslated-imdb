I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was possibly one of the most boring and boring movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. First of all, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor, and ruined most of the film, moreover, the plot is simply too silly. The only reason for a check in for this movie was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was eliminated very quickly. Unless you're a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you probably should avoid this movie like the plague. Many people can not praise this movie enough, but I just can not figure out what people find so fantastic about it. If it's supposed to be the dark humor that makes this movie so fantastic, then I think anything can happen to comedy these days.
