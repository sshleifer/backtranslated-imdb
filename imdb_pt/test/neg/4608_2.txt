I would have given this movie a 1, but I laughed so much, so many times, that I had to give a little credit, on the chance the film was supposedly funny. A movie so bad you'll think the chimpanzees wrote it. You'll wish the chimpanzees wrote it down. Dialogue so canned that only he and the cockroaches will survive the approaching nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by intercepting scenes from the original Carrie (a really good film) in scenes from this film. How to interconnect scenes of Taxi Driver in Baby Geniuses. Do not rent alone because you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone close to you to confirm the wickedness of what you are seeing. Millenium's worst actress goes to poor poor Amy Irving as the monotonous, disastrously wooden-faced schoolteacher. Worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3
