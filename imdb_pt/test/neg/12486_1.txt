I'm a big fan of Zack Allan and I was disappointed he only had one scene in the movie. This was also my favorite scene, where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs it to Down Below. Unfortunately, unlike the Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action occurred out of season. I did not care much about Garibaldi after the first three seasons and I think Sheridan is fine, but not Sinclair. I like Lochley, but she only had limited screen time. If you like crusade or space battles you should have fun. Personally, I can only give 1/10.
