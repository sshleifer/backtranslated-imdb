I found this a tremendously disappointing version of a lovely story. I thought the performance was generally very good. Reginald Owen chewed the stage, as mentioned by others, but I found him moderately entertaining in his brief scenes. TCM made me a fan of Ann Harding and I thought she was fine, as usual, here. Jessie Ralph had a field day like the old battle ax, ordering everyone, and Frank Morgan, as always, made Frank Morgan with a glow. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was the script and / or editing. - the transitions were clumsy, the motives were obscure. The movie was too short to convey the story properly! I felt completely disappointed, particularly since I had so many memories of the later version.
