I can not believe I really sat through this movie. A friend rented the jacket because it sounded good. In his defense, the jacket was correct; there was a haunted room that someone slept through at night. From the jacket, it looked like he was on par with Freddy, Jason, or maybe "The Shining." It could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surrealist movies, you may like it. Whether you're looking for a good scare movie, or a couple of thrills, go rent Jason vs. Freddy IV - you'll have a much better night.
