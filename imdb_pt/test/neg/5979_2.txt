About 5 minutes into the movie you are played in this cat and mouse romance brutally tepid between the two main characters and only gets worse from there. The biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are. That's what 50-year-old producers and Hollywood out-of-the-box writers think of as a stoner's life is as if they give some pot to the cast of Friends. Bland, boring, boring and completely unrealistic. I despise this movie.
