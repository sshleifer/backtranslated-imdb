I knew it was for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice mispronounced the word "scarecrow" (sounded like Scare Crew). And for sure 90 minutes later, after witnessing beyond horrendous acts, tedious drama, punches of scarecrows going away from his target, but "beating" anyway, Ken Shamrock "acting", and the most stupid illogical ending, I saw in my life (Ok, no, I'll take that last one back in about a week). After going through all of this, I openly fought that I could not just go up to Lacuna to the Jim Carrey and just erase it completely from my mind. Any thoughts I may have had that director Brian Katkin could have made an OK movie, given the right circumstances I had after watching "Slaughter Studios", are totally and completely out of my mind now. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert go topless <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: Starz on Demand (available until 22 of September of 2005)
