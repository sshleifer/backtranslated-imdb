A sf / horror mischievous enterprise that takes itself very seriously, memorable only for (a) the beautiful Mathilda May wandering bare by chaos and (b) miscellaneous terrible. It has some slightly creepy effects and surprising moments, and some funny unintentional scenes, but it's mostly a waste of time.
