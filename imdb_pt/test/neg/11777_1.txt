I watched this piece ONDEMAND because the description was kind of weird. This movie smells like cocaine, only the opening scene must have cost at least five figures on film. This is a piece of racist and homophobic trash that crawls for a good 1 hour and 22 minutes with absolutely no direction. I'm a bit confused as to how this has good reviews here. I will not bother telling the plot because, as far as I know, there is no plot. I'm sure everyone appeared on the set every day made giant lines, dressed the Loretta Switt in deep necklines to show as many breasts as possible and screamed action; let the cast improvise in a frenzy of cocaine. Much like real beer, this movie almost made my liver fail halfway. Save your money and watch 'Strange Brew' instead.
