I went to see "give up" with high hopes, because the director's "shower" impressed me so much. Despite some lapses of dissatisfaction, "Shower" is at the top of my list of all-time favorite films for his pervasive insight into family relationships and his generally superb acting and direction. And I've seen it at least three times now. <br /> <br /> But "giving up" fell in my opinion. It seemed like a useless exercise and I was so tired of the unbearable personality of the main character who craved the end of the movie. I admit to falling asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still okay to write that comment. <br /> <br /> I took in the parents and the sister. The device to use all the real characters in the movie is a good one I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Deception aside, I will still make an effort to see any film that has the name of Yang Zhang, simply the basis of the beautiful "shower".
