Bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad that it's funnier. The "plot" is about an American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he is called a "military adviser", but it is unclear whether he is in the US Army or not), helping the parents. guerrillas who end up joining the guerrillas when the government turns against him, imprisons him and torture him. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment salesperson" that he picks up at a bar that gets caught up in all the intrigues. That description really makes the movie sound better than it is, because it really is a stench of almost biblical proportions. How bad is it? Well, Shannon Tweed transforms into the most professional acting work of the film. If this is not an indication of what a second-class piece of junk is, nothing is of sound effects incompatible with a score that sounds like it was a 1940 horror movie with the letter "Z" (and it may well be) for the same footage (that is, armored vehicles following the same trail in the jungle) constantly reused in some of the most inappropriately memorable action scenes in recent memory, this cheating party laughed a minute has to be seen as uncredited. Tweed looks bored, it looks like Brown is hung over, and when this thing is over - if you can last that long; I could not - you'll know exactly how they feel. <br /> <br /> Although there are many explosions and shootings, this can not be considered an image of "action" by any stretch of the imagination. . It is annoying (there is a scene in the back of a truck where everyone looks at each other for three or four minutes), repetitive (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" being killed repeatedly), illogical (when a group of rebels are captured in an open field by a government helicopter, instead of running away to just stare at him), inept (soldiers and rebels falling "dead" when they do not hear gunfire, a shootout inside a house where fighters stand against walls (when the "Governor" says he offers a reward for Brown's capture because "someone" can deliver it, you know exactly who that "someone" will be, and turns out to be exactly who you are I thought it was) and just stupid (pretty much everything in the picture). Inept, brainless and stupid beyond belief. Do not waste your time.
