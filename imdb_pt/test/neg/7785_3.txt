I hate a movie that has no end. I do not care how good or bad the rest may be, I do not like to go without a conclusion. Such programs should insist on a warning ... something like: The movie you are about to watch has no end or is so ambiguous as to be inconclusive. <br /> <br /> In the movie, the last scene we're left with Dee and Dominic having a little fight and he says, almost with regret that I thought, that it could not be him because the fingers were either a girl or of a child. THEN IT COMES! Well, the smoking gun, so to speak, is in the hands of Dee's son, but what about Dominic's daughter? I really thought we might find out it was her! Anyway, unless you like inconclusive movies, I would avoid that one. Otherwise, I found the film generally good.
