Yah I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented it thinking it was a movie I missed in theaters. It is not. It's some junk "movie" made by the Showtime staff (cable station). Wow, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make any trash movie they want! It is not good. I'm as Sinatra's fan as any sensible man, but this movie was just plain dumb. Boring. Chest. Unfunny. Uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that (assuming they adhere to the facts) you learn about what happened to Frank Jr.'s captors otherwise it's just a stupid movie.
