If you like poor SE, (some) poor performance and total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. So a really cheap movie, but I enjoyed it anyway. Because? Because I like this kind of movie. I can not help but smile when I see these kind of movies ....... What were the producers, actors, director and the SE people thinking when they made this movie? Do not expect an "Abyss" or "Alien", just a horror movie / adventure (very) low budget. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful "splatter" moment when a guy's head is shot, but for the most, the horror is very tame. The final monster is pretty cool too. <br /> <br /> It's only 73 minutes, so you can not go wrong there. Maybe you can pick it up at your local videostore or watch it on TV. I'm sure you'll have fun watching. <br /> <br /> But do not say you were not warned .............
