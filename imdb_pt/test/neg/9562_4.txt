The reality of the Mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog, where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a passive. I have no problem with the human side of the gansters being portrayed, but Bugsy drives very far towards gentle and comical men. The film is entertaining, but it is only light entertainment and not a biographical film of a man who, while exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and the direction is very solid. The places and the season are very well represented and the themes are very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
