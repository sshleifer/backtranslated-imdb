"It's supposed to have good reviews," says the g / f. If so, I can not find them. She goes to sleep and I can handle it. Michael Douglas like a good old boy - now there's a new one. Matt Dillon screwed up. John Goodman losing his temper. Paul Reiser running leather BDSM. Oh, it's a riot, all right. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you will probably lose interest soon. Liv Tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain that she may not have the record on her part. But it's irrelevant: this movie is not about character development. Actually, I'd say there's no character at all. What you should enjoy here is the plot. <br /> <br /> No one is "bad" in this movie. Some people wonder why all these "stars" - Reba's, even here, for God's sake - are inscribed for such a tedious project. Odds are they thought it would be fun. Maybe they had fun. Who knows? Hey - maybe they got paid well too. <br /> <br /> But you have to spend money in one way or another to see that turkey. And that's probably not a good idea.
