*** Possible spoiler but probably not *** The game is called donkey kong, but donkey kong is no longer in it anymore! Diddy is gone too! <br /> <br /> The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two favorite games of all time. Super Nintendo. (The other being Super Mario World) <br /> <br /> The second Donkey Kong at least had diddy kong and good levels, although it looked more like a pirate-based game sometimes. <br /> <br /> However, this is the worst of the lot! It does not have the feel of the original or the second, the enemy seems stupid and the levels are even worse. Does not look more realistic! I did not like his game unlike the last two, the first had great background music and the second was not bad, but the music in this game is horrible! <br /> <br /> It happens a lot nowadays that movies, shows and sometimes <br /> <br /> video games that start fantastic, end up being ruined by <br /> <br /> an idiot sequel! I'm sad to say that I feel that kong ass like a saga is not so good <br /> <br /> Now that he has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They should have left in the original or maybe the second.
