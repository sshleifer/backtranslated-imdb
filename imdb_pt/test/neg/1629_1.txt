Even the MST3K could not make this drek painful, long and, finally, mind-boggling, funny or fun. Although most bad films are hilariously bad, this is one of those few videos that use the word bad in its literal sense. <br /> <br /> The element that makes it so painful to watch is not lack of history but the fact that SOOOO too deep is crammed into the first half hour which is absolutely ridiculous and harder to follow than one road while driving without headlights. <br /> <br /> The hero of the movie Actor is no more than a sweet eye for this literal energy sucker of a movie. Dressed in a matte and sporty cloth "pectorals like melons," as Joel put it, he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this just to die, and I mean stubborn cheese followers. If you have an enemy, recommend this movie to you. If you go through this, I recommend you. You should get through anything.
