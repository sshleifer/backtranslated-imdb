This movie is about people living in a trailerpark. later in the movie, it becomes obvious that these people are unemployed comedians, especially old men. well, more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f *** n. but there is never any action, only those people talking. At first, I thought it was cool and perverted, but after a while it got boring. I mean, how many versions can you think of saying f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? sure, this can be funny - for half an hour maybe, not 80 minutes. but it was funny to see these people trying to act. I'm sure they were often reading the text on some sheet while playing. but that does not upset the movie, it's cool that way. because these individuals seem so poor, cracked, boring that the style fits in completely. his reading of wood, helpless texts makes a very good atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters a little. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** later in the movie that f *** ers do some comedy shows (rhymes about f ***) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction advice and then they decide to defend the trailer park and get on their roofs - armed with some guns. so they were filmed. The fin sounds like action, but it is not. only some useless domestic cameras. *** SPOILER END *** But the film is totally consistent in its style and I'm sure that's exactly what the filmmaker wanted to have. is the portrait of those f ** k-ups in a homely groggy camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are good to watch. but the texts about - you know what - all the time get boring after a while. <br /> <br /> A very young director who also seems like an interesting person, since he played some teenage things in popular movies / TV series. but now has gone into more horror movies, which is more your cup of tea, I think. and this, his first effort of direction will be distributed now by the tromo. I do not know anything about a release, I have this as an "advanced screener" this year cannes that says "just for smuggling purposes".
