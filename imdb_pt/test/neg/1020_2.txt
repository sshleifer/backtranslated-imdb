He is the only reason to see this movie. He does a very good job - much better than this crap deserves. He is very handsome and very talented - he deserves more than that. It's also depressing to see Malcolm McDowell in that. He's another talented actor who deserves better, but like Esai, he does a great job. So if you are a fan of any of them, you may want to watch. Otherwise, stay away. One more complaint - could not we have more scenes of Esai shirtless?
