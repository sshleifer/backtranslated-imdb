I went to this movie with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of writing and acting and, unfortunately, my fears have been realized. This is a job without humor and I sat in the theater waiting for the wit and humor to start, I'm still waiting, it seems. Updating the plot to this day just did not work and changing the characters was an absolute farce - why they introduced Bette Midler's character when she disappeared as quickly as she arrived; the related character in the original 1939 was an integral part of the plot. The women in the movies laughed a few times, but nothing touched me as being funny, except for a phrase from Meg Ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that 'it's not like a 1930 movie' - I really wanted to I was watching the 1930 version. It was all very melodious that the "sisters keep together" and really needing some of the keen humor and intelligent dialogue of the original piece - I still watch the original film and pick up a line I never got before . There is no sense of closure for this new version, and although the 1939 film is politically incorrect by today's standards, every topic was tied and when the movie ended - he did it with force. This remake should be labeled with a warning for all viewers, if you know the original, do not bother: I felt cheated for losing part of my life in a movie theater watching this piece of memorable fluff. Bring the red jungle !!
