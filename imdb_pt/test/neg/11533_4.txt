The only reason some of the hundred users watched this movie was because they belonged to the crew, were friends of the crew, or were obsessive fans of Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the "Lance cult," so I was disappointed to see that, despite being the headliner, it's just in name. Playing with the rich Newcastle, Lance is a joy to watch, but all his screen time is relegated to the beginning of the film. Newcastle establishes a 747 assault which includes Ketchum (Lamas) and a lot of forgettable characters. The biggest shock to this viewer was that the pre-heist scenes were not that bad. With the exception of a somewhat unfriendly and somewhat confused looking Aviva Gale, who times each line with the finesse of a theater actress, acting was decent around, and none of the lines really made me cringe. <br /> <br /> But once the assault occurs, the movie falls asleep. It's not just your plan the most ridiculous thing ever captured in the movie, but it's dragged on for a long time. This is not a very deep movie, and you have to fill your 90 minutes, but those scenes are so annoying that I almost dozed off at two in the afternoon. One particular sequence in which we watch each of the characters perform the same task several times is especially difficult to pass. The name of the movie is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from quick - it's excessive and bloated to extremes. Maybe it would have worked if any of the characters had real personalities, but come on, there's so much you can do from a Direct Showtime Extreme movie. Well, it's a lot of laughter, intentional and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is apparently a master of disguise, which results in some incredibly bizarre scenarios), and Lance returns at the end of the film, albeit for a short time. It's a bad movie, and I probably did not have to tell it to you, but it's far from the worst thing I've ever seen. I would not put that much on top of Henriksen's movie list, since it has some real gems with longer screen time, and anyway the movie loses a lot of energy when the robbery begins, but the best thing I can say is Rapid Exchange is that the last two movies that I watched before were the mainstream Hostage and the Overrated, pretentious Crash - and that was better than both.
