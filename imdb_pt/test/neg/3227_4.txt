Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong again in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are newly formed and have gone to Cape Cod to stay at Goldthwait's grandmother during the summer. Along the way, they find Demi Moore being chased by John Matuszak and a gang of motorcyclists. Soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being transformed into another lobster restaurant by a spoiled family who considers a dirty word "work". The film contains several funny vignettes such as the million dollar dollar radio jury jokes and Godzilla's satire. Like Holland's first film, Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds immensely to the film. Otherwise, this is a failure of a movie full of invented situations and idiot (as opposed to peculiar) characters. Moore still sings some bars in a nightclub with some horrible synths. Goldthwait's claws wear out after a while, and Armstrong has never been an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except Class Z. The twins of the tow truck are extremely annoying and unpleasant, rather than the loving ones they obviously should be. This is more a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy that could have used a better script and direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
