This movie seems to have done it for the sole purpose of annoying me. Everything I hate in movies is present: false sentimentality, extreme extravagance, bad children actors and more feature in abundance. This is to ignore the fact that it represents the extreme ignorance of American sports fans with many of the cast professing that a soccer ball is shaped like a lemon. What?! This is a rugby ball. The story follows a group of fans who get a new teacher they like (who, coincidentally, teaches the class with a short skirt) and leaves them interested in football. Of course, they are all rubbish (do not forget, they are not hopes) except for one kid who moved out of El Paso. Blah Blah, etc etc and the kids still do not become good football players, but the good heart goes on and the hopers are not turned into a bunch of well rounded kids. Hell, even the adults begin to approach; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are left out ... groan. <br /> <br /> This movie is starring Steve Guttenberg. Now, before rushing off to get a copy of your local music store, wait a minute. Guttenberg sucks. No, no; Come on, let's face it, how did this guy come to be in a movie? I have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea. Olivia d'Abo stars next to Steve and also does not impress. She just seems to be going through the motions and looks pretty as she does this. Although I have no problems with the latter part; his performance does not credit the movie. The junior actors who make up the rest of the cast are as bad as you'd expect from a movie like that. Most of them are disgusting and / or annoying and do not provide a pleasant sight. There is a goat in the movie that plays the mascot and it does a good job; but you would not see a movie for a goat, so do not bother watching this movie.
