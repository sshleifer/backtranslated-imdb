I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I met the other guy from his role as "Big Brain on" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But I just did not care about the characters. Kevin Spacey is a jerk all through the movie and even figure out some horrible things that happened to him, I did not like him. Especially the ending --- this made me hate it even more. This was like watching a bad car accident. Spacey played a dick well (he does okay), but besides that, I do not recommend it.
