What happened to Mathew Modine's career ??? I still remember when he was considered an A list actor ... <br /> <br /> Was the cruel island the final nail in the coffin of a promising career? wow, this guy really should hate the insides of Renny Harlin ... <br /> <br /> This movie wants very much to be a comedy, but it can not laugh, the characters are caricatures and the badly drawn are ... more still, what bothers me the most is watching Mr. Modine take on this kind of role, alongside actors so far removed from his caliber, I mean, by the time he was making films like BIRDIE, he could never have had worse Nightmares. He imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a country man sucking a cow that had only his anus clipped, and perhaps the worst, next to Elizabeth Berkley !!!
