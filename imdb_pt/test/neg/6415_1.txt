This film does not respect the time of the viewer. It takes a 15 minute story and stretches for 95 minutes. To achieve this, they have to use a very slow narration and make everyone run with some frantic, implausible anguish. At the time this movie showed something interesting in the plot, I just did not care. The problem is not in acting but in rhythm. The story is only weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject mild humor into a serious role are out of place. His humor style is not generic, so it appears as a diluted version of himself. The number 23 causes a lot of sadness and frustration for the people in history, but the rationale for this is never logical. At most, it's just a little interesting. Jim Carrey has far more skill in a serious role than this movie reveals. Do not waste your money watching this in the theater. Rent this movie if you have trouble sleeping. If you're still wide awake after 10 minutes then you liked it more than I did. I also did not like the lighting and the artistic aspects of the film. A lot of passive visual eye drops were thrown at the viewer with illumination or effects and little contributed to improving the already weak history.
