When "Deranged" was made, the filmmakers decided to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb, although the resulting film was actually very close to the facts of the notorious case. I presume enough was fictionalized that they thought they should change names and such. "Ed Gein - The Plainfield Butcher" disguises itself as a true story recounting the Gein affair, but actually has very little resemblance to the story. As a biopic type movie is a scam. If ever a movie needed changing names, this is much more than "Deranged". It's as close to the true crime story as "Dirty Harry" was the true story of the Zodiac's murders. <br /> <br /> OK, so this boredom aside, how is a horror movie? Well, like a horror movie, well, like a movie in general, it's pretty scary. One of the worst movies I've been through in months. Questions work like this: 1) Kane Hodder is surprisingly miscast like Ed Gein. Totally inadequate in the part, Hodder just enters menacingly. Too bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the cast is quite "amateur dramatic" and totally disinterested. It is painful to witness some lines being delivered. <br /> <br /> 3) The occasional efforts of elegant filmmaking seem to come from "The Great Book of Moody Cinematography Clich√©". You've seen everything before, best run. In addition to the stylistic efforts, the rest of the film production is inept: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are useless shots that slow the pace ... which leads me to ... <br /> /> 4) It seems to continue to ever. It is less than 90 minutes long, but sitting is an ordeal. You'd swear you ran for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> 5) Ed Gein almost seems secondary. Mostly the film is concerned about the family affairs of a newly promoted deputy sheriff. Said Deputy is played by an abysmal actor whose shoulders no film should rest. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this? Well, the FX gore is very good. Some convincing wounds are on display and the makeup is usually excellent. None of this, however, compensates for the massive failures of the film. <br /> <br /> It does not even have a kitsch value, it's bad; is not pleasantly bad, not "so bad it's good", just genuinely bad. A film to avoid and despise.
