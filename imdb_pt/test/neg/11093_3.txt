With all the potential for a good movie in its beautiful settings, casting and cinematography, the lackluster script, the heavy rhythm and the wood presentations produced only one big disappointment. With decent direction, editing and musical score, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a somber version of Blake Edward's '10', rather than a tearful version of Ron Howard's 'Splash'.
