This movie took three hours, including commercials, on the History International Channel last night. But it seemed like three weeks. It was not the cheap, theatrical, and unintentionally funny depictions of the bombing of Dresden. It was not that the film was stripped of almost the entire context of World War II. It was not even that the bombing itself was meant to appear as nothing more than a great inconvenience to a silly love story. No, it was the characterless characterizations of wood that sucked the life out of history. Oh, and the fact that if it's possible for a movie to be obsequious, then Dresden is that movie. Perhaps a better title would have been DRESDEN - HOW URIAH HELLP would have experienced. <br /> <br /> It's especially the last point that bothers you. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The creators of this movie believe so. But in the typically emasculated way that the Germans came to approach World War II, they can not say this without criticizing "peace" and "no more wars - anywhere" as if they were Mother Teresa. And, also typical of German obsequiousness towards the British in particular, there is a relentless effort to crawl before "Britannism," while carrying all the "fault" for Dresden about a person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I tell a person? Well, not really. At the beginning of the film, there is an exclamation of the main character, Anna, whom we all supposedly sympathize with. "Damn Americans!" She screams, watching the distant bombs fall. And a few minutes later, a radio voice chants warnings about the "American terror bombing" being inflicted on the Germans. <br /> <br /> Note the word "terror". Got that? It really is the Americans behind the inhuman targeting of German civilians. It does not matter that the American strategy for almost the entire war in Europe has been the "precision" bombing of industrial and war factories. It does not matter that it was the British who enthusiastically embraced the area bombing of civilian targets in Germany - even before the Germans turned to the British. It does not matter that the Americans bombed during the day, suffering more casualties in the process than the British, in order to reach targets of precision, while the British bombarded civilians under the cover of the night. It did not matter that the Americans were essentially brought into the RAF's real terrorist bombing campaign, kicking and screaming at it. It does not matter that most of the American authorities, from FDR to Gen. Dolittle, opposed the targeting of civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait to do so. <br /> <br /> No, in DRESDEN, both the Germans and the British, except for "Bomber" Harris, are innocent of a doctrine, is insinuated, created by the evil Americans. And only the strength and power of a love story between a German nurse and a downed British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of atrocity. Right. Oh, by the way, for the younger and probably less-read readers of IMDb, the first and only great literary effort to give a pensive voice to the bombing of Dresden was the pacifist novel. written by Kurt Vonnegut - an American prisoner of war in Dresden at the time of the bombing. I think the ZDF from Germany could not find a pretty nurse for Billy Pilgrim.
