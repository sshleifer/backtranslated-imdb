Corny and some really bad acting, but for a Golan-Globus movie about right on par. I watched this movie in 1985, mainly because I liked sword and witchcraft movies (what was I thinking?). Arnold is playing with a great lord trying to ensure that an ancient talisman is destroyed before he blows up the world.Bigigitte Nielsen is the title character who at the time was Sly's girl and a very bad actress. Movie producers like to cast the type Playboy women who can not play in low budget B movies. Brigitte cheeses like Sonya and Arnold acts like Lord Kalidor. There's also Sandahl Bergman (who was in the original Conan movie as Valeria) here she plays the evil Queen Gedren, an obvious camp for her role in Conan. And then one of the most annoying children actors on the screen (ernie reyes) as Prince Tarn, who should have been slapped and sent to bed. That's a little annoying. Some of the sword fights are not too bad, but the music really sucks. Special effects are cheap and look like much 70's, like the blast of the queen's castle at the climax of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very low film, but movie movie fans might like it for their activity.
