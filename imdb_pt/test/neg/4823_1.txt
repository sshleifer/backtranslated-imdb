If this is classified as "real life" of London, then producers should be on different planets. <br /> <br /> It is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, gloomy and scummy of the TV. <br /> Everyone is fighting, everything has an unpleasant tone inside, nothing is done for genuine reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real photo of people in London or the UK, then this program is by far the furthest from reality. <br /> <br /> There is not a good word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a big fight over Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are totally unbelievable!
