The first movie I saw of these people was "Children of the Grave" and when I knew this was coming I thought it would be nice to watch mostly because Waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted. This documentary / movie was horrible! There were many false comments from producers, directors, cameras ... they needed to keep their faces out of the film. There are rumors that Waverly is haunted for a long time, but if anyone in doubt watches this movie, they will no doubt begin to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary. The paranormal test was horrible and almost non-existent. I've heard better EVPs from high school students with recorders in a bathroom! They tried hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not the stories, nor the blurred ones too dark to see videos, nor photos, nor recordings! Sons of the Tomb was also bad, but at least it had some substance and a bit of a creep factor. The only reason I'm giving a 3 is because the part of the show's history was very good and informative. Learning about how the hospital came about, the day-to-day and how it ended was the only thing that paid off in this crap for 2 hours.
