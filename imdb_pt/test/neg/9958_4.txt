Fortunately, you do not need a lot of "learning books" to understand where this thing is going ... Obviously, a poverty line makes money from Universal's great success, THE WOLF MAN (which was made only a year earlier). George Zucco in another of his roles of "crazy doctor" patented as the brilliant and vengeful scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who settled in the swampy lands of what I'm presuming to be the bayou of Louisiana, is plotting revenge against four of his former colleagues who humiliated him and forced him to relinquish his previous job. You see, they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with animal to create an unstoppable army of werewolf creatures that would be useful during the war. Fortunately, Cameron found the ideal test subject for his werewolf injections - a clumsy, childish jerk named Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is quite ignorant about what is happening, does not ask too many questions and lets the doctor tie him to a table and shoot him with whatever happens in his syringe. This results in a time lapse change from the man turning into a werewolf. Cameron lets you out of the mansion using a secret passageway, so you basically get a big guy (Strange was 1.85 m) dressed in overalls with a thick beard, hairy paws and a set of big plastic teeth, running around after a witness sees the beast and a girl is killed, the villagers take their rifles and organize a pack to hunt them Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and also has a useful antidote to reverse the effect, also drags Petro to the big city to try to track down the teachers who mocked their original theories and destroyed their reputation in the process. Also hanging around the house are Cameron's daughter, Lenora (Anne Nagel) as well as Lenora's nosy reporter boyfriend Tom (Johnny Downs) whose first inclination is that they are dealing with a prehistoric standing upright creature (!) Although a typically horny movie from the People's Republic of China in many ways, with unimpressive ensembles, cinematography in Ake-ups, as well as a rather bland support cast, remains viewable thanks to histrionics from the star George Zucco. I have no idea why Downs received the highest billing; he appears half an hour and really does not have much to do, nor is it so impressive to do so. This is Zucco's show and he's great and delirious, talking on his own as a fantasy who's talking to his peers ("I'm not interested in your foolish rumors!") And temporarily stepping in and out of sanity. Strange seems to have shaped his performance as the stinking, sloppy hick of the semi-retarded in all the work of Lon Chaney Jr., as Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN, to his performance as WOLF MAN. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a good job playing with each other. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him a "guinea pig" in front of a colleague, while Petro just stands there smiling and staring at a doorknob. Some of the hazy marsh scenes are also quite atmospheric.
