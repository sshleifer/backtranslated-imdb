There is a fine line between being theatrical and simply being forced. Forced performance. Forced plots Forced plots. Even forced photography. There are people who say "the movie develops this way because it's from Asia," but I do not see any kind of forced elements in Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a fine line between being fiction (and every work of art is actually fiction) and just being unlikely. In a more personal way, I just do not feel anything about the movie, it does not take me anywhere, and I just can not believe the fictional world that is proposed. It just does not feel right, has something in it or just does not click.
