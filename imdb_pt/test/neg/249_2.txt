I'm a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all 100 background movies, and I do not deny that these are the worst things to get on the big screen, or even your home video for that matter . Some of them, e.g. the infamous Hands The Hands of Fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on their own, without friends and beer around, is a torture for a taste of cinema. <br /> <br /> The Aztec Mummy Against El Roboto Humano, however, was not so bad. Well, of course it's bad - it's silly, dated, tacky, cheap, etc., there's an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, and so on. the assembly is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, the FX and SFX are the best that low budget Mexican production could have offered, and so on. etc. Still, the movie is FUN. It's so bad it makes you laugh happily for an hour. Of course it depends on the sense of humor, but I'm sure that La Mumia should teach any newcomer to this type of cinema to enjoy it. Please note: the movie lasts about an hour, and I think it's just the silly time that one is able to digest easily. There is also something else - watching LaMiia can give you an idea of ​​what the whole genre concept of SF / Horror was in the fifties, when you compare it to the current era of cinema entertainment of the Matrix. I think this also shows how both the industry and the public have evolved, because watches like La Mumia still attract many cinemas to some special shows (movies like this are special), and they often get a standing ovation. .
