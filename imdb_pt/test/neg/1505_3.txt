OK the end of the story is - all the killings were a joke about the main character and no one is really dead. Yes, I know that Cry Wolf did it and did well, but that's not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Even though the "characters" apparently do not die, we see them stabbed to death (and other ways to be killed), even though these "deaths" DO NOT occur as anyone can see them. Mr. Director, if you're going to show people being killed, somebody needs to see, if they're off the camera and the character is killed it's just because it does not work - and by the end I liked some scenes but their end ruined the whole thing . <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (especially the child at the beginning who really thinks he fooled his friends into believing they were playing with the brains of their dead grandparents) the script is less than half cooked although if you're half cooked you might like the movie) the only reason I gave this movie to 3 is because a) they actually did something b) they were released and c) they filmed the movie Yeah, you read right, they wasted ( at least) $ 5,000 in movie stock for that crap. Sad, if they had filmed DV, they had some money for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director did something (as most do not) but HATWE the fact that he appears on the IMDFB talking about how "original" the film is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see, if a friend has it can be a funny movie to borrow.
