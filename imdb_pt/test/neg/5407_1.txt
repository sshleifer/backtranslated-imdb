This is up there like the worst movies of all time. No research or thought came into this movie. Action scenes were placed at random intervals, which did not make sense in the context of the film. Items appeared and disappeared randomly, etc. Obviously this was run by a "stunt coordinator" who was supposed to go back to his old job. The Skeleton Man rode a horse throughout the film, which surprisingly could change color at will. Either that, or someone thought the audience would be all colorblind and would not notice. The blood would be in the actors in one scene and the next, it would miraculously disappear and then reappear. It seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies.
