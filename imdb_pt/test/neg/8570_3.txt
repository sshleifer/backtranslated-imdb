The headline describes just that. This dribble of a movie was nothing more than the typical "group of teenagers accidentally killed someone now that someone is haunting / killing them 20 years later" crap that has been pushed through our throats for decades. The only twist is that instead of an ex-classmate or a lovable psycho / loser, she was a nun. Nun wants to eliminate the sin of the girls, blah, blah, the girls accidentally / purposely drown the nun, blah blah, nun haunts the girls, people die, the movie ends. The only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes, which were really cool (especially the one with the elevator door ripping out the arms of this fat lady), but even they could not make this a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this garbage. I'm sure I rented it and did not buy it, or I'd be furious beyond belief. If you want a nunsploitation movie to please the senses, go watch Demonia or something. Stay away from that garbage.
