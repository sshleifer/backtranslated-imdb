This movie has one or two slightly interesting jokes, but they are not worth waiting for. After an inexplicable discussion between two guys picking up trash at a drive-in cinema, we cut to a family coming out! Hollywood and driving by driving his camper van through the screen again and again, when futile dialogue is heard. At least I think it's futile, the terrible music that accompanies this montage is so mixed up that it makes the dialogue sometimes almost inaudible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the van arrives, at night, at a gas station where the family leaves, has another futile conversation, before leaving. The camera then moves to reveal the actor we just saw. He speaks straight to the camera and we realize that he is the director of the movie we're watching, that's about him, and how he came to make the movie. <br /> <br /> A good idea that ALMOST (but not completely) makes the previous sequences worthwhile. As the film unfolds, he finds the two characters we know from picking up trash at the beginning of the movie and they all form a movie film company. <br /> <br /> All sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy follow each other as they assemble a team and try to raise the money needed to start filming. <br /> <br /> This film was obviously mounted on a shoe string and a promise and there is a good idea here struggling to get out, but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost. Comedy is more than falling things and everyone is talking (or screaming) at one go. Both of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously - Robert Altman can do this kind of thing well because he has a script, essays, decent sound technicians and editing facilities. Everyone shouting for the only microphone that, it seems, was hidden in a garbage can in the next room, does not give clarity.
