The premise is interesting and the cast does the best it can, but the script and the directing effort are so bad that it is no surprise that this movie has been buried - which is appropriate given the script. While watching, I could not decide which was the worst, the script or the direction. The actors are at the top, the art direction looks like a Disney movie, the music is invented and the feeling is so sweet that it gives the viewers cavities. It is a bad attempt to imitate "Weddings and a Funeral". If anyone wants to watch comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how bad the direction can turn a story into sweetness cavity, this is a good one to watch.
