This movie is the last straw. As two devoted fans of romantic comedy, this movie finally made us realize that nothing good came of this genre since Love Actually. There was nothing good about the movie. It was an affront to love, death, and everything. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This movie took the spark from Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can not act to save her life. She was not convinced in her laughter, crying and dancing. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
