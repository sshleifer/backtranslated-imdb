The RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be an attempt to turn the mysteries of Charles Dickens 'novels into a contemporary story, but this attempt is thwarted by choosing to use the two time-format periods in which enigma' is unveiled Despite a cast of well-known actors trying their best to make this movie straight to DVD, the end product is a long and tedious mess that can only be considered entertainment if viewers are cast fans as reminded by others. movies. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) is a confined journalist reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting tasks. A series of similar murders includes an old friend of Mike - Sadie (Vera Day), who runs a bar on the banks of the Thames, having just discovered an old and valuable manuscript unpublished by Charles Dickens, and has a heart of gold, sandwiches for pathetic creatures like an old beach bum (Derek Jacobi). Sadie's murder lures Mike to the role of detective journalist and, with the help of police officer Kate (Julie Cox), he begins to link the investigation to clues found in reading Dickens's manuscript. Stopping the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks in Dickens' time while Dickens (again Derek Jacobi) tells a rather personal story of peculiar murders. The parallel between the stories and the intersection between the actors may have worked in the hands of others, but the delicacy of this kind of enterprise runs away from writer / director Brendan Foley. He ends his story (finally) with a tired Hollywood ending. <br /> <br /> In addition to Jones, Jacobi, Cox and Day, the film somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng, PH Moriarty and Mel Smith: their contributions are minimal, but fortunately distracting. This is a bit fragile leaving the viewer wondering how the films of this quality always find funding. Grady Harp
