The film begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fighting the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of the whole movie. The rest of the film is unfortunately extravagant, highly unrealistic and an imitation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The end is also a great waste. <br /> <br /> Some moments like the scene in which Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular Chinese pair Twins: Charlene & Gillian) fight over a teddy bear, are particularly noteworthy. The plot is also lame, surely they could have invented something more frightening than a book called "Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film bearable with their comedic roles. However, the good bits end there. Charlene & Gillian (of Twins) have never been able to act well and bother him to pieces, and the role of "friendly but wussy vampire" was given to Edison Chen, who is a handsome and untalented boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
