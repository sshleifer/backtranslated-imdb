I know a lot of people will have automatically assigned the 1 rating for this movie because they do not have the huge budget and the high end special effects they are used to. I, however, knew what I was getting into when I put it into the VCR. <br /> <br /> I do not think we have much lower budget than this, unless we're filming a family reunion. The lighting is awful, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible, and the acting is ultra-bad by almost everyone involved. BUT, this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough. It centers around a guy named Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt), who had his luck with his work. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on himself. As he begins to work longer hours, we see him slowly transcending into madness and obsession, and he becomes suspicious that his wife is cheating on him and begins brutally killing the various men (most of the guys who fix him) who he considers responsible. <br /> <br /> I must say that the bloody effects are extremely cheap, but they fit the overall tone of the film. The brutal forms that Tom Russo created to kill these men give us an idea of ​​how crazy he became. The pace of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. The ending does not really follow the rest of the movie's plot, as it seems to want to go from a psychotic movie to an aspiring "Dawn of the Dead", but it's still fun and I must give Tim Ritter credit for wanting to use a non-ending conventional. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I liked this movie, but it's not at all a good movie, if that makes sense. Your budget is the main hurdle and the consequences are almost too much to ignore. I would not recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by big budget movies and who can not have an open mind for ultra low budget movies. You just will not like it. For others and gore fans - I say give it a try. You will find at least something redeeming in it! My Note: D
