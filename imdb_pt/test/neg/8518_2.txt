Eddie Fischer was just plain bad. Possibly the worst scene came at the beginning of the film, when he spontaneously started singing a number of music and dancing around a piano and some conveniently placed staff. The song was totally stupid ... I think I could offer, drunkenly, a few lines on a sheet of paper that would beat and probably win a Grammy. So, as if the screenwriters could not find a better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, Fischer says something like "Do not say (insert the name of the guy)." He does not like music, "and smiles. I can not describe how bad this is, I felt a bit embarrassed. And that guy Debbie Reynolds works with and who's always beating her is pretty boring, too. I can not even imagine someone like her losing a fraction of time with him. The jokes were delivered without any kind of chemistry between the characters that made the film go by. At least the baby had beautiful hair. The two stars are for Reynolds, who was like a swan among ugly ducklings. <br /> <br /> See Bachelor Mother instead.
