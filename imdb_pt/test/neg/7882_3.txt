Although it is true that the film is somewhat interesting, the execution leaves much to be desired (much like Blood Orgy of the Leather Girls, I Spit on Your Grave and Born in Flames, all superior). I do not think it's not pornography, but pornography is in the eyes of the beholder: if it works as pornography for someone, who am I to say that it's wrong? I was somewhat intrigued by the statement of Winkimation's generally thoughtful review ("A Shame") that "for once we actually see the faces of men when they come." A few years ago I did occasional freelance reviews for an adult magazine and I remember seeing many faces of men when they came. I think this is probably more common when the movie appears in the few male "stars" (and especially when this male is the director). Although, unsurprisingly, I can not refer to any specific title, I know there are some examples in Ron Jeremy's work. I also do not know if I would agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability on his face when it comes.
