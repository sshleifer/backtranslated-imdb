This movie probably started with a good idea, but that's what happened. When I read the cover on Blockbuster, I thought it was promising, but based on the overall idea of ​​the movie. The film began with a teacher talking about how in the future we can see creatures of other dimensions. There was no explanation as to how this would happen, but okay, I thought it would be developed that in the movie. It was not. In the next scene, we see two young men lying on tables with tubes attached to their heads. Next to each of them are two attractive women. Men start by asking "Do you hear that" or "Do you see them?" We conclude that they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seems invisible or hallucinating. Women do not see these creatures. This was good for the first five minutes, but this scene continues for a full hour. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation with the so-called "plot" of the movie. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and who appears to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is it? We never found out. Flashbacks lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab to perform diabolical experiments on these young people, but we never understand why. At the end of the movie, do the terrorists finally do what the terrorists do? they blow up the lab, but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disjointed thoughts and ideas that there are many to list, but one more notable is the fact that the man in the laboratory and the terrorist enter and leave the room throughout the film and not once do the young men try to escape or even leave the tables where they are, even though they are not tied! The creators of the film also bring cockroach appearances on several occasions, but again we never learn what this has to do with the plot. Sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watched it. Take my advice. Do not rent.
