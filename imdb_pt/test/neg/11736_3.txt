Norm (an) ally I do not care about remakes. There are some very good ones out there, but this is a stinker! Considering it was practically scene to scene, it had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly, and added color (I'm not one of those who think it has to be B & W to be classic). It should have been at least a mediocre movie ... but it was cae-cae pee! I do not understand how this could have been so wrong. If you must, see this as a curiosity, but I suggest you do not bother.
