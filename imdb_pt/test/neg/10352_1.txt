The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly must be raising money for this crap. Yes, the American fraud was shown by about two episodes in Australia, but did not evaluate; probably by curious onlookers who were wondering how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and do not readily accept the nuances of written script in Australia. Bad luck for them as they are doomed to plunge with this turkey. My advice to US viewers is NO. <br /> <br /> Americans should be advised to find ORIGINAL VERSION DVD's on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a different 'zone format' than those issued. in the United States. Otherwise, some DVD players will operate discs from both zones.
