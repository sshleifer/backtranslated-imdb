The White Warrior is definitely one of the weaker films, if not Steve Reeves. Set in 18th or 19th century Russia (Steve) Steve plays a Cossack warrior who tries to overtake a crazy Russian czar running alongside a mountain with his rebel band in a goofy-looking Russian white robe. For the most part, the great physicist Reeves is hiding in a pathetic, knee-length tunic with an even more foolish Russian hat. <br /> <br /> The action is minimal with only a good wrestling scene from the middle of the waist up. which shows the great physicist Reeves. This is an apparent attempt by the producers to remove Reeves from the sword and sandal genre to another historical era with bad results. The script dialogue is difficult to understand at various points, and only the narrator's comments allow the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. I imagine that Reeves regretted making this film, but in an attempt to try to get out of his robe and sandals and grandstand armor, he helped launch it for other historical characters like Morgan the Pirate and Thief of Baghdad.
