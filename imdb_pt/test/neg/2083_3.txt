Watchable but pretty awful. How shocking that this was Gregory La Cava's great driving credit! Even in his best-known roles, I do not care about Gene Kelly. He seems to me to be presumptuous, hostile and selfish. Here, paired with a little actress like Marie Wilson, he seems to show these features in swords. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, playing an heiress who falls in love with a soldier, is exceptionally harsh and unfriendly. The actors seem to be working hard to overcome the hard and nasty core of the image and they do what's right. The know-it-all butler is apparently to be funny, but he looks like an extended riff on the good parts for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and in which, despite his stereotypes, he was usually funny - unlike this face). Phyllis Thaxter is as always very attractive in a rather undeveloped secondary plot.
