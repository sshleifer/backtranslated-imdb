Of all the post-1985 Perry Mason movies I've seen, this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> I confess that I never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. She only seems to know how to interpret a type of character - a hard-working woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder which, for that reason, is extremely difficult to somehow sympathize with. This is no exception - it is true to form. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie, in my opinion, is a serious performance of Scott Baio as promoter - in fact, I found myself rooting for him. to win, and it's worth watching the movie just for him.
