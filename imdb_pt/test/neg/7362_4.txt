See .. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were times when my heart beat faster, when the hair on my neck began to rise, when my muscles began to tighten ... but as a strip tease, I was without real action, no resolution and with money missing my wallet . <br /> <br /> Jaume Balaguer√≥ and Miguel Tejada-Flores apparently do not know the right recipe for making a Horror Movie, and as such, used the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything in the pot. This movie is actually The Enlightened One, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser, all in one. Incredible, I know, but it's true. All the flavors are there, you can taste each of them, they just do not mix well. I will not go down the list of all the wrong things with this movie; in short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, worse dialogues. <br /> <br /> The problem of stealing so many movie scenarios and combining them into one movie, plus the resulting confusion, is while you CAN have multiple batches running at the same time, you may not have multiple endings. And what does Jaume do when faced with this problem? Just like a freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses, "The little car disappeared into the darkness and ..... THE END" Oooh, scary. Not really. And very anticlimactic. The ending left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, go rent The Shining, Poltergeist and Hellraiser .. scare your pants, have fun, and forget that The Darkness has already existed. <br/> <br/> -BJamin
