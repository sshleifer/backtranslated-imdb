I love John's work as a singer, but the film was monotonous and "not worth the time" to see. <br /> <br /> I thought he did an 'ok' job of doing his part. When he says "you're having an affair with the old man," to your co-star, I kind of laughed at your facial movements ... or lack thereof. <br /> <br /> I would suggest the movie if you like John's music, but not like a Saturday night video. <br /> <br /> If you love his song, the video has some of his music, but not much. <br /> <br /> So then .. at best
