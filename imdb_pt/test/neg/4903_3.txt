After surfing the Internet, I found the series "Homefront" on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD I received was burned by an amateur of home video tapes recorded from his TV 15 years ago. Resolution and quality are bad. The images look like what you would expect from an old recorded video. Although the commercials have been edited, the final credits for each episode still have segway announcements on ABC's "Nightline" news program, complete with the main headlines of the early 1990s. shows were watched and the sound quality was good. <br /> <br /> For the credit of this series, the cast was almost perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked like the part. His performance was also above average. Jeff Metcalf's role is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (seen most recently in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic, as were the sets, especially the 40's kitchens with appliances and vintage decor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at the time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes interspersed with conversations about the same subject among other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid, although it reduced the time and the room between the different characters and places. This leads to good direction and editing and they did the work in this case. <br /> <br /> As I began to watch this series again, I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a good show, the plots and stories are disappointing and confusing from the start. On the one hand, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When World War II ended in 1945, there were no more fighting, so obviously there was no longer a "homefront". Curiously, the first episode of the "Homefront" program begins in 1945, after the end of the war. It's like filming the first episode of "Gilligan's Island" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. I still kept hope with the possibility that the rest of the series would be a flashback but no, the whole show happens from 1946 to 1948. In addition, this series fails miserably in any attempt to portray any historical event of the late 1940s. . In the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a veiled vehicle for an ultra-leftist political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the program's current racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the cast is Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr., who play the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the "whites" wicked to the point of being ridiculous and utterly absurd, if not laughable. The racism card has been played and played by Hollywood for more than 40 years. We understand. We are also tired of rubbing our noses daily. The theme of racism is also unpopular among viewers and is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for the "Homefront." The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical "frightened / raging black family." The wildly exaggerated racism of this series makes it seem like everyone in Ohio was a member of KKK or something. The issue of racism could have been treated in this episode in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or a fight in which a fanatic gets a well-deserved beating, and leaves it at that. Dedicating an important part of the series to racism really becomes very fast and it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> In another ridiculous plot, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed. as an Ebenezer Scrooge as a character who is against pensions and increases and does not care about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think this series had great potential. Could writers have easily put the timeline in 1941 ?? 1945 as the title suggests and shows the difficulties of food and gas rationing and the 14-hour day work in factories of war. Of course the loss of siblings, sons and husbands struggling abroad would also have added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing on special guests such as military or USO officials who come through your town during training or en route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities of good stories and plot are endless. But no, the Homefront writers (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally lost the point and turned to a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair for the actors to condemn the whole series, but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total junk.
