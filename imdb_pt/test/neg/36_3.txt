This movie, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation / horror flick; but what I got was a "drawn ghost". In this case, the ghost was that of a religious worship leader who tried to refuse treatment, but the request was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: her spirit brings Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit murder. The only voodoo connection was for one of the three black characters, in this case a former blind soccer player whose mother practiced voodoo. The movie is very slow and very annoying. There is a very normal ending that provides excitement, followed by a terribly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> In which a woman really can defend herself against murder charges by saying that she was possessed. This movie is slow and bad in a non-funny way, just dumbfounded. Avoid at all costs.
