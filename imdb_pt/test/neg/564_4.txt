Made in a simulated documentary style, the late 1960s subversives and alleged government detractors are arrested and given a choice. After conviction for their wrongdoing, there is a choice to go to jail for 7 years for life or spend three days and two nights in a Southern California desert in Punishment Park. In the heat of 100 degrees, the prisoners travel fifty miles to an American flag for their freedom. The executors of US and state laws will follow two hours later. If the dissidents are captured, that means imprisonment. <br /> <br /> Appearing in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
