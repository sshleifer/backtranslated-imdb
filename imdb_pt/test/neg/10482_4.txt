Okay, when I bought this movie I thought this would be the best movie b, the Space Monkey landing on Earth and would immediately start killing people! <br /> <br /> Well, it was almost all I expected, typical low-budget science fiction movie from the 60's. Performance has to be the worst I've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the The girl who played the waitress made me laugh at my ass. <br /> <br /> So why does 'Night Fright' not fit into the 'so bad it's good' category? Which is why some of the scenes were very long and boring. For example, the scene was the cops are looking for clues in the forest, it was only a few minutes of purposeless walking. And then the grand finale, the people waiting for the monster for about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears, it will go crazy in 20 seconds at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, 'Night Fright' is annoying, but it has some funny moments. I can recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies like 'Zontar, The Thing Of Venus' or 'Swamp Creature Curse'. <br /> <br /> I give 'Night Fright' 4 Space Monkey. . <br /> <br /> -Rob Gruesome-
