Well, Killshot is not awful, but it comes close. The production values ​​are decent and the main actors do a good job (except for Rosario Dawson in a wasted paper), but the story is just pathetic. I do not know if Elmore Leonard's book had such idiotic characters, since I did not read it, but I suppose the book should be at least a little funny. The film has no detectable humor. After the first twenty minutes, you'll be screaming on the screen: "Oh, come on, no one's that stupid!" In a nutshell, and without spoilers, everyone acts in a convenient way to the plot, which does not make sense anyway. A very frustrating and unreal film, which may be responsible for him staying on the shelf for as long as he did.
