... and that's saying something. No matter how bad a movie is, I'm usually able to sit down to judge the whole movie. Through this, I did it in 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I could not hear the dialogue even with the volume all facing up. The sound effects were good, so with the volume increasing to hear the dialogue, I was blowing my eardrums with the effects. As much as I wanted to see it, I was not going to sacrifice my hearing for it. For the little that I could tell about the plot, the film was a major flashback of the main movie. daughter of the character. It seems that the mother, a military pilot, had to flee from her ship because the only person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemies and now he is chasing her across a deserted planet. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about the movie was the visual of the main character; There was something I liked about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, looks like this one goes to waste ...
