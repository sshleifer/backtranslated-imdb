What is wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird continues to make films that have men acting like women and women acting like men. The dumb male director and writer of this movie needs to have their heads examined. The main problems with this film are the feminist portraits of the sexes. <br /> <br /> In the scenes of the bar, Eva Mendez and her friend are drinking from the beer bottles as if you could find sailors in an oil. tanker doing so at a bar in Iceland. Mendez continually kisses every girl she sees after that. She also dresses provocatively in every scene, but curses like a guy. She gets very emotional when fighting with Will Smith for a while, while trying to 'defend' all women from bad guys everywhere. <br /> <br /> Men are no better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything to win a date. The males in this movie are preoccupied with getting sexual favors or unable to speak clearly when they are face to face with a woman. Men in real life do not behave that way. <br /> <br /> What we see in this film is a product of the culture that went wrong. Everything is flip-flop. The guys act like girls, girls act like guys. All this is done while maintaining the extreme predilections of the sexes a part of the story. Men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in sex most of the time, while women are shown as macho and arrogant, but only as a veneer for their emotional insecurities. <br /> <br /> This movie would be nice if it was not unpleasantly presented to the public. Content is not to blame. It's the way the content is presented.
