Although the prominent and excessive use of the game format is in full operation throughout the film, this is not, however, that leaves that image aside. On the contrary, it is the unconvincing female performances and the rather boring script that the film so obviously depended a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is further diminished by Graham's inability to truly express the devastation that his character so vehemently claims to have experienced. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr proves as usual the talented actor he is, he shades the two actresses into their scenes together, which is constantly noticeable. The senseless sex scene, although intense, seems to exist only to prevent the film from being too expressive verbally, giving the actors a much deserved break. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, Two Girls and the Guy has very little to recommend it, other than the formidable performance of Downey Jr.
