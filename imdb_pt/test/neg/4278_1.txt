For all who read this book, Fanny Price ends up maturing in her own wife, a beautiful woman ... with a brain. Le Touzel seems to be taking medicine. Terrible acting, it just ruins everything! Henry is a bit tall for his character. He too is too effeminate. Mary Crawford is brilliant. Edmond is a little too old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical - OK, this decision of choice works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates looks very effeminate too. But Le Touzel is simply awful. This is not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I would recommend this movie only because it includes an almost complete textual account of the language Austen uses in the novel. The 1999 version is much more fun but terribly incomplete. If they could remake this version with a better adapted actress for Fanny, it would be fabulous!
