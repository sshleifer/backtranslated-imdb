Teenage Exorcist is one of those horrible movies for the video that causes the viewer to give up any expectation of decent entertainment for sexual pranks, teenage humor and empty writing. This film offers exactly what it was trying to deliver. It's about a girl who moves into a house where a Baron de Sade (hmmm) lived and was finally drawn to him through his own inner demon. His sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, his boyfriend and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. Well, not much here in the form of horror or suspense. In fact, a film line pretty much sums up what to expect. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) tied her (the name is Diane and she is played by Brinke Stevens) after trying to hit her sister. He takes a gag out of his mouth and says something like, "This will not be the last gag we see tonight." In fact, it was not. Special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of it using its comic appeal. Some of the lines and situations are funny. Robert Quarry, the old Count Yorga, actually steals his scenes as an Irish priest. He does this by lamenting Bible verses and singing Irish songs. You know you're in trouble, however, when Eddie Deezen gets the highest billing. Deezen does his job and also has some enjoyable moments, but the material is way too threadbare than being anything more than a teenage teenager. Michael Berryman, of The Hills Have Eyes, also has a brief but interesting participation in the film. As for the other actors, well, they are all very good at being mediocre. Stevens is adorable in fishnet stockings and French cut panties, but besides that do not expect much else from her. Her sister is played by Elena Sahagun, and she shows a little more than Brinke (a lovely young woman on purpose) and plays with Brinke for miles. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. Again, it is not a bad movie to waste a little time that involves not thinking. If you're a Robert Quarry fan, check out his performance at least.
