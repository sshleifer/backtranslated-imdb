This movie was nothing like the book. Everything was mixed or changed. Most of the film was not even in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment for me when I really enjoyed the book and then to watch how this movie destroyed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie is not worth being watched with just how out of the book it really is.
