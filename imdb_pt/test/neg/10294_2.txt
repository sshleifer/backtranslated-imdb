I must say, when I saw this movie in a 6.5 on this site, I realized that it was worth a view. I was very disappointed. From almost the opening scene, it is obvious that the two alleged FBI agents are, in fact, the killers. Could they have made this more obvious? If this is the "twist" intended in this movie, this is very sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. Pullman adeptly acts like a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There's no way to change "I'm playing FBI guy!" for "I just killed 12 people and boy, my arms are tired". You can not blame the actors ... history fails in many more ways than one. Since the beginning of the movie, however, I was sure that I was wrong, that no director / writer ever be so blatantly obvious about a "twist" plot. Ormond and Pullman must be just acting strangely in order to divert the attention of the viewer from the real killers, I thought ... which gave much credence to the creators of the film. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the film before it even passed the 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> To Lynch's credit, she has been able to bring in many things that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors. Too bad they were in the wrong configuration. I hope Pell James can recover from that role ... I found his performance particularly impressive as the incredible drug addict became a potential savior. She should have rewritten the paper for the "crack prostitute" to win. <br /> <br /> Those people who compared this movie to Natural Born Killers, note: Tarantino made the characters of Mickey and Mallory reprehensible, but understanding. The art of this film far surpasses the blood, and this is not seen once in the Surveillance. Surveillance just wants them to be Natural Born Killers ... in fact, has wet dreams about being a fraction of what that movie was. People who have not seen Surveillance ... cling to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
