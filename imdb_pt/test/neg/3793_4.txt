I also waited a long time to see this movie. As far as I know it was never released in Australia, then in the end I found a copy on the net and sent it there. Weeks after the confirmation of my request finally arrived and I was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my TV ready to watch a movie that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of ​​the world where there are so many good movies. What a disappointment. In the first few minutes, I realized I had ordered a Graduate B, but it was still full of anticipation. I convinced my son (18) to watch it with me as I love sharing when I find a movie of value with good underlying statements and / or story lines. Halfway up, he stood up and said he could not bear to watch, he was so predictable and amateurish. I nodded, but I watched until the end. The performance was atrocious even by the B Grade standards. The stereotypes are also predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna who must have shrunk after seeing the movie portraying them in such a way. No doubt some racial bias still exists in many parts of the world, not just in the United States, but in fact, today, I doubt they would get away with all the ridiculous alibi presented. I had to double-check the date the film was made, as his attempts to film the most horrifying scenes were something I would expect from a high school student's first attempt at making a movie like "indy." I would like to see this film in the hands of experienced screenwriters and filmmakers, it is an old tale but it can still be a success if it is treated professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I liked.
