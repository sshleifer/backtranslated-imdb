I've seen this show a few times and the more I see it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is the sister of Britney and I am sorry to say that this in the program is obvious. They created the character Zoey to be all that people want to believe that Jamie Lynn is, intelligent, original, intelligent, beautiful, popular, etc. The characters around her are there just to make her look better, being smarter than them, more popular than them, more sought after by boys than they are. There's nothing original about it and it's poured out with money, so every kid has the coolest fashions and stuff. I also have to say, for a 13-year-old girl (or how old she is, she can not be much older) she wears very mature clothes, those short skirts are very short, makes the young people want to wear them, and all this makeup, this raises the growing problems of why girls get into so much trouble. The only thing I will say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, given her age, it's not bad at all, much better than the sister, anyway, when it comes to vocal ability. Sorry, it's very mature and very dumb. It's misinterpreted with predictable plots and there are too many stereotypes going on as well.
