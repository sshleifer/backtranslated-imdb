A truly masterful work of cinema. He managed to put me to sleep and shrink my mind. So annoying that it induces sleep and yet so ridiculous it made me think how things like that are done. Avoid at all costs. That is, unless you like invisible cranial punishment, and in that case I highly recommend it.
