I went to see it 3 nights ago here in Cork, Ireland. It was the world premiere in the tiny cinema of the Triskel Arts Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found "Strange Fruit" an excellent movie. It's a bit rough around the edges, but for a low budget movie that is to be expected! In general, the acting (especially of the main actor Kent Faulcon) is wonderful, the direction and the cinematographic direction are excellent, and the script is extremely entertaining and instigating, with some pleasant arrangements and ingenious dialogues. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit sudden, with no conclusion given to the characters and events, since the end came to its exciting end ... but maybe that's what the filmmakers were going for? This certainly made the film more disturbing. I liked the fact that the main character never reached an agreement with his mother on the screen: this leaves you wondering if he will or will not, as in real life sometimes these things are never solved. This was a good choice, to leave you with no solution, instead of wrapping you up sentimentally! <br /> <br /> Taut and suspense throughout, "Strange Fruit" is an extremely ambitious debut and I have high hopes for writer / director Kyle Schickner will release next. He - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching. <br /> <br /> I hope "Strange Fruit" has a wider release soon, as more people deserve to see this film, an above average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and extreme racism south of the USA. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
