"Milo" is one more answer to a question that no one has ever asked. Do we really need more slashers? I think we already have more than enough. I think the high-tech guys charged more than that. he is also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it. A long time ago, he drowned, but that did not bother him and he still kills people ("Friday the 13th", what is that?) One day, his survivors have a big meeting and as a surprise, Milo comes to visit them. Through some really bad scenes that show everything except the murders, the cast is reduced until only the final girl finds out that Milo is monotonous, I mean, dark secret. She and her friends are dying to know. Once discovered, Milo continues with another murderous rage (is not it your bedtime yet?) And the girl, well, she screams a lot. The acting is not even the bottom of the barrel, the barrel refuses to be associated with it. Myth may be a creepy bastard from time to time I give this to him, but some movies simply can not be saved without a great script or free nudity.
