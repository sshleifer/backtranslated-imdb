Plunkett and MaCleane are two thieves who steal from the rich to give the ... well, the rich; comparatively, they are rich. But we know they are the good guys because the guy behind the forces of law and order, Mr. Chance, is so evil. He rapes women - or tries. He beats his subordinates. He commits murder. He has bad breath. He does not shave properly. He has no sense of fashion. He tortured dogs. The latter is just my inference: we do not see him torturing pups. But I'm sure he does. Little Chance's villainy has a lot to do with his quest for Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby he takes to be absolutely sure we do not like him. He need not have tried so hard. No one in this movie is friendly. <br /> <br /> Let's take stock. Attractive characters? There are none: I believe we have covered that. Swashbuckling? It's not a swash. Instead, we have a kind of dirty, heavy breathing. Trace? Shine? Force? It all worked out like a buck, I'm scared. Realism? None of that either. I think they were TRYING realism, since they were all so filthy, but the characters and action had all the plausibility of Errol Flynn - with no sense of joy in supporting them. Beauty? No. Good camera work? For a TV crew, maybe. Humor? You can laugh once or twice if you are in a benevolent mood. Then again, you can not. Dialogue? See mood, above. Music? Do not even make me start the song. Ladyhawk's music was by comparison strangely appropriate; and at least the mistaken aesthetic of that score was consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to `Ladyhawk 'for even thinking about it in this context. <br /> <br /> In short: there is a lot of bad evil here and NOTHING is good - unless you tell Liv Tyler, what I have in mind I'm feeling like I just wrote a review of smallpox. `Not very good, 'says the review. It would be a lot more interesting if I could somehow DEFEND smallpox, say that pox critics understand everything wrong - but I do not know how I would do it.
