This movie is about the encounters of 7 couples on the Hampstead Heath on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. It shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking a relationship, homosexual, elderly, blind date and escort service. They are not connected to each other beyond the geographic location, so that is a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations, with no tangible plot. The movie jumps from one pair to another without any logic. I find this movie boring and purposeless. The only feature left is the great weather throughout the film. It's sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are wasted on this movie.
