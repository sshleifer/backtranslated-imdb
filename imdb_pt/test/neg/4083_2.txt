Oh Mr. Carell! How far you fell! After a brilliant moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's choice of films begins to contrast with what has come since. Although the 40-year-old VIRGIN was fun, it was diminished by his "Sunshine" character. Hoping to find something that made me puke nose popcorn, I decided to rent EVAN ALLIGHTY and see what possible laughter might await me here. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Given the banal and clichéd script, the whole movie seemed forced and unemotional. Slanting fun with the denunciation of family values ​​and the current US administration over the environment, Evan Almighty also tries to put a deep biblical moment in humorous terms, but fails miserably. Almost all the people on earth know The story of Noah and the Ark The wrath of God was sent with 30 days and rainy nights that flooded the entire planet while Noah, his family and two of each one of His creatures on Earth expelled the moisture in relative comfort through the wooden gopher ark. It was a huge moment in the history of mankind (if you believe in the biblical text). <br /> <br /> So why would God appear to a man and ask him to build an ark that would only take the animals of the world for a few years? minutes after the dam rupture? The simple answer is that He would never do that. Too much emphasis was given to US government policy and not enough in world events, making Evan Almighty a terribly myopic and American-centered film. Although conceived as a comedy, it never comes to anything approaching with laughter. Maybe some grunts and a smile, but little else. <br /> <br /> John Goodman (CARS) performs another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long, whose only goal is to create development opportunities in protected national estates. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OF LESS) as God can not help absorb this waterlogged film disaster. <br /> <br /> The only funny moments are between Carell and the animals. , especially when Evan discovers that animal magnetism is REALLY similar. Birds literally migrate to it. Flock of sheep around him. Lions are proud to be near him (please forgive the puns). <br /> <br /> The special effects were fun to watch, but they were brief (with good reason). The "deluge" was interesting, for the Ark was obviously guided by His hand and pushed in the right direction. <br /> <br /> But, besides, you are a little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
