I have not seen this movie in years, the last time I did I was really drunk after 5 pints of tenant at my local Witherspoon, but even then I thought it was pretty awful. This movie is pretty terrible compared to other movie critters, the first two were pretty good, 3 was crap but miles better than that. The story goes 53 years after the 3 bug, where Charlie, the bounty hunter of the previous films, is found floating in a cocoon in outer space by a crew of some kind of space miner, people and taken aboard. Once aboard the last critter, eggs left in the galaxy that Charlie brought with him from Earth open up and we have bugs aboard the spacecraft, an obvious 'Alien' rip off and a lot of terrible effects and you pretty much have this movie on few words. The only good thing is when we are reintroduced to UG (or we are led to believe), who is now a villain and wants to preserve the creatures instead of destroying them.
