This could have been a good TV movie, but flashbacks do not make it easier to understand the movie. As they give the viewer information on the way (the movie continues) I caught myself wondering why she never said or mentioned it at first. So the whole trail probably would not have been necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why she shot and of course she's not guilty. Too bad the producer / director used flashbacks this way, but otherwise the movie would not have been worth it. <br /> <br /> Good movie for a rainy day, big bag of chips to kill the night.
