Dude, this movie stinks! It is obvious that this film helped to reject the need for Hollywood to produce tired sequences to attract the masses. First of all, it came out really fast, and second, it did not have the same style that made the original movie succeed. No new terrain was broken and turned into a rather mundane effort.
