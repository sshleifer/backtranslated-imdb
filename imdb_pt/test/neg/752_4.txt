Normally, the BBC productions of Jane Austen are very good, but the abbey of Northanger is just strange. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically imitates the gothic romances that Austen so wonderfully ridiculed. Not only that, the Gothic sequences are cheeky, exaggerated and downright silly. The actress who plays Miss. Morland is barely presented with no obvious appeal to attract the attention of a bachelor, and although I really enjoyed the spooky Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, he is not at all like the novel, even when distributing the message directly from the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney did one of his few terribly "ham" performances. This movie was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to savor how strangely wrong it was.
