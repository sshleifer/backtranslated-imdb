This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not feel like I wanted to remove my eyes by force after watching Galaxina. Just not good. The jokes are almost funny, but they are insufficient. All of them. The few jokes that come near are repelled by repeating them over and over again. The production values ​​are, well, nonexistent. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad, it only seems cheap; Overly. The dialogue ... well, is often missing - many embarrassing silences; they are all stopped, and it seems that someone should be saying something. The film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that a comedy was intended - as perhaps it was developed after the start of filming. It looks like a movie project from someone they played together the night before, and if it had been two weeks, it might have been good. <br /> <br /> And I'm easy to please. I thought "Mom and Dad save the world" was a joke. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is very close to a classic. This turkey simply does not do that. "Space Truckers" was more believable. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. His part calls for a straightman, and he plays inclined to sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is well in her role, but not particularly noteworthy. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, the "my watch is always slow". line was funny. I'll give this film all the compliments it can get, it needs. <br /> <br /> Space vehicle models are not bad, but they are few and they are not used effectively. Space scenes are vague. There are no sweeping passes, no detailed overflight, no proper action scenes when they dock. (The Infinity drops very strangely at one point.) The flight dynamics is terrible; worse than anything you've ever seen, they're fragile, not soft. The initial battle is blistered and static; even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver abruptly, they exchange shots at close range in a way that resembles yet another 16th-century sea battle except that it is not so exciting. <br /> <The aliens - imagine if all Star Wars was the canteen scene. That a lot of rubber masks could run out of luster quickly, right? Some are used as vision gags that work well the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Mercifully, if you try to watch Galaxina, you are likely to fall asleep. (I was busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes, and I did not feel it would be worth repeating.) If that does not say "It sucks," I do not know what it does.) Unfortunately, there is a lot potential, and this could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to remake this and have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
