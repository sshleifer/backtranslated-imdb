If good intentions were enough to produce a good movie, we would have rated the "Focus" obvious, heavy and weighted a little above 4. Macy does his best, but as a previous poster commented, Miller's parable asks us to suspend disbelief many times. Perhaps the novel gives us a little more background on Newman, so we can understand how someone who obviously lacks intelligence can be so dense in noticing the attitudes of those around him. I agree with another reviewer that if someone is not aware of how average intolerant citizens were in America during this time period then this movie might be a big surprise. I grew up in the fifties, and the "good" pastors of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with picnicking in the church on a commercial beach, whose sign prominently indicated that Jews or blacks would not be admitted. It is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm, not just in the South. Back in 1964, when I graduated from a racially integrated (but sexually segregated) public school in Baltimore, my black classmates were unable to attend the traditional "father-son feast," as happened at a facility that did not admit blacks. Unfortunately, it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family. The subject of "Focus" is important, and we must never forget, despite the persistent signs of racism in modern America, how truly repulsive were the attitudes of the previous generation (the "greatest generation", in fact). So maybe this movie is somehow valuable to counteract the recent spate of sentimental junk about the 40s of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. But in the end, as in "Far from Paradise," the filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time.
