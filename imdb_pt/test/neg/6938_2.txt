If you are a six year old boy who likes dinosaurs, you will love this movie. If you are someone else, you will be rolling your eyes every 15 seconds. If you want to start choosing things like acting, special effects, dialogue or the absence of a coherent storyline that makes the least amount of sense, you will have a lot of material. If all you want is a safe dinosaur fantasy movie for your kid, he'll do well. That being said, there is plenty of entertainment for kids that is a lot smarter, and some are even bearable or fun for adults. Unless your child is in an uncompromising dinosaur state, you're probably better off searching for something else.
