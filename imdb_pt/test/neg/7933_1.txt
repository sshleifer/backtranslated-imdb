** Maybe spoilers ** ** hard to screw this thing over than it is, but just in case ** Gee I do not see how anyone could have liked this re-make! It was like a "made for TV" show and still too bad for that. Lots of fake snow, bad acting from big stars, bad deeds and that crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the heck ?? !! I really did not think it would be a great movie, but I hoped I could have fun. No, we fell asleep in the middle of the road and had to finish it the next day. I could have skipped the rest easy (but then I would have missed those great pine woods!) I'm so glad I missed it in the theater! Bad enough to waste $ 3.50 on the video store. And I'm a lover of cop movies, action and drama. This was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original any day !!
