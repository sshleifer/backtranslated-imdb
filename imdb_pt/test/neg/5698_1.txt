It amazes me that someone actually considers spending some money on a movie like this. Same. Let's forget for a second that the plot does not even give a single hint of originality ... Most movies today are based on stories from other films, so a "simple" lack of originality is not a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie ever took a plane before filming it. Because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to invent something so ridiculous. To be honest, I think a 6-year-old with a fake camera could have something technically much more convincing. Some examples to follow. <br /> <br /> The scene that really drives me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. When they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like "Okay, press the 1 and 2 buttons on the panel". Now these are not buttons. They should not be pushed, they should be pulled up and towards the pilot. This is something that only an airplane junkie would know, you say? Wrong. In the next scene you can see your fingers pressing the "buttons" ... And of course the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not even a single millimeter! (And note that I did not even mention the fact that aircraft engines are not like car engines, that you turn the key and magic happens ... You have to do a rather complicated procedure to activate them ... ) Come on guys! You could have faked the moves at least !! Not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane collides with every thing along the runway (light poles along the runway? What do they think ?!) ... And the wings are not even ripped off! It happened to me too, once ... Except the plane was made of Lego! What about the steward? She is so skilled that she knows perfectly where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. Should we then mention the guy who can drive an ambulance and fly an airplane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did he turn the other engines on the plane? <br /> <br /> Really, I could go hours with these things. This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen, and I'm including junk like Alone In The Dark and stuff on the list. Want to do yourself a favor? Do not watch.
