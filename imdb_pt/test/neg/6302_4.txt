"Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert" is always being presented as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it very disappointing. The protagonists are great - Terence Stamp is aging beautifully, Guy Pearce should do more comedy instead of the austere roles he chooses and I've been a Hugo Weaving fan since I saw him touch Oberon a few years ago. Cinematography is great, but if you've been to the Australian outback, you'd know the air is so clear and the light so bright they could have filmed the film equivalent of a Brownie Box and it still looked spectacular. <br /> <br /> So what's my problem? Well, three things. First, there is not a nice female character throughout the movie. A woman who has to make a living by throwing ping pong balls out of her private at a roadside pub deserves our sympathy. Tick's wife does not get much better treatment. <br /> <br /> Second, the scene in which they sing "I Will Survive" to a group of Aborigines is offensive. Trying to draw any sort of parallel between drag queens and transvestites and the almost total destruction of Aboriginal culture, which is what I presume the scene should do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. <br /> Finally, and the biggest flaw of the movie is that it's not funny enough. Stephan Elliott actually talked to some drag queens when writing the movie? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have intelligence and are not afraid to use them. Now, I can understand that a lot of drag queen jokes would probably have refused the film's rating, but Elliott should have been able to muster "child-friendly" material to complete his film. <br /> <br />, after all, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.
