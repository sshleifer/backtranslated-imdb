This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. This is also my first review so you can say that I must hate this movie batch. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like my serious movies. I do not like Hollywood very much, I tend to like French, Italian, USA or anything that tries to communicate something sensible. <br /> <br /> But that was horrible. Because? 1. The plot (as it was) was totally unbelievable, although the director seems to be giving it all in a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to recommend him. Does he smoke from coldness or show us his anguish? For God's sake, this guy must be a former Mafia lawyer. Are we destined to care anymore because he is also one of the most hostile people you could meet? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. Pop psychology is better. In the closing moments, I almost cheered when he was buried in the cement. Best place for it. And I thought that was the only good scene. Or maybe it was because he was so close to the final credits. <br /> <br /> 3. The entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character of the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old and old men, with a deep and meaningful personality (as demonstrated by smoking). It happens all the time. In really bad movies, this is it. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace was so heavy. I like slow, I like care. But that was only deadly. <br /> <br /> A lot of other things I really can not bother writing. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
