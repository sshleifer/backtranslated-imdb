I'm a big fan of Northern Exposure. Men In Trees is a complete Northern Exposure knock-off. There are the people of New York City stuck in a remote city (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). She immediately does not get along with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city has only one pilot that is not always available. Ther is just a radio program. And the whole show is about quirky people with sincere and strange relationships. Lots of parallels. Exactly like Northern Exposure except an obvious demographic has been altered in each character. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, writing is very good. But if this was a school project, it certainly would have deserved the label of plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the people who love this show were protected from the hard work and creativity of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
