I made a great effort to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. I did not really have time to write reviews, but I felt that this was my duty as a science fiction horror fan. This is just the second review I wrote. The other was for the Dracula 3000. Now, to the point. This movie sucks. Clear and simple. I was wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those "lovely" comments. I've seen movies with bad effects, bad acting, bad sound, you named it and I saw it. But it really sucked. I do not care how much it costs or does not cost to do, movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the entire cast and crew arrested and arrested for murder. By the way, I mentioned that this movie sucked. I mean really sucked. The plot was non-existent and the performance was weak. It seems that the writer saw Pitch Black and got upset because he did not think of a plot like that first, so he decided to make his own stolen version. But instead, the suction factor took over and possessed it. DO NOT SEE THIS. You will have more fun if you pull on your pants and sit on the embers.
