Ah, how I laughed .... this has it all ... an Asian / white family, a disabled Asian ... everything a healthy person needs to see in the eyes of the BBC. <br /> <br /> What absolute tribe: This was a total insult to my eyes that saw this garbage for an episode and ONLY ONE SINGLE EPISODE. <br /> <br /> When you think of some quality that the BBC has published over the years (Fawlty Towers, for example), then that comes rolling ... It's a disgusting disgrace. <br /> <br /> It's all about political correctness and it's devoid of any humor. <br /> <br /> It's straight from the guts of hell: but what would you expect from the ultra-leftist BPC ... I mean BBC.
