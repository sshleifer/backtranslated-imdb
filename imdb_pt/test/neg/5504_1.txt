This movie is the worst of all! Sorry, but this was a total waste of good hours. quasi-psychology and b-actors makes a baaaad horror film. you can say that if you are in bad movies, you will love this. and the "hottie" was not that hot. there's absolutely no climax to the movie, and the worst part is the final song. something homemade with these words "is in terrible condition the world is a mess.When heads fall from bodies and girls do not get dressed.The cops are ignorant, eating donuts in the car. . " Jesus! Excuse me, but the milks have gone wrong with this one.
