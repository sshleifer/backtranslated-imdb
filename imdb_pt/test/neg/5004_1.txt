This movie was total cheese. That stinks. The only good thing about it was acting. Others then, nothing worthy of note. <br /> <br /> Big Time Spoilers coming! Do not read more if you have not seen! <br /> <br /> This film is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful lives were destroyed as a result of their youngest son and later when they discovered the eldest son were molested by their day care providers. Although, they are called liars in court and the defense lawyer is a real jerk, the jury finds them guilty and condemns them. <br /> <br /> In the end, all I can say to the director is, "Next time you want to make a movie like that, do it differently."
