I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of bad movies. I like to think that movies that most people label as the worst of all time I can easily withstand. <br /> <br /> But ... there are exceptions. I can only recall three movies that I had the misfortune to see that I repeatedly used the fast forward button for large parts of the story. These movies are The Mighty Gorga, Night of the Seagulls, and this little crap, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> In the world of Jaws ripoffs, it falls off the scales. Deep Blood does not have the realistic plot of the original Crocodile, nor the incredible effects of the Marine Serpent, nor Tintorera's commentary. No, instead, we're taken to a handful of teenagers from any 1980s public-access sitcom that has failed bullies and local sheriffs. <br /> <br /> Shark attacks are performed by rapid documentary cuts with actors struggling in the water, occasionally with a bit of what appears to be an orange paint thrown into the water. Not a minute of footage of original sharks exists in this celluloid dump. Normally, I, or someone like me, would read a dark review like this and say "cool, I need to find a copy of this!" That's the same thought I had when I read another viewer's comment on this same site. How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another ... let it collect dust on the shelf ... take the Depths or the Great Alligator to satisfy your need for something bad lurking in the Water.
