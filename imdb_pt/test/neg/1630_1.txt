I saw this in the late, late, late, late, when MST3K was just a glint in Joel Hodgson's eyes. I had the privilege of seeing without knowing exactly how bad it would be. I did not know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "to the ends of the earth" in about an hour and a half (thank God her father gave specific instructions) and then take days to return the castle with help. I did not know that a sword wielding a kind of barbarian could run into the forest and create a hanglider and powder bombs in less than 30 seconds. I had no idea how disjointed a movie could be. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, children, a very bad thing. If you like bad movies, go ahead.
