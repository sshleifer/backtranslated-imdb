my friends and I watched this movie last night. it was pretty amazing. by all means, this was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. In the beginning, it was tolerable. it was horrible, although the scenes were very long and drawn and the quality terrible (I read $ 400 over budget ... sounds right) of the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem came from the lack of a script; With experience in improvisation, I know how difficult it can be to keep the scenes short and efficient. What happened in this movie was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they did not know when to stop, they kept going for long on stupid topics. at first I thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long and useless scenes to give body. As the movie progressed, I realized it was just a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I could see that the filmmaker had a good idea for a shot, but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it off effectively. many scenes were taken from a single shot (because you know, improvisation) so it seemed a long time. so boring! if you can endure an hour and a half of terrible improvisation, watch. It's very funny in the parts, but it's also very stupid and annoying. the performance varies from good to absolutely terrible. It seemed that the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot; the brave boy who swore a lot, the barbershop, etc etc <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad. like, I was literally suffering. after an hour, my friends and I got bored and left.
