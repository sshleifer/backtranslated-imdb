This movie was included in the BBC's Six Wives of Henry VIII mini-series DVD. I loved those six movies. They were well-made, well scripted, and historically accurate. I actually read Gregory's book and enjoyed it a lot, despite the huge historical inaccuracies (I refer to the false homosexual angle with George Boleyn in particular), but this movie did not even mention it. This angle was one of the central points of the book. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie leaves me wondering "WHY?" Why do we see, as one aptly put it, "The Real World: England Tudor"? Why are camera angles so bad overall? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so bad? I mean, I know it was improvisation, but come on! The actors at the time stutter and stutter their lines and it is obvious that they are doing things as they go. <br /> <br /> Why are the sex scenes so strange? The way they were made in the book made them at least a little interesting. In the movie they are bad, becoming absolutely hilarious. At one point, the actress who plays Mary Boleyn was having sex with the actor who plays Henry VIII. He's pushing away and she has that look on her face that says "Hm ... I need to go to the store." "Is he finished yet? Maybe if he finishes I can get some cheese quickly ..." It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine of Aragon play such a small part in this film? His refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of the scandal that rocked Christiandom. She is the reason why Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn could not marry immediately. Why is not she here? Above all, this movie is just plain bad.
