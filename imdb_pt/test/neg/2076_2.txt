When I saw this in the movies, I remember shaking with the bad acting for about a minute or two in the first scene, and then immediately told me "no, this has to get better." This did not happened. The performances are fairly uniform and there is no sexual chemistry in this film, just the awkward postures of a reasonably beautiful, discreetly untalented actress who seems to have been born to grace the cover of "Interviú" and not much beyond. If the writer thought that making Mérimée a character was an original creative maneuver, he might have to leave more. And Aranda, if he had thought a little more about it, would have realized that Carmen's story is only crying for thoughtful, iconoclastic, parody deconstruction, not this case of leaving the brain behind at the time of the ratchet. of ersatz passion and dialogue of comics. This is contemporary Spanish cinema at its worst. <br /> <br />
