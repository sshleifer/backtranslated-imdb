I liked most of the dialogue, I liked the cast, I thought it was well represented. I particularly enjoyed the perfect performance of Ellen DeGeneres. <br /> <br /> What did not work for me was: (1) the case with the younger (very long, seemingly out of character for Helen). ), (2) the seemingly endless cinematic clichés, mostly visual, but including endless verbalized re-readings of the love letter itself (its content must have a mystery); (3) a young feminist scholar and, ironically, a fireworks scene (no wonder this reminded me of that horrible film How to Make an American Quilt); (4) the cheat cop who smells like "drug" everywhere (no cliché too!); and (5) a nauseatingly romantic small town setting. I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source (or even glorify) the bitterness of Helen, to include much more of DeGeneres's character, to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices, and to be a bit less uncritical life in small towns. <br /> <br /> If they had been developed as a play first, these criticisms could have been addressed before committing to the material. this film, which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre.
