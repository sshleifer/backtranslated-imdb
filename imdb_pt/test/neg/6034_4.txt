this movie is very bad, aggressive, not well played, not well directed, seems low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and disconnected. after watching the previous comments, I went to see it, but if you try to compare it with the apocalypse now, PLATOON, or any other, you're really off the rails. this movie looks like an old movie purely made in the 1960s with a cast of Neanderthals grown up, not to mention (or really do) without paying attention to details like shifts, low budget fireworks and all kinds of poorly filmed features . it's watchable, though, if you'd like to see it as an initial development of the movie document .. not to go back !! <br /> <br /> p.s - afterall, the guys are fine.
