When I discovered that there was a Christmas holiday 2, I could not wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and watched it as soon as it came through the mailbox. I love all the national lampoons movies with Chevy Chase, and I bet he was glad he was not! I could not believe how bad this was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national satirical film, but believe me! . This movie probably seemed like a good idea on paper with Cousin Eddie as the main character, he started to get on my nerves from the beginning of the movie, and was totally embarrassed in the middle of the movie, and by the end of the movie I had died in brain and could not remember what had happened! .
