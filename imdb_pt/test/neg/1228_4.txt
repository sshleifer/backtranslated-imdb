I, like many people, believe that the 1989 Lonesome Dove epic was one of the best westerns ever produced, perhaps the best. And, realizing that most of the sequences (in this case, a prequel) will certainly disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met this expectation with his marginal direction and acting, poor cast and, frankly, a bad script. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Dove has created Western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Before living in Lonesome Dove, we believe they fought bravely to rid Texas of savage bandits and Indians during their war years. <br /> <br /> If I had only seen Comanche Moon, I would have thought these two idiots were a pair of incompetent and cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae chased Blue Duck all over Texas and were never able to capture or kill him. At Comanche Moon, a shot at Call's heel convinced him to calm down and raise cattle. There was no decent fight or armed struggle throughout the miniseries. The best punch was the idiot McCrea Inez Scull, a funny scene, but out of character for McCrae. <br /> <br /> Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunken and unshaven flirt, was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call, a dispassionate, sullen loner, defies logic. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. Credit is not just for HD technology, but for the director of photography. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights, but unfortunately that does not mean much.
