When you look at the cover and read things about it, a completely different kind of movie comes to mind of what you see here. Then again, I read the summary for the other movie called "Mausolem", since there were two films of this title released at about the same time they both had graphics that had key elements in common. However, reading things about the movie here I know I've seen this and not that one and that the movie is even less what one could imagine a movie with that title would be about. I'll be honest, I expect more of a zombie-like image and you get it in this movie to some degree. However, there are more things involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of people being taken by the coroner at the beginning of the movie will attest. The movie also has the old theme of the children going somewhere that do not belong to having some crazy party, in this case it is actually a mausoleum. The other movie I do not think really has this key feature playing prominent role in the movie and I see that the score for this one is also higher, it was still not the movie I was expecting.
