I found 'Shuttle' an incredibly frustrating movie to watch. It starts quite well and advances quickly until the first 'injury' (which is a doozy). After that, it becomes very lazy and subscribed as a story. It was the case of the plot directing the characters and not the characters directing the plot. If you hate movies where you can not understand why the characters do what they do, you'll loathe 'Shuttle'. Particularly, the last act is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also in the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to his friend, instead of generating sympathy from the public, most people began to laugh. This was probably because the heroines of the story were complete idiots. Finally, there is an ending that seems to be "shocking" and comes from the horror school of "people are bad, audience, so just accept without any explanation". <br /> <br /> 'Shuttle' is not good or bad, but mediocre. It's boring.
