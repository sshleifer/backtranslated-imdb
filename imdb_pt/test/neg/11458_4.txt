I'm glad that this was the last of the Universal Mummy films of the 40's. The films were all of varied qualities and this movie was definitely one of the smaller ones. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it's a very slow movie, in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is happening. Perhaps everything would have been better if the mummy had made its entrance earlier in the film. Instead, the film once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what happened in the previous mummy films, again using archive footage of this time "The Mummy" of 1932, for which this film is the fourth film of the next mummy. the history of the mummy of 1932. The film never knows how to find the right rhythm and even if the film is just over an hour long, it still seems a little annoying. <br /> Of course it also does not help the fact that the film has a rather simplistic and really very uninteresting story. The film also seems quite disjointed. The first and second half of the movie did not connect with each other and they looked like two separate movies on their own. <br /> <br /> At least Lon Chaney Jr. is still there. He again reprises the role of the Kharis mummy for the third time. Too bad he has such a limited screen time this time around. It unfortunately gets very uninteresting, which is also a huge waste of the mummy's own character. The film is even more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing with silly accents. It seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and really get a little disturbing and annoying at some points. <br /> <br /> The mummy movies that are less worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
