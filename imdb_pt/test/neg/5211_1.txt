How the hell did those guys get money to make that movie? Lack of script is one thing, but cinematography makes you want to cry. A portable camera can be of great value for the look of a movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what you're doing. I am well aware that the actors are amateurs, but have no defense, as the director may be the least talented he has ever directed in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if he (or any member of staff) was paid money to make a movie again. This film simply provides fuel for the argument that many films are made in Sweden every year.
