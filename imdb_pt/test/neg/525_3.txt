Some aspects of this production are good, like those of Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance of Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She slauters the songs with her raucous voice and overacts into a role she clearly does not understand. I also think the chorus is not good. They drag the time and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is fine, but Sweeney Todd can be a lot more if done properly. This production does not come close to the level this material requires. The version of the show with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
