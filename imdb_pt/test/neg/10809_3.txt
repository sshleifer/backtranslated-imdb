OK, I read the director's comment about this movie (presented as the 'front-end comment'), and I have to admit that I can identify with his position. <br /> <br /> Micheal, I hope your career has recovered from this. particular setback and you went on to other better things. I saw this movie in MST3K form. Even with all the cut-off continuity and inaccurate comments being thrown by the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to fight under the limited budget and the limited actors available to it. And this is one of those films ("Mitchell" is another) where the MST3K team took a lot of cheap shots on the main character even when she really deserved better. You know they had some unfair fun at the actress's expense because it made for a more upbeat episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the movie actually tried to be ABOUT something, and had some decent and effective moments here and there, should keep it out of 'Bottom 100' ("Tangents / Time Chasers "is another movie with a plot and a heart that does not deserve to be there too). <br /> <br /> But it's still not a very good movie. I do not blame the lead actress for being who she is. It's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could perform a vanity project like this or take a feature film. Writing and characterization are amateurish and careless, and dialogue almost never meets ABC Afterschool Special standards. The cast sincerely gives its best effort, and acting in general is definitely head-and-shoulders above abortions like "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but there is no really professional level here, except for "Big Joe" Estevez, who is strong but adequately intense. I've never seen the full original cut, but MST's sampling of "Soultaker" was representative enough to make those facts clear. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie has Robert Z'Dar. That is, IMO, a true 'Kiss of Death' for any movie you expect to be taken seriously. Yeah, he's big and scary in his role, but I hate the guy as an actor. (In real life, I wish you good luck and hope he is financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> There were few things I liked about the movie. For example, the camaraderie between the male protagonist and his dead companion added a bit of warmth and humor to the film and made it much more watchable. The idea of ​​an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the Afterlife was an inspired way of invoking some frightening vibrations without having special effects, and I respected whoever worked on it in the script in an attempt to keep the budget manageable. It really did not work, but it might have been with a little more tweaking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mr. Rissi, better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this flaw would not keep me from watching the other thing you did if the buzz was good. And Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the movie was not that bad.
