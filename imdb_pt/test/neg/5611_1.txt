This movie had so much potential to be hilarious, but moving, but it fell far short of anyone. It had a great plot, it simply was not executed as well as it could have been. The strange "hallucinations" during their sleep scenes made no sense and were definitely not needed, did not impact or enhance or give any understanding of what was to come or would happen. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder's character was OK, but could have been expanded more. He played the bad part he got at his best. The character was funny, but once again it fell short of what it might have been. <br /> <br /> Mila's character was perfect and her performance was spot on. At closing, the writing was horrible and more often than not, it did not make sense and its hallucinations did not fit the film. This movie, with best script and direction, could have been a contender of the National Lampoon Vacation, regarding the funny and bad things that happen to a person on a trip through America. <br /> <br /> Instead, he deserved a second flush. If I had seen this in the theater, I would have demanded my money back and boycotted the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie did was waste an hour and a half of my life. It also got everyone involved in the movie to look bad, simply because the movie was bad. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone! Ever!
