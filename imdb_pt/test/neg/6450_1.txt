The Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I'm sure Mr. Osmond wanted to make a heartfelt and heartwarming Christmas film, this one is as cynical and scary as they come. The religious meaning of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute children, ignorant adults and stupid villains. The production values ​​show that this was filmed with little money or by truly inexperienced filmmakers - I suspect the latter, unfortunately. The worst part, oddly enough, is actually the music. You would think that someone with a long musical career could do better than the title song, but you would be wrong. Even my mother did not like this movie, and she likes Osmonds stuff and humor.
