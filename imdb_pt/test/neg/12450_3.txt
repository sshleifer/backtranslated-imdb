Heavy and slow film, with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely sites and clothes to admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who does a handsome job as usual. I wanted to laugh out loud with the narration - so silly! But Dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This movie is worth seeing just to see it .... and it looks like it went into a penniless, penniless novel. His time would be best spent watching Mr. Dalton in "Wuthering Heights", 1970, or the early 1980s, in the BBC version of "Jane Eyre." Poor Sela Ward, so beautiful but so wood ... certainly she has been better at other movies.
