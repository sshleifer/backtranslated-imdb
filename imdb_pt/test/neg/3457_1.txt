The depiction of Ichabod Crane's character was so terribly unpleasant, that my wife and I expected the knight (or some other character) not only to cut off Crane's head, but to do it slowly and painfully. I mean, this Brent Carver guy played on top of it - like he's on Broadway. And he was such an implacable idiot that we had no sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> I could continue with specific criticisms of how this movie failed, but I'd rather not devote to energy. <br /> <br /> Just skip and go to the Johnny Depp version. Either that, or rent the Sleepy Hollow Haunted Pumpkin (lively). It's very good - fun for kids and adults alike. <br /> <br /> Better yet, read Washington Irving's original story.
