THE STAR PACKER is one of the roughly 152,000,000 westerns that John Wayne performed during the 1930s. Well, the number is a bit overdone, but it looked almost like that. This is because these B movies were made quickly with very low budgets to be the second or least feature in a movie theater. Most Bs were very cheap and tended to cut costs to keep costs down and STAR PACKER was no exception. To save on costs, incidental music was not used, run times were kept under an hour, writing was often quite derivative and the actors were largely smaller talents - and Wayne himself was definitely far from being a family name at this time. Some of Wayne's resources are very good, while others, like this one, are watched, but they are also silly and inconsequential. I liked this movie and most of the others, but it's probably because I gave a lot of slack to Bs. Wayne stars as John Travers - an American Marshall investigating the actions of a local gang in a chase locations they leave and steal from the stage. This is strange, since the movie was apparently set in or near modern times, since they used modern telephones and machine guns - things you would not expect to find in the Wild West. Such anachronisms are actually very common in B Westerns - as Gene Autry's films (for example) are plentiful. Wayne's sidekick is Yak - played by Wayne's real life stuntman and friend, Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> The villain is an unknown figure called "The Shadow" and he distributes his instructions through a black screen. who hides his face! That sounds exactly like a character in a series of movies - the kind of villain the kids loved, but the adults moaned because they were so foolish and a little bit like Blofeld or dr. Evil! The problem is that if you listen to his voice and pay attention, it becomes obvious at the beginning of the movie that this "shadow" is George Hayes. Now talking about Hayes, this is the same guy who later in the movies became known as Gabby Hayes, but here and in several other Wayne movies, he looks and acts NOTHING like Gabby. In THE STAR PACKER, he was well-groomed, articulate and well-shaved - imagine that! In real life, this was apparently the real George Hayes - though I doubt he was evil! Now as you can tell in the last paragraph there really is no mystery in this movie. You are left with acting (passable and nothing more) and acrobatics - which were actually quite amazing. Again and again, one startling trick after another occurred-like men jumping from horse to horse and some great fighting scenes-all done, by the way, by Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often the double in John Wayne movies - and this went on for decades. The problem with some of the acrobatics, however, is that it seems that the filmmakers actually killed a few horses to get those great "stumbling horses" seen later in the film. Until about 1940, the filmmakers often tied fine metal strings and ran at full speed on horseback! In the process, the horses' legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently slaughtered! One of the worst examples of this was the film JESSE JAMES - where several horses were brutally killed - prompting the American Humane Association to insist that a representative of the organization make filming to make sure that the animals are NOT injured in production. So, since 1940, the movies carry that little warning. The STAR PACKER was made well before the disclaimer and I can not see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is at best a time-passer due to a poor plot, occasionally poor acting and unbelievable cruel attitude toward horses. I'm not a bleeding heart, but I just can not understand this disrespect for an old, poor animal.
