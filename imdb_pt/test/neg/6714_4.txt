"The Foreigner" is a tale of intrigue with Seagal in the center as a deep cover agent who has a package that everyone wants and is willing to kill to get. The film is little inspired by less of the usual action material that put Seagal on the movie map (fire fighting, melee combat, pyrotechnics, acrobatics, etc.) and more of a story that is complicated, uninteresting and full of filler meaningless. What action there seems token and gratuitous, while Seagal, looking more and more like a pork chop, snakes through this insipid film without expression and bored, while not manifesting improvement in the ability to act. Somewhere around "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below," Seagal's movies took a nosedive and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of that trend. Nothing here is worth watching, except for the diehard Seagal fans. (W-)
