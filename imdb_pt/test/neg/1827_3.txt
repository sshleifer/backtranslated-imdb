This is a really bad picture. It does not offer anything original or original or even interesting. <br /> <br /> A medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is involved in macabre medical experiments. Of course, she gets involved in solving the strange deaths at school. This movie started promising with some cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while alive and tries to escape after he wakes up, but then even those failures and the rest of the special effects are routine plastic models of the human body and that blood of unrealistic appearance that these second-rate horror films always seem to have. <br /> <br /> And as if the routine plot and bad acting were not enough, this movie had subtitles. which often do not even match the dubbed English that you hear being spoken and then adds that to the mouth movement that does not match the dubbing ... well let's just say that trying to coordinate it all in your head is not worth it for this mediocre movie. <br /> <b I was, at least, counting on a bit of skin in this movie and, except for a bit during the opening credits, this movie also did not yield that. <br /> <br /> This is a routine mill routine. horror movie / gore --- short on horror and gore.Skip this movie unless "Ernest goes to camp" is the only rental remaining.
