When I saw the poster in the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast that was worth trying. But after I got in, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There were many nonsense and logical failures. For me, it's a movie that is not worth showing in theaters. Not worth seeing.
