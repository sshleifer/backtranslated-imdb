We can conclude that there are 10 kinds of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand binary and those who do not understand. Those who understand binary put this movie in their grave along with hackers, while those who appreciate this movie for the good that none of these crap could happen. Ever. <br /> <br /> For a movie try to be a modern movie with fiction applied to it. He failed. Horribly. Only an 11 year old and below can enjoy and only 30 years and could even be afraid to have their identity taken. It loses in the main market for a resale value (I see now that it is more annoying than when it was first released).
