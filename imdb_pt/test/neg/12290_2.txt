I saw this in the store and thought about trying. It sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. That's it. The characters looked good, and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, although he did not have much time in the film. I find it very difficult to give a bad rating to a movie, but this is one, in a tiny number, that gives me my book. As the film went together I kept wanting it to be better, but to no avail. Astetically, it was good. The sound and lighting were good, but the acting in that movie killed me. It was like watching a low-grade soap opera. I just kept saying, "I can not believe they made that move like that." I stopped several times out of pure disbelief that the acting was so bad. There's a lot I want to say, but I'll say it, everything else, for the most part, was good, it was acting, as a final cut, that really made this movie.
