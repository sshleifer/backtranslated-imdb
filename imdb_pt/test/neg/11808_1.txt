The video box for "Joyride" says "starring the second-generation superstars," and no one can stop feeling sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith moved on to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? So being the pathetic grabber of attention in the box, I was foolish enough to buy the movie for a dollar thinking I'd be in the land of the movies "so bad they're good in the '70s." While so many 1970s non-purpose movies (or plain old 1970s movies) have tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, 'Joyride' does not even try. It's just aimless. It is devoid of any interest. Each character is so poorly conceived that it is no wonder that these actors seem so apathetic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the movie has about three people in their 20s who go to Alaska to start a business, but they are stolen. have to find work. They are beaten, eat dog food, steal cars, steal banks. It's all very typical, but, above all, it runs in the most mundane way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the characters' actions are so ambiguous that you can lose a lot of scenes and not mind at all. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then this is a must-see. This is still not enough to achieve this above the lowest rating I can give. <br /> <br /> Better Line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * outside of ****
