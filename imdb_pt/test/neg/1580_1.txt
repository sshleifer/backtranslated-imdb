I watched this movie a while ago and the only thing I remember about the movie is how absolutely horribly bad it was definitely in my 5 worst movies I've ever seen. And to think that I had to persuade my friends to make this movie. In the video store, my reputation has been shaken because of this movie, will my comrades trust me again? I doubt it, they always say do not judge something by the hood, they were right when I saw the hood skins / boys gangs I thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal bars. Do not watch this movie. I can not think of anything else to say that acting is bad. The story is bad, it's just bad.
