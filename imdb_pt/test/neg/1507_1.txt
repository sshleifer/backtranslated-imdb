I watched this movie at a party, we were very intrigued by the end, it ended up pretty poor. even if the whole movie was not so amazing, I was expecting something a little better. This movie is pure junk, but I suggest you watch it if you find cheap horror movies with a pretty funny weird script. Personally I loved the ad, it was my overall highlight, the fight scenes were basic, a shot from a knife, a few shadows in a window, fake blood. I must say that Grandma's fantasy was pretty scary. This film is a mixture of killing joy, camp blood and marshy stream 2, except that this film has a color treatment and camera wok a little better compared to camp blood.
