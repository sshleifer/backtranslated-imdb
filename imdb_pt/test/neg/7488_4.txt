Clearly, Andreas Bethmann would like to wear the crown of Jess Franco while coveting (at least cinematographically) the wife of the old worker, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt, lascivious and masturbatory prison director in this modern and ambitious W.I.P. movie. With a few exceptions, many of Franco's films are ineptly produced and directed in a hurried and sloppy manner. The shots do not always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrible. While watching "Angel of Death 2" (also known as "Prison Island Massacre"), I wondered if Bethmann was deliberately trying to replicate Franco's patent falsity, or is he of course poor quality as his mentor? This movie is deliberately bad, what would be self-destructive, or is it simply bad for negligence? After a hitchhiker is forced to blow a hole in the tip of the gun, his rapist fills his mouth, then fills his vagina with some drugs. Minutes later, she is dragged into a prison on the top of a cliff for reasons unexplained and subjected to hares and the rough handling of officials and other inmates. As this is a WIP movie, there are plenty of lesbian scenes and a lot of violent behavior. The blood is also bloody and sadistic, with delights like pulling teeth and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are thighs, but there is a love of sloppiness in every frame and an understanding of what garbage fans like. Unfortunately, simple script makes a flat movie. So, despite countless atrocities, hardcore sex and a special guest appearance by Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But is not that what most of Jess Franco's films are?
