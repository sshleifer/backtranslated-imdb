This movie begins with a man who seems to be some kind of sports driver. He meets a gang that contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never talks, and a woman who spins between the three. The group called Satan's Angels wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no, but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check them out. They steal an arms shop in a ridiculously lost scene. The scene involves the woman entering the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses. She says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to carry the gun to show how. She then picks up the shopkeeper and shoots him. The other three in the gang (excluding Rod) rush to the store. They take everything from the walls and then play with it as if the children received their toys on Christmas Day. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly does not waste valuable time with a plot.
