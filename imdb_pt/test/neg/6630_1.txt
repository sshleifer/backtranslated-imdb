Should I have expected something other than putrid from carrot? This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "Chairman of the Board" did not add humor to my attitude, but it infuriated me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian I was furious because this man is making movies.
