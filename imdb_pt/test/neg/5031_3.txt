I was not making big assumptions about the fact that this was certainly a very, very free adaptation of Eça de Queiroz's work, and I must say that this free adaptation forms the book as a bunch of possible good ideas and characters. The problem is the way it is done, without any care, without any taste, just a bang of bad taste clichés everywhere. The script is so fake and the characters are so unreal that it makes cool actors like Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lizard and others, get lost in a network of anything except cinema or storytelling. To my surprise, newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves, bravely, maintain their performances, but you may see them lost as a boat without direction. And speaking in the direction, this seems to be something totally absent in this film, where is the director? Everything is bad taste; the frames are whatever and whenever the use of the handheld camera without any justified reason, the design of light that must build environments does not exist (and there are no excuses that the main point is a grim real story) . The general problem in this movie "trying to be" is that I do not like, or very, very bad taste. It's sad to see Jorge and Soraia melting into fake and free sex scenes, painted here and there through the film as narrative closing holes or used as fake transitional motifs. Maybe Carlos Coelho da Silva sees Carlos Carrera's 2002 adaptation of the same book from Eça and discover how to build a true movie.
