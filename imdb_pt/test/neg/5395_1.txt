I have it in The Horror Six-Pack of Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. This is not the worst movie of all time, but it's still a drug. Actually, this movie sucked, I do not know how I'm going to write this review, especially since 1. I took it from the DVD player because I could not even watch another second and 2. Damn Hurricane Ike is coming and God knows how long until I do this review. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scientist and his wife. The scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this so-called Urban Legend known as the Skeleton Man kills him and later his wife. So ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but there's not much else to say on this point, unless you do not mind. I am currently using the disc as a roller coaster, and if you see this, you may want to do the same. Casper Van Dien and Michael Rooker must have needed money ... BADLY! <br /> <br /> PS. I'll pretty much review the movies in the boxset and do a new review on the IV Ghoulies.
