I have to say that I had low expectations for the movie before viewing it. Everyone around me said it was great, but I knew perfectly well what they liked. They like the music of Aerosmith that is really great, they like the amazing special effects that had fallen a lot, they like the comic side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who according to my opinion is a terrible actor who did not try to be one, failed and now it is nothing. And all those things, plus the reviews and ratings I read on the internet, gave me a clue that the movie would be a big disappointment, since I'm a big disaster kind of movie fan. Well, I'm right, but at least I was prepared. <br /> <br /> The movie is really commercial. It's been said, but I'll say it again. We have over 100 million budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors who are popular with rarely agreeing to become part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names do not are written with large letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are highly respected actors and that I also really like. They could play many characters in many different types of movies. They could improvise, they could transform tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. Overall, they could turn small movies into really interesting, entertaining or dramatic films, people love and always love. Like Fargo in the case of Buscemi or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm very disappointed they participated in Armageddon. Thornton plays an intelligent and refined man involved in politics, if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the deep drill team members that is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid that is about to disappear from the world. <br /> <br /> What I did not like - well, I guess I was already understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is monotonous, naive and silly. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic end that is ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that can be considered as art. At least it is not so obvious that the film is made for financial purposes. Otherwise, bad performances by all the big stars. The jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and, sometimes, they do not make any sense. In fact, I recently read that on the stage, Ben Affleck asked Bay whether it would be easier if they taught the astronauts to drill, than the drillers became astronauts, and Bay's answer was simply "Shut up!" which is a very funny story that perfectly shows the despair of the creators. <br /> <br /> And putting it together, I'll give you an explanation because I give 4 for the movie. Well, I like "I do not want to miss a thing" and I was impressed by the special effects that are obviously the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the only two good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is a middleweight director, but The Rock and the Bad Boys have been hundreds of times better than Armageddon, which was, is and always will be a big bad movie.
