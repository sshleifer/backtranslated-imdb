First of all I loved the book, more than the most popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I want to watch Angles and Demons again. <br /> <br /> The film hardly remembers the book, in fact just the general premise of the story is there. From the beginning of the film I was disappointed, in the book Robert Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Whoever finds his father's body (can not remember his name) and asks Langdon to come in using the super-fast airplane ... In the book, the only people who knew about the technology Father and Daughter's team had created were them themselves. and the camerlingo ... In the film, however, there was a huge team involved ... so the tension was never there ... how they discovered it etc. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside or changing that Every part of the story was a big mistake and it was in my mind what made a bad movie ... changed everything that happened from then on, when Camerlingo was confronted in the closed room of the pope, it should have been Maximilian Kohler who fired the video of his wheelchair, the commander ran to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti, in the film was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot ... err I think I got it right but I was bored and can not remember the events of the movie) ... There was no love interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she was not at CERN when he arrived and was actually brought in from his research work. In the book all four preferratti were killed, but in the film the last of the four survived the source. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they who killed the Murderer in the Church of the Illuminati, not exploded as he was in the movie by Camerlingo. The part where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, except for his Mickey mouse clock alarm. OK in the book, we are led to believe that Langdon escaped the helicopter, enough to say that this was a bit tricky but it was important in the movie because he had to rush back with the movie ... It was no mention of how Vittoria and his adoptive father got involved, this was also important to know the character of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In all the worst movies I've seen, I would have left early, but my brain went numb and I temporarily lost use of my legs. Really a very reeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa: I want my money back !!!
