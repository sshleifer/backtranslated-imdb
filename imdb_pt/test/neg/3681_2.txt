I was hooked on the premise that the show was about demons. From hell. And a door to hell. What I did not realize was that I'd be watching some guys running in tunnels chased by little kids who may not have been demons for the whole movie. Of course there was some dialogue between them, and a great underground scenario, but the lack of a plot, developed characters, any twists or developments in history, was extremely inadequate. Oh, and out of interest, there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on actor salaries, sets and a lot of time running with a camera underground. <br /> <br /> The ending was one of the typical boring and boring endings that makes you say "I endured this boring movie for this !?" If you want to see demons and an entrance to hell, I promise you that it would be better to watch the trailers to Hellgate: London, which although smaller than this movie in 5 minutes, includes more dialogues, character development, action, plot and satisfactory conclusions than this. <br /> <br /> The second star is for the effort, but overall a low score for not making a movie that stands out, and for promising in the slogan much more than what was delivered.
