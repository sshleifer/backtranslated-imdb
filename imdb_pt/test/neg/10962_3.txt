This movie was horrible especially considering the work that must have come into its production. Although not as bad as Ax 'Em, it's awful. Take into account the obvious mistakes of Gladiator and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you gain? This mix of horrible makeup and wood performance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins like most zombie movies these days. An assembly of interesting jumps cuts and an outbreak radio transmission by hand. We see our hero (Ryn, possibly the worst 'zombie hunter' in the modern era, counted about four or five times when he scratched his gun barrel or looked at the barrel as he blew) cutting off zombie fingers. Later, we learn that these fingers are collected by rewards. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing zombies; going so far as to buy chum * gasp * from his French friend Hans (who is not really French, speaks with a Middle Eastern accent). As Ryn uses his friend to collect an abundant reward from Lost Hills, all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> And it makes clear the horror of the movie. The zombies are together very badly. I saw comments praising his makeup, but he was quite amateur in my opinion. Obvious Halloween stickers were used to make the faces of zombies and there were stitches where a girl appeared to be wearing a clown mask rather than a freshly stripped face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To sum up the next sixty minutes in a few lines: Ryn is back stabbed by Hans (who made a deal with some other zombie hunters, Blythe being the leader), gives him a second chance, back stabbed again by Hans, then shoots Hans and arrives at Union City where he meets Blythe is poisoning the cities for profit. <br /> <br /> That's really about the plot. When Ryn arrives in Union City, all thugs are gathered in a house that is obviously so big that it takes Ryn hours to get to the top floor. People die, Ryn lives, and the movie ends with one of those cynics "will he kill himself?" scenes. END SPOILERS I'm going to have to blame most of this mess on Nott. The direction was awful. Each character had a different scowl from Hans, who was easily the best 'actor' in this group of MacBeth tailings. When they arrive in Union City, a group of zombies attacks the crew and zombies are not given tips or ideas on how to walk as if their appendages are rotten. A woman is swaying as if she is swimming in the air on a Sunday stroll. <br /> <br /> Some movies are horrible. This movie is one of them simply based on how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing. It works occasionally, but in this respect (where the story was already in tatters), this does not happen. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you want a decent laugh.
