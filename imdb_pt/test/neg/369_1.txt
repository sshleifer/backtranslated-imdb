I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and imitate them in every episode of South Park (if they do not show it, then mention it) and love to mock and play and make fun of themselves too, but I felt that mockumentary <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the most common theme running in the "documentary" is that the episodes are meaningless garbage pieces that they throw only for the money. Obviously, this is completely false if you bother to watch any episode, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." is said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters. The creators are also portrayed as pompous and arrogant assholes who only care about money, including a supposedly funny scene but that is not involving Isaac Hayes delivering lines to Chef (by phone) and Trey Parker screaming and yelling at him for sucking and hanging . I think it should be funny, but the pretense to it really made ... shudder. <br /> <br /> The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the edge, all for cash only, in the end. Completely false, obviously, and all a joke, but not funny. It's disturbing, even if it's just a joke.
