VIVA LA BAM This spin-off of "Jackass" focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, despite having its share of gross comedy and crazy acrobatics, focuses mainly on Bam's torture of his parents. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that, Bam, but ... you're not as cool as you think you are. This ego show is not only painfully bland (and yes, I liked Jackass) but also narcissistic beyond belief. The overly stylized intro ends with Bam explaining coldly that he will do "whatever he wants". How about you do something that's really funny? I liked "Jackass" for what it was worth. The camera work was horrible - any idiot could have done a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt bored among the crazy, dangerous, or simply disgusting acrobatics that the friends did Not so with "Viva la Bam". We follow our hero as he makes jokes with his friends and tortures his relatives, but never feels like anything but a really dumb and scripted comedy. The acrobatics and jokes are slightly fun, but presented in such a tedious and boring way that they can barely make you smile. <br /> <br /> "Viva la Bam" is a poor spin-off that does little good, but feed the already large ego of Margera. I would not recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.
