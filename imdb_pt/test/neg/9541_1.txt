If a copy of that film fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I'm a big fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of bad movies, but there's not a letter in the alphabet that can adequately describe this rancid part of solidified vomit. This movie even goes beyond the "so bad it's good" phase and goes straight to the "so bad that your world will seem a little less meaningful to have watched" stage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say which is more disturbing: .1. The fact that the people who wrote this thought that their political satire (I use the term very, very, very loosely) was witty enough to film. They were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this trash for obviously little or no money. That someone really thought it would be a good idea to get this crap for distribution on a horror anthology DVD. If I were a weaker man, I would probably have stuck grapefruit spoons into my eyes and then blindly threw myself to my death in the approaching traffic after watching this. However, I live, but I am always marked by experience.
