Yeeee-Haa! <br /> <br /> I've seen that most American movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that Hollywood is so in love with its only truly original creation that it continues to reinvent the cowboy myth. I'm not sure I totally bought this argument, but Slipstream is evidence in support of the theory; It's a cowboy movie with planes. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's better than that. It's a Western Spagetti with planes! Replace the airplanes with horses, make the droid a priest, and this movie would be indistinguishable from any of a dozen "throw-in-awake" pretensions of "the seventies" of Spanish Italy. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as bad as I had been led to believe for some of the comments I had read here, but it certainly was not good.
