A man is taken from a London street and taken to a foreign country, where he is tortured as a terrorist suspect. It was boring and banal, and I was bored a lot. One more idea than a movie. I was in the middle of this 77-minute movie when I realized I had no idea who someone was on the screen. It was as if they took all the other similar films and removed all ideas and put them in a place without the real notion of character. Certainly his well acted with passion, but there is no emotional center, there is only one kind of ordinary man that filmmakers feel enough. It is not. And while the story presented is, in theory, important as a warning, the film is too monotonous to convince anyone about it, especially if one has watched other better movies of a similar genre (Reese Witherspoon's interpretation, for example).
