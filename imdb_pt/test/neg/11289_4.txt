Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and belligerent athlete of all time. His baseball career was unmatched in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played was a spectacle of human skill and cruelty. So of course, the film about him does not deal with any of this, instead focusing on writing his biography by author Al Stump. Now that's not such a horrible idea in theory, since Cobb himself slid further into paranoid dementia as the years progressed, and the stories of his crazed outbursts, even as seniors, are shocking even by today's desensitized standards . But instead of focusing on those events, which I think was simply very interesting, the film is a pseudo-fictionalized road movie with a cliché plot cliché that will make any Cobb fan know how to cry tears of vinegar. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones does very well as an eccentric Cobb, but somehow manages to overdo the supervillainy of his cartoons. Most stories about Cobb are hardly believable, but making it even crazier seems impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, portraying the writer Al Stump, is a somber vortex of nonexistent talents. He sucks the life out of all the scenes, trying to make this film his own Nagasaki. There's a reason why we never see him as a leader again. (Arliss does not count, it's just a show.) Even the inevitable "reversal of roles" of Cobb and Stump to the end becomes even worse because of his sheer inability to utter words that do not sound like a poor book on the voice of taped narration. <br /> <br /> For all the horrible writing and production of bland movies on display, there is a sequence that stands out as so superior to the rest of that flaw that accepting the film is almost impossible. A streamlined hyper flashback sequence exhibiting Cobb's overwhelming psychology and brutal athleticism, while actually playing the baseball game, is pure glow. The camera moves bizarrely and the whole event looks like a dream due to the Cobb monster's unique gameplay style. Each slide, hit, and tackle are rendered more forcefully due to improved sound, and Tommy Lee Jones has the intensity of the master player. It makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of Cobb at his peak with the same actor. It pays to watch the movie for some incredible minutes, just to see what could have happened. <br /> <br /> I may be a bit unfair to this movie because of my knowledge of Ty Cobb and want it to be something it is not, but making such a boring and neutral movie about this maniac is absurd. I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has slipped since.
