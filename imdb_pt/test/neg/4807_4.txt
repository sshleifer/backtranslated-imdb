I am a big fan of prison dramas that is reflected in OZ being my favorite American TV show of all time. I think the appeal is in a kind of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen in the bad men's pants, but I found Don Siegel's BLOODY IN CELL BLOCK 11 somewhat disappointing. Okay, I knew since it was made in 1954, it would be devoid of bad language, rape graphics and collective rape, but nonetheless it is a rather weak film compared to the portrait of the prison in previous films like EACH DAWN I DIE and WHITE HEAT . The problem lies in the serenity of the film, with the leader of the troopers, Dunn, being a kind of prison reformer. Yes, this sounds ridiculous, since he is a violent anti-hero, instead of hugging a fragile tree on a salary, but that's what he is in essence, he wants to see rehabilitated prisoners to join society instead of to suffer. There is also a problem of making a B movie with such radical themes (quite ironic that Siegel later would make DIRTY HARRY where the only good criminal is a dead) and that the cast is not very good with Emile Meyer as the guard being especially annoying performance. How did I say a disappointing movie?
