I suppose I should be fair and emphasize that I do not believe in ghosts. Having said that, I am very interested in the subject and enjoy a scary story as much as the next guy. I am a fan of Ghost Hunters, because they at least try to give a scientific angle to their investigations. Even the first episodes of Haunted had an entertainment factor for them. The paranormal state has none of these qualities. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so many "reality shows" these days, he suffers from overproduction, poor acting and foolish scripts. The creators of the program admit that writers "guide" the stories. I've heard that they're even going to shoehorn in a novel subplot to appeal to the young female demographic. The show has many other flaws as well. As others have stated, narration quickly becomes like nails on the chalkboard. Superior visual and sound effects quickly become irritating. I am willing to suspend some disbelief because of entertainment, but this whole "demon with a vengeance" is simply ridiculous. Given that the producers of this program are also responsible for brain feeding, such as Laguna Beach's MTV and Newport Harbor, I suppose this is not a surprise. If you're a fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big reality show addict, I think you'll find a lot to like at Paranormal State. For the rest of us .... I recommend you avoid.
