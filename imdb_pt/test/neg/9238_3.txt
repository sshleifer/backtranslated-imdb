**** It will probably contain spoilers **** After a successful attempt to get attention (I would not care to make sure you get help before dying a "failed suicide attempt" ), Joey discovers that she is pregnant and begins to see images of spirits. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was a bit slow, but fun enough to watch the whole thing. For a horror movie, there were only a few little shivers and emotions. Halfway through, however, it was a very good and scary scene (I will not give up) :) I watched this movie because I really liked the previous movie, The Eye. I was a bit confused, however, to determine that, in addition to being a "supernatural thriller" of the same creators, The Eye 2 had no relation to The Eye, * any *; different cast, different story. The Eye2 has nothing to do with the eyes: The film had some questionable scenes: Joey tries suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time when the witnesses say they saw Joey trying to jumping in front of the train), she is associated with the brutally defaced of an attacker, she goes crazy in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to take care of her business freely, without even an evaluation psychiatric or hospital (for reasons other than pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The movie was not the greatest horror movie, the story was pretty far-fetched (even for a fictional movie: P), the ghosts were few and / or nothing we have not seen before. However, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what the "truth" is behind the ghosts, it was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story. <br /> I rated the movie 3 of 10
