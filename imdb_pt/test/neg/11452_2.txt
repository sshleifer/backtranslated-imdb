This movie was from 67 of the 71 best photos I saw, by far the worst. First of all, I found the plot a bit absurd - the husband absent for 25 years / still in love / not even a letter! Give me some time. And why the guy who'd been away for so long, coincidentally working on an oil rig next to the congress woman's party? This movie also exhibited some of the worst stereotypes of African-Americans I've ever seen. It makes Gone With the Wind (see Prissy) seem downright progressive! I barely saw a movie that I did not like so much. UGH!
