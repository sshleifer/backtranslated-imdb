What the hell was the point of this dull movie? It looked very interesting at first, but quickly fell flat on the floor. is supposed to be based on a true story, but to cry aloud, there are no more Hollywood writers? dude I saw these guys in some of the best movies ever made, defoe can play just about anything and when I see he's in a movie I have no problem renting him, but I'm starting to amaze myself. great actor is also slipping; maybe its hard or just losing its senses. the dialogue was long and terribly heavy, especially at home with the family. I wonder if the actors thought they had a hit around here? maybe ... uh ... an Oscar?
