I am currently 22 years old and I remember seeing this movie in theaters when it first came out. You heard me well, I was 5 years old, and yet I distinctly remember what I saw that afternoon so many years ago. Was it a mystical journey through Mark Twain's fantastic world of creativity? ... No, on the other hand, it was a rather scary movie about Mark Twain's dark, depressed, and suicidal side. One scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain is playing the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Would an adult love this movie? Well, this movie possibly presents some interesting points of view that a person with a practical knowledge of Mark Twain writing might like; but trust me, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to use to introduce your kids to Mark Twain.
