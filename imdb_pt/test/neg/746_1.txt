Hand shaking cameras (this piece was filmed for television, not you, movie) not only keep you fully aware of how horrible the cinematography in this film is, but makes you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story. Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave. All I can say is that if you liked the novel, stop there, until the BBC creates one of your smart and sensible masterpieces (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, who, speaking for what I imagine in my opinion , Austen would have revered). The BBC would never dare to overdose cheese saxophone solos and Indigo girl would yell a photo of a historic castle and a loving hug. Giles Foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the song for The Specialist. If you want Austen as you love her, look for the BBC logo ...
