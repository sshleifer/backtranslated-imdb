Undoubtedly, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Bad acting. Poor script. Poor management and poor production. <br /> <br /> Why did they bother? This whole movie was total nonsense. The suspension of disbelief can only take a degree, but that pushes the boundaries completely. <br /> <br /> For a movie without humor content, the audience laughed disturbingly often.
