I have not read either the book on which the film is based or the letters between Vita and Violet. If I came to this film with any expectation, perhaps it was the Bloomsbury group (including, among others, Virginia Woolf, of which the Nicolsons were part) being represented. It was not, which however was not a problem for me. What I'm wondering is how the people behind this movie have managed to make it, in my opinion, very uninteresting and repetitive and most of the characters despite the great material and some really good actors. The script simply is not good enough. I agree with the criticisms of my Finnish neighbor - many scenes of senseless sex (but only among women, although there is nothing explicit about Harold's numerous love affairs), many senseless scenes in general, little background information of the characters. . It seems strange, considering the quality of production - on the surface, it seems like a really ambitious job, but the script has, of course, the biggest weight and that's where that film fails. <br /> <br /> Vita's relationship with Harold seemed unconvincing to me, though both of them acted very well, especially her. The way they continued to declare their unconditional love for each other in a somewhat mellow way, I thought, well, just plain unconvincing. It makes a lot more sense than it should have happened through letters, as tmmvds points out that I would also like to know where the nicknames came from - the Russians * just like Mar - why is someone called Vita, given the nickname Mar.? It may be a small thing, but it is important to contribute to the bigger picture. <br /> <br /> * I watched the film with English subtitles, and where apparently Mitya should have said, instead, Medea said. That may explain my frustration with the nicknames to some extent - I could not understand why the Vita should be Greek while the Violet was Russian!
