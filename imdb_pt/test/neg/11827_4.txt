I liked the Takashi Miike movies that I had seen so far, but I found this very disappointing. I bought it, but I will not keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on DVD Adness, which has only two episodes. In the first, a killer kidnaps women, cuts the top of their skull to expose the brain, plants them on the floor to the chin and plants a flower in the brain. You can say this in the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred by static TV. If you had not seen the DVD box, the viewer would not know what people were looking for until later a young police officer produced a small body model. Strangely, there is also a flash picture later on the woman's head and is not censored. Also, I'm not sure what was going on. Some women get phone calls, and a sketchy animated character circulates when this happens. An animated character also appears on TV screens sometimes. It is not clear if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are being cut off and their babies are missing. Again, a policeman produces a model of how corpses are, which is useful, since again the actual body is censored. There is also a natural birth in the film, but strangely even this baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions were not retained when this was originally done. Perhaps, even if they did, if they knew they would be censored, they might not bother to really show anything ...? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> If I know that later episodes are better, maybe I'll look for them. As it is, I will not bother.
