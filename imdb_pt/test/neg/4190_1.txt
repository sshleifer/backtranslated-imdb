This movie was so bad that I do not know where to start, apparently neither the filmmakers. It starts with a guy in his late thirties until he is forty years old watching TV. The news speaks of a corn maze that is open for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God knows what and runs off to save his children who are entering a labyrinth of cornfields and are somehow connected to this "vision" How do you ask? I do not know, and like I said before nor the filmmakers. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did he get these "visions"? It's never explained, we just have to agree with it. He enters the labyrinth to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he is looking for pass by him, since they actually find him. What he does? Does he run after them? No. He stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just passed. Do the girls stop? No. They run away and ask, "Was it Daddy?" Then someone dressed as a demon jumps on the "star" (the character of Daddy), he hits a pathetic fight only to find that he is a worker in the haunted maze. The police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a very bad term to use), they handcuff you. They put their hands in front of him, so he can find something to get the lock, what he does. Firstly, anyone who has ever been arrested knows that cops hold their hands behind their backs and, secondly, why does this "common guy" seem to know how to tighten the handcuffs? Well, he ends up moving away from the police officers who give up and leave after the "star" wife fires the siren in the police car as a distraction. By the way, now it's night and all the workers who run the labyrinth seem to have left once the sun has set. Leaving a man who attacked one of his workers and two missing children in the maze. Considering it was a slow night that these are your only customers, why not. Besides the cops, apparently, there are better things to do as well. By the way, the "star", which goes by the name of "Walker", we find that it is his surname, a name in which his wife still calls for him. Somehow, he knows there's something buried in the middle of the cornfield labyrinth and begins to dig. I say "somehow" because I could not figure out why he started digging in the first place. He finds a medallion, what does that mean? Nothing to anyone who watches this, but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime. Someone killed his kids in his "vision" and I think that's what he's doing, a real detective job. And now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze, one he somehow knew was there from the beginning of the movie, and that's why he's looking for his girls. Every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a strange robotic sound, like a science fiction toy that transforms a person's voice into mechanical sound. Why do we hear this sound? Is it in any way related to ... anything? Once again, who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The peak of all bad acting and bad dialogue was when "Walker" yells "Hey you, Mr. Bad Man ... I'll get you". Again, his wife is attacked by the "bad man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which, as I mentioned earlier, is strangely empty of officials or police officers. The "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone to say that he plans to kill his wife and children and him too. "Walker" can only respond with "Hey. HEY!" before dropping the phone and running away. With no one on the other side to talk, the killer also drops the phone, drags his wife a few steps and leaves her alone for the rest of the movie, missing the first opportunity to stay true to her treats. If this script were not written by a child, I would be surprised. Opps was not. It was written, directed and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he also did a lot of low-quality camera work, where we have random photos of feet walking through the muddy labyrinth and meaningless cornfield shots, which waste 90% of the film's time. In the end, "Walker" uses the handcuffs to handcuff the "Bad Man", who also seems to know how to choose the padlocks with the same metal object that "Walker" chose. Apparently, there are many small metal objects around this cornfield. But after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids, "Walker" kills the "Evil Man", and everything is right with the world again. Now, in reality, that makes Walker a killer, he killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his own. He knows this, not because of evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a body, no one else knows that this guy was in the maze. And the medallion? It returns to the ghosts of the two dead girls. No proof. So he kills a man for no tangible reason. I can not imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. It must have been a way of covering up an undisclosed appropriation of funds for the producer. I'd rather watch the Blair Witch Project five times than watch this movie again. The actors must be ashamed. The director / producer / writer / cameraman should also be ashamed. In fact, the whole producer should be ashamed. If anyone is associated with this movie, please respond. What were you thinking?
