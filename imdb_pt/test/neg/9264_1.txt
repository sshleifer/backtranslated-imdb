Well, after the hype around the movie and after Surya labeled the movie as PATH-BREAKING, I went to the theater expecting something great. Boy I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> First, the characterizations of the film are so strange! Which wife would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? An idiot, how do you? And what was the point of it being in the rain with her son (Baby Shreya) after she and her husband quarreled? What was the purpose of that scene, anyway? To start a vulgar shot "Maaja Maaja"? Not only was the music not aesthetically canned, it was not needed in the script. IT IS NOT NECESSARY! Secondly, the first half had virtually no history. The whole first half was a FREAKING drag. All the scenes from the first half of the movie were of no importance in the movie's true story. And also, how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) change so radically suddenly? And how did Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi lead a happy life together after six years, even though they were so unhappy in getting married? And if Gautham loved Aishwarya as he claimed he did, why did he marry Kundhavi even if it was his uncle's death wish? BECAUSE? That's the question you keep asking while watching the movie! And how fair is the end to Aishwarya? After all, was she the first wife of Gautham? Krishna, the director of the film, said he worked on the script for two years, but his script is full of flaws and makes the audience totally angry! Third, Rishman's unimaginative images of Krishna are simply disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's (usually excellent) edition for the song "New York Nagaram" sucks! The whole song looked like it was a slide show made in Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" Rangoli chorus was wasted showing Gautham PLAYING FOOTBALL !!! Who wants to see the damn guy playing soccer during such a cute chorus?!? What's more, the entire film needed only two songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs, including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal", are simply not necessary. Rahman's efforts are simply wasted on a stupid movie directed by an amateur director! Fans of Rahman, you ask why Rahman keeps moving to Bollywood. After looking at the way his songs are portrayed in Kollywood, why would he want to stay here? What is most annoying is that after Krishna decided to include Machakari in the film, the music was cut in half, which really bothers him. <br /> <br /> Surya looks beautiful in her new clothes, except those that appear during college scenes. and bundles into such and such a performance. His expressions during all the songs in which he participated really do not fit as the singer sings the songs. Was Jyothika really acting in the movie? All she did was cry! Would you call all this tearful acting? One of his worst performances ever! What's more, her new hairstyle does not suit her. She looked much better in Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu. His clothes during the song "New York Nagaram" are far. Bhoomika Chawla is simply beautiful during the film and does justice to her role. Vadivelu's comedy is annoying. When someone is watching you, someone wants you to slap their faces. It's Santhanam who's the show thief during the comedy scenes. And why the hell did Sukanya even agree to play such a tiny role that could be done by anyone? And why is her makeup so heavy when she has perfect complexion? Music by A.R. Rahman is simply fantastic. "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal" deserve special mention. The cinematography of R.D. Rajasekhar is good and not as good as his previous films, although the setting during the song "Kummi Adi" deserves a special mention. Anthony's edition is really very disappointing. The film is just a bit arrogant and can be cut severely. <br /> <br /> Krishna's direction sucks. Dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are too crude to be digested, especially the part where Bhoomika professes his love for Surya. The script and screenplay (Krishna) are horibble. The film moves at the most interesting pace ever. And the script of Krishna is full of inexplicable subplots. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake, why was there so much publicity in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you choose. Was the film's producer (K.E. Gnanavel) low-budget or desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a wet abortion. With a title like that, you can expect a moving and refreshing love story, but what you end up with is a painfully misplaced love story. Really, very disappointing.
