I believe the Cockpuncher is the best job that came out of the Steven Seagal factory in a long time. This movie was the first one I've seen since that preview of the movie. My point? He already was. Every movie is the same. Maybe he's good at Machete because he will not be the star. We can only wait. <br /> <br /> Q. Thanks for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was an incredible speech. You really influenced some people out there. <br /> <br /> So I have to write ten lines about this movie? Umm .... I like the smoker guy who killed a bunch of fools. Whenever someone smells menthol, look out. Because there might be a killer with a muted glock (and another noisy one) who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> Is that ten?
