I was at WrestleMania VI in Toronto at age 10, and the event I saw at the time was quite different from what I saw on the WrestleMania Collection DVD I just watched. I do not understand how WwE does not have the rights to some of the old songs, since most of these songs were created by the WWF, they should not worry about licensing fees and royalties that prevent shows like SNL from releasing season sets . It's too stupid to complain, but for me to hear Demolition getting to their theme song in a Wrestlemania in person was a keepsake I never forgot, and it did not exist on this DVD. What's the point of them having the rights to this huge library of videos if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?
