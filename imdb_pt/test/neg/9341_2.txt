I grew up in the 90s; Therefore, you must understand that I witnessed firsthand the first of the largest DCOMs. I was there when Brink! appeared, Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc., These films constitute my childhood. When these films came out, not just me, but whoever I was watching would be completely blown away by 1:30, talk about it for next week and get it again next weekend. I do not think words can express the excitement that Zoog Disney brought. <br /> <br /> Even when I watch them now, the dialogue does not seem so bad (so effective actually that I actually remember parts of conversations literally word for word, from films I've seen for over ten years ago) . The characters are believable, funny, granted a bit stereotyped, but that's what makes Disney charm ... <br /> <br /> I sat my little brother in front of the Disney channel to try to convey and make him understand mine feelings for DCOMs. Enter Stuck in the Suburbs ... my brother looked at me a little confused, asking if I was always gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed now than with what I could compare this? When Han Solo discovered that Lando sold him to Vader ... Half the movie, and I'm not exaggerating , is flashbacks. There is no talent in these young actors (some of whom are older than me). The plot is ridiculous; it seems like a bunch of rotting elders at Disney sat around a table and wondered "How can we look cool for these youngsters?" Okay, maybe all DCOMs were like this, but at least they made a little effort not to let us realize that they are complete idiots. <br /> <br /> And apparently this kind of movie works ... Stuck in the Suburbs is rated almost as much as Zenon or Airborne. How is this possible? DCOMs got even fuller and people prefer it now? (although apparently the lack of profanity is enough to give it 10/10 for some people) Christ, is a completely different generation.
