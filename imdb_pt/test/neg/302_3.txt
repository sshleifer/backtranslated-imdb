"The Secret Life" begins with the worst possible narrative introduction: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a movie about ...". Okay, what are you suggesting? That we should not bother to keep watching, since the film will not be accurate or bloody? And they were right too! The film is not at all shocking and almost contains no blood or blood. Although I think this is mainly due to the low values ​​of budget production and not because Dahmer's crimes are too horrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just a repeated sequence several times. Young, pitiful and mentally confused, Jeffrey catches victims (always men, as he was homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it was not his intention to hurt them and how lonely he was. This gets annoying really fast and even the admirable performance of unknown actor Carl Crew can not save this movie from being a total failure. Still, this version is far better than the pretentious and hopelessly "Dahmer" that was released in 2002.
