I read the reviews of other hacks in this movie, and while it's certainly not the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it's not too bad if you accept that for what it is - low budget, ) "borrows" from the likes of "Alien" (nasty extraterrestrial monsters who marry their victims) "Species" and "Incubus" (the beastie-breeding-with-girls-captive angle ). This is a seriously extravagant movie, and the whole thing was obviously done on a tight budget, although the alien is not so bad (I've seen far fewer men-in-rubber suits). None of the performances are Oscar material and the Isle Of Man does not really fold for Boston Massachussetts very convincingly. The plot is also quite predictable and the premise that an alien ship would travel for thousands of miles and land in the middle of a girls' college campus - conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is absolutely laughable. However, the film has its moments of suspense, there are some nudity and semi-nudity aids and the film presents one of the few appearances of the film by the beautiful and tragic model / actress Kadamba Simmons (like the "Space Girl") that, with just 24, was murdered in London by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.
