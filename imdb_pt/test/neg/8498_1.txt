This film is a gay love story disguised as graffiti and friendship tale. Not ONE review described this movie as a gay novel, and that's the weight of the plot. I do not know if this was to deceive people who otherwise would not be interested in watching it, hoping that the film was as it was marketed ... The film is out of touch with the culture of graffiti, it abuses and smears the culture of graffiti, and the performance is abysmal. Oh yeah, graphite sucks too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying gay boys. Just look at the rest of the movies the director was involved with, all containing the same subject. Boring as hell, not what I expected.
