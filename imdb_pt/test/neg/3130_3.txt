Dakota's Incident has to be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. Not good, but definitely weird. <br /> <br /> A car without a driver enters the city of Christian Flats with all the passengers dead. It is scheduled to continue, but very few, for obvious reasons, want to risk the Cheyennes on the way to war out there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond have their reasons for continuing. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in a shootout after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot him and left him to die in the desert, are so eager to go, he's willing to run the team. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry cleaning for cover. Who will live and who will die is the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The Dakota incident came at the end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates shut down his little studio. Westerners were his specialty, but usually the kind Roy Rogers had created. That would not have been a product of Rogers. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's unbelievable. The characters are not grounded in any kind of reality. Whit Bissell is taking ore samples of his allegation, but Robertson discovers it's iron pyrite, fool's gold. Toomey is a cynical guitarist who goes mad with thirst. Darnell is after a manager of her cheating, but really does not know what to do when she finds him. Lund is looking to bring Robertson, who has committed a crime for which he took the rap, but has to bring him alive. For this, he would need help, but he does not have any. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Ward Bond, who is a United States senator on his peace mission to the Cheyenne. In real life, Bond was an extreme right-wing individual and I'm not sure if this was not some sort of caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. He's really a silly idiot, but I think that's drawn him to the role. <br /> <br /> I tried to get into the Dakota Incident, but I could not. And the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least. <br /> <br /> Give three stars to the cast involved.
