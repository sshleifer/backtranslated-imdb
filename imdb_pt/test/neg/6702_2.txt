I'm assuming the heart of the filmmakers was in the right place, but frankly, this movie is truly unfair. I was offended by the tone and the total ending. You can not have problems like this so lightly! Not knowing the final caveat of the movie ... we see how a guy lowers his 9-month pregnant wife and two children and should follow him for the next 2+ hours as he tries to establish a new life? You can not have sympathy for a character who does this. You can not! Not to mention, we are given nothing until the last say half an hour of this unnecessarily long film, because this guy is suffering a lot. No flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - things that real vets are suffering. All we know is that he has a pain in his wife and can not financially care for her and her 3 children. There did not seem to be any research on what the current Iraqi veterans are going through. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film suffers tremendously from a heavy and totally inadequate score. It's a catastrophe. It's actually detrimental to some really good acting by male lead and sometimes Joe Morton. It foretells everything you should feel, and sometimes gives you the wrong clues altogether! Again, that was a brutal thing this guy did, and then see him get a new job, meet a new blonde, fight behind the counter making toast is NOT appropriate! And really the ending? What a freakin 'cop out! How do you dare? <br /> <br /> There are much richer movies dealing with the effects of war on returning soldiers, please do not worry about it.
