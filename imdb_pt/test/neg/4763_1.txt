The film gets promising enough, the use of simple pictures and short clips convey the larger story, which usually need a considerably larger budget than here. However, this started to worry me as it continued, combined with another overly hoarse Max Payne type voice over the movie was starting to not look so good. I hoped it was just the introduction of the story. <br /> <br /> The story is what really got me and took me to this movie. The idea that a research scientist created a virus that actually protects the cells it infects from other infections was an interesting scientific idea. So the individuals who had the most bizarre disorders sought out the scientist and offered to be their experiments on humans, made me think that this could be a very good little film. However, the introduction had not gone well. There seemed to be a change of pace as the film turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the film, the test subjects. Although the acting was not excellent, there seemed to be plenty of room for character development throughout the film, and the recordings were done very well with a varied mix of characters. However, these disappeared through the film. They were not used again after a few short clips and I felt that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development, reflecting back to them, however, was not meant to be. <br /> <br /> Images become increasingly disconnected from history, often repeating itself to represent something that is still happening. This disconnection and repetition are reflected in the annoying and disturbing commentary. He began to recite words one after the other. Short and meaningless phrases and reciting scientific ramblings not very relevant or interesting. If there was something to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, looping ... you're getting the idea. <br /> <br /> Now this might have been to reflect the confusion and character, slowly getting caught up in his own thoughts, rambling for lack of food and water. What this really did was make me completely turn off the voice, and in the final stages of the movie, I discovered that I was not listening to some of the ramblings. <br /> <br /> Multiple times When an event occurs, the camera shows all the characters one after the other for their reaction, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. There are repeated disappearances of the same scene for the same scene, for example, a character who dreams fades to black, then disappears again in the character who sleeps again. Look, we know the character is sleeping, we know the time has passed, please move on. Overall, there are just so many atmospheric cuts and long shots, hanging to fill the time. <br /> <br /> The acting was not bad, and the characters were fine, but not exploited and developed. When they were interacting, there were some truly cruel moments. For example, when one of them asks if they are hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to a group photo, they stop, look at each other, go back to the camera and say "No" slowly. He laughed for a second or two. Their dialogue was slow, brilliant and either lacking completely or totally unnecessary, there seemed to be no middle ground where the dialogue took place. <br /> <br /> However, there were some good scenes, but they really were hard to find, unless you see them in isolation, and that's what it looks like happened to this movie. The film was seen as a series of scenes and not as a complete story. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this seen more than in the main plot. The characters are infected with the virus that is killing the animals, which was being designed for them. We are told that it develops in stages for something dramatic, and this is what we expect. What we have are the characters eating mounds together, all vomiting together, the water coming out of their mouths in unconvincing streams, and then everyone falls asleep, these are the stages that all happen at the beginning of the movie. So, they all say "Good" together when asked how they are, and that's it. This is the virus done, nothing else happens. <br /> <br /> There could have been a lot more done with this film, much more developed with the virus and protecting them from all sorts of damage. He could have explored a serious change of these characters once they infected and took control of them, could have developed these characters, shown them to make decisions and do things that connect to the character shown in flashbacks for the interviews. <br /> <The end is not even confusing, intriguing or thought-provoking. It just shows something that happens and that's it, although in the long and lingering style with the annoying voice above it. I really struggled with this movie and watched some members of the press go away (including a famous TV critic coming out of the first twenty minutes), I stayed, but I regretted the time lost.
