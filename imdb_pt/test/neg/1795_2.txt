Heart of Darkness, a small novel written by Joseph Conrad about greed, corruption, and travel through Africa was, to say the least, a tedious read. The Narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels to the depths of Africa to rescue Kurtz, an ivory trader who is supposed to have gone mad, this conclusion came when the ivory stopped entering the main port. The basis of the story is Conrad writing prodigally from the environment, he sets the scene wonderfully, but possibly a bit extensively. The story looked more like a watercolor painting, as opposed to the slow, crawling action story that Conrad might have planned. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it happens that after reading a book, maybe watching the movie. the movie can help match some thoughts with those of the book, or vice versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, even with the supporting role of the master actor John Malkovich the film only confused me more, there seemed to be no real main characters in the film, no one stood out for others, not the extensive symbolism was explained. It was rather mild and painful to say the least. <br /> <br /> In all respects to the Author, The Heart of Darkness is a true short novel masterpiece, it touches on some very serious subjects, Marlow's lies and Kurtz's greed. It is not a book to be taken lightly, and will put you in a rather somber mood. Such a book seems to be heavy on many people. However, I recommend this book to those who yearn for a sad pseudo-action story without a happy end of textbook.
