The most fanatical about bad movies will be surprised by the general ineptitude of this z-film "movie." Mary Woronov, a clever actress best known for her roles as Mary Bland in Eating Raoul and Miss Togar at Rock 'N' Roll High School, is by far the best of this tripe. This movie is really bad even for MST3K - honestly!
