Forgive my spelling. This is probably the funniest horror movie ever to have existed. Think dead evil * 1000. The acting is horrible, you can see the makeup line on the face of a certain lady. there is a lesbian scene, which makes no sense at all. And the end, haha ​​ohhhh the end ... be prepared to have your stomach hurting with laughter. Now if you watch this movie for more than 5 minutes and are still waiting for something, take a look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a really bad movie, meant to laugh and enjoy for its sheer nonsense. <br /> <br /> Do not forget to watch every shot after the movie, you can see how low the budget the whole thing really was. In short, this film is a rare gem in demonstrating the lack of talent / care / skill / money / and anything you would need to make a movie successful. But definitely worth watching.
