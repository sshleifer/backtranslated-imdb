Well, for one thing, I'm as black as black, and I can say it's very sad when blacks think a "black movie" sucks. I can not say I've ever seen such a badly directed film or a worse story. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my boyfriend and anything but he was not feeling this movie, I do not know how much they paid for him to be in this fucking bucket called movie, but I hope it's enough to wash the smell. <br /> <br /> I'm all about supporting a nuisance movie, but this was bad, really bad. Exploded in every way, no real plot, sucked story, cast could not act and the best there was was the white guy! <br /> <br /> I almost demanded a refund on my way out the theater door, half the crowd and left before it was over, I'm still wishing I had too. Spare some pain and go see something else, anything else ...
