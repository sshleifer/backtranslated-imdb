Strange things happen to the Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg's real-life daughter) when they move to a large newly-inherited house in Ireland. Crusty corpses are found in the basement, a turkey squirts blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and an old cackling appear to scare the little girl. Paranormal investigators are eventually called upon to banish evil spirits, but Maura gets possessed and chases everyone around with a cleaver. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of clich√©s, but there is a highlight performance of Alexandra Paul. .. too bad does not belong to this movie (nor any other I can think of hand)! She can barely keep her face serious and her screaming, exaggerated tantrums are a joy to behold. Anyway, she's much more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
