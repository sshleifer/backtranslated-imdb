I'm 35 years old. Bruce was the man of Evil Dead, and I still love watching ED1 and ED2. It was cool to also see him as the king two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep, in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for the early Bruce fans. Either I'm getting too old for this sh17, or I'm no longer part of Bruce's target audience. I'm sure kids 9 to 13 will love this movie. But this science fiction comedy about extended matinee contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments, and the rest is the cheap humor of the children's clowns. Campbell talked best with Sam Raimi and had his brains shout together for one last picture of the Evil Dead reunion to regain my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry, Bruce, that just does not fit me. Take care.
