Let's face it, a truly horrible movie, no ... I mean that a truly "horrible" movie is a rare, strange and beautiful thing to see. I admit that there is a special place in my heart for such films as Plan 9 of the Outer Space, Half Breed, Species, etc. And although I'm giving a 1 movie, I ask everyone who likes a bad movie really is (a bad movie) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion that deserves it: Aussie Park Boyz. From the first moments of the main actor to the side, as he tries to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight from the silent photos). - Take your heart Rudolph Valentino - to the sudden conclusion that we're out of the movie, you ... will not ... stop ... laughing. <br /> <br /> To summarize the film, it is a poor, complete man's warrior - and that description alone should be enough, but then comes the wonders of the "eating scene of spaghetti", "the" we have their tickets, they will not leave the city now 'scene', "It's the Asians! Run!" and more. The only truly objectionable part is a gratuitous rape. Other than that, I dare you to watch this movie. And I dare you to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say a movie needs to be judged to be good. <br /> <br /> If this movie does not make you laugh uncontrollably before it's over, all I can do is roll your eyes threateningly from side to side in you and shout, "Your dog! Your dog! Your dog "
