There is a considerable amount of money behind this production, so the appearance is very good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns, and a brief early part of Christopher Lee. There are some exciting shootings, and one or two pieces of humor - the satire on Django, the Unnamed Man, and Sabata is fun, especially when they receive the names of failed presidents of the Mexican revolution. <br /> <The problem is that there is no purpose in satirizing the Western Spaghetti as is attempted here. The key element in Spaghettis is IRONY, which easily mingles with comedy; in fact, the source of all Spaghetti is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most Spaghettis easily fell into a real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity movies, which are both openly Spaghettis and openly cover comedy. So why bother to satirize a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself? Consequently, I found the whole company essentially unconvincing. None of these characters were people I would care about, the story was generally cliché, and the production values ​​reflected only the money involved, not the director's passion. Above all, a banal and futile effort to profit from the phenomenon he mocks.
