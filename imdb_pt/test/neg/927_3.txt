The third film based on the play by Charles Belden, entitled "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933), targets the X-tasy generation. Twin scriptwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other horror films - a promising start. Its condition guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much for the world's favorite heiress. She peers "In Style", stripteases boys, talks in a cell and cares about an ill-conceived pregnancy. Your regular routine has been changed beyond repair. Hilton reached the peak of her performance - not so hot - during the parody "1 Night in Paris" (2004). While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she zealously "looks for lipstick" on her boyfriend's return (Robert Ri'chard). Finally, the "actress" atones the word "N" on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra casts his opinion on the twin as opposed to the theme of the past. Each had opposite characteristics at the time, while a couple of good or bad can come out of the womb today. However, the latter does not exclude the former. Parto is the lucky lottery. Viewers can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Granted, inmates share some similarities, such as art, disfigurement, submission, and murder. However, a small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier inside than on the outside. "House of Wax" by Collet-Serra pays homage to Vincent Price, the first remake of 1953. The film leaves obvious van Gogh puns to the public's imagination. Still, the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist in the end. Jarrod's unmasking gets the runner-up, but the most terrifying in the history of the horror movie belongs to Lon Chaney in "Phantom of the Opera" (1925). With regard to the new competitor, the consequences of separation surgery minimize the effect. A surgeon must know that working with Siamese twins hurt them - physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call some of his colleagues - dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to take a look. Despite what the trailers said, "Wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
