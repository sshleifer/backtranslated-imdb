Let's not fool ourselves, this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's bad, period! The performances range from theatricality of the theater school (Marla English) to a 'could not less' walk (Tom Conway). The photograph (even in a good impression) is so obscure that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. The real problem, however, is the story without purpose, meaningless, almost without plot and direction of lead and without patience. At an accelerated pace of 77 minutes, it still seems endless. <br /> <br /> The script is especially inept. There are two story lines that only intersect at the end of the picture. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (though there is little scientific evidence) that he can control telepathically. He is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). Meanwhile, a couple of thugs and a white hunter-type guide are trying to find the village he's working in, expecting gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for their experiences. She is turned into a monster, kills Conway (natch!) And then returns to normal. She sees a half-drowned gold statue in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls into the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter rescues his wife. In the final scene, we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now it's really a scary thought!). <br /> <br /> AIP producer Samuel Z Arkoff, in a lecture included on the DVD, prides himself on identifying the adolescent niche market and satisfying him with ingenious, low-budget films. However, it is difficult to see how one would think that this rancid mix would satisfy any type of audience. What appeal do they think they could have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror movie. The action in the jungle is tepid and tedious. There are no teens in it and no character that teenagers could identify with. <br /> <br /> The producers exposed 77 minutes of film, but did not make a film. This is a trick and Arkoff should be ashamed of his association with him.
