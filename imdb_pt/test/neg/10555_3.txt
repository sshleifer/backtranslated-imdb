This is a very used line, but it sums up this movie well ... "If this is the current state of gay cinema, then we are in trouble." I saw this movie on SIFF because of IMDb's high ratings (7.6) and if there was a case of stacking votes on IMDb, then that's it. Just watch the number fall during the movie's release weeks. The boy discovers that his ex-boyfriend is going to marry a friend of hers, so he returns to his old hometown (still carrying a 10-year-old torch) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First off, I enjoyed Latter Days, the director's last feature, despite his characters and plot plans, but you should become a better director at every subsequent launch. I do not know how you get horrible performances from so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow he did. Writing was network quality of life (way back when they were really bad) and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably difficult to watch. I kept looking for a nonexistent remote control to advance, but finally made me stay to the end, waiting for a decent end. Ugh ... no. Even the free male nudity that came up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their places. <br /> <br /> To be fair ... the 2 protagonists, especially in the free nude scenes, were beautiful. There was also a real sweetness among them during their rekindling friendship as they discovered how they followed separate paths. And the film looked great ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film. <br /> <br /> How can the TV network give week after week of major weekly episodes of entertainment (such as "Ugly Betty", "Desp. Housewives", etc.), but so many releases in similar genres can be as bad as that?
