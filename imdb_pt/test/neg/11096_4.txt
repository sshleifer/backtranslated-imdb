If you thought this is the French The Mummy and if you are waiting for another "Vidocq" ... well look elsewhere. He has the same kind of story as The Mummy with regard to this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 pieces that are scattered throughout the Louvre. I found the film a little fun, boring most of the time. The special effects are not bad, but it's nothing spectacular, as I expected big bursts and maybe the eiffel tower collapsed, until I realized that that kind of scene was in the Mummy and this is Belhgorgor. Apparently, based on a cult French TV series, Belphegor could have been much better. I voted this movie a 4/10 just for the beautiful Sophie Marceau ... she must be almost 40 years old and she seems to take her breath away!
