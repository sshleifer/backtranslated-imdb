I think it's safe to say that if you actually watch standard box-office films or any premium production, do not worry about this movie because you will hate it. If you are an overly critical movie fan, do not bother. If you like science fiction movies and do not mind the ability to catch a glimpse of the future, then you will be slightly entertained. It's very obvious that the budget for this was super super low, but what they did with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some of the fire scenes were very bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is pretty obvious that they had a good support from a computer perspective as the scenes of the planet and the alien images were quite creative. The dialogue is fun but not bad. As for the story, I'm not really sure what really happened to tell the truth.
