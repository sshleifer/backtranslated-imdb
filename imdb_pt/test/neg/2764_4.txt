Someone should teach the people who made this film that there is a difference between "having multiple twists" and "spoiling the public". They still use hypnosis as a tool to cover up the holes in the plot; whenever they can not get in or out of a scene, they just say "she's regressing to her past now" or "she's coming out of it now," and they think that explains it all. This movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes it becomes a complete fiasco. (* 1/2)
