Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is caught by the same mysterious curse that has killed so many people. With a group of others, she tries to solve and end the curse forever. The Grudge 2 remakes everything from the first and produces only a few scares. The first Grudge was an average movie at best. The premise was decent, but the acting was made of wood and some of the scenes were really ridiculous. Grudge 2 is even dumber and less scary than the original. In addition, Scary Movie 4 made it almost impossible to take these movies seriously and I had trouble keeping a straight face during the "scary scenes" that should encourage laughter more than fear. As Takashi Shimizu messed up his own franchise is inexplicable, but managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the movie at a slow pace with a lot of dull characters and fear tactics. Clearly, he made this movie for money and I'm glad he failed. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty bad, mainly because it did not make sense and they did not develop the characters. In the movie, there were three different stories going on and each one was related to "grudge." The connections were weak and a lot of people were killed without a real reason. They did not explain the rules of the curse very well and ended up being a bit of a bloodbath because everyone died, although the PG-13 rating kept things from getting interesting, so even some of the death scenes were pretty bad. The dialogue was weak and none of the characters were nice enough or developed enough to really care. <br /> <br /> The performance was on par with everything else and was much worse compared to the first. Amber Tamblyn was annoyingly wooden. She moved on the screen very slowly and all her emotions seemed false. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine, despite having made a special appearance. Jennifer Beals gave the best performance, she had some good scenes and was kind of effective. Arielle Kebbel was well, a little embarrassed. The rest was horrible or simply forgettable to mention. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. There was a lot missing and not worth watching. Overall Rating 4/10
