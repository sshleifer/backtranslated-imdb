They give you the setup and lead you to death with a constant chase of cat and mouse. The main characters are involved in a constant deadlock, where they threaten each other every five minutes or less. And I'd like to see the police force that would let one of their police pull the piece of A. Garcia. It's like a local cop coming out of Charlie Manson to go get a cup of coffee. Be real!
