Amnesiac women who take off their clothes with a hat fall (or blouse?) Are the only highlights in a film that otherwise is slow and aimless. Although the basic premise of history offers a wealth of possibilities, they are never developed to any satisfactory degree, and exposure is almost non-existent. A large part of the film is just wandering the halls of a multi-story hospital / hospital. The general effect is bleak and sterile, to THX-1138.
