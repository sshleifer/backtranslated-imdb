The legend of pornography, Gregory Dark, directs this horror film that has Glen Jacobs (WWE / WWE Kane / whatever today's name) in his film debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a serial killer blind who is strong and is taking his eyes off people. The plot, in any case, has a group of troubled young people cleaning the historic hotel in which GoodKnight resides and being subtracted by him. Hemmingway is not. It starts out as a fun dopey B movie, but soon gets too tedious to be fun. I'm glad I had very low expectations, but even those were not met. How can you have a porn king driving and still suffer from lack of nudity ??? for shame <br /> <br /> My notes: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble finds her ass briefly
