This movie just stank. I know some people will say that those who think they are not good "just do not understand". I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But this is totally wrong. The main character is so annoying that I could not care less about what he does. He is, as has already been said in another review, jumping like a small boring monkey. I just could not bear it or force myself to care. This is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to be tough or weird. I liked the character Mel Gibson and the characters of Milla Jovovich and I wish they would have focused more on them. Milla is, of course, beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and what she's been through and why she's the way she is. I see the character Gibsons as almost like Frankenstien. I just wanted him to save Milla and topple the hotel with all the dull characters who lived in it. Milla Rating 10 Movie Rating 0
