I had a bad feeling when I saw the cheap job of the title. It took only a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real disaster! The only pleasure I had with this was laughing at technical flaws (example - the background sound "car sound" disappears during the scene with Danny and Dog in Dog's car). The production shows a total lack of imagination (example - the machine gun fire in slow motion repeats many times). Sandra Bullock essentially plays a part, completely unnecessary to the plot. To say that this movie really has a plot is doing more justice to writing than it deserves. The old hardware is interesting. This movie was released in 1982 (not in 1987, as the IMDb database indicates) and then the current "high tech" was an amber screen on an IBM PC of 4.8 MHz with floppy drives. Maybe the PC was the real star of the movie ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We put this on DVD for a few changes at Walmart. As the other reviewer noted, we paid a lot!
