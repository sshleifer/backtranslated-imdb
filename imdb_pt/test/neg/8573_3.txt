I thought this movie would be totally different than just another teen-slasher. Well, I was totally wrong. There's a net nun coming out of the toilet and something really weird. I know the Spanish culture is a bit different and its films too, but I did not expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. They certainly pretended very well though. Why did they make a movie without new aspects? This is simply annoying and was done totally without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought having a nun like the bad guy in the movie would be something really original. It turned out to be a teenage slasher. If this had been done ten years ago then it would have been something new. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone, but it certainly has some comedy value! It's like a parody of terror at some points.
