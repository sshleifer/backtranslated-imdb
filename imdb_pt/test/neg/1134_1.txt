Note, I've only seen about the last half of this movie, so feel free to make my criticism with whatever grain of salt you deem appropriate, what was said, seeing what I saw was more than enough to convince me of which star rating for this is enough. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a bleak quest of NL Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase, but he does not have Chevy Chase on it, and it happens on a generic tropical island, essentially with no connection to it. Christmas. The Ol 'Chevy probably did not want to because the plot is devoid of fun, instead, they picked up Cousin Eddie, who, again, was great in the original, but in that he's a little overdone and an extremely poor base for any movie considering the plot and acting. Attempts of humor are generic to a point where even contemporary television comedy prevails, and considering it is supposed to be comedy, I doubt I need to say more. <br /> <br /> This is not to be seen its qualities as it has none but its failures and again, as Hollywood is shedding the blood of past life in search of a quick buck. <br /> <br /> I think I'll watch the original before next Christmas season just to try to regain my childish innocence, from a time wasted when the movies were more than just a high budget but a nonsense garbage .
