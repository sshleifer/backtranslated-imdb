The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells by director David Michael Latt is a film a little less than average, which is not so bad considering the budget with which he had to work - only $ 1 million. For this budget, the production value was not so bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (I was totally impressed with the CGI considering the budget) and the sound design. The less stellar parts of this movie are the story that is VERY prolonged at best (but again I think this is because of the budget they had - they had to lengthen certain scenes to create the duration of the long 97 minutes), the acting (again, it's because the actors had no history to work with), very few exceptional camera shots and music. However, again, I can leave the negative parts only most of the time because this film was made on a meager budget and still had a good production value. Still, you should see this to see how a low-budget version of the War of the Worlds CAN be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.
