James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees the grumpy guys as the new superintendent of a state reform school. Introduction of warm genre in which Cagney is the whole show; it dominates the image, but only because there is much more interest going on. Jimmy gives exactly what is expected of his hard-boiled persona, which can be rewarding if you are in a quick fix. The direction (by Archie Mayo, although Michael Curtiz has helped) is direct without being particularly exciting, although the narrative slips in the second half, taking the film to a confusing conclusion (even with Cagney's Patsy getting lost in the film). shuffle). Remade in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** in ****
