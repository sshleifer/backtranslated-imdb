A bunch of nasty city dwellers descend on Le Touquet for a week's vacation. Stories intertwine, characters fight, make friends, fool each other, have sex ... <br /> <br /> Blanc reunited a stellar cast for his adaptation of Connolly's book, but made little use of it. What should be hilarious is instead tedious and annoying. All the characters are pathetic or unpleasant or both, and in the end, despite the ridiculous nature of things, this viewer was little concerned about what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> Credit to the ever-wonderful Rampling, plus Bouquet and Viard, but that's it. And Dutronc looks like he's a little overdone, if you ask me ...
