I can not believe I let myself rent that piece of crap! The acting was so bad, my grandmother could have done better. The punches in the movies were nowhere near the character the Scarecrow was knocking over. The movie has become a chore to watch! <br /> <br /> So, this group of baseball athletes decides to go jogging, even after they should not in order train the coach under the consequences. So, of course, they will anyway. They decide to tie a loser to a post with the so-called "Scarecrow". When the loser's best friend finds out about it, he and his girlfriend will rescue him. <br /> <br /> The boy is found to have diabetes, and is hospitalized while the athletes go out to the beach the next day. The scarecrow finds them there and kills them all practically. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you really do not care. Anyway, the Scarecrow ends up having a connection with "Diabetes Boy" and the boy starts to end the scarecrow job after the scarecrow is killed. Yes, it's really very tacky. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was full of bullshit. Sooner or later, the only ones who live (naturally) are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters. The evil is then transferred to the boyfriend, and he kills himself to break the curse so that no one else is injured. Playing ei? No, do not waste your hard-earned money on this, I give you a score of one since it is lower, otherwise it does not even deserve much.
