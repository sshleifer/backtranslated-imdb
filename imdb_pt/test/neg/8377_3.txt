This movie looked like fun on the cover and I honestly thought 'how bad can that be?' Little did I know. Outside the gate, the dialogue was INEXISTENT. It was invented, unrealistic and not even interesting. Dialogue on UPN syndicated television programs is more natural. The story was implausible and had almost zero play-off in the end. The ending with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. The only remotely interesting character is Rose McGowen, who is dumb, which prevents her from being ruined by clich√©d junk dialogs (well, at least until the end, when she needs to speak). The only thing that even gives a 3 out of 1 or 2 is Rose McGowen's nude scene. Really awful. Get out of trouble and rent something more interesting like a Barney video.
