Great piece of fiction played as if factual. Tonight I was looking at the Birdman from Alcatraz. Robert Stoud was not a tame prisoner and model, and he was in prison because he was a pimp and a unpaid client. Once he got into jail, he was so unmanageable that he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. Killed some people in jail too. This movie reminds me of the Birdman of Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and contributed to society in some way. And the BOA had some evidence of Stroud's madness. But this guy, Henry Young, who is Murder at First, was a well-known bank robber who took hostages and beat them in more than one robbery. He was not a poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store that happened to be a post office and took some money. This man was a hardcore criminal. He also killed a person three years before going to Alcatraz. He killed another person in jail not because of solitary confinement that ended more than a year before the murder. The true story of his life would have been more interesting. They did not even hit the director's thing. You can not be a director in 3 different prisons at the same time. And according to all accounts, the director of the film was a very handsome guy as guards. Also, if my math is correct, the Warden played by Karl Malden at BOA must be the same director as this movie. Oh boy. Not only that, in this film, we must think that poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. It's not true ... he may be alive now. He was sent to Springfield where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison then Walla Walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped in 1972 never to be found. Maybe he's going out with that CB Cooper guy who jumped on that plane in Washington state after committing a bank robbery. Now the acting was very good. Kevin Bacon is in this class of actors that includes Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the very underrated club of actors. Gary oldman well, they just might have invented the director's part so he could play because he was great. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, not sure if this is good or not. Bacon's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, was in the movie, I guess just because she's his wife. I like it though, but not in this movie. For some reason, I felt that this movie, when it first came out, should be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel that he could have taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system, sure enough there are enough of them and spread some light on their situation. Another then choosing a psychopath to show off as a victim.
