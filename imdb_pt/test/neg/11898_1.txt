I was surprised after watching this piece of shit if you saw an episode of TOM and JERRY in which Jerry spills some liquid on it and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with EROTIC added a man becoming- if invisible and doing S * i * is the conclusion of the film. engaging a lot of sex in a cartoon-themed movie does not increase its value :(, and most of all I was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show Mr.Invisible and this was really horrible, I must say drops of flour off the rack and our own Mr.Invisible becomes visible "watch Zack and MIRI do a porn" I bet you will not be bored, 1/10 of me
