When one considers that Carson McCullers is one of the leading literary figures of the 20th century, it seems he needs a great lack of talent to ruin one of his stories, but this movie shows that this can be done! How do the actors insinuate their way to becoming directors? Wooden, unatmospheric, unfriendly, totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of McCullers writing, my jaw dropped with horror and disbelief that such a miscellany of a film could have found funding and sponsors. The only redeeming features are a few moderately good performances (though Vanessa Redgrave seems to make the same performance permanently in any character she plays), and good cinematography in some places, but it's a bitter and bitter disappointment. could, and indeed should, have been a contemporary masterpiece. Simon Callow should hang his head in shame and keep acting!
