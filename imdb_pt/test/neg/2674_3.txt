[Possible spoilers] <br /> <br /> The sixth "Halloween" movie is an absolutely depressing subject, but unfortunately not in the way intended by the filmmakers. So far, everyone knows the story of how it was massacred and thrown sloppily and inconsistently. The second half, in particular, makes little or no sense, since plot elements are introduced and discarded, apparently at random. The end left me scratching my head. What the hell happened? Is Dr. Loomis dead or what? This is what you get when you put a shameless haute in charge of a movie. It is not a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> On a related note, this is the most graphically violent entry in the series. I have no problem with the blood if it is in the right place, but this movie leads to absurd levels. The infamous head exploding should be a new low for the series. Michael himself seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being, inconsistent with his efficient and methodical approach to John Carpenter's original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who was responsible; director Joe Chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. I would be perfectly happy to grant a pardon to all concerned if they released the legendary "Producers' Cut", a more complete version of the film which is a great improvement on all accounts. From what I understand, it's like a different movie. I offer to pay the full price to buy the DVD, if the Miramax regain consciousness and release it. <br /> <br /> There are a handful of good elements, however. The idea of ​​Michael being controlled by the Druids is intriguing. Paul Rudd is solid as Tommy Doyle, whose appearance is a perfect connection with the original. Slippery visuals help make the process a bit more watchable. But these meager offers are overshadowed by the overload of nonsense we have to endure. <br /> <br /> Finally, "The Curse of Michael Myers" is known to be the last Donald Pleasance movie. Many of his scenes have been deleted from the final cut, and when he appears, he seems frail and unhappy. The film is dedicated to his memory, a blatant (if unintentional) insult if there were any. The fact that a talented artist should end his career like this is too depressing to think about. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Released by Dimension Films
