Do not kid yourself thinking this is a remake, as this year's remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier movie. It's not because this is a meaningless movie. That is the director used the original camera script shot for a shot similar to the "remake" of moving away from a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt is made to beautify or restructure the original script (But with a director like Van Sant in charge, we should be grateful he certainly is not is no Hitchcock) in fact I may even be correct in saying that the costumes can be the same as the private detective uses a pork hat. Did not they go out of style in the late 60's? <br /> <br /> In short: Avoid
