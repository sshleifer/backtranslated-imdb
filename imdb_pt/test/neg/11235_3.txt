So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy in a hotel, Marion believes he's his long-lost brother, Brian, but when she gets close to him he seems to be someone else with just the same face. Marion can get her fingerprints and takes them to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother Brian, she and Bob leave for New York after tracing their whereabouts. They get Brian but he still does not know what they're talking about, but the couple really wants to know is where Brian has his 8 year old son, Joey ... and even when they see Joey he does not know them either. The plot thickens and they see one day thinking that they are someone else too. Experiments done with people just to make the perfect killers, but the question of why they would bother putting Bob and Marion in the same building as the other is beyond me. Personally Gregory Harrison played his two big parts, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little suspense yes, but that's it.
