I'll say it first ... the movie would have been a 1970s science fiction classic if it had been run much better. That said, let's examine the plot ... begins with Peter Graves (or is that Clarence Oveur?) running for president, then cuts into a university campus environment full of authoritarian truckers' hats and headphones and retarded athletes who act as if they were eight years old. shows a guy apparently going to America, throwing a party, then taken to a medical lab where he's drugged, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for packets of steam ... okay, actually it is being put on ice so doctors can extract the organs they need. <br /> <br /> Then he cuts to another doped man thinking that the place where he lives is a bit strange after a beer can (of all possible devices) found in a river makes it look like suspicious (damn those beer cans!). He and some equally stupid love interest because he feels he needs to get to the bottom of everything, so he makes her stay behind while he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he finds out about the way cloning. ..and as it is a part of it. <br /> <br /> He escapes from his controllers after being shot, and an old reporter helps him find his "father" - the man from whom he was cloned. Turns out he's a clone of Peter Graves's brother. After the debate over what to do with him and his evidence, he returns to the facility to find his girlfriend (who was lobotomized to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to host a talk show according to the SOL team). He is captured and put in the cold, just like his retarded friend of Nazi construction, since the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a confrontation at the home of the Graves brothers results in several deaths, including that of Graves. The reporter and his wife are killed in the middle of an emotional talk about a bomb. It seems the conspirators have gained to some extent ... <br /> <br /> So Peter Graves turns out to be able to survive being executed with a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parties, and giving another 'vote for me 'speech as reporters confront you about the cloning thing. <br /> <br /> Definitely MST3K fodder, but at the lower end of the spectrum with regard to malice in general.
