You would think that a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually kill your employer could not help but be exciting, but then you would be wrong. <br /> <br /> There is no plot. There is no character development. There is no redeeming visual beauty. <br /> <br /> This movie is a waste of time. Exploration of how the sisters' relationship develops is void, their sexuality is never anything more than a grotesque, class relations are covered up, and the employer is a silly caricature. <br /> <br /> Powerful silences and period clothes do not equal the depth of meaning.
