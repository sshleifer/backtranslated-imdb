[As a new resolution for this year 2005, I decide to write a commentary for every movie I saw in theater (10%) or on DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I must admit that the DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the cast's true voice, which is an essential personality trait. In my country, non-French films are dubbed and we end up with aberrations: the French voice is terrible, far from its original tone! the same voice for different people or the same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> Well, if everyone found my comments useless, well, in 2006, I'll stop my comments ... Ah, AH .... So, enjoy it now !!!! My summary means that the story, locations, cast is not very enjoyable ... Just .... <br /> <br /> Sandra Bullock is there .. She is a talented actress, able to make the viewer get the movie ... <br /> <br /> This reminds a female "the fugitive" ... So if you look for a moment to escape your life, watching this movie makes it worse because Sandra's life is one mess ... <br /> <br /> She has nothing left to hold, only her poor mother (who is Alzheimer's) the touch to depression). <br /> <br /> Na truth, she has a sad life at the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life everywhere, to finally get back to her in the end .. .. what a happy ending !!!! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writers wanted to make a point about the life of a nerd .... <br /> <br /> far from the best computer movie ever: * WARGAMES *
