What the hell is this? Kelly (jennifer) seems to abandon all moral behavior as soon as she arrives on the island. She finds this existent and exotic Juan P (Manuel), although she witnessed when he slapped him in the face, which he also justifies later in the movie, right or wrong? These two guys are the first to meet on the island. Kelly is totally lost in every way and the great Juan P can fish and build a little house. Mr. Handyman. They seem to have a great time. So Billy Zane (Jack, the husband of Kellys characters) appears and, of course, two days without knowing what his wife has done with this gorgeous Juan P, he is a bit jealous. Billy Z is the rich stereotype and may not be the coolest man in the world. He does not like Juan P (for beating his girlfriend on the pier, who can blame him?) He is also arrogant, but he paid a lot of money to rent the boat and Juan P, who is the waiter / everything can not even give a beer Billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you find him, but at the same time, he's not to blame for suspecting the diving glasses that Manuel has Kelly and Billy have just lost some dear friends! How convenient he simply has them, no matter what!). However, for some strange reason, Kelly likes this girl who beats Manuel and starts hating Billy for being jealous. OK, Billy is overdoing it for sure, but Kelly is not doing much to convince him either. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them since he was so cool (and even if Manuel yelled at her and called her things for asking a few private questions, but Kelly is so forgiving ...). Okay, right. And then she starts having sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before this incident on the island, at least they have intimate sex on the boat and talk about how people do when they like each other. Now you may think this scenario is possible. But really, is that it? Are you cheating on your husband after two days on a coconut island just because he's jealous and acts like a drunk at the bar? (I would not disagree if the relationship was really bad, but the director does not give too many tips, if that's the case). For God's sake, Juan P was not really a good person. Taking some fish and building a wooden house to get into someone's panties, does that show a good side? Not trying to make friends with Kelly's husband anyway (which would be very simple leaving them alone most of the time on the island, just be respectful). He does not care about their relationship (and Kelly can not understand it), he just wants to have sex with Kelly. Kelly's character is unreliable (if she was stuck with Billy and another cute girl, would not she be upset or what?). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person, and Juan P is not really much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused, and believes that having sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and aggressive with poor John P? So ... to all of you who read this ... What do you think of that? If you were the character of Kelly, you would think of betraying your husband, knowing that one day you will be back in real life, and suddenly Billys may not be a horrible person, after all. He is very jealous. And if you're Billy's character, what do you say, he's totally wrong in his behavior? And the character Juan P, what do you guys really think of him? One thing is right. Manuels exist! Ps ... Voodoo is so wrong here! What the hell was that ?! Seriously! Someone tell me?
