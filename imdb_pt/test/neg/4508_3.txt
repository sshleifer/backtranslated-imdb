Victor Buono as the devil? Certainly someone must have gotten drunk when the choice decision was made. That's not the worst part of this dumb mix of various haunted household devices, but it's my vote for being the funniest part of it. Although the film is by no means terrible, it does not even come close to other 1970s "haunted houses" movies like Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. Evil can be fun at some points, but do not expect to be afraid. It's best to approach it the way it is: a silly horror movie makes everything dumber because of the overly serious approach.
