It's easy for a movie that tries to be full of suspense end up being uninteresting. This happens quite often. Not only is Dark Harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. Scene after scene is attached to an otherwise exaggerated premise. A troubled couple picks up a troublesome stranger just to find more trouble. <br /> <br /> Some movies increase tension by building the story. Dark Harbor continues to increase its history, but never building on it. I was hoping that, like other movies, the suspense finally exploded. That never happens. In addition, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. They can act one way in one scene, but then act quite differently in another scene. At first you think they are merely out of character, but in the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. They are just props for the ultimate twist. The final ten minutes try to be shocking. Instead, it is rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. In less than ninety minutes, the movie still seems too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low budget jewelry. It's more like a fake watch that breaks so you take it home.
