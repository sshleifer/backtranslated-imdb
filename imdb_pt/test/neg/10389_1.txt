Even worse than the incredibly boring "Exorcism of Emily Rose". It began decently, and even the mother told her father, "See, I knew she was possessed," in a voice I told her. It was a terrible line, badly spoken and foreshadowed the rapid disappearance of this incredibly bad movie. Each family member has a past problem with the priest. The father begins to accuse everyone of liking his wife or having an affair with her, culminating in him killing his friend, then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes that his friend had not slept with his wife after all. People are dying, others are under possession, and by now most viewers do not even care. Except for his employee Miguel, none of the characters in this movie were really nice, making it hard to care about any of them. The acting was terrible and the writing even worse. I'm glad I saw it for free; although I think that for a movie that bad someone owes me money for the time I lost.
