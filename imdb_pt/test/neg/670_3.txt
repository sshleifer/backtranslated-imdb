Compared to other "sand and sandal" fare, the egyptian leaves a lot to be desired. The film is very much based on Mika Waltari's well-researched novel, which revolves around the adventures of Egyptian physician Sinhue at Akhnaton's court, as well as his travels through Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately, due to the moral constraints of the time, much of Sinhue's story (which is replete with romantic and sexual feats) remains on the cutting room floor and instead the audience is treated with reels and rolls of wood acting by Victor Mature. Even Gene Tierney? a main lady "staple" of the time? can not look or act in the best way in this film and makes a somewhat somnambulic presentation that can only be justified by the fact that the actress is having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There are a lot of rhetorical and theological machinations about the idea of ​​monotheism versus polytheism, but Michael Wilding is just as tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton, that someone is hoping someone will erase it and restore the old religion before the second roll. My advice: buy the E-Bay book, rent something more fun like Solomon and Sheba and then end the night!
