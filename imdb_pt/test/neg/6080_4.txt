I'm always interested in watching neglected films that seem to have good credentials, but in this case, the film's neglect seems justified. Evidently based on some real incidents during World War II, the film simply does not connect with the viewer for some reason that is not clear to me. A very likely reason is that - in the impression I saw in the TCM, anyway - none of the scenes in which the Germans talked to each other were given titles. This interesting concept of direction - allowing the non-German-speaking viewer to guess "context" what the Germans are saying to each other - is, in my book, a total failure and helps to block the viewer. Also, the way the movie starts - leaving us in a very confusing situation without too much setup - is misleading. Brian Keith is very good here, but the reputation of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" will not be challenged by this movie.
