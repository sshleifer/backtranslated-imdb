How can you make a joke about the Mafia? Not the kind of guy to laugh at! A close movie can not make me laugh, because I'm comparing it to Jane Austen's Mafia! Mafia! It was not a good movie, but Hoods is really worse! In the Mafia, there were some good jokes, but in this one there are maybe two or three ... that make you smile. Not too bad actors, but a very bad scene !! We sure preferred something serious like The Godfather. I give it to you *.
