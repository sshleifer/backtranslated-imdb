As usual, the leader Leo Gorcey (as Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are pressed for money. After unsuccessfully trying to sell his old jalopy, the boys seek help from the local bank. There, the hapless Huntz Hall (as Sach) has her photo taken by the beautiful photographer Teala Loring (as Cathy Smith). But since the shot was broken during a robbery, it makes Mr. Hall look like the prime suspect. With friends Bobby Jordan (as Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (as Whitey) and David Gorcey (as Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to clean Hall and collect the $ 1,000 reward money. "Bowery Bombshell" goes through the motions, with Mrs. Loring a major force. <br /> <br /> **** Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
