J Carol Nash and Ralph Morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a pianist's daughter. When his advances are rejected, he injects his father with a disfiguring illness so that she is forced to seek him for a cure. <br /> <br /> God, this is horrible. Before the pianist became uglified, I was on the verge. Yes, it picks up when things get set in motion, but this is one of those old movies more remembered than seen again. <br /> <br /> If you need to see him arrive late <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
