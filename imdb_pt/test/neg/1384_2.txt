There has been a lot about the theft of material from other comics by Carlos Mencia (Mr. Holness, sorry). Heck, even before Joe Rogan had a blast with him on stage I knew that Carlos Mensteala was stealing material from Cosby and Kinison and a host of others. <br /> <br /> To worsen the crime of his robbery, he recounted comic geniuses plays BADLY. <br /> <br /> And this is a crime that he continues to perpetuate in this show. I'm sure the writers of the series have to share some of the blame - it's hard to write jokes every day ... but that's why people get paid in such a way that they do it! These series writers need to get back to their daily jobs of turning hamburgers or whatever they were doing before deciding to embark on a career of intellectual stealing. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that he steals all his material. You can tell when he invented a joke on his own when what you are watching transcends the merely horrible and goes directly to the territory of horribly bad. <br /> <br /> Because he likes to call people b *** h at his show, ten-year-olds call him genius. They'll grow up one of these days, Carlos, and when they do, you'll dry up and explode.
