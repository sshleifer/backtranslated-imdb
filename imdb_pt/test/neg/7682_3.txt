Sorry guys, I love the work of Ray Bolger, but the only thing he is not a protagonist. Maybe if you pretend he's the last man on earth, this romantic plot may work, but come now! <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that exists simply to show the title song that was a big hit for the band Basie the year before (1951). And some really cool dances and dances keep it from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is pathetic even in 1952 standards of musical comedy. And the other songs are as forgettable as the Evening In Paris colony. The dialogue embarrasses the stars, Day & Bolger. Only the charms of Boyeresque by Claude Dauphin retain his three-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> So, how do you like this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward through the whole dialogue ... <br /> <br /> B.) Deal with the vocals of Doris Day and the loose-legged work of Ray Bolger. And do not miss Dauphin's hilarious vision of a wind-soaked April In Paris reraise ...) C. Finally, keep a couple of Cabernet bottles chilled and handy. Bob Raymond
