I can not believe the actors agreed to make this "movie". I could not bear to watch for too long for fear of losing. points for each passing second. I think no one on the network who broadcast this dribble watched it before putting it on. The IMDB ratings only go from 1 to horrible so it's time to get some negative numbers there for cases like these.
