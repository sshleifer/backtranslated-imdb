... a recommendation! Gloria Grahame runs the type of orphanage where discipline is applied to a cleaver, orphans are hanged on meat hooks to punish them and bodies are kept in deep freezing so they can be brought out when social services call. That the orphanage is out of money because we know Gloria puts all orphans to work, and also because there does not seem to be enough clothes to walk - especially for older orphans (the age group seems to be 12-30 years old). ish). The new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a game for Gloria - and in fact has just taken the mistress of her own mother and mother (in a clever hammer and criminal fire opening scene). Predictably, Gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. This was done for about tuppence but it was / is a HUGE HUGE HUGE in the circuit grindhouse. My DVD cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes," and I certainly was not lying. I believe he is considered as the Kane Citizen of the orphanage set of torture pornographic films. 4/10
