I rented this DVD because I'm a big fan of science fiction, but this thing (I'm not going to call it a movie because it was obviously filmed very quickly on video) looked like they invented it as they continued. I'm still not sure what it was. There are these guys dressed in strange S & M outfits, and I think they're from another planet, anyway, it does not make much sense in this low, low, and low movie. If it was their first movie, I'd give it a go, but I think it's like their 5th movie and it's really really bad. <br /> <br /> Too bad acting is not a good actor is this movie. This director must have gone crazy to work on a horrible movie like that. Do not waste your time or money on this DVD, please people do not. Not worth the 0.99 cents I paid to rent the DVD. In fact, I will tell them that the DVD was messed up to get my money back. I do not believe in giving anything at all a bad review, but I owe it here. My advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship - please find another profession to enter. How can you make a rotten movie like this? I would give these negative stars, if possible, it is so terrible.
