I do not know, maybe I just was not in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of banal melodrama. It was very long and seemed at least slightly disjointed (granted, I did not pay full attention ...). For a more entertaining depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At The Gates. It is true that some pretentious people will mock because it is a Hollywood movie, and it does not show "the harsh reality of war" as this "wonderful foreign film", but it has a better flow and is more fun to watch. In addition, there are already artificially "brave" war films, and this seems to have been done kindly. But hey, you might like it, so go ahead; It just was not for me.
