"Stick Around" is one of the short film series that reunited Bobby Ray with Oliver 'Babe' Hardy before Hardy's immortal team with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy-the naive little man and the big arrogant man-were a prototype to Laurel and Hardy, but that is simply not true. Ray and Hardy play against each other well, but they really are not a team; In each of these films, Ray has more filming and clearly intends to be the hero, while Hardy intimidates him in a very different way from his later "Stanley" treatment of "Ollie." It is very clear that the relationship between little Bobby and the great Babe was inspired by Chaplin's previous films, in which Little Tramp was intimidated by the immense Mack Swain or the burly Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> However, in "Stick Around" Hardy wears a top hat that is identical to his later "Ollie" (though with a fuller mustache), and he and Bobby - after getting the biggest part of the film as opponents - end up being drunken companions. <br /> <Bobby is an exchanger for the company of Matz and Blatz, with Hardy as his boss. When the late Bobby attempts to pretend he appeared promptly, there are some clever physical deals between the two men that remind me of a routine performed by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in 'The Garage'. A little later, Bobby Ray - whose brief acting career never developed a screen persona - performs an "impossible" gag that would be inappropriate for Stan Laurel when he takes a long ladder from a much smaller tool kit. The notaries go to work in a sanitarium, and there are the usual unrealistic descriptions of mental illness: a villager insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks it is a poached egg! There are also some howling (and unbelievably bland) jokes involving a black man who lets the prisoners open the nuts on top of the head. When he sees a * photo * of a lion - not even a photograph, remember - he's all coward like a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stay close" is quite ghastly. Most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it needs to be for a slapstick comedy; even Hardy, already a very subtle actor in 1925, reaches much its excess of performance. There are several bad examples of gun matching. I was struck by an unusual camera setup when a fat pedestrian's face is dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror rather than his actual face. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS. During the brief pair, Hardy used to be the boss or opponent of Ray, or both; here, for once, they end up as friends. It's a good ending, but it does not make up for what a really bad movie is. My rating for this is only 4 out of 10.
