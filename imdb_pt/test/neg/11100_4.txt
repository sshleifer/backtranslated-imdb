This was a really annoying movie, actually. I think the problem with a French horror movie is that the French should be easy to scare or something, because this movie was not so scary. The special effects with the mummy's ghost seemed not to belong to the film, as if someone put them through post-production to pepper them, because the actors barely reacted to them. <br /> <br /> The plot just kind of snakes, which is the opposite of the real narrative. I think this was based on a French TV series where they had to distill it for a two hour movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the Louvre, which apparently has such a weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can invade this several times. (So ​​that's how people keep stealing the Mona Lisa!) The boyfriend and cop of the 1960 version of this movie get together and try to exorcise the demon. <br /> <br /> So, I'm not sure if this is true. a mummy should be a bad guy or not. He kills two guards during the film, but he only wants to get to life after death.
