Well folks, this is another stereotypical portrait of gay life however the added disadvantage includes poor acting, horrible script, no budget, terrible sound and let's not forget the impossible plot. <br /> <br /> It's Christmas in New York City and our story immediately "focuses" on two male individuals, seemingly lovers for some time. One did not let his parents (the right wing, religious fanatic types) know that he is gay (adding to the possibility of being implausible in the story, because this guy is as effeminate as gays come today) and his parents are coming . viusit it. They will stay in his New York apartment where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The story continues to unfold around the arrival of the parents, which no one will like anyway and - as just obvious and predictable ways - they come to learn there son is gay. Tears are shed as well as my interest in this movie. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters, seemed like a course of interpretation in the theater of the local community. The lovers in this film are incompatible, and there does not seem to be any cohesion to their union. <br /> <br /> The owner is flat and his attempt to be humanistic in the situation is undercooked and certainly did not help move the film. plots below. The dragqueen friend who steps to the aid of one of the lovers in his "moment of need" is stereotypical and gives a bad name to the unique art of crawling. <br /> <br /> Although some guys think that one of the lovers has a beautiful body (again, stereotyped images) that does not help in this story. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, especially if you are considering a purchase. You will kill yourself if you do!
