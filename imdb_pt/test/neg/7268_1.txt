What the hell is this!? That was my first reaction to this movie (in fact, my first reaction contained more swearing). This is not Star Wars! Star Wars is space battles, this movie has none. Star Wars is the Force, this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring. Star Wars is lightsaber battles, this movie does not have any battle worth mentioning. Star Wars is humor, this movie is not. Star Wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has HORSES on it !!! On top of all this, how did Luke get the insane idea of ​​letting a five-year-old play the lead role? Big and big disappointment. Do you like Star Wars? Do not watch it! 1 out of 10
