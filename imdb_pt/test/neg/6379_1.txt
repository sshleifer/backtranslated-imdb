I tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time I found that he was completely pale in mood. <br /> <br /> The reason, to mention one thing, is that it is based solely on ridiculing anything that Republicans have. done. In sum, they are basically political opinions of the Democratic Party, taken as humor. <br /> <br /> Everything Stewart does is a joke about anything the Republicans have done and the public gets wet in forced laughter. <br /> <My guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate Republicans. _____________________________ <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
