We were waiting in line to see The Good Girl, an excellent movie starring Jennifer Aniston, when a lady invented this cheap twenty dollar bill announcing MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come and see this movie!" she said. "You will love!" <br /> <br /> She then introduced us to the director of the film. Now, this should have been our first clue. I mean, in how many cinematic situations do you have the movie director standing out in the lobby begging for people to see? "Is this a Christian movie?" I asked, not really caring one way or the other. I love Jesus. There is no shame in that. "Not!" she said defensively. What a load of crap. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad. So bad. And it is not only because of the obvious Christian agenda, but because of the terrible dialogue, acting between wood and super-exaggerated, and the obvious lack of an editor. The movie is too long. If it was an hour and a half, then maybe (just maybe) I did not have to visit the suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, I lie. See, after an hour of this junk we hide in SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN we know it's crap before we go see the movie. We know how to prepare. And SWIMFAN has hot semi-naked people. The only semi-nude thing in this movie is the desperation of the stars involved, whose obvious lack of script offers is anything but hidden. And the actress who painted the nun? This is called personality. Get one. People shamelessly begging for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if I liked MY GREAT FATHER MARRIAGE, then I would love him (his emphasis, not mine) MANNA FROM HEAVEN. Right. More like, "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MANNA FROM HEAVEN". And Mariah could really outdo any of the clowns in this movie. If this is not an insult, then I do not know what it is. <br /> <br /> I've been criticizing enough. Go watch indie movies, but do not see the bad ones. This is definitely one of the bad ones. MANNA FROM HEAVEN is in need of some divine intervention.
