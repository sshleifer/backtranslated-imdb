This film is the proverbial 1980s film that shows the viewer that while he or she tries something, they may be better than the pros. The main character, Doug, has shown his skills in piloting a Cessna aircraft, which in any way amounts to being fully capable of flying a jet plane and being able to kill people. We would all like to have a few million dollars to play with ... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy some things, but the directors of this movie decided to do Iron Eagle ... not once ... not twice .. not even three times; yes, four times. The thing to be seen further is the multitude of "hollywood finals" in this movie. Only when you think the movie will end after a cheesy final sequence, there's another cheesy final sequence. Then another. Definitely a movie that one should watch to believe ... and maybe own just to remember how the 80's must have been.
