So much for JUDGE AND JURY, which lives up to its meaningless title. How good is it? The lighting is terribly nebulous! Another horror movie you ask? Well, that is perfectly explicable. David Keith really does very well in disguising clowns, chefs and other antics while he is the killer who escaped death row. But overall, despite some twists and turns, it's reasonably stupid. Unapix has recently released some ridiculous productions, and this is just one of the most significant. We, the jury, find this movie guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it to be a total waste of our time!
