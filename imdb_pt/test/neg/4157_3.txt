I like to think that I can enjoy a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary, and I certainly love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like the ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you'll think about afterwards is that you've lost 90 minutes of your life watching it. <br /> <br /> Such a movie needs a driver to get buy-in from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This movie makes a very weak attempt to do this and fails the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors who are excellent in their ability to feel comfortable in any role. So why did they fail here? I feel strongly that they did not know what their motivations were as well, and when an actor does not know, their audience can not follow. <br /> <br /> In short, I've seen flash videos from macromedia that offered more in the way of teasing, at least I have more interest in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than because this married family man would risk everything for a violation of "Code 46".
