Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the great films of the 1970s. The sequel "More American Graffiti" is a horrible and depressing mess of a movie. It was not funny, the wide-eyed and friendly characters became cynical and tired, and the stories were invented (like the "Laurie" character having another brother because Richard Dreyfuss did not sequence and "Terry the Toad" and "Pharaoh Joe "somehow managing to serve together in Vietnam). They still have a police officer named "Falfa" (Harrison Ford's character in the original), who makes a cameo. He does not even look like Harrison Ford, who was a very big star in 1979 to bother with this crap. <br /> <br /> The operative word here is "funny." This movie is not even fun. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed with a bunch of hippies and trying to get her boyfriend out of jail; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), the original lovebirds, have two children and have become a boring and quarrelsome couple; Lovely little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become "Rainbow", yet another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser racing driver whose fortune was announced at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was an integral part of the original, and gave him such a great flow, is only heard sporadically. <br /> <br /> Maybe they were different writers, a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive plot that makes this movie such a regrettable failure. <br /> <br /> The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original are nowhere to be found in the sequence. It was a film that did not have to be done and is best just to remember the great movie "American Graffiti" and avoid the movie with "More" in the title.
