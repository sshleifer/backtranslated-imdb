Let's cut it all down in the first paragraph. "The Messengers," the newest Pang Brothers movie (Danny and Oxide) as a horror film, is deeply bad. And just like a movie in general, it's a big disappointment. It is nothing more than a "Sixth Sense" reheated, and while that image is still available, there is no reason on Earth to pay money to see this turkey. Lately, horror / horror films such as "Final Destination", "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "The Ring 2" and "The Grudge" are becoming more and more dependent on big shocks without reward (for example, something jumps in the person on screen, causes a sigh from the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a raven or something.) Little comes in to make it a truly scary experience like "O Sixth Sense, "or" Signs, "or some of the classic horror films of the 1940s, 50s and 60s." The Messengers "is based on the same old and tired clich√©s as these older films new and far inferior, and so old, tired and - to my surprise - turned out to be one of the most annoying movies I've seen for a while. The plot has another stupid family, led by father Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), mother Denise (Penel Ann Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop," TV series "Desperate Housewives "), big sister Jess (Kristen Stewart," Zathura: A Space Adventure ") and child Ben (Evan Turner), who move to North Dakota from Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for the movement is never really outlined here, but it has something to do with the inability of the father to find work and the adventures of drunken driving from Jess. We know that there will be problems immediately because they move to a large Gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a domicile that looks like the summer house of the Munster. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show that something really horrible happened there. <br /> <br /> Jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but optimistic pop hopes to get out of sunflowers (despite the extraordinarily large amount of crows fluttering). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and looking like Kevin Costner in the film version of "My Name Is Earl"), an itinerant drifter and expert at raising sunflowers, things start to pick up. <br /> <br /> But then strange things begin to happen; Jess is terrified by an unseen violent force in the house (of course, no one but Ben, two years old, can see it, so it's labeled as a flake) and the crows are around. Ben is also able to detect supernatural creatures, but since he is two, he can not articulate it. Scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he saw, finally made me want to scream at the screen: "He can not tell you! He's two - going crazy" - years old! "Yes, having the only protagonist who can solve all these things being a mute child is very intelligent. Anyway, we are left to reflect on Jess's sanity, when and if Ben ever describes the paranormal visions he sees, if the father makes the sunflower thing work, if the wanderer of the high plains is good or bad, what is the purpose of the real estate agent who looks like George Plimpton; it can be a wound in the flesh, what is the role of the mother in the family, and where all the crows come from.All this while waiting and asking for something - anything - happens.The conclusion is really unsatisfactory, and again, raises the question of how a spirit that has no physical body can do damage to a living person. Very boring, pointless and most terrible of all, it is nothing scary. Ah, and there are many crows in this movie.
