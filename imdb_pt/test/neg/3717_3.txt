The film has strange annoying characters, a strange and inexplicable trick and an insurmountable amount of dialogues about smoking. The film has a planned plot of a bitch and hollow-headed woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn) in search of love. Although I would prefer the character, personality or reading of Jeanne's dialogue, I really can not say. Except she likes to smoke. <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker makes an interesting character (who likes to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look handsome and emotional (as he smokes). And, hey, what is Jennifer Aniston doing there? Oh, she's not really into that enough for anyone to care about her. But she likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> This is a waste of nobody's time. I do not even know how I got through the movie as much as I did. I can not even believe that I spent the time to write this, except to warn others about their banality. Does anyone need a cigarette?
