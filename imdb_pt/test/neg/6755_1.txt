I was completely fooled by the comments about this movie, mainly by someone saying they saw him at a film festival and loved every minute of it. Hoping this is a good time for the movies, I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the camera work is horrible, I do not think the director knows that the cameras can move around the scenes rather than stand still and get the actors to get close by themselves. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenery! My god I saw more furniture in a bird's nest. The club was totally unconvincing, with about 3 extras dancing in the background at any time. The apartments were empty and lacking in personality. <br /> <br /> Third, the actors. Wow. The director obviously chose the typical "Reaper" character, a main character with a rude character "I do not give a shit," who takes pictures in the pot. Everything the main character said and did was a chore, so much that it made me shudder. Overall, the plot, the subject of supposed revenge, lasted about 30 seconds and had no real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and did not seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. No character had any depth to them, they may well have been cardboard cutouts passing the static camera. <br /> <br /> A truly horrible piece, worse than a first year students 2 minutes to youtube. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any association with the movie that will likely sell a copy on a sale in Ohio.
