Okay, how can anyone really think that this movie is incredible, it's so beyond me ... I can not even understand how anyone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character he has, is the evil super nerdy game designer and this gets old after a while. This film is so predictable, drilling lines are not funny, they are forced, you see better acting in the red light district, and the story is such a predictable drug, you know EXACTLY what will happen. Even the characters do not react as they should, try to go to the hot boss at work and tell her that you're beating two crazy girls with whom you live at the same time, her response would not be (smile) "ok let's go back to work". I did not laugh once during this movie, and I wish I'd never seen it or spent $ 3 to rent it because it's not even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this movie, I lost all respect for it. All his movies are the same, his comedy style has aged since The Waterboy came out, if I'd known that Adam Sandler had produced it before I rented it ... no way would I have wasted my time on it. This movie is as bad as possible in all respects ... ace ventura was not a clever comedy movie, it did not have a killer plot ... but it was original and it was hilarious. I'm not beating the movie because it has low-level humor, I'm pounding because it sucks, it sucks Hollywood. If this film were presented to a producer and did not have "ADAM SANDLER" behind it, it would be dumped in the trash faster than a used condom. If you want a good movie about marijuana culture, watch Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you have is a generic comedy that targets boys ages 14 to 17, with high rock music in every possible cut, acting so that their eyes are quivering and their stomachs rolling. Plucky friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. Do not do it ... for God's sake ... this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look beyond all the Hollywood glory behind it ... Hercules in New York used to be the worst movie I've seen it, but it's actually so bad that it's good. This was a very expensive movie that sucked so much, if not more.
