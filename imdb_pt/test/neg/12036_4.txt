MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is a time killer. It has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely dull. There are many murders. And the production values ​​are not bad. But in the end, it plays like a standard TV episode of the 1970s with some nudity. The film is the end product of an "author" trying to make a purely commercial film. There is very little depth here and the film spends a lot of time with chases and action scenes. Except for the beach scene with the old, the MMBM is almost devoid of scares, suspense or dread. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. It is watchable, although it does not leave a lasting impression.
