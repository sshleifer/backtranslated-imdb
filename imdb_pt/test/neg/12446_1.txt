Wow, this movie was actually sucked down from the normal range of tedious, bland and unimaginative movies I've seen recently. The acting was poor and robotic. The story was so bland that you could summarize it with a simple short 5 minutes. The audio was so poor and dirty that it was hard to hear; maybe it was not edited from the camera it was filmed from? I'm not sure which movie the 3 brilliant reviewers were commenting on, but it was not this one. Maybe the director had the chance to see that his film received a good review, at least before the actual reviews began to appear. <br /> <br /> Save your time or you'll be wasting your time and money on this movie. Absolute suction!
