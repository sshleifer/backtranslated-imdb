I usually do not write reviews for programs unless I have seen them in full. However, there were many positive views about this show here, I felt it was necessary to balance this with a bit of realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I do not think it was meant to be, but it is. I see there's a lot of praise being poured on the show, and I honestly can not understand why - this show is so misunderstood, the dialogue is so awful, and the plots are thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it is a definitive test of their standards. Some elements of the show work, and maybe those elements are only more important to some people than to those that do not work, which makes the program almost inaccessible to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you like to make fun of a show while you watch, anticipating clichés and such, this can be a fun spectacle of ridicule if you have that kind of time on your hands. <br /> <br /> The pilot is a very fair example of the whole show. If the end of the absurd saccharine cliché does not leave you in a dumb ass, then this may be a show for you.
