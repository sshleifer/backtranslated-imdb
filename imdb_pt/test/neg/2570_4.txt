In addition to some pretty impressive scenery, this vehicle Steven Seagal is devoid of reasons to spend some time watching it. For a Seagal movie, he has very little (almost no) action, but he puts in some reasonable scene (for him) in artificial character development scenes. Not recommended. To no one.
