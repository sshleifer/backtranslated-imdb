I was wondering when anyone would try to turn all that Matamoros mess into a goreporn photo. Anyroad, here are some things I learned about Mexico watching this movie. <br /> <br /> All Mexican women are super hot - Remember that little desert town in Unearthed? Yes, well, this must be the sister city of Mexico. Do not bother with prostitutes, just put some gentle moves on the hot bartender. She's going to be as hot as prostitutes and probably has no kids too! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by insane cultists of Palo Mayombe, worshipers of satan. Oh my! The other half, as everyone here in the US knows, is run by drug traffickers. Fortunately, this does not interfere much with the sex tourism trade and our very low wage factories down there. <br /> <br /> Mexican police officers are useless. Do not go to them. Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot girl behind the counter what happened to your missing friend. She's going to be a lot more help than the cops. <br /> <br /> When you are being terribly tortured by the bloodthirsty cultists mentioned above, do not go reciting the Psalms or any part of the Bible, really. You'll only ruin the mojo.
