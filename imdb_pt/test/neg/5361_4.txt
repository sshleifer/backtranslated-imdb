This show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when he came back from the commercial, the noise or "surprise" was as simple as a mouse). This is pure theft of the Ghost Hunters and tries to go "beyond" them, and fails miserably. Besides, what's with the record-keeping thing? Is this a journey of stars? Just spoil the novelty of this show, which ended quickly. The only reason it has been noted is that people want to laugh at the sheer anti-climatic nature of it. They never find anything and probably never will. Curiously, they always point to something that is the thing that they are "hunting" and guess what? It is the tower of the local radio station that is blinking red!
