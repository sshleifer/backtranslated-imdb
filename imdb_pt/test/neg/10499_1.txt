A friend of mine showed me this movie yesterday, and I was really impressed that anyone could make such a terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Mix the most horrible and clich√©d dialogue with the most woodworking action you've ever seen, with the funniest special effects that man knows, and you'll have that magnificent beast! <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is funnier than most comedies I've seen, it's really awful! <br /> <br /> I was in points during the scene where the ex-cop / killer vampire character is drinking coffee with the internet journalist. Just watch and you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> I honestly can not believe anyone did it with serious intentions. <br /> <br /> Tragic, but a really good laugh. It has to be seen to be believed.
