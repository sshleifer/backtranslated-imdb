While everyone does a decent job on this film, I agree with the other comment: it's very loose and scattered, much like an experiment without a script with really talented actors. As such, it is not enough to hold your attention. Having said that, there are some really funny moments, one involving Dylan McDermott and a glass of burning glass that I think anyone who has been so drunk would find it as funny as me. the other is a fraction of a second with an inflatable dinosaur. Crispin Glover makes his usual crazy guy and does everything right, Harry Dean Stanton does his usual nut patriarch (Repo Man, anyone?) Etc. Good cast, not enough to continue. Just a few gems, seconds long.
