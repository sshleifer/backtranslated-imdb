Before seeing this movie, I heard some negative comments about it. However, when I watched it I found myself thinking "ok, it's a bit slow, but that's quite interesting". As it drew to a close, it created a complex moral dilemma, leading to a shocking yet, in the context of the film, an entirely believable decision, with extremely powerful dramatic consequences. If this had been followed, it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favorable impression of the film. <br /> <br /> However, due to an end that not only distances emotionally, in a happy and unnecessary ending without a real emotional credibility, but also within the context of the film, it makes absolutely no sense for you to see clearly a character take action that should end his life, but inexplicably not. Incidentally, please tell me if I missed something here and there is a reason why she survives like I just could not logically like she could have and it destroyed the whole movie for me. <br /> <br /> That said, All three protagonists perform powerful performances, although the transformation of Kevin McKidd's characters in the end is a little further than it is totally convincing and creates a very powerful ethical triangle. <br /> <br /> This movie is recommended if you prepare to leave when the mother and sister are lying in bed. But do not watch more than that, unless you have only a pinch, but several mountains, of salt.
