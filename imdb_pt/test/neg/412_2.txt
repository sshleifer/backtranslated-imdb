I got into the movie expecting a bit of action mixed with a strong plot. I understand that changes between written works and films must be made ... for many reasons. The change of the relationship between the scientists (they were father - daughter in the book) The director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director was changed to the Carmelengo and the chief of the Swiss Guard in the pope's office. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard had his father inserted as a cardinal in a hayseed accent but lost all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and Carmelengo took to the skies in the helicopter with the character of Hanks landing on the river and the priest landing in the chapel in what was described as an image of Christ. <br /> <br /> At some point this movie needs to be redone by a director who is up to work
