Overall, the movie "Heart of Darkness" was unfortunate compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the numerous obvious flaws. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. It seems to me that the director was entering a losing battle. I could not imagine that anyone would take on the monstrous task of re-creating "Heart of Darkness". The immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to interpret with justice. Conrad's story had so many layers and depth that it would be futile to attempt a visual interpretation. <br /> <br /> First, capturing the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal points created by Joseph Conrad can not legitimately be recreated through the cinema. The feelings and emotions of Marlow can not be equally interpreted in the film. If you took on the enormous task of dealing with Conrad's work, you know as well as I did that Conrad wrote only half the story. The additional half is a series of connections made by the reader. You, as the reader, must be able to infer and connect the ideas of Joseph Conrad. As a result, several crucial details are missing in the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the film has a suitable size, the film seemed short. It seemed that Conrad managed to put more details into 75 pages than the film could pack in an hour and a half. The speed of the movie prevented the viewer from knowing the characters. Marlow was much weirder. The point of view of the book puts you in Marlow's place. However, in the movie, you're almost watching Marlow in the distance. I began to think that the director was trying to use the same "read between the lines" method that Conrad did. However, the connections were weak. I know that if I had not read the book, I would not be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters at all. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz also seemed to be interpreted. incorrectly. His paper was short and details were not included. It was impossible to understand the real Kurtz at the time he was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz had become a god to the Africans. I did not find that significant details were defined. In addition, in the book, Kurtz represented a soulless being. He died a long time ago. I believe the director understood this detail. However, instead of re-creating him, he just had Kurtz play and mutter it all. In addition, it seemed that the director tried to make Kurtz look mysterious, however, instead he seemed totally unidentified. <br /> <br /> In all, this movie reminded me of a teenager getting ready to finish a science project, day. It seemed to have been worked out effortlessly and in almost no time. The characters were alienated, crucial details were left out and, in general, the central plot was lost in the translation.
