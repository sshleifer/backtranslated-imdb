I am relieved that later revisions have soured - reading all the positive feedback, I was beginning to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different from everyone else in the world. Everything in this movie sounded bogus to me ... the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the tacky narration, all that. As each scene unfolded, I kept thinking, "People do not act like that." It is relentlessly heavy and mushy. In a way, I think the movie gets you to like it, or pretend to like it, because it's Serious and Real People and faces Questions. But man, it really did not work for me.
