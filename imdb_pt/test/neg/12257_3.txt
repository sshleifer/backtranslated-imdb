A bunch of genuinely strange and surreal visual ideas that probably looked extremely intriguing on the printed page; Only what has attracted Robert Redford to the project, you can never know. Sidney J. Furie directs this indirect journey of an egocentric motorcyclist carrying a youthful milquetoast under his wing; the boy looks at this anti-hero and eventually begins to imitate his amorality. Disarticulated and disconcerting - although for some, Redford's view of undressing, about to undress or have been undressed, may be enough to demand attention. Lauren Hutton gets naked too, however all the sexy flashes are only teasers for those of a lascivious spirit; there is simply no story. Maybe Furie was making an esoteric comment about irresponsible wheels and his flock around 1970. If true, then this pre-Blank Generation approach backfired, since the film was not a success. * 1/2 of ****
