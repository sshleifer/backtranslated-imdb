Dishonest plot, dishonest script, dishonest almost everything in fact. The most attractive performance is that of Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even this does not rescue this nonsensical and nasty film. The director's implied invitation to viewers is not only to suspend disbelief, but to suspend judgment. <br /> <br /> Presumably, it's meant to be steamy and menacing, but although the movie has erotic moments, they are few and far between. That sort of thing was best done by many others. Do not go out of your way to see this.
