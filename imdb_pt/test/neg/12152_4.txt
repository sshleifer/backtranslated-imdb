For native Mongolian speakers, the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used by many non-native speakers, especially Jamukha. Lots of amusements in real history. Terrible terrible legend !!! I wonder where and who made this subtitle. It was in English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle was in Thai if the subtitle in English was soooo bad! Described the life of the most uninteresting leader. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budget since 1980. Honestly, I'm wondering if the Academy Award's film critics are so mild or what? The only good thing was a good CGI in some fight scenes only moderately ... not above the top CGI
