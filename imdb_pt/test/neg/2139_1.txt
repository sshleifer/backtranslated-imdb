I'm not sure what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this excuse for a movie, but whatever they thought did not help this movie, it just hurt him, and it hurt this movie a lot. The acting, for once, is not the problem, it's the horrible editing, the scenes will end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in the middle of the sentence. I'm not sure what the story was, but it really did not matter, since what I saw was rather uninteresting. Just bad around, a huge "Jaws" rip-off and not a good one at that. The MST version was funny. 7 for this, none for the movie itself.
