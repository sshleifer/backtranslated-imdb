To be honest, I have never read one of the comics and I do not remember parts 2 and 3. I can compare it to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one is really disappointing, compared to part1 as compared to most other movies I've watched in the last few weeks. The first few minutes seem to be just an unnecessary clone of the movie's first introduction and then it's getting even worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but in total it's just another tedious second-rate attempt by the German film industry that can not succeed (almost as usual). A good thing: The movie is very short (75 min.) The bad thing: it only contains stories and jokes of 45 minutes;) -> Do not watch
