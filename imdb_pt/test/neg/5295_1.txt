This movie is a waste of talented people and Hollywood budget. It made me think that everyone in the movie was paying a favor for being in it because they were all out of place and was wasting talent on that horrible pile of junk from a movie. It's a planned plot that is just pathetic, unrealistic and not even fun or interesting. The only thing that kept me interested was the countless big names in the film who kept appearing for no apparent reason and who had no acting or good lines to contribute to the mess of a movie. I kept hoping I had some good things, since all these people had been cool in other movies. But that never happened. This movie should be shown in prison as punishment, but that would be cruel and unusual. You will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parading around such a horrible pathetic script with flat lines and terribly bad acting. This movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with many recognizable faces BIG TROUBLE (2002), which also came off the readable scale in the sucker.
