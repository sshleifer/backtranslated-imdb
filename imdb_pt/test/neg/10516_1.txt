In a world full of movies - like "You Got Served" - that explode your mind with its vast number of mistakes, you would never have imagined that there would be worse films ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" does more than chew on you. KNOW that you're mad at this. First: there are no killers in this movie. In fact, there's just one cool guy fighting the whole movie. Second: The location ... is basically a location: some donkey house (or basement. It's up to you.). Third: Special effects (bluntly) can kiss my butt. Fourth: The performance wins "Plan 9 from Outer Space" in the worst performance category of all time. Ron Hall can not act to save his life. Finally (and definitely not the slightest problem): THE EDITION. The person who edited this movie hopes I'll never find it. The cuts and shots are HORRENDOUS !!!! Other issues: Lighting (practically none), the fact that the guy on the cover is not even in the movie, and the fact that this movie exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, let's just say that I tortured the DVD copy before taking it back to Hollywood Video (do not worry! I used the MVP association, so it was free!). NEVER SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!
