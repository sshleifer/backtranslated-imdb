I give this movie a 4 because I'm a big fan of the video game series. the graphics and animation are great and it's nice to see the whole gang in the form of CG Sephiroth is still cool <br /> <br /> now the reasons it only has a 4 well the characters feel like wooden boards with some of the worst voice acting that I've seen (I watched epic movie) <br /> <br /> the movie seems only cloud oriented so much that it makes even the embarrassed fans with this cloud and cloud it. Clouds mentioned so much it makes you not want to see it in this movie <br /> <br /> Villains have the prize for the worst villains of all time (I was more scared of the bad witch from the west) All the other characters in this movie are simply put in the film for a nod to the fans and do not take it any further than that <br /> <br /> wtf is with the chilly chally ??? <summary: I waited 9 years for this movie and this is what I get a great scene meaningless and boring I beg the head of the square cenix to shoot the man responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and anyone involved in it and create a new film from the ashes (it would be good to make the movie into action live and based on the original game)
