Derek Jarman has shown us over and over again that dialogue is not his strong point. He is a painter and painter. His films are almost always visually splendid, but as exciting to be seen as the paint that is already dry. Watch your movies on fast forward, the very fast setup you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or the characters, using them simply as a network to hang a very long and well-built cinematic frame. He goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to achieve these excruciating, slow, lifeless scenes. There is nothing of the novel, magic, trick or urgency that the script demands, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a tremendous and insane idiot, similar to Gaveston in Edward II of Jarman. It's a shame that this is only the only film version of The Tempest available.
