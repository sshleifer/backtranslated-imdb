If it is an art and rehearsal film, there is not enough art, not to mention essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there is not enough thriller. <br /> <br /> If it's a teenage drama, there's enough drama, and as far as teenagers are concerned, there is not enough NOFX and Nino Rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's upcoming movie, but there is no Tony Hawk, so I guess I was fooled: it's not Tony Hawk's biopic. <br /> <br /> If it's an action movie, it has no bangs, which would have added some interest to it, or at least would have made the sleepers jump in their seats. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it's a movie, there's enough storyline. If it's not a movie, it's a long time to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, well ... it's an album that I will not buy
