Half Past Dead was unlike any Steven Segal movie I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, himself in action and I agree with the last review I read, Nia Peeples steals the show. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything really new here, just the same old things from other movies have changed around a little. The best action scenes were those of Nia when she once again kicked her butt. It was interesting to see her as the villain after seeing her for two seasons in Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking her butt, but for the good guys. <br /> <br />
