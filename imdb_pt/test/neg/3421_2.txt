This film illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that hinders it. <br /> <br /> Incredible talent, remarkable performances (particularly by Victoria Hill), but a disappointment in virtually every other aspect. <br /> <br /> A kind of "adaptation," did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, establishing it in present-day Australia is not enough), and essentially failed completely to justify its existence, besides face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there is a body of work that was done (and done and done and done), it is Shakespeare's. Therefore, any adaptation, if not a self-indulgent and meaningless exercise, must at least bring some new interpretation to the work. <br /> <br /> And that's what this Macbeth can not do. As it was made, this film has no contemporary relevance. It's the same piece we saw countless (many!) Times before. Except with different weapons and clothes. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fundamental error (there is no other way to say) to keep the original dialogue of Shakespeare, one of the most dismal moments of the film is the prolonged and unbelievable slow and boring camera exit towards the end , during which I completely shut down, even though I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had little attention, but there you go. <br /> <br /> I suppose the film succeeds in very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class talent, its filmmakers need to stop being proud of succeeding in limited terms and actually setting standards high enough to show they respect the kind of talent they work with. A shame. An absolute shame.
