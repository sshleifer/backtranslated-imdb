A zombie curse is placed on a woman, which causes her to have live snakes inside her. Brujo, who is taking care of her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several clashes on the train, Brujo's collection of snakes can separate from its owner and go hunting. While all this is happening, normal and everyday passengers are relaxing, what is unknown to them is that something mortal is walking towards them, and that there is nothing outside them. <br /> <br /> After watching the wonderfully fun snakes on an airplane, I had to check this out. I knew it was going to be a swipe and that the movie would seem cheap but what I found was the worst to watch. The whole curse plot was foolish and should never have been included. The special effects are not terrible, but they are not the most beautiful. I had no idea about the ending. It was silly to watch and pathetic. The acting was absolutely terrible and looked bad. They simply could not act to save their lives. If you want to have a good laugh, watch this, otherwise you should avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a runaway train. - Master (Stephen A.F. Day)
