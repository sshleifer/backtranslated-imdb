Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice Cream, I scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with the dream of Ali, an ice traveler. a cream vendor in a town in Western Anatolia, where he finds himself succeeding using the same marketing methods as large ice cream companies. He dreams of playing the TV commercial of his product with beautiful bikini models, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gigantic wife, who refuses to have sex with him for six years for no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful at his job? Apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies. But that's what he says; in fact, we do not see him suffer so much: he still sells well, traveling through the surrounding villages while his apprentice stays in the store, selling ice cream to the townspeople. Ali blames big companies for using sweeteners and dyes while he's using the real "sahlep" (powder roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to be a street vendor and gives ads to a local TV channel that prefers to even broadcast the news bulletin in the local dialect. His wife does not like his ways of doing business, they always fight, and Ali the threat that he can do very bad things in a moment of frenzy. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, his bad bike is stolen by the city's poorly behaved boys. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the robbery, but of course, no one takes him seriously. Angered by his wife's irritation, Ali goes to a tavern and gets drunk. One of his friends at his desk, a socialist aspirant in the city, makes a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and without any real connection, jumps to the subject of the global freeze. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and stops him. An old neighbor takes you for an evening stroll and advises you on life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world face global frostbite. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife understood his value, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile, thieves became ill eating a lot of ice cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and the happy ending arrives. Although the plot may seem promising in a way, it is the storytelling that makes this movie insincere and tacky. First, the director does not show much effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems are not convincing because we do not see, we only understand his words. The director markets his film as Ali's just fight against big ice cream companies, but there's nothing in the movie about big companies. We do not see their pressure enough. The film really ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when her motorcycle is found, she solves all problems: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. It is not a real critique of globalism. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie is tacky because of raw humor. Perhaps the people of that part of Turkey are cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and raw humor are not enough to make a funny movie. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and "smart" at the same time, but they are not clever jokes, they are just cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe Americans might like the American version of American Pie's American humor. But American Pie never had any claim to be an Oscar nominee, or to have a political message! If you think you can laugh just by seeing a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) Or an old villager saying "f ** k you," then you might find this movie funny.
