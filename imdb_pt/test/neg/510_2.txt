It's disturbing to see so many people giving outrageously high rates to this movie. Some of the compliments use such distorted reasoning (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the US) approaching hysteria. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate is a bad movie, it's fundamentally horrible. Endless scenes using elaborate images that are useless, muddy dialogue, obscure narration, no sense of any subject beyond excess ... <br /> <br /> The high rank of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary changes. in perception. <br /> <br /> For some perspective, watch Lawrence of Arabia before attending the Gate of Paradise. You will see just how pointless and lost this movie truly is. The "issues" he may have tried to deal with are lost in a miasma. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with movies that are critical of the US itself, but when a terrible movie gets undeserved praise. purely because of this element ... which is worth challenging. <br /> <br /> The film is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity, and as a warning tale for young filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I saw this at home for free, imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it ... for 4 hours winding!
