This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only is it a comedy, which is not funny, but is also very poorly done with an overly full direction of unnecessary split screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" in their fantasy language are simply annoying and confused me enough, that they have touched the genitals all the time. But the worst of all this nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that film some appeal, referring to German history and showing sensitive aspects of the "heroes", who finds its climax in showing how Erkan and Stefan heal a woman mentally ill with his "cheerful" lifestyle (!). But I did not expect anything better with director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also did two non-funny TV shows, a not-so-funny Western movie and a comedy movie of almost no funny humor. But Erkan and Stefan were a little better at some of their stand-up shows. For me, the only good thing about the film is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful to me.
