If you like really shocking movies, this is for you. The acting is the worst I've ever seen and the plot does not happen. If you come across this movie in your video store, do not even consider lending it. The girl on the cover is not even the one in the movie. I gave this movie 1/10 just because I could not vote 0. Avoid at all costs.
