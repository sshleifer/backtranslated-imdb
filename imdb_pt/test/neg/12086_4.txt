Despite the strong performances of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to spark the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happened to Mrs. Driver? It had such great potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> This to me was almost like an 1850 version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of its father, Driver assumes a position like governess of a Christian family, hiding its Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> Although I realize that this is a period of peace, it was terribly annoying even in 1850 in England. and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The housewife is more annoying with that voice of her song. I hoped she'd refer to Driver as her mistress at any moment. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know the driver is trying to pass himself off as a Christian, but does this name mean all the way? <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Mary finds love with the young accuser's father (Wilkinson) and her emotionally unbalanced. son. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing we see is that Mary found a profession to provide her family photography. Did we really need to subject ourselves to what was going on throughout the film? The first scenes of Judaism practiced in nineteenth-century England and the cholera epidemic in the end could have been more explored. There is a clear underlying sentiment of anti-Semitism by the Wilkinson family, but this is never allowed out.
