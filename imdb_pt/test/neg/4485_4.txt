I was convinced to see this for a girlfriend ... John was a good, sweet, sensitive guy and looks great without a shirt !! I thought it was a love story about the two, but it was mostly about her reactions to her letters. Savannah was a nice character at the beginning of the movie, but once she let it go, I lost respect for her. She said that he separated her being away from him and it was difficult - he was the only one million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he got was through his letters !!! She did not have it hard, she had family & money and he had a tour of duty !! I was so frustrated with the ending when he forgave her - he was very loving. I would have waited 3 years and received it at home with open arms.
