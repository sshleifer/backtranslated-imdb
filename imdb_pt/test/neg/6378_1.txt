Comedy works best when it comes to things that are true. But even so, it takes some effort to make jokes that everyone likes and even the moodiest of viewers can smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole thing "it's funny because it's true," but I do not see, however, the effort and often I do not, whether they're being funny or just trying to make a point I notice this mainly in the interview segments). The Daily Show began as a parody of news, by definition they scoff at how the media interpret their own news by pretending to be inept and stupid reporters and get hooked and they tackled various science subjects to film and sometimes politics, so Jon Stewart came along ... and everything went to hell. In the early years of Jon Stewart's reign were undoubtedly golden, I thought he was so funny but then came 2004 and it's where you get to notice a big chance on the show from there. The mood of the show was spoiled, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the show's best anchors were gone and now it's mostly about Jon Stewart and the show went from a parody to a semi-serious, essentially Evening News, but with a few jokes here and there. For those who have not seen the program and are having trouble figuring out what to see on the channel, I'll give a brief description of what the program is (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (unless they also embrace an opinion shared by the Democrats) are stupid, perverse, corrupt and hypocritical, anyone who espouses conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and hypocritical; - people who doubt the theory of global warming produced by man are bad and stupid; -vote democrat; There, I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go see something else. At first I thought the producers hijacked the program for their own personal political agenda, but when I actually see the interviews, it's clear what the show is like (what I mentioned above), but I'll get to that in a moment. Anyway, humor on The Daily Show, according to Jon Stewart, hopes you find a random quote, told by Bush, Cheney or a random Republican humorist, because well, why. Jon defines the joke by defining it in specific contexts of writers and hopes that the random citation in some way offers the joke. So, unless you "get" the context, it's totally useless as a banal mood. Also the Daily Show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of a politician speaking and in another separate video saying something else, again putting it in a context that writers expect you to understand, making it funny, why? Well, because Jon said that. Now imagine The Daily Show using this formula countless times for years every week, and you will begin to understand what used to be a laugh fest that is now only 25 minutes of silent stares (yes, even in the Lewis Black segments). At first, a decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. And the interview has the strangest sense of prejudice I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks every actor and democrat (John Kerry before, Obama today) who appears on the show and scorns the respected Republicans and conservative journalists. as Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard? He puts them in some kind of popular court as if they were being charged with a crime, often anyone on the show who defends Bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person were out of touch with reality and assumed that he speaks to most of the United States, that's the de facto treatment for any conservative, unless they share a similar point of view with the Democrats, if so, then it's an endless love party. But still, it does not matter, in Jon's eyes you're already wrong before entering the show and are still wrong after. That's the kind of treatment you get if you're anything remotely right. Now you have to know what this might have something to do with humor. One wonders what will happen if the Democrats win the White House ...
