Total misery! Really horrible! The script and the dialogue are a joke, and combined with a director who has no idea about life in Saudi Arabia. Not surprisingly, a Saudi film, the director is Palestinian-Canadian, the writer is Lebanese, the main actress is Jordanian, and filming took place in Dubai, and all these elements show very well to make the film far from representing the society. Yes, it does contain some Saudi cliches, the things we see in cartoons in the newspapers every day, but that's all. The film had the opportunity to show a real problem with Saudi society, or at least gave us something new and genuine about the problems and concerns of youth in Saudi Arabia, instead copied and pasted from here and there, and the result was a mess. Even the supposed love story in the movie does not exist or at least we did not see it. The only bright side in this total failure is a good supporting cast performance. Veteran Khaled Sami was funny in a poorly written role as the great father, which he is clearly misunderstood because he seems younger than the actor who plays his son. Also the actor who plays the role of the fanatical brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, did well, in fact he was the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast, being professionals for a long time, did a good job, but the lead actor, Hisham Abdulrahman, was lousy. He had a look of a lovely bobby for every situation. He could not even say his lines properly. He has charisma that earned him the title of Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and he is good at interviews and TV shows, but he was only the weakest link in this film. The lead actress did not much care, but even she acted badly on some scenes and exaggerated her sensuality unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge success, Saudi Arabia gathered in thousands for the neighboring Bahrain and Dubai attended when it was shown there, and earned a tone of money, then was shown on pay per view, after in the TV broadcast, and this lasted a few weeks. This was to cash in on the Saudis' craving for home entertainment, but unfortunately; the film was neither homemade nor funny.
