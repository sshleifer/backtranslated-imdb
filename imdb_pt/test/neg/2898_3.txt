"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. It will hardly please fans of martial arts movies because there is not enough action but even the action scenes themselves are often marred by laughable excesses and unnecessary violence. As if the film was not weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of him into an idiot "The Exorcist." The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine; she is a beautiful, athletic woman who the director does not forget to explore in various mean ways - she is simply an aerobics teacher. I do not care about a small exploration of soft-core, but it should not pretend to be anything else.
