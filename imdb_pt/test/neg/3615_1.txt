Now we know where they got the idea from Snakes on a Plane. To be honest, do not pay to see this movie. If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then grab it on the cable, or grab it as a free choice from Netflix or Blockbuster. Do not pay to rent this. If you pay to rent this then you are a stupid individual. The acting was horrible, the plot was horrible, everything was horrible except for the snakes. If they were real or generated by CGI, they looked very good. But having said that, this movie still has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the naked dance scene was really bad that I actually went through it. I did not sit, I did not warn you.
