If you're looking for summer success, Dark Harvest 2 might be your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (it looks like they were filmed with a Sony Handicam and edited using iMovie), especially the sound effects - they sound directly from a Spooky Halloween Sounds CD! The scarecrow on the cover, although it does not appear in the film and is irrelevant, is terribly realistic! From beginning to end, you will see how a man searches aimlessly for his daughters through a pun on the CORN! At the end of the movie, you'll see, well ... you'll have to watch for yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm really trying to say here is: do not go within 1000 yards of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be kind of a funny "Troll 2", but it's not. I cried after watching this movie, because I realized that I had spent money on it (and found the $ 4 I spent to rent it). I actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.
