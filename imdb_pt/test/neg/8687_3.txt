The evil below begins in "The Strait of San Sebastian 1683" as the 17th century treasure ship El Diablo sinks in a violent storm. Go to 'The Strait of San Sebastian' day where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, to come across the sunken wreck of El Diablo & exploit it but are attacked and killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns a rental boat called "Vagrant Viking," which caters to tourists who want to fish, dive and generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher who dives into treasure as a hobby (well, we all have to do something to get the time right?), She hires Max and her half-witted assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) so she can try to locate El Diablo and get rich. Talking about sunken treasures excites some of the more unscrupulous members of the local community as they dodge criminals and thugs, it catches the attention of Max and Sarah that El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that supposedly still leaves its supernatural legacy for back even now ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jean-Claude Dubois, according to IMDb, with a little help from the star Crawford, although the version I saw only listed Dubois, I thought the evil below had some potential and is a bit different, but unfortunately that's not enough to save you from sinking into the bottom of the sea like a rock. Arthur Payne's script begins well with the two divers being killed by some kind of marine creature, but that opening is NEVER mentioned again, the creature is NEVER seen again and there are no more supernatural deaths. The Bad Below, then, suffers from a serious and terminal case of identity crisis, he does not seem to know what he wants to be while filming pieces of various genres of underwater adventure, terror, action, suspense, crime and still has time to launch a little murder mystery and religious nonsense too. As a result, the Evil Below looks very bitty, fragmented and as the best scene in the entire movie is the opening sequence, I found myself sitting there getting more and more frustrated with the lack of any horror consistency as it went down quickly and the fact of us never see the sea creature again. The evil below is dull, slow, monotonous, predictable, silly and has no charm or intelligence whatsoever, in short The evil below does not do anything right that a good movie should. Director Dubois failed to cheer things up, although he obviously shot a lot of underwater footage of wildlife, sometimes I thought I was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the shots of fish, corals and wildlife in general. Forget any bleeding, some blood stained water and blood cough is almost as bloody as it gets scared. <br/> <br/> Technically, the evil below is very basic, it is soft and totally forgettable apart from the nice underwater photograph of fish. This is a point and shoot things and as a whole, the production values ​​are very low, even the place where this was shot does not look too sunny or attractive. The acting is bad, but then again, did you expect anything else? <br /> <br /> The evil below is a bad movie, it's a basic story everywhere and you can not decide what you want to be. As a result, it ends up being a mess. Add that to the low production values, the fact that there is no blood here and absolutely minimal terror content, you have a movie that is probably best avoided unless you are absolutely desperate and yet there are better ways to spend 90 more minutes of his life. .
