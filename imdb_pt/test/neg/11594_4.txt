This is like a zoology book, given that its representation of animals is so accurate. However, here are some details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to the movie: <br /> <br /> - Revolver bullets never hit giant Komodo dragons. No matter how many times you shoot at Komodo, the bullets will not get close to him. <br /> <br /> - The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant Snake, or a giant Komodo dragon, is to just stay there. The exception to this rule is if you've been told to stay very quiet, in which case you should run away, until the Komodo is right next to you, and then you should stay there, waiting for defeat. <br /> <br /> - Minutes of shaken footage in slow motion behind the credits actually make for pleasant viewing. <br /> <br /> - $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool and ample replacement to lose your boat / arrest license. <BR> - Members of elite army units do not see giant Komodo dragons arrive until they are within one meter of large beings. Perhaps the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> - When filming a report for the purpose of exposing tests on illegal animals, a reporter and cameraman with a camera is all the equipment and personnel you will need; sound equipment, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous. <br /> <br /> - When you hear a loud animal scream, and a person has a gun, he should take it off and point it at the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - When you take out a gun, the sound of security being taken will be done, even if your finger is far from security <br /> <br /> - Reporters agree to go halfway around of the world in order to expose something - without having the slightest idea of ​​what they are exposing. Background research and vague knowledge are outmoded in modern journalism. <br /> <br /> - Firearms carry at least 52 bullets in one clip, and more than that in the next clip. Nevertheless, those with guns claim they will need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> - expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without hesitation or even a moment of regret. These cameras can reach the reporter by themselves. <br /> <br /> - The blond girl is really the stupid. <br /> <br /> - The same girl who says not to enter a house because a Komodo dragon can easily pass through it, making it insecure, takes a team to a building made of the same material for protection - and no one say a word about it. <br /> <br /> - High tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets. <br /> <br /> - Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 meters in length in a matter of a day, but do not grow at all. weeks on both sides. <br /> <br /> - The military routinely destroys entire islands when people do not meet the deadlines for contact. <br /> <br /> Men with guns do not necessarily change the direction they're shooting when their target is no longer in front of them. Instead, they just keep firing into the air. <br /> <br /> - The more beautiful you are, the greater your chances of surviving giant creatures. <br /> <br /> - Female intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds. <br /> <br /> Every time you're being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit girls half your age. <br /> <br /> - Animal noises are a masking noise appropriate for 'swearing' in the same volume. <br /> <br /> - The old Israeli and Russian airplanes are regularly used by the US Armed Forces.
