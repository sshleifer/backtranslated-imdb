Visually, this movie is interesting. The light is literally thrown in a way along with cinematography and a seductive introduction before the titles, which had my hopes at the beginning, but then - a movie b is a movie b is a movie b, no matter how much spectacle it is seen . This film involves the life of Albert Fish, one of the most well-known serial killers in the world. Active around the early 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry before he starts killing children at an advanced age. This film is based on two tracks: the life of Fish and that of William F. King, principal investigator of the case. What saves this film from becoming a Hallmark show and a failure of the usual kind, whenever serial killers are concerned, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; Director Scott L. Flynn throws enough focus on the b-actors to not let their flaws shine too much, but at the same time created a truly stupid and stereotyped view of American police through King's angle. Sure enough, he dealt a lot with Fish's encounter with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl he killed, though I'm not sure if his mother was the media madman Flynn really tries to emphasize who she was. I miss more psychological diving at Fish, not to mention the little time that was spent on Fish's post-catch. All in all, interesting for those who are into serial killers, but mostly a disappointment; however, if the director makes another movie about another serial killer, I would definitely see it in the hope that the holes would be fixed.
