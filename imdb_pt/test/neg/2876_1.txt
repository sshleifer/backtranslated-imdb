For me, Bollywood movies are generally not very good, although they are still quite wanted and Bollywood is a big file producer because they have their own fans. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched the movie was to see how much an American actress could change or affect the logic of the Indian movie. Not only did it not change the story of the movie, but this mix caused a ridiculous series of events. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's very common to see loads of illogical things through Indian movies because they have their own world in their lives. movies. But once you see such incidents happen to an American, that will make you laugh. For God's sake you can believe that a famous American actress is trapped in a desperate situation and feels helpless. Can you imagine that an American actress falls in love with a dance instructor whose fianc√©e has fallen in love with her American boyfriend and they met at the same time? There were many similar things to mention. The less said the better. <br /> <br /> Maybe I was wrong, as I expected a lot from Indian movies.
