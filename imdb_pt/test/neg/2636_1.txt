This movie sucked. The script is so full of holes; I do not see how the producers agreed to fund it. <br /> <br /> We are never given an explanation of ANYTHING. The acting is horrible. The plot sucks. This movie was obviously written for those 8 years or less. <br /> <br /> I have to say: why do high school classes last only 2 minutes? The teacher walks in, finds a frog on the desk or draws it on the chalkboard, and 30 seconds later the bell rings, class is over. The children did not even open the books. Can we have at least a little continuity? <br /> <br /> Oh, the dialogue. Milo Jeter is the fetus reincarnated, aborted, zombie. We really need the line: "This is Dr. Jeter's office, Dr. Jeter, Milo's father." Thanks for the tip; I could never put it together myself. It never gets better. <br /> <br /> Why does Milo speak the way he talks, even in the beginning? Milo was never "real". Or was he never real, just always what he is today? And if it was always like this, why did the inexplicable 'accident' Milo have? <br /> <br /> In addition to "What is Milo?", What are all the unresolved items worth? We see all these contraptions in his father's doctor's office, and they are never given explanations of what they are, or what they have to do with history. What are the injections for? What about the aquarium contraption? They obviously are not needed. (See the movie, it will make sense). And what does this medicine do with someone? Apparently nothing, since it has no effect on the main actress. <br /> <br /> This movie is very, very bad, ripped from all the other horror films. It really is a horrible Friday the 13th / Halloween played together by a writer for 10 years. It's not cheesy enough to laugh, it's just an incredibly frustrating hassle.
