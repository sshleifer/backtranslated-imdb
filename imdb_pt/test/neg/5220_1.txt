This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. What they were thinking. Stop preaching to me now! That's why we all watch Walker Texas Ranger and we will not admit it to our friends. Terrible acting and an extremely fake plot. As the film unfolds, the story stops and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The director somehow believed that the two blended well. It looked like crap! When I saw the title in my local blockbusters, it seemed interesting. They should have been a warning saying he was religious instead of the false propaganda of an action / adventure. First time in a long time I stopped a movie and could not tolerate the finish.
