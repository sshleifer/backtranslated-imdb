I found this movie in a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. The interesting thing is that Camp Video bought the rights and put a copy in 1986 in the credits. Anyway, enough of strange facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is not absolutely scary. Even calling it horror or "suspense" is laughable. There was only about 5 minutes for most of what you would call horror in this 80+ minute movie, and that consisted of acting because it was HORRIBLE! All the puns aside, writing for this movie was absolute rubbish as well, as the special effects and makeup was laughable. No wonder this is such a dark movie, the director has probably spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all the existing copies and burning them in a big pile so that no one else could be subjected to it.
