A few weeks ago, in a movie theater, I saw a movie poster of El Padrino (2004) with the tag "The Latin Godfather". How stupid have we become, I thought, Latin just because he's Mexican? Let me remind you that ANY Latin comes from or is related to Latium, Italy, So the original guy from the movie The Godfather is more Latin than the Mexican godfather and that's why: We are called Latin Americans because we speak Spanish , language based on the Latin language that originated in Rome now Italy. So putting a tag on a movie poster like "The Latin Godfather" is not only ignorant, of course, if we are trying to relate this movie to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a classic movie. Now about the movie, I hate overacting so from 1 to 10 I think it's 3 more.
