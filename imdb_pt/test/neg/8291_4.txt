"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981, during the heyday of the madness of horror films. Earlier that year, fans were submitted to such films as "My Bloody Valentine," "Just Before Dawn," "Friday the 13th Part 2," and "The Burning," and movie theaters were still expecting movies like "Halloween II," " The Prowler "and" Happy Birthday to Me ". I've seen all these movies, and all of the popular slashers from 1981's "Graduation Day" is by far the worst. What "Graduation Day" equates to a low budget exercise filming with poor acting, poor writing, meaningless characters, nonsensical scenes, unnecessary nudity, tacky dialogue, and an editing experiment that does not it worked so well. And who could forget the classic 1980s disco music that plays throughout the movie (the music of the opening scene is only rivaled by the music that plays during a chase scene). However, when renting a movie like this, a person should be aware that these details will be in this movie. So why "Graduation Day" is not considered a classic like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom Night" ? Why are fans still looking for these movies but ignore it without care? <br /> <br /> Where horror movies need to succeed above all other areas is in the rhythm. There is nothing worse than a slow slasher, and "Graduation Day" moves very slowly. The most aggravating part is that there are many opportunities to speed things up; there are countless nonsensical characters who are introduced and who are never allowed to be a suspect in the murders or being a victim. There is a despicable teacher, a stressed-out director, an astute secretary, a school security guard, an impudent detective, an alcoholic stepfather, an irrational grandmother, and a mother to a previous victim still suffering. All of these characters may have a reason to kill or a reason to be killed, but all of them are wasted. The worst part is that the story still focuses on them and sometimes designates whole scenes just to perfect their character. But for what? <br /> <br /> What impresses me about "Graduation Day" and its small fan base is that people are no longer impressed by the death scenes. Fans go crazy for death scenes like the rampage on "The Burning," the death of the washing machine on "My Bloody Valentine," Kabob's death on "Happy Birthday to Me," the death reversed in " Friday the 13th Part 3 "and death of hot tub in" Halloween II ", and even death of car hood in" Madman. " But where is the respect for some truly unique (even if extravagant) deaths on "Graduation Day." One victim is impaled by the jugular with a sword of fencing, while another receives that sword thrown against her like a dart. The best death includes peaks under a carpet. Why are not these deaths famous in the genre as the deaths in most popular horror movies? <br /> <br /> "Graduation Day" strives to be a great and unique movie, but there is only one element of logic and lack of rhythm that really spoils the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try checking "Do not go in the woods ... Alone") and there's a bit of suspense as well as offering exactly what the fans are looking for (blood, nudity, sex, nostalgia) , but "Graduation Day" will not be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made. It's not a matter of budget - almost every slasher has a low budget - however, it's a matter of ideas, creativity and skill. That's all any kind of movie is ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. Horror fans can get a little bored, and people who do not have much interest in horror should stay away. It's not the worst horror movie ever made, but it's far from the best.
