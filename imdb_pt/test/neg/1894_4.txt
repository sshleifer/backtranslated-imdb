Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Filmed in Toronto, it's more a feature of the 80's era on the dangers of urban jungle where the police are afraid to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. In this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing, a fierce young woman raised by a lady in the sack after her parents were murdered by a dirty cop (Take-Maury Chaykin) and local crime lord (Robert Davi) Chopper. Mix the local benefactors (Father Sean Hewitt and out-of-town social worker Kathleen Quinlan) and you'll have a recipe for some pretty uninteresting action sequences. David is the highlight of the cast, and director of photography Rene Verzier does a great job. Otherwise, this is a pretty lumpen action photo that will not satisfy the action fans and leave the admirers of Sayles gaping.
