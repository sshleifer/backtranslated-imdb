This is a stupid movie. When I saw in a movie theater, more than half of the audience left before it was over. I stayed until the bitter end. To show courage? I picked it up again on television and it was a lot funnier. It's still not a classic, or even consistently hilarious, but the family has grown in me. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better to do and it's free on t.v. you could do worse.
