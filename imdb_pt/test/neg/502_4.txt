The movie, Heaven's Gate, was a good sight, though still tedious in over 4 hours. But the movie was heavily licensed - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" actually married in real life. His main contribution to the Johnson County war was to begin by being hanged. Well, at the beginning, I mean it came in the beginning, not the end. Here's the real picture: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because a country estate could be given to every family. By presenting single individuals, they could get two properties. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek, actually controlling the above-ground water maintained by a mighty member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them repeatedly, which they refused. Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she bought many sick heads of cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Catadores Association of receiving the cattle in exchange for "indecent acts." In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act. It is almost certain that this is false, both for that part of the myth of the "American West", which is a gooble-of-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life She and Jim Averill were one day surprised by several members of the Association of Pickers, taken in hand, and promptly hanged, Those who perpetrated injustice were never brought to trial, but this was the the first link that led to the assassination of Nate Champion, and the beginning of the war in Johnson County. <br /> <br /> Very different from the Hollywood version that shows your chance at the end. <br /> <br /> Other than that, I think the main problem The movie was the publisher, who could have accelerated the action with a more skilful editing.
