Harry Knowles has a quote right on the cover of the DVD saying "The Next Icon of Horror" Really?!?!?!? I heard a lot of hype around this, but I was not totally convinced. However, I am a fan of hard terror and will give the chance to any horror movie. No matter the budget or the cause of the ranking you never know where you will find the next gem. Not here. It's not Hatchet. Hatchet is ill-conceived, misrepresented and not funny. Just because you have the actors who played Freddy Jason and Candyman and a chic topless Buffy with tons of blood does not make you a horror expert. I do not even want to describe the plot because it's so stupid. Honestly my money is in Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows the terror of the old school. Forget this crap.
