After seeing the movie, I feel that the father and mother are both a reasonable person, although they are not perfect at all. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. <br /> <br /> Is a person's journal an exact portrait of itself? No. Most of the time, people only write problems in their diary because they want to solve the problem. So a diary is always a more negative side of a person. In this film, the author judges the life of his mother by his diary. It is not a wise choice. <br /> <br /> The author's older sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said her father's second marriage was "not fair" to her mother. So she said she does not love her mother. So she does not love father and mother. I doubt she loves anyone in the world. Your face is so ugly, just a reflection of your heart. Throughout the film, I feel that the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect for their parents. However, I feel that the father is mother are very loving to their children, even the author tries to portray them as a cold and misleading person.
