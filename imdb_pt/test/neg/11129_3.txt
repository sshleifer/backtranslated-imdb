What a boring movie. Although it had funny parts, it was just annoying and time consuming (for a 90 minute movie). I believe the cause was the lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I expected to see the white blood cells fighting the evil virus, but I was not so lucky. It was more that the virus was frustrated than defeated. <br /> <br /> The film was promising, but since it was made for the little kids in mind, it did not find its potential in my opinion.
