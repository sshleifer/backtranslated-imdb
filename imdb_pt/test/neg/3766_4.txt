I saw it for the first time when it came out in the movies. Although only 13 years old at the time, I was an avid reader of "science-heavy" science fiction stories. The technical gafes of the film are etched in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> Even when I was young, I knew the premise was silly. The rocket takes off for a lunar mission, in a cosmos where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (although loose objects float as in zero gravity) and because of this, the "booth" (the area with the controls, what they were (so that when they landed, why did not they land on their heads?) and where, at least in space near Earth, the rocket engines had to be running continuously - with When the engines stopped, the rocket stopped in space, and it could not go until a PhD chemist determined it needed some oxidizer. This time, the rocket reminded him that he had momentum, and the next thing that our heroes know they are close to Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that a minimum energy trip would take more than 200 days). <br /> <They land, they find that the air was breathable scientific data reveals that the pressure, even if the atmosphere were pure oxygen, would be too low to do any good). They decide to camp out of the ship and even build a campfire. They come armed, although they are supposed to be going to the moon, where guns would not be needed. <br /> <br /> They see a collapsed civilization, encounter lost Martians who resemble people, develop an anti-nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to return to their home planet and die in an attempt to collide with the Earth! To do so would require such a long orbital period, they would have died of starvation long before approaching their destination. The movie that he preceded, Destination Moon, used the real science more effectively (though "rescue" with the Oxygen Tank forgot the moment arm of the center of gravity of the tank to the outlet nozzle Only the most illiterate technologists should think of it as a science-fiction movie: it's on the same level as the old Flash Gordon sitcoms, where their rockets took off from their bellies and spiraled , and whose engines were always on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story about this I consider banal, and I can recommend this just as a movie to be shown to students for them to choose technical gaffes.
