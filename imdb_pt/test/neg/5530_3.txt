I'm so glad I got this movie for $ 5. Anime is expensive, there's no doubt about it. I had my eye on this for a while and finally I saw it on sale. I grabbed him right away and took him home only to cut off his head. This movie sucks. I've heard people talk about how bloody and violent this movie is. It's not really that bloody or violent. I've watched it three times, and I think I've lost enough of my life on it. Demons have a point of being single and cool sometimes. Sex gets a point since it's almost non-stop. The horny old man gets half a stitch from being aroused and still having the sex drive. And the main character (whose name I deleted from my mind) gets half a point by the cool design of his weapon. I've seen great connections between this movie and the Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style animation, which is obvious because of the director, both have thighs that suck like the Antichrist, and both have terrible endings. Avoid this movie unless you're into anime sex.
