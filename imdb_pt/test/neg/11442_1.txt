"Catchfire" or "Backtrack" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. I mean, it's bad. Jodie Foster had already won an Oscar at the moment. Why did she agree to do that? I do not know. <br /> <br /> The hostage / kidnapper relationship is not credible, even though it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, this movie features a scene where Hopper and Foster ride by boat under the Fremont Bridge (a bridge in Seattle), which means that the traffic had to stop so the bridge could to open. I had to wait for the bridge to collapse many times, almost all on the bus. Not a pleasant wait. This movie caused an unnecessary wait for the bridge and the world is a worse place for that.
