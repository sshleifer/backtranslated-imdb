Where to start ?? I think only three other films led me to publish a critique of IMDb, and they were all positive. About that ...? <br /> <br /> Lie, hideous, tragically, embarrassingly, catastrophically, stupidly, annoyingly, completely and completely beyond horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm impressed, this was done, no matter, given a theatrical release. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I'm not a snob. I did not expect a wonderful film production or intense character depth, but that's really a joke. We simply MUST demand more from the movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like the black plague.
