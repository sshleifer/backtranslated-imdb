As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara as Vivien Leigh, and no one can play Rhett Butler as Clark Gable. All others pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exception. One thing I did not really get through was that Joanne has brown eyes. The green eyes were the most striking feature of Scarlett's good looks, and in that sequence she was stripped of them. <br /> <br /> The film, like the book, contained several pauses. The new characters were not so memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt like she was going to Ireland did absolutely nothing. It may be that I was only 11 years old, but I did not see any change in his attitude until the last word, 10 minutes when Rhett said she had grown up. If Rhett had not said that, I would never have guessed that there was any change in his attitude. She really loved Cat, her baby. She likes this child better because she had it with Rhett, her only beloved husband. Still, if you read And the Wind Took, you would see that children do not make a difference in Scarlett's world. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it seemed to me that there was a lot going on without Rhett. All one wants to know is if Rhett and Scarlett get back together, and Scarlett took too long to get there. It's practically nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but what's not? If you read the novel, you will like it more than the movie. <br /> <br /> I watched, just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind regardless of whether it's worth it or not. It may not please you completely, but it will get you there.
