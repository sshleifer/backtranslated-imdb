Set in the mid 1800s, when the British are cleaning the New Zealand desert to establish colonies. The daughter of a British Army surgeon, Sarah (Samantha Morton), falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maoris are an indigenous tribe and a people dangerous to Europeans. When Sarah's child, whom she calls "Boy", is born, her father is dead. At age six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will begin his quest for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland), who is deeply in love with her. <br /> <br /> Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of the film. Sutherland is a total waste. Also starring are: Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Penis. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and scenes from violent battles. I think the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover only with Sutherland and make you believe that he is the protagonist must be a crime.
