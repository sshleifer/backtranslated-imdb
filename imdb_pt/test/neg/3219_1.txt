I'm a sucker for gang movies, so I rented this movie. This movie is a complete train wreck. With all the big name actors in this movie, I can not believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically at the end of the movie. The actor best known as Zues or the big guy in the movie Ice Cube "Friday" does an incredible job exaggerated throughout the film. The first thing I told Blockbuster when I came back the movie was to remove that garbage from its shelves. Do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life. If they leave with a sequel, I wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. I'll be more cautious when renting movies called 'mob / gangland'.
