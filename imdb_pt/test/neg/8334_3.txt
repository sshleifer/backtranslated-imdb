When the movie started, I had the feeling that this would be something special. The acting and the camera work were undoubtedly good. I also liked the characters and could have grown up to empathize with them. The film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, as the film continued, the plot never seemed to take off and just rolled scene by scene. I could not understand the connection between the stories. All I could see were the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles. Without this connection, I ended up with a few remarkable stories. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised you've done so well in Cannes.
