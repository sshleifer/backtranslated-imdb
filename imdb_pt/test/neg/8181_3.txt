After watching Avalon (which was decent just because of the very cool digital fx), and several anime movies written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic) I decided I should take a look at the box set of the trilogy of Oshii cinema. Since the Red Shows and the Vaginal Dog are related, I will comment here on both. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest waste of money I've spent in a while. I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I'm sad to say that these films are possibly the two most annoying movies I've ever seen. For only about 10 minutes in each movie you can see some action between the characters, who are only dressed in the clothes "Panzer Cop" for some fleeting scenes. The rest of the time, you will see some very elaborate scenes, full of boring dialogues in some less impressive places. I really do not understand the motivation behind these two films. I love the clothes of the Wolf Brigade and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave a lot to be desired. I would suggest not watching these movies, and certainly not buying the box like I do, unless you enjoy spending money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think about the third movie on set, Talking Head, I could not even watch it before clearing the box from my DVD collection via eBay with a $ 20 loss. you want a cool Japanese live action, check out Returner, or Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series.
