My partner and I chose to watch this obvious piece of junk purely based on his slogan ?? After almost 30 years of bad and rudimentary teenage slashers, I can not believe that just now some brainiac nerd of terror comes up with the brilliantly witty slogan "They Axed for it"! Other than that, "Miner Massacre" is as random, annoying and forgettable as all the rest out there ??. Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical cliches and features all the terribly stereotyped characters that you wish for a horrible and painful death. The bloody effects are computer-designed and therefore beyond pitiful, and the obligatory "big" stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are totally wasted, despite their higher billing. Damned mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal terror scenario? the creators of "My Bloody Valentine" already realized this in the beginning of the 80 ?? but his tedious film simply has no groundbreaking ideas or remotely surprising elements to offer. A bunch of greedy, twenty-something losers, who refer to themselves as friends, though they clearly can not stand each other, desecrate an old mine in search of the gold that is supposed to be hidden there. Of course they resurrected the zombie miner this way and he only had 150 years of rest to prepare for a massive massacre of teenagers. Yay! The cast is exceptionally annoying in this. All the girls have awesome shelves, but they refuse to show anything. Instead, they all prefer to lament endlessly and take unnecessary risks. Stupid guys clearly serve only as screen fillers. In her almost five minutes of recreation, Karen Black can still make a fool of herself by designing the most prototypical and hysterical local woman of all time. The zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but he looks well and reasonably menacing when shown in the distant moonlight shade, swinging around his pick. Since the best thing about the "Miner's Massacre" concerns the above-mentioned slogan and you can read this in the box of the own store, there is not much to recommend here. Director John Carl Buechler achieved some modest successes during the 1980s, such as the original "Troll" and a "Friday 13" fair, but it's obvious that it's time to retire now.
