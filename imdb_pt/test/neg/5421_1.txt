Oh boy! I really destroyed Manhunt in Space. I think this flopper is deservedly worse than Manhunt. It does not work at all and the fungus growth was more exciting than this junk. <br /> <br /> Poor Cleolanta. She's so misunderstood. Smug Rocky approaches and fortunately, there is no mention of Winky about his "gay nightlife". There are a lot more conversations, a really awful wedding (to watch) in space, and clippings of crappy effects in space. So there's Bobby. You decide who is more annoying: Bobby or Winkster? Personally, I would throw them out of an air lock into a black hole, not before subjecting them to killer meat by eating alien mutants. <br /> <br /> At least there is Vena. She's just a cosmic girl!
