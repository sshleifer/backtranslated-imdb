I know it's not original, but what the hey? What else can be said about this? I feel indisputably silly just watching "From Hell It Cam". The film makes the important political and social issue of the consequences of atomic atmospheric testing seem like a matter of joke and dismissal, not the concern and alarm raised by scientists around the world at the time.
