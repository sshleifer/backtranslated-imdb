Solo is an action movie about an Terminator-like android that is built and trained for the military. When a fault is discovered, it is issued to be deprogrammed. Instead of facing death, he decides to flee to the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him there, leading to a big action party. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance on android. His movements and gestures seem mechanical enough to do the job. Real scientific realism is abandoned to make a good action hero. And this works; the action scenes are not so spectacular, but they are not too bad either. The acting of the other characters is very bad, but I did not expect anything very good. The special effects were also decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent as an action movie, but very forgettable. It does not have the substance that most movies have. But if you just want to spend a few hours without thinking too much, it will do the job.
