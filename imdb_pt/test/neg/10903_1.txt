I will not ruin everything for you. Although you could probably care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what I mean after watching) Poor story. Quality of film rating B. Typical horror - stupid situations - rare weather. I should know when they try to push a lot of hype into their advertising or even add "quotes". Just tell me the movie bombed big time. And they are trying to attract everyone so they can balance the cost of making this bomb. I wish I could go back the time I spent watching this. I was stupid and I thought there just had to be something big just around the corner. But I kept disappointing myself. I usually do not spend my time adding comments on any movie. Actually, this is my second post. I just felt it could save some of you from wasting money on something that had a lot of hype about it.
