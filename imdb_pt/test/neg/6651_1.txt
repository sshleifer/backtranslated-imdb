This movie is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia must have really needed the work to make this movie. The plot is totally unbelievable! Michael Keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to a dying son of a detective, but then escapes. He can fool the police throughout the hospital - it is not to be believed that he has so much knowledge of the hospital. He takes an extremely complicated route to get out of the hospital, blowing up the power generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And on top of that, Andy Garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help the criminal get the bone marrow. The plot is so silly! Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen.
