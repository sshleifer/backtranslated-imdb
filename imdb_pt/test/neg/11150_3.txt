To summarize, skip End of Days and watch Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate instead of rent. This movie is the perfect stereotyped American movie against the Ninth Gate, being the perfect stereotyped European film. <br /> <br /> Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, clever, well punctuated, atmospheric, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful Scenery, good cinematography, amusing lines of expression, intellectuals, shocking minimal language, thought-provoking. The only flaw is that some people did not understand the open ending and said the movie was "bad" because of that and there were some questionable scenes. END OF DAYS: Excessively violent, liberal use of foul language, NO musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne peeked over NYC as Satan (but all that you could choose was the unintelligible scream of Jonathan Davis), sex that had nothing to do with plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did I mention much more violence? I think some of the special effects were good, but that's about it. Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought Ninth Gate was much more interesting, quirky, original and clever. But maybe Americans do not need it. * dripping with cynicism * Although I am American, sometimes I wonder.
