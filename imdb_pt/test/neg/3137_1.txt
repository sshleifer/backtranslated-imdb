Critics are a strange kind of people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. When a critic says that the Cruelty Subconscius is beautiful, I wonder where they grew up? Which is nice to shoot a field, a few clouds or a tree with an old camera if you can not do it in style and capture the mood of the environments. Karim Hussain certainly can not. I've seen kids do better than Karim can do on Subconscius Cruelty. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is the whole recording, I refuse to call this movie, it's just a bad excuse to portray nudity and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, piss, cannibalism, murder of children and more. I love gore / splatter and I love horror. That's none of those. This is absolute crap and if my comments make just one person skipping the Subconscius Cruelty paid off. Always remember that your life will not last forever, do not waste two hours of precious time in the Cruelty of the Subconscious. You have been warned.
