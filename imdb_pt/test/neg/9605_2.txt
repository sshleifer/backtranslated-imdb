I usually do not bother wasting my time writing comments for trash like the one I've forgotten almost as soon as I see it, but since I saw this movie yesterday on one of Comcast's Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make an exception . <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can not give any rational reason for me to watch this movie until the end. It always surprises me that beautiful women are willing to appear in horrible movies like this, but I suppose she thought that this movie would lead to something better. I hope she's right, for her sake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a typical laugh riot straight into the video, or just a piece of junk, depending on your point of view. While there are some decent moments of action in this movie, they do not connect well with the story as it is. <br /> <br /> The setup, as I recall, involved Carol Alt as a depressed person. a housewife who believes her husband, a police officer, is cheating on her. There was also something about her son dying in an accident, and she blamed him for it, but before the story went anywhere she would shoot and kill him. <br /> <br /> On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger arrives at her door and she takes care of him, and almost immediately his house is surrounded by government minions and mercenaries who intend to capture the stranger who seems to have combat skills almost superhuman. <br /> <br /> This same kind of material has had decent entertainment many times before, most notably in Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity, and could have done it this time as well, but this particular movie was hampered by values poor production and a bad script. <br /> <br /> This movie really collapses in the end when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) who was programmed to be a police officer, and after discovering that Carol Alt killed her husband, he tries to kill her, over there! The movie was not particularly good until this point, but the ending really spoils it, trying to turn a modest action thriller into a wannabe Terminator / Lumpy Robocop. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit overdone in the end, with the cyber goose ripping the eyes of poor Carol Alt before finally biting the dust. What was the point of that? For that matter, what was the purpose of anything in this movie? He caught my attention and entertained me for about an hour, to the end, when he reminded me that I was not watching a first-class movie. It was not even a second-rate movie. <br /> <br /> The final scenes seem to suggest a sequel, which I do not think has ever happened, although I have not checked carefully. the web for this. Needless to say, I'm not in a hurry to see any sequels for this movie.
