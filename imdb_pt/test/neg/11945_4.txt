I'm a longtime fan of the original of this film (Bella Martha / Mostly Martha), and everything that makes this movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing out on this one. I miss the slow pace, the accumulation of characters and their style in small gestures, the mastery of lights and moods and movements about dialogue. I do not think the story itself is enough. Marta / Kate is more isolated and Mario / Nick is not a clown. In most cases things that make a great scene in the original, are not working on your copy here. Small changes take the strain off. My opinion is that you should go and see the original. It's worth the inconvenience of subtitles.
