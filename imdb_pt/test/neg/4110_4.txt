(Synopsis) In the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a living dinosaur for a huge price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) took this technology and opened a business known as Time Safari. Anyone with the money can travel millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. Dr. Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team along with the great hunter on a floating walkway to a place where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel protocol is that they must stay on the catwalk and not disturb the earth or any creature around them. Unfortunately for the human race, a hunter steps and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes great impacts on Earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. The course of evolution as we know it now is being changed by the waves of time. Travis and Sonia try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent, and man becomes extinct. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The movie was a bit slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little overdone. The death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the atmosphere and evolution of the world is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago skyline to look modern, but the new cars of the future looked silly. You can expect to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, runtime 1:43, Rated PG-13) (4/10)
