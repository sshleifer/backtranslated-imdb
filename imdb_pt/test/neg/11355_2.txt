I never thought about watching this movie. I kept seeing that perched on the horror movie shelf in my local video store and never thought much about it. Just his mill run, a mild zombie movie with a little blood and a sex scene. Nothing special, I might as well watch Python ... oh no, wait, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I just decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on TV and they said it was a horrible part. of trash. So I decided to check out these short stories, and only then did I realize just how terrible the movie was hiding behind the soft, unattractive cover of the DVD box. <br /> <br /> Not that the idea is bad in itself. An airplane is a confined area, and would be a real deadly trap for the people on board if the zombies showed up ... a good premise for a zombie movie. But this movie had a good scenario and filled it all with poor acting, unstable camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score. <br /> <br /> All characters have different levels of hate. There are two young couples who are basically friends going on holiday in France. A couple consists of an athlete and his annoying girlfriend who is having an affair with Mr. Jock's best friend, who came along with his girlfriend, who is a blonde psychopath. There is also a policeman escorting a swindler (an effeminate and highly irritating man). The cop is probably one of the least annoying characters on the plot. So there are a lot of receptionists who most often end up as zombies ... no, I did not watch the whole movie, it was a very painful experience to perform, almost as bad as watching the Cannibal Holocaust. Oh, and there's also a golfer on vacation with his wife, a strange marshal who does not really seem to matter until he's summoned to help deal with the fugitive zombies, a trio of scientists who are the undead victims and some pilots . Camera work is often unstable, and although many people do not seem to care, it can really get on your nerves after a while, like having a small fly constantly around your head. It's small, but it's there and it's annoying. <br /> <br /> The adulterous couple is genuinely annoying. All they do is have sex in the airplane's bathrooms while their spouses are not looking ... in fact, all the young adults in this movie are insanely irritating. They whine, complain, argue and have some of the most stupid and boring dialogues in the movie ... yes, you're happy to see them die. <br /> <br /> The result is atrocious. It is so generic and uninspired that it kills any kind of suspense that a scene could have spawned and replace it with the feeling that someone is scraping a nail-board and laughing at you. In fact, it sounds like the score of ... Python! This movie will never stop haunting me. <br /> <br /> There is also a character that the filmmakers seemed incredibly determined to have as many pictures as possible. A nun, sitting next to the young adults and holding her bible that is included in so many scenes, you start to wonder if she plays any major role in the movie ... but no, she does not, so why does she have so many scenes? ? Was it because the original project of the creator of the movie was a nun porn movie? No one will ever know. <br /> <br /> Zombies look very good. Their makeup is good and they are probably much better actors than the living characters, they are much more convincing and friendly! The guard responsible for overseeing the illegal load of the scientist was quite funny. A large crate seems to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some sort of sharp object ... but he does not scream, shudder or moan in pain. He just grunts and writhes in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg ... in fact, he sounds more like an obese man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain. <br /> <br /> Oh well, all in all, I give 1 for the interesting scenario and 1 for the zombies. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you like young people fighting and throwing things at each other, and unfortunately, there's really nothing. Anything funny about the whole thing, so watching a laugh would probably fail, unless you're on top of some kind of psychoactive drug.
