Pure shit, decent cinematography ... I like some colors. Other than that, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring, lifeless, not once did I find myself interested in any of the characters. I was waiting for a real plot to form and the movie to pick up the pace. Nothing happened! I think they spent a lot of time working on hair and in the wardrobe that they forgot that there was a movie being made at the time.
