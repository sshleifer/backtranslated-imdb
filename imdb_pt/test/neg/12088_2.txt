The housekeeper was by far a very unfortunate movie. I do not use that word loosely, since it was honestly a bad excuse for a movie. Did I finish watching this feature with only one word in my mind? "because"? Honestly, you could use that question at the end of every scene in that movie and it would seem appropriate. There were so many inconsistencies that led to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters), which eventually led to a very confusing movie with actors walking through the movements rather than giving any explanation. The scenes would occur without foreshadowing, understanding or leading to a complete ending. It was as if I was watching several different ideas with no resolution. The actors were putting the events in motion that did not seem to suit their character or were actually resolved. This was my biggest problem with this movie. The complete and utter lack of structure for this movie has brought all the foundation points collapsing with a genuine "cascade effect" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result. <br /> <br /> Let me explain more in this lack of consistency throughout the film. I would compare this movie to a bowl of oatmeal that had a zebra. It made no sense and there was no logic behind everything. Minnie Driver was the worst culprit. The lines of his character were drawn very confused and almost transparent. She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but still she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time. She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement. It happens nonchalantly, and it just does not seem to fit the original conversation we had at the beginning of the movie with Rosina and her sister. Is she a very intelligent woman who accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to her invention? This was confusing and completely random. Is it not obvious to anyone that their teaching methods were non-existent? Anyone in their right mind could see that she taught nothing to Cavendish's daughter. The sudden, awkward relationship that arises randomly between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers almost made me laugh out loud. I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this movie as Rhys-Meyers literally "poofed" on the scene and suddenly caused some unnecessary drama. I felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was not going anywhere fast, so by adding this random character, we could advance the story a bit (or confuse the smaller movie enthusiasts). Well, that did not fool me, I saw that he was almost a cut-and-paste character used to strengthen an already weakened story. Do not make me start the ending, which has no consistency with the rest of the story. Again using the "cut and paste" method, the author of this film needed a way to end the story, and that was the only solution they could come up with. Is it sad when actors are forced to do things outside the character? but I think that's the name of the game in Hollywood. Fix it even completely broken, or at least usable. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story was dribbling uninteresting. There were perhaps a handful of perfect cinematic moments where you could see that there was a sliver of creativity trying to get to the point, along with a few decent bars of vintage music, but nothing to write to Grandma. More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this movie a little more, but as I said before, leaving open scenes just around the entire movie, you will experience a crack in your foundation. What may seem like a difficult story will eventually wear out over time, and by the end of this movie I felt like the house was falling apart on top of me. Wilkinson plays his normal self in this movie while the driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I'll have to see a doctor after those pictures were burned in my eyes ?? eeewwww). Besides, she wore the same dress every day. This was disgusting and I could smell her through the television. Sex and laundry. Now there's a great movie for you! There seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just crap. Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supremely. <br /> <br /> Overall, this could have been a decent movie that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but it was just regrettable. I can not emphasize the disturbing fact that the characters were going through movements without any kind of pre-explanation. I do not need cinematographic moments for me as a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation. Just remember the oats with a zebra analogy that I used. If you were as confused about this as I was then you will fully understand the movie The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oats ?? so maybe this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> Grade: * out of *****
