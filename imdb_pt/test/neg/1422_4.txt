This is a standard action movie, as we have seen many times before. There is not much action on a present though. Once again, it's about the guy who protects the president. He is male - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholy - as usual. Does he have the courage to carry a bullet to the president? And then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around. Stereotypes and predictable until the last minute of disintegration of the toes.
