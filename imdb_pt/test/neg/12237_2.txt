Sometimes things just should not be done. And while the set-up looked good enough, it just makes the audience gasp in horror. But the problem is that it's not another saw movie. It's so bad you wanted to be getting punishment from Jason Voorhees. <br /> <br /> I've lost count of how many sports movies and spoofs he has incorporated into the movie. And usually, he failed in his attempts. It's true that telling your team that they should fail on all matters to be true players was a little funny at first, but it got tiresome to watch. This is the joke about "Radio" and "IPod". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not stand watching this movie again. Even Trantasia is worth more than that. "D-"
