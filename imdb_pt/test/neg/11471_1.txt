Swoon focuses on the homosexual relationship of Leopold and Loeb - a facet of the case that has been ignored (and unfairly) since the trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But even in your treatment of this Swoon over does this by far. Worse, this distorts, combines, and alters the details of the case, which will irritate those who know much about it and at the same time confuse those unfamiliar with it. Although it is an interesting film, Swoon stinks. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 - horrible.
