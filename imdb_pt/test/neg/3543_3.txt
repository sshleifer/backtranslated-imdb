Nightscream is a TV movie, so it's quite difficult, especially since it's a horror movie. This young woman is haunted by dreams when she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman a year earlier. She marvels when everyone in town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. City residents are surprised when she continues to dream of trances, where she reveals precise details about the murder and the murderer because the police understood everything wrong. Thinking that they are in danger of being discovered, the killers (there are two of them) begin to plan a plan to get rid of it before it reaches the real truth. By now, you've probably fallen asleep and why the creators of the movie have the "fog-making" machine at full throttle in the dream sequences.
