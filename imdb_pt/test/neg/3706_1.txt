Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the silly and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this is just a waste of time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night, and that was all I could do to finish watching. I understood that this crazy stranger wanted to capture Bigfoot but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. He had some fun parts though. There was this very fancy and tacky disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to continue for a long time I think the director was trying to fill the time. The worst thing was the way Bigfoot looked. The obvious man in a suit looked like a fake pink Bigfoot skin. It was laughable. If you want to see a lousy movie from Bigfoot, then I suggest you buy this movie. Personally, I wasted my time and my money on this!
