This movie is really a big piece of junk trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production. Sketch of the poor story (stupid robot story) ... ultra bad acting pop idols without talent ... and they're trying to "COMBAT" !! My God ... these miserable actors use wires to make them look like "good fighters" ... :( and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !!! I'll never touch your movies again.AVOID this movie at all cost !!! I wanted to give it a negative value in ten ... not even worth a 0/10.
