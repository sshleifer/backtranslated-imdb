LTL is the kind of stupid and hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the kind of sheep that stops and listens when it comes across a band playing in a mall. I remember Murray promoting the LTL on Larry King's crappy CNN show, where he said something like "if this movie does not become a hit I will stop making movies (or comedies)." He was not as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that LTL was an infallible success and that his failure would mean that his star status had fallen - hence a kind of live ultimatum for his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (The comedy being stupid, not the elephant ...) Or maybe he just realized during the filming (or when he saw the final cut) that it was turkey, so he tried desperately to convince everyone of how optimistic he was about the LTL. quality. "Go and see, it's really good!" Actors are intercreated prostitutes with car salesmen. <br /> <br /> LTL is the kind of bad project that comes from the comedy school "Friends"; its motto: "If you run out of ideas - or if you've never had any in the first place - then put an animal in the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness." Fofura = a sad substitute for a lack of funny jokes. The other motto "Friends" was "always include nonsensical and bland sentimentality," with which this film predictably ends, when Murray says pathetically: "What they forgot to say is that you never forget an elephant." Maybe not an elephant, but I certainly managed to forget this turkey, which I saw many years ago. Suddenly I remembered this when I saw a scene from him on TV today (hence this equally useless criticism). <br /> <br /> Murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he is not nearly as unattractive / bad as McConaughey (or yet the name of this man is written); One would think that M.M. He would have an easy time playing himself, that is, a hick, but he is so painfully bland and unconvincing that I could hardly bear to see him make a fool out of himself. It was worthy of embarrassment. To complete this absurdity, we have that generation X clown, Garofalo, in a rather useless role. So again, everything about LTL is useless ... <br /> <br /> After the LTL, which bombed, as far as I know, Murray went on to become more of a "serious actor." What about these comedians and their inferiority complex? It's all about getting prizes, that is, "recognition of your peers" (read: votes of your idiot colleagues)? This piece of shit marked the end of a number of good and great films that Murray did in the early and mid-1990s, such as "Groundhog Day", "Quick Change", "Mad Dog & Glory", "Kingpin" As for Bob and Ed Wood, we recently had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in rubbish / mediocrity like "Hamlet," "Lost In Translation" (and you can not stay away from these "ultra-talented coppolas") and " Broken Flowers. "Compare these two lots. <br /> <br /> One guy described LTL" funny as heck. "Now that's the kind of audience this movie was waiting for ... malls and trailer parks ...
