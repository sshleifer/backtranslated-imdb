This was an interesting adaptation of the last solo piece by William Shakespeare, but in my humble opinion, a terrible one. Jarman tries to change the characters' personalities to begin with. He makes Miranda look crazy after being trapped on the island for so long, Prospero is no different - a mixture of madness and self-pity on his part. I could not imagine Shakespeare thinking that his characters were similar to the way Jarman portrayed them. Caliban's appearance may be the only thing he's gotten right, but again, I got the impression that Caliban was a tormented, deformed monster, but it turns out to be an insane, constantly clucking, not as I would have imagined it. Ferdinand makes a brief appearance, naked most of the time and quiet. <br /> <br /> Indeed, to the point where I stopped watching this awful adaptation, there had been so many cut lines from the play. If anything, I think Jarman was trying to rewrite Shakespeare and include his own scenes most of the time. So much text is cut in the first part that does not make it a Shakespeare play, but a garbage of melodramatic and absurd 70's. An attempt to interpret this piece more realistically in the end, but This game was never realistic and was not done as the text shows.
