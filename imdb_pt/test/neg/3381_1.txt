This "stretch of space" was kind of stupid. I think it should be an unexpectedly shocking ending, but IMHO was just a huge disappointment. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the land actors do a great job on this; their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though. How this end could have done so through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me. The other comment here is not correct, the tongue-in-cheek vignette came only during the second season, this thing should be taken seriously! The producers and writers could have been a bit more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice.
