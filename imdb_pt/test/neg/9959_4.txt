Ok, I've seen George Zucco in at least four separate suspense / suspense movies recently while I worked on several collections of 50 packs, and I have to say, the guy had limited range but he was good at what he did. He was not Karloff, but PRC was lucky to have him. <br /> <br /> But the poor boy was trapped in some sort of horror movie ghetto, and he was not good enough to take them to the next level of interest ... not the wire. scripts and direction, as well as budgets that he worked under. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> This movie is, well, slow, indigestible and uninteresting for the most part. The "heroine" seems doomed to be a version of Judy Garland's rental center, the "hero" is tasteless as white rice, and the poor guy who plays the monster does not even get a good transformation of the scene. to deal. Her make-up effects are not scary - he looks like a slightly more disheveled version of a farm hand, that's all. <br /> <br /> It's not a total waste. Zucco sits right on the camera as he chews the scene while he manages to deliver some terribly affected and invented definite speeches without faltering or losing the flow. There are some somber black and white photos here and there that are not completely bad. <br /> <br /> So, all in all ... this movie has helped some actors from level "C" to "Z" pay the rent for another month, and never sink below a certain level of hacked quality . Watch it once, whether you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to watch all the werewolf movies ever made.
