I think it's the first time I've been in a theater and I'm disappointed. There were two reasons why I went to see "Astérix et les Vikings": first as a cinephile, and second as a great fan of Asterix. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film does not satisfy any request. . It's simply a big bumpy mess and proves that the Asterix franchise goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it has been so since the death of the first painter René Goscinny in 1977. His faithful collaborator, illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following books were clearly lacking in the quality that was present during the Goscinny years. <br /> <br /> "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands". "which was published during the reign of Goscinny.The basic story is the same: Goudurix, Abraracourcix's nephew arrives in the village and Astérix et Obélix must turn him into a real man, while the Vikings go to Gaul to find out what it is fear, because fear seems to give wings <br /> <br /> The similarities end here. What follows in the book is an uninterrupted series of laughs, jokes and hilarious dialogue with the result that the Vikings discover fear and The film is silly, bland, quick, tacky ... Well, just name a pattern and have a good chance of being applied ... <br /> <br /> The difference between the book and the movie it could be more acceptable if the film were good, but new ideas simply knock it down in a bottomless pit, and even older films like Astérix le Gaulois, which almost switched the lines one by one without altering them, are easily better. The animation has the quality of other films of the 21st century, but it has its flaws and any beginner in the movies could find the mistakes. The biggest example is the continuity error, in which the day follows the night after a fraction of a second, in the same sequence. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They have taken animation studios from various countries and still can not get a suitable film. <br /> <br /> The changes in the original story are simply unbearable. And they could still be even if there was an original story. Goudurix, in the movie, has a pet pigeon called SMS and acts as his cell phone (!). Grossebaf, the Viking chief, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!) And she constantly defies her father's authority. There's also a stupid viking magician, his grumpy, muscular son, the faithful Grossebaf bride who's obsessed with decoration (her name is Vikea!) And ... well, I can not stand it any longer. <br /> We are far from the original jokes of the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the biggest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and the visual jokes that do not have the same appeal in the screen of the cinema. I remember that the greatest moments of the book were Obelix laughing at the names of the invaders (ending in af) and Goudurix tries to frighten them in a ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> And if all was not enough, someone from the advertising team decided to write on the poster that there is an already existing Céline Dion song that would be included in the final credits. If it was a new song, I could have understood. But using an old song is just another proof that the film is so poorly made that they are ready to do anything to entice movie goers. <br /> <br /> The only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can not leave the theater without being cold. In a summer release, this simply can not hurt ... <br /> <br /> The only other acceptable point in the film is how Goudurix becomes brave. His psychological transformation in the book is very spontaneous and not believable, while it is best portrayed in the film and the point of motivation is more believable. <br /> <br /> So if you have not seen the movie yet, do not do it. Waste your money on it. Take the book instead. <br /> <br /> Oh René, why did you leave us?
