Zarkorr is a bad movie. This does not even rank its bad category as bad. Is bad. From the (lack of) scenography to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie smells bad. To begin with, the film seems to have been filmed in empty rooms with a few props to make it look good. So we started acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like an Oscar nominee. And to top it all off, there are the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur who took them out of the garage. The cities that the monster is supposed to crush resemble the scenery of my nephew's train. So obviously false they shout at the viewer. The only good thing about the movie is the monster costume. It's too bad they spent all their budget on this and left nothing for the rest of the movie. And maybe a decent script would have helped as well.
