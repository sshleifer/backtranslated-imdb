This film is a cinematic collage of gangster cliches. Writing is z-degree and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic. It's a confusing pastiche of stereotyped gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny's drawings) and silly supporting characters (the doctor and the writer). There are a lot of Bogart movies out there. In fact, Bogart seems to have fallen asleep with this performance. He puts very little effort on this character. I think the board he got was something like "He's a bad guy." This guy is the equivalent of the time of Darth Vader; obvious, evil and anti-hero. Do not waste your time on this one.
