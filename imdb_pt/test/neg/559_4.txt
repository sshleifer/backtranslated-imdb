I thought this movie would be a shame for the series. After all, part 3 did not measure up to part 2, and this one does not have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor was not as witty as Part 3's, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> The girl's part was very good. She is a lost teenager who needs guidance. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That her aunt would simply agree to leave her at home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she has just met. Of course, he was a friend of her brother's. <br /> <br /> I liked the monastery. One might think of some of my other comments that I would not have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was fun. This showed that they know how to have fun. Now, if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop music, this would have been another matter. Probably the smartest part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid for the monks not to. kills a bug Miyagi told her that street gangs killing themselves are stupid, nations trying to destroy each other are stupid, but having respect for a lifetime is not stupid. Miyagi expressed such wisdom in the other films as well. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Of course, there were some things I liked about it. It was not as funny as part three, and no character could live according to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can not imagine watching it again, but it's worth seeing once.
