I have to give this movie a 4 because of some things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I will call "stupid victim syndrome." If you have the killer on the ground and you have his gun - shoot him please. If you're a cop and have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back - shoot him, please. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach in firearms training and the reason you do not put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to fire - ask any hunter or infantryman. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should contract as well - making you squeeze your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It's really hard to lie on the floor completely still for 8 hours without two other people - one of them a doctor - without realizing that you are not dead. Even more so if you're supposed to be dying of a brain tumor and been in the hospital just a few months before. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - the guy he injected poison that had to pick up the antidote. If you poison someone, this is murder. 5. What was the lesson of Adam that he should learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> In addition to these things, I would have given this movie a bigger note. The plot was very good, and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. I can even forgive the terrible acting on the part of the doctor - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and the soundtrack were very good, but the ending looked artificial and simply did not work for me. Thank goodness I did not have to pay to see this or I would have asked for a refund.
