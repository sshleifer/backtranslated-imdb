The film begins in Latvia shortly after World War I. Being a history professor, he knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during that time. There was a serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect the interests of their nations. However, sometimes they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "whites" win. However, whites were deeply factional - some wanting the return of a tsar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something between them. Because of these mixed objectives and the lack of a real commitment from the foreign armies, the entire expedition was doomed and left the USSR after only a year or two. However, what I did not know was that the German troops were also involved. This surprised me, as they had just lost World War One and were not in the best shape to mount this expedition. <br /> <br /> This is the background to the film, but it's also about a rich pro-communist. mistress and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the German troops. She throws herself at him repeatedly, but in each case he rejects her. So she sublimates those desires for various subjects. While nothing of this sex is so graphic, this and the underlying reason that the man is not interested make this movie somewhat adult and I would not show it to a younger audience. <br /> <br /> While the setting for this movie is interesting, the movie is generally as gray and lifeless as any I've seen. I do not recommend unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are actually into overrated German films. I especially notice who suffers from depression, as it will undoubtedly worsen. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films waiting to be seen - like MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MTHER KUSTERS GOING TO HEAVEN, WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI, FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others).
