Stu Ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - of small stature but a huge heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have here is some kind of Hallmark movie about the dangers of the game. Of course, he wins, loses, throws everything into sex, drugs and more games, but where the real play is - which made him the greatest card player of all time. <br /> <br /> Very boring, and frankly annoying in some places, this earns a four because we learned something about Stu, the man, but Stu, the card player, nothing. <br /> <br /> Well filmed and presented to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a movie about cards: Honestly, the ESPN coverage of the World Series is more watchable than that. <br /> <br /> A waste of a great chance.
