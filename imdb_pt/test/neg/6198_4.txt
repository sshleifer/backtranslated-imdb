The film is cool Well portrayed but unoriginal ... This film is copied directly from "The Hitch", where Salman plays as a Dr. like Will Smith, and Govinda as a fat idiot, who is desperate to fall in love with her boss until the end, the film reaches an old Indian style of Flimi, the father of the bride does not like the bride's lover and receives some other fiancé, and Govinda, the lover of the bride, comes in the final and saves her from the new fiancé and a chic dance and other things. <br /> <br /> The comedy was very good, no doubt when the encounter with Hindi would be funnier ... <br /> <br /> worth watching, but when it comes on TV after a few months ...
