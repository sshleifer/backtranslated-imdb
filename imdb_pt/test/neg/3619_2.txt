Snake Island is one of those movies that, while one sits down and watches its incredible level of stupidity, makes a wish that the film's camera has never been invented. The real reason Plan 9 From Outer Space will keep its title "Worst Movie Ever" for a while is not so much because of how bad it is. It's because of the fact that it's the most fun bad movie you'll see. Snake Island is the other kind of evil. Snake Island is so bad that it's excruciating. A stupid premise combines with a script that was written by monkeys playing typewriters from a key on transparencies that were then superimposed to look like dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. Filmed entirely on location in South Africa, the environments in which the film takes place are the only element that can truly be considered well performed. Many plans involving snakes consist of such surreal-looking close-ups that begin to wonder if snakes are real CGI, puppets or snakes that have been fed with really heavy drugs. <br /> <br /> William Katt starred, if you can call him that, as an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river raft. Beside him are a variety of very generic and ill-defined characters. It's all a matter of writing randomly about who survives to the end, but Katt certainly seems to be thinking of firing his agent. The rest of the cast seems to be from Home and Away acting school where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot is accompanied by gaping open mouths and casting eyes in all directions. The effects of foley are usually worse with a memorable scene in which a double-barreled shotgun sounds like the rather flat sound effects that used to accompany shots in games like BioForge. Meanwhile, the snakes explode continuously or jump randomly. It would have been more accurate to call the movie Snake Holocaust. <br /> <br /> Of course, no horror movie or science fiction Z-grid is complete today, without free scenes of naked women in a state of nudity. As every woman in the cast almost takes off her clothes, the movie begins to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst batteries, everything in this case is too much configuration with no real return. The sex scenes never happen, and the character deaths are so flat, so uninteresting, that the whole movie becomes meaningless. Unless you consider watching William Katt running through a muffled forest using poorly adjusted cricket gear and breaking snakes in all directions with a cricket bat. For the record, I do not. I used to think that Anaconda was the worst film ever made on predatory snakes. I was very, very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake that might be afraid if they disbelieved for some time. Some of the snakes shown killing the human cast are no bigger than the laces of some pairs of combat boots I used. <br /> <br /> So, so far we have the checklist of bad horror movies running well. The unrecognizable and lame cast is considered, as are the bad sound and visual effects. The dialogue is so unfortunate, so inopportune, that I have seen better writing and delivery during some of the plays in the school where I have performed on many moons ago. Unfortunately, where Snake Island hesitates about it is the fatal area for all bad movies. In essence, forget about being so bad it's funny. It is so bad that it stops being good after the initial credits and it becomes painful in the second that the cast begins to speak. Compared to William Katt's performance on Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance in Anaconda was as Oscar-honored as Russell Crowe's in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors, but with stuff like this, you have a hard time saying a single word naturally. Hearing some of the lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. The mind tends to empty experience, primarily as a mechanism of self-defense. <br /> <br /> Because of the above mentioned failure to be amusingly bad, I gave Snake Island two out of ten. My special score for movies that are so bad that may not be good but not enough to entertain. It's all so boring or meaningless that one might be observing the test pattern. The correct way to spell "crap" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
