While the film has a redeeming feature, ie some stunning images, eg. the scene of the funeral procession on the ferry, or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed to be influenced by the scene when the warships approach the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon"), these were more photographic of the which would have been better appreciated hanging on a wall in an art gallery than inlaid in a painfully slow film that reaches the stunning 162 minutes and suffers from a terrible dialogue, an extremely poor character development, active and unobtrusive symbolism inspiration and heavy styling. This is the first film I've seen Angelopoulos, and his reputation preceded him, I expected much better, but I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm not going to go out of my way to watch any other work of the director in the future. The four friends I went to see with the agreement.
