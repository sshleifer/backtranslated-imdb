Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of suspense you could imagine: he set standards so high that any director making a thriller would be fatally compared to him. <br /> <br /> The main subject of this Bullock vehicle, all ideas, almost everything was already in the classic "Rope" of Hitchcock: the two students who commit a gratuitous crime, the philosophy of Nietsche and the clues that the boys The Master was the first to transfer them to the screen. And with an eighty-minute movie that was a fascinating technical tour de force. <br /> <br /> "Murder by numbers" does not occur in a single room, like "the rope," remember. And, what supreme originality, puts two cops against the evil youths, and you'd never guess, these two cops are very different: in fact, Bullock plays the woman living as a man, and his partner (Chaplin) is as timid as one Girl with no idea. The performances of the two boys are not really incomprehensible, not as good as, say, Edward Norton's in "primal fear." <br /> <br /> Well, you know, "Rope" was so good ....
