The gorgeous blonde Natasha Henstridge is the young widow who is not so bereaved at the mansion on the hill, telling her story to a TV reporter in Monroeville, Virginia. And among the heterosexual community group, she is suspected of involvement in the death of her eldest husband. This is James Brolin, relying like a baby gun. Flashback teledrama made in Canada, based on an article published in the magazine Vanity Fair. Must be true! Anyway, it's a lot more romance than mystery and a very familiar story. Leggy Species star Henstridge as a hospice nurse digging gold? That can happen, I guess. And it's good to see Brolin in a sizeable role after his turn in Antwone Fisher, even if he does not reach the end of the scene. The end of the photo? He does not even get to the beginning of the picture. That's why flashbacks were invented, of course.
