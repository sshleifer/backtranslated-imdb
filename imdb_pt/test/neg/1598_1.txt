I can usually tolerate distorted movies, but this is really an obsessive and selfish movie! <br /> <br /> First, the writer / director is a totally selfish guy, full of jokes that are not funny. all. Secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons children's minds! I can not believe my ears when I hear the sick and perverted monologues spoken by children! <br /> <br /> I really am sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. Both are very talented, but were victims of the dirty and little-known film of Eric Schaeffer! <br /> <br /> And what the hell happened to the beautiful face of Eric Mabius? I mean, he met this girl he was supposed to marry, but he was not at the wedding! Actually, there's this bald guy in his place! Has time really flown so fast? <br /> <br /> Either way, do not waste your time to watch this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by a sick, Eric Schaeffer!
