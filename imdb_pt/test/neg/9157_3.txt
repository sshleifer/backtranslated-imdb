A true yawner and a bad movie even for the Chan series. I like a good Charlie Chan movie or even a reasonably good movie, but this movie falls far short of expectations. Charlie enlisted to help uncover the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house stole the plans of another power. The mystery is very pedestrian and the acting does not do much better. The only saving grace for me in the movie was the presence of Mantan Moreland as Birmingham Brown. He gives the film a little comedy and has a few scared faces, but after that the choices are rather scarce. Benson Fong is here as Tommy Chan and partners with Chan's daughter of all things. What about Sidney Toler? He's pretty decent, but it looks like he's trying hard to get the movie. What I noticed most was how the movie was filmed. Chan's director, Phil Rosen, whom I usually like most of his entrances, uses many long, action-less plans (like Charlie's initial walk to the house outside). Because? The movie only takes 64 minutes to cry aloud! Shots like this tell me that the director had to fill the time because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to. This is probably not the worst Chan movie ever made, but so far it's the worst I've ever had unfortunately.
