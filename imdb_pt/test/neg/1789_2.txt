A handful of young college sister sisters decide to go camping with a teacher. A giant druid wants to sacrifice them to avoid the apocalypse in the year 2000, they also have to fight with motorcyclists, an Indian and something lake-type monster. Worth seeing for only 3 reasons, George 'Buck' Flower (a sadly unsung film B clip) is on hand as a hobo and the other 2 belong to the gorgeous Savannah (in one of the three non-pornographic roles she has had) . Both have very small roles. Too bad everything else in the movie is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Original Trailer <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 4 pairs of breasts, 2 buttocks
