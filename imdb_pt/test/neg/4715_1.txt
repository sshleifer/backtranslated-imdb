This movie was a big disappointment. The plot looked great, about a half human creature, half leopard in Africa that becomes the subject of a documentary of young American adults. When many of the crew are found dead, the two survivors are interrogated. I would not even call it a horror movie, since most of the film is about the (dis) adventures of those already cited and young narcissists in their twenties, which include sex and animal dung to get stoned (it is not so fun as it seems - trust me). You can rarely see the creature, and the lead actor (who is also the director, screenwriter, editor and producer!) Is incredibly annoying. <br /> <br /> I finally got so bothered by the never dialogue that I progressed quickly to the end. I had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes in the movie ... and I was right. So this horrible movie is totally predictable too - as if it was not bad enough. Moral of the story: avoid films that are represented, directed, edited, produced and written by the same nobody. And avoid this movie unless it's kept under the gun's sights.
