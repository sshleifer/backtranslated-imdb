This is a movie about people getting a love letter. Nobody knows who sent it and nobody knows who it is for. A good cast, led by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, however, is a completely dopey plot. As an example, the character Capshaw, a leading citizen of a small town in New England, studies with an immature college student who works in his bookstore over the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the city fireman who is crazy about her. If this is not the epitome of stupidity, I do not know what it is. Just an example of how this movie is doped. Watching Kate Capshaw running is a pleasure, but you immediately realize that she never ran a day in your life. Another obviously doped part of a dopey movie.
