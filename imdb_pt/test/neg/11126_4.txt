A cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a Caribbean island. To return to civilization, he bribed the cargo compartment of a large luxury cruise ship with grace and I think the script intended disastrous results. Let's start with the one thing I did not really like about this movie .... The monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit. The CGI scenes looked like a different movie. Okay, this is my chest thing now for all the nice moments about this B movie. The best thing was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter, the eye drop, second). John was intermittently funny, gentle and no matter what the writers made him say, he said it well. Good job, what he had to work with. The cytozoologist was exaggerated and fun to watch as well, he had some funny things. The Marines were all well and were good cannon fodder for the monster, as were some crew members and guests. There are some pretty funny lines in this movie, and a pretty fun conspiracy involving a thief. <br /> <br /> Special effects are usually med to low and I swear they reused the same blood spray in the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie. I liked the blood of the man without legs. Actually, since this movie was not scary, I feel a bit more cruel in improving the ability to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like B monsters, it's worth a visit.
