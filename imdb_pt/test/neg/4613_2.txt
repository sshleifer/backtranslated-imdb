Following the classic 1970s horror film Carrie with this offering, it's like Ford following the Mustang with the Edsel. This movie was horrible in every detail. It would have been titled Beverly Hill 90210 and it meets the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both shows far outweigh that gut. This movie was not a horror movie. I timed about 3 minutes of blood and 90 minutes of trotting and licking high school ritual. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's weird friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misinterprets her love interests! Wow, the crowd rides Carrie! Wow, athletes have a sexual scoring contest! What this film needed was a lot more action and teenage cliches much less tired. This movie is totally unpredictable.
