The last time I checked, the Nazis did not win the Second World War - not that you noticed. After all, the Third Reich was quite big at issuing orders and demanding cold, robotic obedience to the population, and that is exactly what we are facing today. But the way the orders are delivered has changed. Instead of being barked with a German accent through a megaphone, they are disguised as worried experts' advice and float under your nose every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper There is a continuous buzz in the background, a class message average self-improvement, whispered in the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much, you eat the wrong things, you drink, you smoke, you do not exercise enough, you probably can not even beep right, you're going to die if you do not change your I'm sorry for you, I do not care, I do not care, I do not care, I do not care, I do not care, I do not care, I do not care, I do not care. and it is evident that the people who recite it are routinely portrayed as saints.Ã‚ Last year the media fell to their knees to give Jamie Oliver a collective blow about his school series Dinners, in which he campaigned for healthier food on school menus, given the back slap reaction, you'd be forgiven for thinking he personally rescued 5,000 children from the clutches of an asshole pedophile. Anyway, the series was a huge success In fact, in terms of television, there was only one real disadvantage: it was not returnable. After all, when you have saved all the country's children from certain death once, you can not really do it a second time. The only solution is to find a new threat, which takes us to Ian Wright's Unfit Kids (Wed, 9pm, C4), a weekly issuetainment program in which the former football player and renowned enemy of grammar forces a group of young people to accept part of some extra-curricular PE. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a copy of the Jamie Oliver program, with more sweat and fewer shots of pupils crushing fresh basil with a pestle: an uplifting fable in which Wrighty molds his A gang of misfits into a skinny middleweight who fights apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents and trying to turn the whole thing into a national issue that will have Range Rover frogs everywhere dampening their panties with sheer holiness between travels. to the Conran store. Is not it just awful, what do these blob plebs do to themselves? It's not our Josh you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and goes to practice lacrosse six hundred times a week. <br /> <br /> I bet he does, little yes, it's heartwarming to see flaccid and inconvenient kids turn up with a little simple activity ... but there's something about the underlying message of eating their greens that really stays on my stomach, in case you have not guessed. <br /> <br /> What happened to the concept of CHOICE, you * horn * So a little run can increase your life expectancy - so what? That's just a couple more years in the nursing home - who does? And besides, I'd rather die dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with lots of sweepstakes trying to outdo each other. <br /> <br /> In episode two, video games and the internet are targeted as villains in the war of flaccidity: they make children very sedentary, you know? Interestingly, TV, which is equally sedentary, and unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy with your physical, escaping without rolling. That's funny. Well, listen here, Channel 4 - instead of forcing kids to eat ferns or do squats, how about teaching them to think more expansively, so they reject the insightful and flattering nature of programs. such that? Or would it be a campaign too far?
