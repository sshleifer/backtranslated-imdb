This plot had more holes than an alibi OJ Simpson! <br /> <br /> I noticed two references to Star Trek in the movie and yet, ironically, we have a protagonist played by Andy Garcia <br /> <br /> which is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of: "The needs of the many surpass the needs of the few or one." <br /> <br /> Let's just say that while trying to save your child from cancer, it puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk. The character of Michael Keaton is almost as unrealistic as. He forgets to kill on countless occasions and still gets angry when Garcia thwarts his attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. The child's doctor remains responsible for her colleges even after being held hostage several times in a short time but put her on a 5-story walkway and she misses it. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia's son is a kind of anathema in this movie <br /> <br />. He is the most nice and real character, one of the bright spots in the movie. In addition, he utters a line, which must have been the result of serendipity, regarding the fight against cancer that resembles Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the film was not a complete waste (see From Dusk to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money), but disappointing considering the talent at hand.
