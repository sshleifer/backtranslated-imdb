(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Oh, it's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and it destroys him. It's total madness. The movie starts well, but at the end of the movie, everyone is destroyed and the main star's mind is blank. <br /> <br /> The supposed half-sister is never convincing. Some very bad lighting effects. Music is interesting. But little else. It took me over a month to finally finish the damn thing. I suppose if you like being John Malkovich, you might like that. But where BJM was a great movie I did not want to watch, Pola X is a movie I hate in hell. The only possible emotion in the film is the sexual incest scene that is free until the end of the movie. (I hope you're not thinking about Catherine either.) <br /> <br /> This movie is seriously boring, depressing, and misdirected. Not highly recommended. If you like French films. (go watch Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Replayable: 0/10
