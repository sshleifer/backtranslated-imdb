This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the film is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /> <br /> The acting is pathetic. I know acting is hard work and stuff, but that's why it should be left to real actors. Watching these people acting is like watching Michael J. Fox perform a brain surgery. It is unstable at best. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments would make you believe that the film is saved by the talents of Dan Gordon as Chris. Only Dan himself, or perhaps his mother, believed it was a good performance. <br /> <br /> The special effects of this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked like someone was glowing with an orange light from the bottom of a model built from a refrigerator box. Of course there was a bit of layered computer animation on top, but that did not help. I suspect the special effects in this movie were created and rendered using a single Amiga computer from the late 1980s.
