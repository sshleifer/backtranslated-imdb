I saw this movie in the movies. I was taking classes at Second City Chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. It's a Woodward movie about one of the native children of the Second City. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about John's story. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that folklore did not make him particularly friendly to women on improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But, hey. the man took his life and he was intensely loved by the people who were in his world, and also states that he treated all his close friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea of ​​poor Michael Chilklis (who is really a great actor) being in a really incredibly bad movie, and really just relegated to doing an imitation of man. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any work from Belushi ... and all the SNL scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie. Damn the idea that half the historical information in the movie did not even follow Bob Woodwards works. Kind of saying "Ok ... we're about to fiddle with Belushi ... now we're going after Woodward too ..." They also decided to take the premise of "It's a wonderful life and turn it into a horrible crack life. <br /> <br /> Is he a guardian angel or the devil? The pinball machine is the devil's assistant electronic device ... how many different endings can you make in a movie? It's one of those movies after it's over ... you look at the person you're with and in stunned disbelief "What the hell was that ?!" In some circles, this movie has become a cult classic. But for good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult classic, you sit on the screen and make fun (or throw away a lining) on ​​the screen. A cult movie is never good. And most people would never watch them in any serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch some classics from the late 80's, stoned? Wired rental. If you want to know about John Belushi ... you can get more information off the walls of Second City Chicago than this movie.
