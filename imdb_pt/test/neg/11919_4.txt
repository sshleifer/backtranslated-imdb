Having no idea what this movie was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. Well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as it puts another comment on this forum, we feel embarrassed by the actors who participated in this film. Although the film is by no means horrible, it makes no sense at all. The superior performance of William Baldwin also does not help the situation. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserves better. The basic problem that seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and those responsible were left with no ideas along the way. The result is an uneven film.
