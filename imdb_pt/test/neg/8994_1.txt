Ram Gopal Verma usually makes a recipe so special, taken from some Hollywood movie. All of his films after Shiva are in the cookie cutter genre. Occasionally he makes a truly horrible movie like this. <br /> <br /> During the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only two characters, a fighting gymnast disguised as a skilful dancer (go ahead!) and an aspiring actor trying to get rich in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer / gymnast has no slack, gymnastics, anguish, habitual disgust, more gymnastics, anguish, music, dance, anguish, a little more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, You're sleeping again. And this despite the body HOT HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY of the main lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer. <br /> <br /> But hey, you're not alone !! The editor, director, photographer, in fact, the entire cast and crew are sleeping through the production. The only difference is that they were paid to put off while you paid for this crap, so you lose. Ha, joke is about you. Do not feel sorry for yourself, but because of our poor girl, who cheers daily in her high-profile coverage, in the sexiest gym and gym clothes. Puh-leese, when the poor are going to take a break, she's the STARR-VINNNG ?! <br /> <br /> Antara Mali can not act. RGV lost his marbles. Abhishek tried hard but failed. No plot. No history. Anything. She must have paid generously to the RGV to do these absurd things, plus free gym classes on her selection sofa. What a super deal. There is no need for an acting career. <br /> <br /> This absolute rubbish can only be "Made in Bollywood", of course!
