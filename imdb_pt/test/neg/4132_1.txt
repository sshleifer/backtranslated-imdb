He's playing on SHOWTIME now, but will be released as a movie called THREE or was released in 2006. Problems include a supposed naked body coming out of the waves with the bottom. You can have fun meeting others. It was a decent video, hungry, cold, crazy, but that's about it. And, of course, what a sexless movie would be. The lady has a beautiful body and the men are beautiful, but the story is the same as Swept Away or The Savage is a loose type with some blood. I wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and have already released this show and now they will release it as THREE. Billy Zane should have worn a top hair or shaved his head completely. Juan Di Pace is amazing and there are some good sex scenes. There is a voodoo that loves the character Di Pace and in real life his name is Di Pace as well. I am not aware of any connection, but probably of relatives or married.
