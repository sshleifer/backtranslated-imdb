"Bland" is probably the word I would use to try to start describing this movie. I just watched because it had a good rating here and I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is about racism in a post-September 11 in America and the director went there with a sledgehammer! There was no subtlety in the movie and it looked like they were trying to get some kind of Magnolia feel for the movie - which is never a good idea, since this movie was three hours of boredom and confusion just to start raining. frogs at the end ... <br /> <br /> All in all a HUGE disappointment.
