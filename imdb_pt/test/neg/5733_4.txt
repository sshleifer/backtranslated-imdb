I just saw this movie for the first time after buying it on DVD <br /> <br /> It appears as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two Conan movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie did not seem to have the same budget as Conan's films and so some of the scenarios and effects are not so fast and some scenes seem rushed. <br /> <br /> Nielsen is well into looking, but unfortunately she could not act if a gun was placed on her head. Arnie's supporting role seemed to be done as a favor to director Fleischer, who also directed Conan the Destroyer. Maybe Arnie was not confident that he would go to movies like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> Some of the women's talisman guardians at the beginning of the film seemed to be struggling to raise their swords and the looks on their faces suggested that they were having a great time making this movie. I could not be so jovial if I was fighting for my life. <br /> <br /> All this aside, this movie required very little concentration to watch and was slightly entertaining. I've seen much worse. Two stars.
