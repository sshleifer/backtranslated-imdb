I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (by Errol Morris). Instead, I was shocked by this superficial and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This movie should be called "The Return of Fujimori". The director assumes that she made a "perfect" film because she pushes the pro and anti-Fujimori factions away from being really biased and unprofessional. <br /> <br /> The film has few crucial facts: 1) It uses the so-called "slippery" election of 1995, in which Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the votes. , as an example of Fujimori's massive popular support. But we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film claims that the Shining Path (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. In fact, the Truth Commission's final report states that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in Peru. 33% of them were caused by SL. This leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, military and other groups. The fact that she uses the same misleading information that Fujimori uses 10 years ago is another example of how horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> For anyone with any education about politics and history in Peru, Fujimori is clearly an accomplished manipulator, a ruthless, egocentric, self-centered character. His regime was far from democratic. He is still a threat to the Peruvians. Despite these facts, the director lets Fujimori tell the story. Not just about how he wants the camera to be positioned, but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. He always seems to have the last word. There are no "cojones" journalistic, only soft issues and unchallenged comments. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? The director, when questioned after the screening, did not hide the fact that she was deeply impressed with Fujimori, his charm and intelligence. Yes, she was definitely charmed by it, and you can see looking at this movie. It is obvious that she has a hard time digesting the multitude of facts that point to her responsibility for the corruption, murder, and deception that have occurred. She assured the panting public that Fujimori was indeed a "patriot" when a few moments earlier, one of the leading Peruvian journalists was too adamant to tell us that Fujimori was, above all, a "traitor." She went on to say that despite all the charges, not a single dollar was found in any bank account in his name, etc., etc. It was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs who ruled the country for 10 years master. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This movie makes history unfair. It is an insult to hundreds of people killed, missing or unjustly imprisoned by the Fujimori regime. No wonder she later confessed that all the Peruvian intellectuals with whom she became friends in making the film felt betrayed by him. Impartial? The words "opportunistic", "naive" and "denial" come to my mind.
