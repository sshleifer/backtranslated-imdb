Four things intrigued me about this movie - first, it stars Carly Pope (of the fame "Popular"), which is always a pleasure to watch. In second place, it counts on the brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly, it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended me. However, I was totally disappointed. The whole plot is absurd and complicated, with very little resolution. Pope's acting is fine, but Owen is unfortunately underused. The other actors and actresses are fine, but I'm not familiar with all of them. In addition to the good puzzles that are scattered throughout the film (and Pope and Owen), this movie is not very good. So the moral of the story is ... do not watch unless you really want to.
