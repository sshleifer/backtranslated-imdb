I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historical classics". It's not a classic, and as the plot has been updated to the time of its release, it's also not historical. The current title of the DVD is "Indecent" and, in addition, has the subtitle "The private life of Becky Sharp". Myrna Loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is overwhelmed with a horrible script and banal dialogue. As with many early talkies, and especially those made by small studios, there is little skill shown by the cast and crew. Loy wears some dresses that are quite elegant, but her costumes and makeup in the later scenes are exaggerated. The saving grace is a tolerable performance of Billy Bevan, who plays one of his many suitors
