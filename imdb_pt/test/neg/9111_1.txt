***** I reveal two 'twists' at the end of the movie. Do not read if you want to watch this movie for some reason. <br /> <br /> Oh my God, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of today's greatest actors, sold his soul and appeared in it. The only consolation is that the writers must have realized that someone as pathetic as Steve Guttenberg could ever in his life want to kill someone as cool as Sean Bean. Instead, he is killed in what must have looked like a wonderful twist in the end, for the good guy who was to be killed by Bean, but actually was his boss and faked his own death. Do not worry. I did not ruin anything for you. The acting itself is spectacularly terrifying, with Guttenberg's patented "Hey-look-I-Can-Pull-A-Chuck-Norris" man who dominates most of the two hours of hell on Earth. Added to a plot I might have written while being tortured and hanging upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely senseless critical error in the fact that at one point the virus will escape if they look wrong, another time, Steve Guttenberg bravely running with him, playing, picking up assaults and generally abusing that 'virus' that has the distinct appearance of a collection of those little soap bubbles that you put in your bath. My final word? If you are suicidally depressed and feel like laughing about something that should be a bad comedy but worse, tape the next time you are on Channel 5 at midnight, then burn it up when you realize that I am actually telling the truth .
