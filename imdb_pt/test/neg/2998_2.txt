First the easy part: this movie is a pretentious crapola! <br /> <br /> It reminded me of "Magnolia." And then I thought, "Wow - someone made a movie even dumber and more annoying than" Magnolia. "<br /> <br /> I know nothing about the Polish brothers, but this movie seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school, but knows nothing about storytelling. The banal elements and the mallet's symbolism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic. The detailed comments would be only one list of flaws that are supposedly funny or satirical, the "elegasic" parts are good pictures of coffee tables with mediocre music, the "emotional" parts are simplistic. The worst thing is that the film does not shows love for all the characters, except for a little courage of dignity in the priest. <br /> <br /> I still can not believe the respect that some people gave to this photo.
