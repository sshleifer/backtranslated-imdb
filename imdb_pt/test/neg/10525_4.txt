What I would not do to give this movie a rewrite. Extra disappointing due to the great start, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates into a superstitious mess after half and ends on such a ridiculous, melodic and melodramatic note that I could not believe I was watching the same movie I started. The film had numerous elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so palpable that I thought the screen would start to light, a great soundtrack, and beautiful locations. Instead of ending up with the religious mumbo-jumbo, the film should have kept focus on being a frothy road movie, with perhaps a few tones on fate and superstition versus spicy logic. I understand that the whole intention of the director with the film was to do religion, but the fact is that it just did not work, and he threw away so many good things from the beginning in doing so.
