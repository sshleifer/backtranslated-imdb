You expect it to be youthful, but at least you expect a complete and coherent movie. What a waste. I am extremely disappointed, not because I have seen a bad movie, but because it has such a great concept of being contaminated by a common movie that we have all seen before. If this crud makes $ 1 above your budget, the studio would be wise to declare victory, gather all available copies, store them in the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and never make another movie like this again. Most of this movie will keep you thinking, "This is not what I wanted to see." This movie appeals to non-savvy and maybe teenagers. It's a real shame because most movies are made for this audience. I had much bigger hopes for this movie.
