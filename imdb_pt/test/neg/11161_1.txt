The whole setup of this Disney family movie (the ad-exec arranges her teenage daughter because she "wants more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the big horse show at the end. . All other ingredients (the hype for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a potential boyfriend for the youngster, Lloyd Bochner as a potential rival for Dean Jones over the affections of Diane Baker) are filed near the end simply to show the horse . More than half of the image is filled and, worse: it is tearful and unpleasant. The kid is the type who cries on the couch with a dog in his arms and, as usual, gets what he wants. * in ****
