This movie is a bad movie. But after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it's a bit different from many I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a relatively regular story, but more like the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us many futile dialogue scenes, but they last much longer than in most such films. Because of this, some of the victims look a little less like cardboard cutouts. Only slightly. I had trouble figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and wondering if certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are fleeing the killer and take refuge in a car. In the glove compartment, they find a gun. "Thank you, God!" one of them cheerfully exclaims. This guy's head suddenly looks like a dummy's head, and it lasted just long enough for me to ask myself, "What's this? Where's that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" So BOOM! The head explodes and I realized that it was to be one of the guys in the car that had his head fired with a shotgun. I love this scene, but the movie is a really bad movie. 3/10
