Baby boom was bad enough, basically doing a series of nightmares every straight man is worse. Yes watched some always made me feel better after a bad day, it reminded me that it could be worse. The guy was rich and successful, single (smart man), and dating celebrities from singers to actresses, so his brother from a cousin ends his biggest mistake. In fact, it would have been straightforward to promote caution, I'm sure, this was definitely a fancy show. Oh, and what is most advantageous about changing the baby, most of the time is probably a doll that, beyond that age, is nothing more than an accessory. <br /> <br /> Any case, I'm glad it did not last more than a year.
