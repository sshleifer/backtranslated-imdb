This has to be one of the most terribly scripted movies I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but done with his snake puppet monster instead of an elegant creation by Ray Harryhausen. Combine the plot of the classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of The Creeping Terror and you will get an idea of ​​what this movie looks like. <br /> <br /> The film is dubbed, although by the original actors (I think the film was originally dubbed in Italian for the public of the countries, and then redoubled for release in the US), which makes the film look weird ... the sounds, as in a Japanese monster movie, do not match the action movie well on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly. <br /> <br /> Poor Ray Milland ... he certainly has come a long way since The Lost Weekend or M-Dial to the Murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in. Add that to your other science-fiction farces (Panic in Zero Year, XO Man with X-Ray Eyes) and you can see a good actor fallen into a Boris Karloff syndrome ... stuck doing really bad horror movies in countries foreigners just for work.
