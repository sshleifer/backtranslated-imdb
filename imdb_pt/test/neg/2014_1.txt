Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Revenge of the Dracula" (cheap money in another lame vampire movie) as I have seen is a master class on how not to make a movie. A collection of ragged board salvage misfit from a previously lost cargo ship "The Demeter" in the Cough (Carpathian System) (which is then upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and awakening a relentless evil (in this case the script) . The film is a bizarre disgrace to Event Horizon and whatever the worst vampire film ever. <br /> <br /> **** **** Followers **** After a myriad of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown up, we opened with a speech of type of extravagant display of Casper (silly name) that plays Captain Abraham Van Helsing (more subtle name) and instead of real character development, continues to describe the twisted, unintelligible oddities that make up his crew. Van Helsing himself bears a beardless spray and wears a warmer body in a sort of retro 80s tribute to Han Solo (I think). From time to time the Demeter Captain appears in some kind of crazy video diary to tell us nothing of importance in a pronounced German accent (unfortunately not included subtitles). Mina embarks on the abandoned ship (alone?) Armed only with a gun-shaped torch and a strong Eastern European accent while talking to Van Helsing on his ships bridge (which is basically a single gleaming wall). Mine wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, finds what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cape that slides continuously through the camera. Why this happens as the Vampire is not yet done flesh is never explained. This leads to an unstable camera chasing Mina down the aisles until she finds the Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith might have been recruited to write Humvee's lines, since most consist of Humvee reminding him that he is black every ten seconds and saying the word "butt" enough for a Guinness book to input records while delivering all of this in a "da hood" accent (this is the year 3000, is there "da hood" until there?) One of the main problems with this movie is that it insanely tries to fake its set in the year 3000. Unfortunately someone with healthy eyes won 'Do not buy this, as the Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet ocean-style tanker. Possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy Lenin poster next to a bunch of cabinets and explain it as a kind of special futuristic communist return. The crew's clothes appear to have been invaded by an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and armed to the teeth with the most recent automatic weapons of the 20th century (with the addition of 3,000 zing when triggered) which are obviously not Vampires . Health is a thing of the past (in the future) as Professor Simper not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair ??? My God, what happened to all this genetic engineering stuff. The teacher is an interesting character, since he is a direct asshole from Alien Resurrection, who had his own misfit team with a guy in a wheelchair (who strangely was not killed). Fans did not take to the Prof how he looks scared in many scenes If I were buried in a Soviet wheelchair-bound ship chased by bad-acting vampires, and everyone would leave me because I was a weeping coward, I would be scared too . <br /> <br /> During the dramatic chase scene at Mina, the teacher informs us (with feeling) "this is disconcerting." The rest of his lines are also bewildering "bugger," and "We're all going to die" X 100, goes on. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as the vice captain (what happened to 1st officers?) in what I thought would be the standard problem, tired, tough, no nonsense, "do not look at me unless I tell you too, "hit 10 double at once super-babe, but this is a Z-flick so she basically wears a fair bass top and tighter leather pants. Coolio's performance increases the ham factor by 90% and is more than a row of tents, but fortunately for us it dies soon. Although it seems to keep your heart on the right side of your body. <br /> <br /> After much running up and down the same hallway, using clumsy Soviet style controls, and sitting in Soviet-style locker rooms the crew finds themselves stranded as their own ship pulls away to find a crew more interesting (probably). Why Dracula is mentioned is unknown as the main villain is called Orlock, who is the Transylvanian Space for "crimes against fashion" as he dandies in a large ruffled shirt and even collared collar making Hammer Horror Vampires look slicker on Comparation. Orlock stops to explain his entire story back (off camera) to Erica Eleniak, but can not kill her in another Alien Resurrection turnaround. Your background story is such a burden that it's not worth repeating. As the budget can not afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimp) and even appropriate final titles (the first cast list I saw, they were same characters but completely different and Italian names) the movie begins to destroy any sanity with which you started. The crew, fortunately, is able to retaliate with the help of an on-board computer that contains obscure, millennial references on how to kill fictional creatures and some useful 20th century pool cues they find in the ship's recreation room (up to their "holodeck" "). The end is horrible and a little suspicious, or they ran out of money or the former soviets demanded their ship back. I got into this movie knowing it was bad, but I forgot how bad it really was.
