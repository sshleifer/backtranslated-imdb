This movie sucks. It is very disturbing to see that someone is able to say that this is one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Bad acting, bad action scenes that become really comical in the end. Forgive me if this were a comedy, so I did not get it. If so I regret laughing at the tent scenes! Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching it! Good night!
