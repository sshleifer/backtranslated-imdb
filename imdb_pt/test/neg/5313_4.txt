John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, the Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eyes to the music business. Using his "negotiating skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and tries to make his young singer (Christina Milian) a success. <br /> <br /> Before seeing this sequel, I heard it was a terrible movie. However, Be Cool is still a fun comedy, even if it's not as good as the original. The film focuses on the music industry this time instead of the film industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a lot of lame stereotypes. I can not tell if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a good job of forging the film industry. The same can not be said for the sequel and the attempts come just as lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it is good to see it on a different kind of paper. Vince Vaughn also makes a funny presentation, but began to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman does an average performance and I expected more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does a good job. His performance is kind of bland. Christina Milian does a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance, although he is not in the movie for long. There are also a lot of appearances, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray drives and he does a poor job. He just does not handle the movie very well and the movie is a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after some time. Also at 118 minutes, the film is very long and there are many slow points. The film needed to be edited poorly and clearly was not. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script, and they present funny scenes. Sometimes the movie tried too hard, sometimes it was funny. Compared to the original, the sequel does not perform well. However, Be Cool is a harmless and harmless comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it. Overall Rating
