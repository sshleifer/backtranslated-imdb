This movie made my face hurt. I do not understand ... things simply happened, inexplicably, and usually resulted in someone bursting into a number of music and dance. I do not understand how people can praise this movie with compliments. There are B movies, and then there are B-musicals, and then there's Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. The only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a music video, which relieves the pain but still can not justify why it needed to exist. The scariest part of the movie is Toni Basil's crackling dance that accompanies her strange song. But on the bright side, she can find the notes she's looking for, unlike the sensations of pop music Rockula (also known as Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say that the tone is deaf. So if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, watch this movie. If you hate your life, buy it.
