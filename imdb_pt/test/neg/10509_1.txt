This movie almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> To begin with, false teeth. Then you stain a good plastic or drawn set. To make it even more annoying, all the action is followed by a flash of bright light. So the conversation: the sound levels are so different, sometimes very difficult, then very smooth, never exactly good, like in good movies. Also, it echoes so much that I think they had a microphone on the whole set. And to make matters worse, did you hear about stereo? If the camera changes, the sound will always be centered. The actors speak as if they were reading from a staged plaque behind the camera. And zoom into another scene, how terrible childish. <br /> <br /> The music is so poorly chosen that it never adds anything. It only destroys any accidentally created excitement. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fight scenes ... my 3 year old niece would make a better fight scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good at laughing, it's so bad ...
