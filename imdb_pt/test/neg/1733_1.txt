Honestly, the only reason I got this Blockbuster movie was because Aaron Carter was in it. Okay, first thing is the first one. Do you realize how ugly Aaron Carter has become? I mean, he used to be so cute, but now ... with that slim body and spotted skin - EW. I think he should stay with the singing and the directors of the film could have found a much better guy who could do lip-sync. No offense though. I thought that this teen movie was really bad - and that comes from me, being myself a teenager. The evil girls there are oh-so predictable, the acting is so amateurish that it makes you cringe at times (especially from Aaron) and overall I just do not like it. Although, I give points to the plot - this was good, but not at all realistic. Either way, stay away from this movie by all means you can, unless you have packs of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. Not worth the $ 6.50 !! (P.S., my comment may not apply to children under the age of 13!)
