"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic comedy style 80's with more than one eye full of sex over its 101 minutes in length. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through their divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of this same perspective. Both good friends decide to take vacations in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter by his side. Complications happen when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter. <br /> <br /> This potential riot of a story is quite funny and there are some good lines, but it never really becomes hilarious, as it could be. Any attempt to deal seriously with the moral issue does not work either, and perhaps Director Donen has been stuck in the mood. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, but what really spoils it is the bad situation of Michelle Johnson. performance as the little tantalizing nigga Jennifer. As long as she uses her body to the maximum advantage, it is the only thing she has. Michelle's acting prowess leaves much to be desired. No wonder we have not seen her in anything else. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video
