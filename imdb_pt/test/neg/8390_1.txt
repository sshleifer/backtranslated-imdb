Unless you want to be bored to death. I was never a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of what previous posters described as the next generation of young people, I was very disappointed and mildly angry at the stereotypical description of the characters in the film, especially as they were accustomed to tying together. The ridiculous plot of the film, which is virtually mandatory for the masses that the skaters are socially rejected and should be held accountable for crimes. As a skateboarder I watch a lot of skateboarding movies and filming during the skateboarding scenes, which obviously is an important part of the storyline, since the main character is a skateboarder, it was awful and weird technique of the Bourne camera was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect. This movie is full of ridiculous stereotypes, as shown by the 'emo' soundtrack, which only adds to the media myth that all skaters are white rockers. It's just just a really bad movie.
