I do not understand why so many of the reviews here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. The horror of opening this cinematic monstrosity can not be overstated. My girlfriend and I just watched together, and I'm not sure we'll be able to have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse, the skeletal, ugly cast, his supranhotogenic genitals, rancid attempts at humor, the raucous noises that used to be songs ... <br /> <br /> No, I know what was the worst of it all. The girls in the green tights, with the green paint, licking Alice to dry it, then proposing, in broken childish language, to suck the milk from her breasts. That was the worst. <br /> <br /> Besides, what happened to the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding the vaginas of each other? Why are all male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty swing a penis in the air and pretend it's his penis? Why do my eyes have to see this? There are no words.
