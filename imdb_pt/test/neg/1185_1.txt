please re-watch all 3 series and not go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series extend a poorly thought 25min episode of TV in the most painful 2hrs of my life, truly a horrible movie . tubbs and edward are in it for a few minutes, micky has 1 line, and his lipp just wraps the same old and tired puns, and m briss's accent changes only about 5 times in the movie tons of misunderstood extras, and really some laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hours I honestly feel that this series was completely ruined by this awful piece of crap .......... batman and robin everything is forgiven
