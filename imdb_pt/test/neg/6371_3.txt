I am a fifth grade art teacher, and after reading this book (which the students loved), we watched the movie. They laughed out loud! Unfortunately, it's not a comedy! The acting was so horrible, I felt like I was watching a lot of kids in the neighborhood doing a play. My students were imitating the lines and making fun of them all the way. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was too bad. Still, I would show the students again, just for fun, and to compare the movie with the book. We did a Venn Diagram (the teachers know what that is) then to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. I noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005, so we can only hope that the performance is better!
