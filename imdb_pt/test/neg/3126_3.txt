I wish Depardieu had managed to finish his book and see that it had become a staggering success. At least he would have done with something. <br /> <br /> The film seemed useless, disjointed and very stylish, like some other recent French films. Not to knock. The most recent American films are useless and disconnected and have no style whatsoever. We should be grateful, I suppose, for the photograph that evokes a European city in the midst of a continental winter blown by the wind, and elliptical conversations that defy our ability to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> But it can be very good. Golubeva is found stumbling by the sea in the middle of the icy night, continuing with a bad accent on dreams and such. (There are some dream sequences that include things like swimming in a river of blood. You'll love it if it's Vlad the Impaler.) Many people die. Catherine Deneuve dies on a motorcycle suicide. I do not know why. Golubeva's girl also dies and I do not know why she dies either. She is slapped, falls on the sidewalk, and dies. <br /> <br /> Supposedly there is an explicit sex scene as well. I'm going to have to take their word because, although it's elegantly photographed, it's elegantly photographed in almost complete darkness. Do not worry about children being shocked. They'll probably be asleep by now, anyway. <br /> <br /> Depardieu is not a bad actor. Seeing him deteriorate from a handsome, carefully groomed young man - well, handsome, except that his nose does not seem to get out of his way - to a lank, hairy, killer physical wreck, we feel sorry for the guy. Golubeva has a pale and handsome face, with huge half-closed eyes and wide cheeks like a doll. His next film must be a remake of Lewton's "I Walked With a Zombie." So there's this mysterious guy who leads a band. I think it's a band. As far as I could understand, the band consists of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitar. Every viewer will find the resulting sound interesting, but uneducated listeners who like to "listen easily" may not like it. If you do not like the music, there is a reward involved because the sinister composer and leader is hit in the head with Depardieu's cane. <br /> <br /> I must say that I thought it would not be worth going through. (And it's also a longie.) Sometimes it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing, while a long, long freight train passes slowly, sometimes stopping altogether. I wish you had some jokes.
