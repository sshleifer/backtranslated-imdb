The Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenage Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering covered in dog blood. His parents Ely (Randy Colton) and Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch and are deeply concerned about their daughter, recently she was not herself and is considered a danger to herself and others. Hand of the ranch and ex-priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognizes Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession and when she begins to speak old Latin in a strange voice, he becomes convinced of it. Blanche calls Father Jacob (Cameron Daddo) who is the ex-husband of his other daughter Claire (Madison Taylor) to see Isabelle, he confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the work of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside Isabelle and an innocent girl. .. Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sitting at my house in front of my television watching Exorcism Blackwater Valley & I kept asking the same question over and over again, why do I do this. Why do I keep sitting in the middle of all those horrible low budget movies that seem to have been filmed on a camcorder? Let's make it quite clear, the Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete and utter exorcist scam (1973) and you literally point out the main plot points that the two share. There is the possessed adolescent who begins to get very horny and suggests improper things, the demon that uses the contravention of the past against the others, the worried parents, the way the girl possessed is avoided by the doctor, the priest with a troubled past and the possessed girl. is tied to his bed among other things. I suppose that where the Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (besides its total crap) is that it tries to give time to the whole screen of the character and tries to show how the situation is affecting, but it is so poorly written and acted that it ends up being annoying . The film begins with Isabelle already possessed, so we never knew how she was like a normal person, so we never care about her or what is happening to her too, the rest of the character is poorly written and detailed. Sometimes I wondered if the Blackwater Valley exorcism was a parody, there is a silly scene where a veterinarian tries to sedate Isabelle with horse tranquilizers and then he states that she needs a 'little idiot' he goes into her bedroom with a huge needle hidden behind your back! There are some scenes in which people are perforated accompanied by a sound effect of silly comedy. The film has an uneven tone as a result, as it goes between silly parody and serious horror drama, or did in my opinion, at least. <br /> <br /> According to some text before the opening credits Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on 'Actual Events', yeah right real events of 1973 that happened in a movie called The Exorcist ... This text also states that the scenes of exorcism were supervised by a true priest. There is not even blood or decent farm to liven things up, there is a scene of a severed arm, there is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and that's about it. There is surprisingly no bad language, despite the demon trying to be offensive. I imagine that the only reason the Blackwater Valley Exorcism has an adult rating is because of a very brief scene in which a pair of breasts is seen. A pair of naked female breasts is not worth the time watching this or the money you can spend on it. There is no fuss, no atmosphere and a really amateurish feel throughout the movie too. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 1,000,000, I must say I'm wondering where all the money went, the movie looks ugly and cheap everywhere. There are no special effects to speak of and production values ​​are at the bottom. The acting is pretty bad of all involved, the favorite of the genre Jeffrey Combs comes close to top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a special turnout that amounts to about five minutes of screen time. Even he must have feared how bad that would be if he hid behind a mustache and a terrible accent, he's better than that. <br /> <br /> The Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete Exorcist scam without anything that made that movie a classic and the makers were thirty-five years late anyway. A total turkey from start to finish.
