I checked this video hoping to like it. Wanting to like it. I like foreign films, I like beautiful cinematography, I know critics like this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert), and I do not care about "slow" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, it's beautiful. That's the best I can say for that. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the looks are very significant, the actors are very sincere, and it seems a very long film. I fell asleep in the middle of the road, woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. It was a trial, but I came to an end. I did not like it at all.
