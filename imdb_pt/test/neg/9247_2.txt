I can name just a few movies that I saw that were so bad. This film has everything terrible: the dialogue is tacky and clich√©, the acting is poor mostly with some exceptions, cinematography is nothing to cheer up, and the plot is silly (a fat woman chases a suburban family because she did not make the soccer team). This is so bad, it's funny to watch. If you can get this in life, I highly recommend it as a comedy. As for being a serious movie, I'm afraid to give a note to this 2. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you're a serious movie fan and are looking for an interesting and challenging or good storyline performance. There is nothing to be found. <br /> <br /> Edit: Hmmm ... I think a group of people who work for life should have written some false reviews and voted all the negatives down. Do not believe them. This is a really bad movie.
