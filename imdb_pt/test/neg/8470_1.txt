Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most annoying personality on the Food Network and all television. If you have never seen 30 Minute Meals then you can not begin to understand how incompressibly annoying it is. I really really meant that you can not even begin to be bothered by it until you've seen the show once or twice, and yet all the smart words and thoughts will fail at you. The problem is mostly with its mannerisms as you may have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often imitates the parrot. If you love something or think it's "incredible" (a word she uses about 87 times per transmission), just say so. And she's constantly using horrible and bland slogans like "EVOO" (extra virgin olive oil!). Shut up! What's worse is Ray has two other shows on the net! I think this is an elaborate conspiracy of terrorists to drive us insane. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
