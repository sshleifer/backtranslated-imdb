The filmmaker remained true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894, which includes a manuscript of Richard Williams Bell, 1846 (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) titled "Our Family Trouble." To the knowledge, this is the only eyewitness account ever written. The filmmaker must be credited for accuracy, but there is little to say about the quality of production and acting. The acting was theatrical and the quality of sound and image was extremely poor. It seems that the filmmaker simply filmed scenes of the events reported that occurred without incorporating them or inserting them into a fluent plot or plot. If you need to know the story, read about it, it is much more exciting and conclusive.
