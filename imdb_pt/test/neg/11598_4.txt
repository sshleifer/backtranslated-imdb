Komodo vs. Cobra will not set the world on fire. It is not a mark of film history. What is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another payment, and continue to support themselves and their families. As such, I give these efforts much laziness. I mean, it has to be difficult being a Russian special effects technician. There are not many great budget films being made there. BUT - they are a dedicated pack and more than willing to throw it all in any American monster movie that needs SFX handy. And I got a kick out of looking for the same places popping up again and again in those movies. If for some reason you see yourself again, look at the sequence in which Stop and company are walking through a "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two before in SciFi too), you'll see people wandering through the same surrogate jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both movements. I can admire the parsimony of these films. Every dollar really pops up on the screen! Too bad there is not enough money ...
