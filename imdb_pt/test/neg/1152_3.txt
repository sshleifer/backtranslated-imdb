I had never heard of this movie until it came on DVD. I was immediately intrigued by all that: the actors, the title, the cover and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you can not make a mistake with him, can you? Yes. I did not read the novel, but I'll guess it was a lot better than the movie. I had high hopes for this movie. I love Macy and Dern, and it sounded interesting. Unfortunately, this movie never rises above the messages about racism and bigotry. If you've never seen any other movie that deals with this subject, or if you never knew that America was founded on fanaticism, then maybe this movie will surprise you. Others will probably find it predictable, obsolete and bland.
