I love a good western movie, but this was more like watching a play on the stage or an act at the local street carnival show. I could only last 38 minutes in the hope that it would improve, but it only got worse and I had to end it. Each actor (s) declared the lines as if they were reading directly from the script or suggestion cards. There was too much predictability for lines and actions, not as if it were a natural occurrence or conversation. Rachel Kimsey's wig was obvious. Actresses who play Native American sisters could have played non-native roles and should have participated. The wardrobe for the Native Americans could have been better and a bit more authentic. If I decide to watch it with a friend in the future, I will, not with the expectations of watching a good western, but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy movie production.
