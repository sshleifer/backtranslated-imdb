I love eccentric animations, I love many Asian movies, but I do not love this specific product from Japan. The Fuccons are supposedly an American family (they are all dummies) who moved to Japan, and they are a kind of family type of 1950s comedy, with slightly more modern sensibilities sometimes. The DVD features several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) And I did not find it funny or funny, not even in a weird way. I'm not sure what the appeal is. I've got some satire here and there, damn it, who would not, but satire is generally good-hum, is not it? And nothing I saw or heard evaluated even a small smile. I got this used and certainly SOUNDED attractive, but I guess either I'm missing the point or it's just LAME. The box still says it's Fuccon hilarious, right there in the front, but I disagree. 2 out of 10.
