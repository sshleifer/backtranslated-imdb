I've never been really interested in cannibal movies before and even a few months ago I had avoided this genre of film. <br /> <br /> I recently had to undergo knee surgery and found that I had too much time on my hands, as I was unable to work, so I decided, after seeing almost all the horror movies that our rental company local video had to offer, I would risk a chance on that. <br /> <br /> Christ was a mistake! I've never seen such a bad movie in all my years as a movie addict. This is just a stack of movies pasted onto a DVD disc and sold like a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can change their heads long enough to enjoy it. this crap, they're more dead than I'll ever be and that's an achievement! 0/10 and this is generous.
