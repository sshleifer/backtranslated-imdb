this movie is so incredibly horrible! all about it was rubbish. you can not say anything good about this movie, the acting, script, direction, effects are all as bad as the other. Even the wood could have done a better job than that. I seriously recommend staying away from this movie unless you want to lose about 100mins of your life or the time the movie was. I forget. This is the first time I wrote a comment about a movie about IMDb, but this movie was only on TV and I had to let the world of movie lovers know that this movie sucked balls !!!!!!!!! !!! so if you have any decency in you. go and rent a bad movie much better as bugs 3
