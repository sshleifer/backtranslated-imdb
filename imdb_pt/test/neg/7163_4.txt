This is an example textbook of how Hollywood does not (not) trust viewers, and favors their big names. The character of Christian is completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah faces from his own army unit is virtually eliminated, Michael's story changes significantly, and the end result is to decimate the book's power and dreadful beauty. I almost wished I had not seen it, because the ability of movies (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; I would have been much more impressed with the book. The book could have been written today, is honest and courageous. Not the movie either. My advice: SKIP the movie; Read the book.
