We all have to start somewhere, it was in movies like Escape In The Fog that someone like Budd Boetticher could learn his craft before producing good movies. In fact, the film was dated before even reaching the public on June 25, 1945. The war in Europe ended for almost two months, of course not even Harry Cohn could control the events of story. So I'm wondering why even at that time the public did not question why a Nazi spy ring was helping the Japanese. Another very vile historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with the theater of the Pacific or Asia. The cloak and dagger were OSS territory in that part of the world. <br /> <br /> When you're an FBI man like William Wright, it's good to have a psychic girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is about to go on a mission to the East to hand over the names of the top leaders of the underworld to start a general revolt in China against Japanese occupation. The Germans who are bothering the home of Otto Kruger learn this and the whole movie is spent on these guys who have already lost the war trying to help their allies. Who, by the way, they refer to as "Japanese". When Foch is hit by a car at high speed and becomes unconscious, she dreams of Wright's danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. She goes there and frustrates the plot. <br /> <br /> Everything you'd expect from a good movie noir is there, the foggy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit settings, Budd Boetticher tried his best as well as the cast. But they just were not convincing, probably because they did not believe in this fool. <br /> <br /> It is possible but it is not likely that Nina Foch's dream and its psychic consequences may have been further developed and developments were left on the cutting room floor. I think it was just a bad script. <br /> <br /> And Budd and Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures had the quick story events against them here.
