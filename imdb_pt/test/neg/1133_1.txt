I was out of town visiting an old friend. After dinner, he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boyfriend. She is 15 years old, beautiful, intelligent, athletic, and the young man is also from an excellent family, good, also athletic (if not so smart). I told him that he might just be feeling the normal paternal concerns; however, a few minutes later, the young man arrived with his DVD of that film, which he had apparently been looking forward to for some time to share with others. <br /> <br /> These people have a bona fide home theater with a screen of more than 4 feet, and the two young people have come to see it, while the young swain proceeded to extol their almost frame- by-frame. <br /> <br /> I've seen enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in its horribility) to endorse all the most critical comments I've ever seen in scanning a few here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I would not go so far as to disqualify the young suitor just based on his liking for this opus - but it certainly seems to justify that he is paying attention. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad - they're good: the classic "Plan 9 from Outer Space"; and, in my opinion, the wonderful work of Bruce Jenner / Village People, "I Can not Stop the Music." <br /> <br /> However, this remains firmly in the horrible category. <br /> Second / third / fourth "bananas" - even the best (eg, Tim Conway, Don Knotts, everyone with Seinfeld) have great difficulty in carrying a newer series (or, as here, movie). And these were great supporting characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The character "Eddie", really at level 5 or 6 banana in the previous films of Griswald, and never added much, In my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who did some good acting. His contribution to the previous "Holiday" pic was average at best. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, have done nothing for their efforts here except to get some home payments or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> Whole presentation --- story, performances (from lead to support) could not be worse.
