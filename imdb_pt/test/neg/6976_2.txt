I agree with a commentator who says it's really impossible to review Glen or Glenda? objectively. If one does this, the film on its merits would have to be classified as reasonably dreadful, given the hilarious and complicated dialogue, the generally mediocre performance to bad by the cast, as well as zero production figures. However, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely fascinating experience of watching this movie as it unfolds. It is not the fact that the theme of the film is transvestism and that it was a controversial choice in the 1950s lifestyle. It is not even the call to tolerance of people who embrace alternative life choices that fascinate except as a relic historical. <br /> <br /> No, what does Glen or Glenda do? A fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood exposed his psyche in a way that the so-called directors of authors like Hitchcock or Godard, despite their immensely superior talents, never did. In Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the call for tolerance for him through the film. In fact, the film's conclusion suggests that Ed Wood's Glen character will be able to "kill" his female Glenda counterpart, transferring the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his female counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that, while Glen does this psychic transfer, Glenda will disappear. So, although Wood could defend the tolerance of transvestites in general, he was not so sure he wanted them for himself. <br /> <br /> In addition, Wood was not afraid to throw everything else that went through his mind. screen. He did it with any film that could get his hands on. If not cohesive, so what? What the viewer saw in Glen or Glenda was especially the imaginative world of Ed Wood in all its fundamental strangeness. <br /> <br /> The only comment I would add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria quoted in the first paragraph. The strangely mem√©rico effect that the film has, despite its technically atrocious qualities, do not think it can be evaluated.
