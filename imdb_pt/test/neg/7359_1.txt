Horrifying and utterly ridiculous horror movie that has a character out of place Anna Paquin playing a neurotic teenager struggling with the "dark-going stuff" that is tormenting her and her family shortly after moving to her new house in Spain (?!). Little more than a geographically replanted reboot of "The Shining" and most notably "The Others", "Darkness" is basically your typical B-Horror feature with few predictable clicks. fits that can be seen by the public a mile away (so to speak)! In retrospect, I suppose I should not have set my personal expectations so high for this movie to really be good considering the well-known fact that it was shelved for almost three years before finally being released around Christmas last year in cinemas. the country for which was ultimately sales of warm tickets and critics very harsh critics. When will the filmmakers learn that there is more to make movies (whether of terror or not) than just the fairy possibility of a little financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Stars)
