I saw this movie for the first time on NBC Friday 11-29-02. It was a very good movie, but I do not think it would be the kind of Muppet movie Jim Henson would do. I mean, first of all, Pepe 'using the word' sexy 'from time to time, and Pepe saying' would it be bad? ' And I definitely know that Jim Henson would not let Kermit yell "I WISH I WAS NEVER BORN!" thirteen times a minute. This movie is not like a classic Muppets movie. Of course I can understand Nicky Holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper," but a business woman cheating the Muppets on a contract for her theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub. If Jim Henson were here today, he hates this movie!
