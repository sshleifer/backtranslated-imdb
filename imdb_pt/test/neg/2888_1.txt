This movie is worse than horrible! It took a good plot and turned it into a schizophrenic movie. The photo is EXTREMELY amateur. . . it looks like a fifth-grade home theater project shot with defective 8mm kiddie cameras. . . the issue appears to have been made by someone with psychotic flashbacks (with drugs and alcohol), with interrupted scenes followed by other unrelated scenes, then chopped segments of stuck scenes. . . totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity. . . lost scenes . . Daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night scenes, and suddenly come back to the day. . . obviously without continuity. The good acting skills of Tom Skerritt, Wendy Hughes and James Mason are wasted, as well as the talents of the "key" support cast - (forget the villain and Anderson's women - very amateur acting). This movie is a good candidate for a remake, even with Skerritt and Hughes. . . just do it professionally this time.
