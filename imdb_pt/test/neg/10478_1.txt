First I must confess that A Separate Peace is my favorite book. So, of course, I have some prejudice against any attempt to adapt it to a movie or television movie. But when I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give the benefit of the doubt. The original version of the early 1970s, although filmed at the Phillips Exeter Academy, where the author of the book went to school, and although it was as faithful as possible to the book, had no depth and could not grasp the essence of the characters. The original seemed simply to go through the motions. Reading the trivia about the movie, you discover that it was mainly released with non-actors. Thus, the original has an amateur feeling and finally fails. <br /> <br /> This new version, though I concede that it captures the look of the period better than the original, seems to have played the book. all together. The scenes are rearranged, the characters imposed where they do not belong, the created characters that were not in the book, and no attempt was made to deepen the deeper conflicts that make the book so attractive. And the chief sin of all: the tree is not treated as the vital, almost central, character that is in the book. This is an inexpressible vision on the part of the filmmakers. How could they minimize the role of the tree? Why was it not introduced immediately? Why the beginning of the Dead Poet? And what in God's name had Gene's accent? This movie is, to be honest, rubbish. A Separate Peace should not be a difficult book to adapt to the stage or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a perfectly linear style. The filmmakers should have relied on the story as it was already written; make changes, of course; beautify here and there, of course; take some moderate dramatic leave, of course. But destroy one of the pearls of American literature in the process? What were they thinking? In their corruption of the story line, they cut off any possibility of suspense or drama. The whole movie falls and fails miserably. <br /> <br /> If you are a college student or college student assigned to read this book and you are thinking about saving and just watching the movie ... do not even think about it. This movie will not be of any help to you. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we'll have to wait even longer before a version of this story hits the screen that really does justice to it.
