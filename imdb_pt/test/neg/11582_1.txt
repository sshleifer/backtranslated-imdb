probably the worst creature feature of all time, python vs. python was a million times better then this and that was not great, poor performance, bad effects and guess what the DVD with 3 hours of previews before the main menu. probably the least scary movie of all time, no blood or violence, people are stupid and still wear pistols when they have no effect on these animals, the only cool part was the radioactive leeches which was really cool, I name the island is just a rip off boring boring Jurassic Park and not worth looking at, but I suppose the stupidity of the characters is very funny so it would make a good comedy movie but it's definitely not a thriller
