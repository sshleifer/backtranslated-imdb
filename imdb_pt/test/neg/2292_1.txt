This movie is TERRIBLE! He prepares to disgust you and make you laugh but fails horribly. The director obviously has no sense of comedy, and the actors are like nothing I've ever seen - without the acting talent and comedy talent. Even their attempt to languish in England is really sad, and indeed the peculiar Swedish accent, in which incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the most comical and pleasant thing about this film. Even the blood is horrible and unconvincing. If you want a bloody comedy, I suggest you turn to classic things like the evil series of the dead or even brain death, if need be. We all like a good laugh, but this is ridiculous!
