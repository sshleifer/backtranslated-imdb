I usually like these dumb / non-brain activity movies, but that was pretty stupid. There were lots of cliches, and the plot did not make much sense. There were many loose ends and the end was extremely poor and abrupt. We could not even see if the big master plan worked. We also only saw the main character sobbing about his dead farthest, the teacher (who died because of stupidity (see below)). <br /> <br /> A scene particularly bothered me. Why did the teacher only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually replace the dam? And if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes of oxygen, why did not he bring in two or three of them? So he would have survived ?? That was very stupid. The movie is very full of such stupid things. I can not recommend it at all.
