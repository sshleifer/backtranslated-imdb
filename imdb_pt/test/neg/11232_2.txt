The worst part of all is poor routing, leading to a perfunctory performance. <br /> <br /> Dreyfuss's character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and Dreyfuss himself has the irritating face to match. <br /> <br /> The character of Holly Hunter is overly self-centered, and Hunter herself takes it seriously, as usual. <br /> <br /> Brad Johnson was made of wood. John Goodman did his best. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole death / ghost thing has already been somewhat exaggerated, and now it seems rather lame. <br /> <br /> Only watchable only if you like old airplanes.
