This documentary is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your own family? I understand that you think the subject matter is interesting. I was bored with it. This is not a fascinating story for me, and I do not know why you'd think it was. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sound evil, but I have to say: the people in this movie simply are not attractive. And that's okay, not everyone is beautiful. But your camera technique, to stick the lens in their faces, so you can not help but feel overwhelmed by the unpleasant appearance because it's filling your 47 "TV, it's not pleasant.I had to put my hand in half the time to protect myself from the warts, wrinkles, bags under the eyes and yellow teeth. Actually, I'm trying not to sound inhuman, but I pull the camera back so that it does not look like strangers are breathing in my face. It is the type of camera work you see of everyone with a camcorder at a family picnic. The uninteresting, hesitant, and even static framing is done carelessly. If you're going to do it for a living. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not see what's the big deal about this thing.
