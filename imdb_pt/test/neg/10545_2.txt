The first toxic film was dark, bloody and hillarious. This film is a huge battle with Chilean jazz music, no blood and the worst mask of toxin I have ever seen! Her deep voice is now a light and happy voice, part 1 characters reappear by actors who look NOTHING like them (Claire, Mom Junko), the characters' names change (Claire or Sara?). It's missing all the brutal violence, dark humor and political imprecision of the first movie. If it were not for nudity, this movie could have been rated PG. Really limp. I'm a big fan of part 1, but I just can not bear this.
