Why every time I mention this movie to someone, I have to hear 10 minutes of compliment about it. I have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist is considered "genius" by anyone watching it. Is this really the movie that has become? Or is it that every time someone says, "Wow, that's so cool," does everyone have to agree with them and have no opinion of their own? As this film has a rating of 7.5 it is a shame for the film industry in general. It also became more of a movie that "needs" two sequels for that, so I'll have to hear about this awful franchise for quite a while. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie and why it's so bad. The original concept is not that bad since there has not been a good serial killer movie for some time. The writing for this movie is horrible, just like the execution. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but that should not change the story or the writing. The actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us scared of this killer or just scared of that movie. So they go out and win a big name in Danny Glover, but their talents (whatever they are) are wasted because ITS CHARACTER WITHOUT VALUE. Why was he even in this movie? What was his entire fight in the end turned out to be useless and misleading to what the public believes is happening. This of course the filmmakers want, but there could not have been a better way to do it without making us watch all that junk. And then the "big" twist comes (was it the third or fourth?) And the whole audience is shocked and leaves the theater like some kind of masterpiece. Of course the movie gets people talking about the plot and what not, but that was not the only flaw in this movie. The direction was trying to be too creative with what it was working, and the flashback sequences were used only as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you liked it, go back and review the movie and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the compliment you are receiving. For an incredible serial killer movie, check out se7en if you did not do it. That's what this movie wanted to be. I've put in more arguments about this movie than probably any other and will continue to argue against it. Please do not support this franchise, not only for your sake, but also for mine and for the good of all. Hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to do, instead of 1,000 remakes, sequels and "shock" factor films (like this one). Oh yes, the saw line looks real promising: "Oh yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Candy!! blood, that should mean it's good right? Give me some time. Sorry for everyone who loves this movie, but poor writing, flashy direction and bad acting does not make a good movie.
