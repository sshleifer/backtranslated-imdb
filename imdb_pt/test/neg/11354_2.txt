I was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and quite good rating. This was a big disappointment. This does not cling to contemporary zombie movies like Shaun of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Land of the Dead, etc. Horror movies sometimes take a while to get started, you have to build the characters so they get to it, you feel some empathy, etc., but even then, there are 45 minutes to sit here before even sniffing a corpse, so far, it's like watching a bad soap opera, nothing of interest or relevance happens and if you are to watch for the first time, you can start watching honestly after 45 minutes, and you will not lose anything in terms of plotting. When things start, it's all very sub-par. Some of the killings and makeup are well made, others are made very poorly, consistency is lacking here and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the more wooded stocks I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This could all be acceptable if you really believed that everything was happening on an airplane, but with guns being fired, bombs burned, no pilot in the cockpit in a violent storm, but the plane stays in the air, Come on, we're not all simple. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it really takes a minute for a fighter's missile to reach a plane that's a few hundred yards away. I know it's a zombie movie and you have to stretch things out, but this movie, along with the other major flaws listed above, had zero credibility. One to lose.
