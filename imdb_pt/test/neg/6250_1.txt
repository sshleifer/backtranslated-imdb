Before I start, I need to report that I love horror movies with passion. LOVE THEM! I've seen thousands and rarely one comes along that I do not like. I am very indulgent with the horror genre. One of the biggest lines in film history is in the movie "Ed Wood," where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) goes mad and screams at overly critical producers after they comment on the cheap sets and continuity issues of "Plan 9," " You do not know anything! Have you ever heard of 'suspension of disbelief?' "Well, I try to bring that philosophy of" hanging from disbelief "with me to all the horror movies that I see and often work in. Unfortunately, it did not work for me during the display of the Cheerleader Massacre. > Strike One: The first thing you'll notice about this "movie" is that it's shot on video and has that bad style of portable digital camera. Camera work and quality are so bad which makes daytime soaps look like breathtaking in comparison - it actually makes Troma and Full Moon video releases look good, and that's a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: Jim Wynorski.jpg This "filmmaker" probably imagines an old Corman chip, but nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman fired fast, furious and under budget, but was able to deliver a movie Although Wynorski delivers a cheap movie, he fools his audience. (and perhaps other artists) as he steals entire parts of the musical scores of James Horner's "Humanoids From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" and inappropriately places them in the Cheerleader Massacre. In the back of the box art and during the initial credits the score is falsely attributed to Dan Savio (an extra in Wynorski's "Deathstalker II"). You'll also notice how the Cheerleader Massacre jumps from the video to the movie and vice versa, while Wynorski raises entire scenes of both the "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From the Deep." Wynorski used this deception, fourteen years earlier, in his horrible version of "Not From This Earth." <br /> <br /> Attack Three (you're out): <br /> <br /> While the Cheerleader Massacre does have some nudity, (40-year-old teens playing with teens and the coarser set of fake breasts that I've seen in a horror movie, ugh), the murders are relatively bloodless. What the hell is all this? The movie is titled, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen murders, in my opinion, do not add up to a massacre. This is not even a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The story of the "movie" is fairly fair - invisible killer chases a crowd of cheerleaders (old girls playing with teenagers) until the van runs out of gas and the "girls" are forced to keep in a secluded two-story mountain home. I'm not going to ruin the ending for you, but this is one of those "movies" where the person who is obviously the killer is obviously not the killer. The Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it were shot on film, directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. Instead, it's an ineffectual farce filmed on video by Jim Wynorski. There. <br /> <br /> I beg you, please do not buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, more of this untalented video junk they will produce. Go out and rent "The Prowler," "The Last House on Dead End Street," "Delirium," or "The Burning." You'll be glad you did it.
