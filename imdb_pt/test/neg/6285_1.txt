The perfect 6-step recipe for a boring road movie mean: 1. Take an ex-cop, exhausted, with a bad attitude but also a touch sensitive (pianist with a pet cat); <br /> <br /> 2. Add some "cool" retro gadgets like a battered Porsche 356, a roaring bike, a leather jacket with heavy patches and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles of the feet; <br /> <br /> 3. Mix a couple of "free spirit" sites, a modern apartment by the sea and a diner dedicated to an office; <br /> <br /> 4. Spice up with "deep" socio-romantic themes, like a traumatized-but-finally-married post-divorce spouse, a secretly-admiring, and therefore forgiving, waitress a couple of ex husband. A colleague-policeman-just-a-who-is-really-a-complete-idiot and a best-friend-getting-frozen-on-the- 5. Boil for about 90 minutes in an "accelerated" sequence, though not necessarily logically or internally consistent with mediocre action scenes, moments of cheap tenderness, and slow, wise cracks; <br /> <br /> 6. Serve with a comfortable pillow for direct sleeping or something a little more interesting (do not worry: even the yellow pages will do!).
