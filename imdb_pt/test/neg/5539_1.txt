I just wanted to leave a quick comment as it is not listening here, but I just saw this movie, the version I just rented was released in 2005 as far as I know and was actually called "Do not go to the attic" I I just realized it was the same movie as Devils Harvest looking for some of the familiar actors who appeared in the film. Anyway I'm in Ireland so maybe this has only been released here and in the UK right now, but that's what's called here .......... it's not really that important because I Would not recommend this movie The only words that come to mind watching are cheese CHEESE CHEESE !! My a mark of ten is purely for the somewhat nervous: o)
