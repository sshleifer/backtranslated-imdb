Oh my. Oh, this is a * really * bad movie. The acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is horrible, and the photograph is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie stand out, however, is that you never cared about a single soul. good face or villain, living, dying or dead - in all 87 minutes. "Oh, he / she died? Huh ... I thought it would be" was the best reaction I could muster after each murder. The characters are so black or white that, with the volume off, you can still figure out who was who. While the voices of the cast had a strange and monotonous quality, their faces give the impression that you are looking at an old silent film with many eyebrows, exaggerated wrinkles and "pensive looks". Each character is a pony of a one-dimensional trick and without passion; once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation, they are summarily dismissed. I vaguely wondered what would happen if Thomas Borch Nielsen (director / writer for "Skyggen", American title: "Webmaster") decided to make a low-budget version of "American Psycho" distracted along the way. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly horrible movie; the cast cold and without passion ensures this. It's not an offensive movie; the director plays so well that no one could find him like that. It is, simply and after all, a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid. We were not so lucky and actually paid to watch this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my penance, I am writing this review. <br /> <br /> He said enough.
