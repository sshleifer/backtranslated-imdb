There are some really good songs and performances; Kid Creole and Coco, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, Plastics, Mel Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but there is not much else besides that. The dialogue, especially the narration (by Saul Williams), is really very good, but the performances are all very enjoyable, but no matter how many hipsters are played; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter being the lead role) both still lack sufficient cultural credibility to prevent this film from being an innovative item. This is true for itinerant Jack Kerouac-like spontaneity, but it does not have the insight to keep it moving, which is where the band's performances come in. I think it's well balanced in this respect between good music and bad acting, and I enjoyed it, but I just expected more. Although it has a fairy tale ending.
