I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways that this movie is bad. Computer graphics was lacking to say the least. I found the performance hard and unbelievable. Look at the sand as the lost "e-pods" (what an original name!) Are found. Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, such as Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, a huge ship to carry a prisoner? And what about the prisoner? He speaks, does he speak? I kept waiting for something to tie the pieces together, but it never happened. If this movie was done on a low budget, it will be displayed. The only part of the movie that I liked was when it was finally over. I do not want to say I liked the ending, I did not like it. I just liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. Do not waste your time on this.
