Experienced actors know how to act and have proven this before, but the director, who also wrote and produced this farce, is incompetent on many levels. IT'S OK. it's a low budget, but I know film students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors who can do much, much better. For example, since there were people involved who should know better some of the weapons platforms were totally out of place and never existed in those days. The stunt job was awkward - the story obsolete and mushy. If someone gives you a copy of it, use it for a roller coaster. By the way, I love westerns and I know lots of stuntmen and even went to high school with one of the actors, so I was looking for it to be good.
