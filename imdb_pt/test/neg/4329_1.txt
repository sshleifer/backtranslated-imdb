Imagine watching a slide show where the projector stays on each slide long enough so you can memorize it completely three times. Now imagine that the images on the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes? a small park; and an empty tennis court; a piano Now imagine that the people who are exhibiting the slide show are having a frustratingly slow and semi-lucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides that are showing to you. Great ?? you just imagined the whole of the movie 'India Song'. <br /> <br /> The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little more than simply shout 'Look at me! I'M DEEP !! with such self-importance that the images themselves and the film as a whole are presented not only devoid of depth but devoid of depth. The visuals could easily have been replaced by a series of static images, as described above, since it is so rare that there are people on the screen, and even when they are, people really only move a little more than the furniture. Do they ever talk or interact in any meaningful way? they just stare at each other and occasionally crying. The most energetic moment in the entire first hour of the movie is when three people cross a parking lot in slow motion. In fact, the visuals could easily have been left out, since the story is told completely through the narration. The story is about a woman who hates India because it is hot, and hates people who do not hate India because it is hot (this point is covered several times). It is also about a man who feels he has the right to sleep with the woman mentioned above, since she goes to sleep with whoever asks her, but he can not sleep with her simply because he never asks, and he is very upset about it. Then he looks at her as a single tear runs deep into his cheek. Later, he looks at the bike as a single tear runs down his cheek. In fact, you can not see the single tear running deep in your cheek when he's staring at your bike, but you know it's there anyway, just because it's the kind of movie that it is. <br /> <br /> Better, the narration becomes a background buzz, serving as a perfect complement to the coma-inducing visual. Simply being conscious throughout this movie would require a supreme act of determination. Watching it and actually coming out with a serious and meaningful idea of ​​what was supposed to induce the same type of migraine would try to read long technical papers in the dark. This film is perhaps the largest monument of pseudo-artistic pretension that man will ever know.
