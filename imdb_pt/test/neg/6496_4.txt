Most critics wrote something devastating about the movie Michalkov, but I wanted me to see myself. And, unfortunately, they are right. The film had the biggest budget ever in the history of Russian cinema, two international stars, massive color scenes, apparently shot very close to the Kremlin - but in the end it seems to be a good and sweet nothing. You would not believe that this director previously did masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the story are not convincing, neither Jane nor McCracken nor Andrej. Only General Radlov deserves to be mentioned. It remains on the surface all the time. Politically, it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the Russian, with values ​​such as honor and duty. And having lived at least half a year in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one depicted in the film Michalkovs. Regarding "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director, as a 10-point film, one of the best I've ever seen in my life, I was totally disappointed. Excuse. However, Michalkov's unique talent in delivering unbelievably beautiful images is still there.
