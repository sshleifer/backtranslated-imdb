And believe me, this is an impressive achievement. Take "Jolly Roger: Cutter's Cove Massacre," switch a pirate's killer to a prospector, change his treasured obsession buried into old gold and its vomit-green color to deep blue. You now have the "Miner's Massacre". The problem is that at least "Jolly Roger" was fun enough - albeit in such a bad way - to keep you watching for two whole hours. There is no scene of murder striptease or any bizarre murder. I can not tell you how many times I lost interest in "Miner Massacre" and started to do the dishes or clean the apartment. And the ending is absolutely silly. The 49er guy reappears randomly out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff, while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriff's vehicle, shouting. A truly horrible movie.
