I had gone to the movies hoping to see a great movie based on all the word-of-mouth and great reviews. The minute the opening sequence began, I knew I was in trouble. the music and the credits tried so hard to evoke the emotion that I wanted to vomit. All I got with this movie were clich√©d characters, invented dialogues and a script without emotion. Director / writer Paul Heggis got great reviews with his manipulative and virtuous writing, but he did not fool me. some performance was good. Dom Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is a little over rated, but he was decent. The ridicule was also on the nose. he should keep on rap. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression what ever. I do not find anything interesting about her. Sandra Bullock is always the same in every movie, she's fine. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching him work. Ryan Philippe was good too. but as for the script and the bad direction, this is actually one of those movies that is so annoyingly bad that I really took the time to write about it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, what a waste of time.
