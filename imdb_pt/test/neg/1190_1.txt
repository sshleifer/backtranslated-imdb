It became apparent in the first 25 minutes of seeing this that the writers really wanted to make a feature film and probably they certainly liked the whole process but then seemed to forget the fact that it needed a decent plot! If the best they could do was to have 3 of the duller characters come into the real world and have "all kinds of fun capers", then they should have gone out on their own! I did not laugh once, and all that "Adventures of Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" thing in the middle was very, very bad! Convalued, invented and very loose. It sounded like a whistle-stop tour for anything they thought "could" work just to drag her to a resort. Full of holes - Royston Vasey's characters needed the writers to continue writing in order to save them, yet Jeff managed to enroll in the sub-story / time-filling of William and Mary and it was. If he could do that, why would not they keep writing Royston - duh ?? What about Herr Lipp's audition? What was that for? I mean, what was the point? He did it, and we did not hear anything else about it? <br /> <br /> My main point is that even though I loved the series, it was a poorly thought out, seemingly rushed project. Putting it this way, the plot was so poor that if we did not already know the characters (and as a fan I had a certain loyalty to keep watching), and we depended only on the story itself, that would have fallen flat on his face! At best, I would have gone straight to the video and, at worst, it would never have been done in the first place! Or maybe this must be the other way around? Truly terrible ....
