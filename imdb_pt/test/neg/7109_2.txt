Being a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I was very eager to see this "documentary". I was also sucked into reading the critique after the criticism of the national critics. That should have given me the hint. <br /> <br /> The film is simply annoying and obviously extremely overrated. You do not even see Dietrich. She is heard in the background, discussing her films and this video. She does almost nothing but complain about everything. What a bummer! <br /> <br /> Filmmaker Maximilian Schell constantly complains and begs her to be on camera ..... all to no avail. She just refuses to cooperate. After a while, this kind of thing gets really tiring. With your attitude, why would Schell continue with this project? He should have just told prima donna to "dig in". <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you read, do not waste your time on this.
