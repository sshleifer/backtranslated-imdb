This movie was an uninspired film. It was a moving story that definitely does not make you think of anything other than where all the moving stuff that other reviewers say about the movie is. The 3 main actors are good, and there are some laughs, but again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in the hope that it gets better and it does not happen. I watched this movie last night and wished we had not wasted our precious time (while the baby is sleeping) watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not intend to recommend this to my family and friends, and obviously to anyone who wants to rent it. I was pretty much impressed with everything about this movie.
