I loved this movie when it first came out (but I was only 12 years old - and I had forgotten that this movie existed until one day I found a copy used for sale at a gas station. I could wait to watch this movie that I loved as a child, and then, when I saw this movie again many years later, it hit me ... Why, in the world, I liked this movie as a child, watching again as an adult I realized that this movie is terrible. The saddest part of this movie is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western of all time and they spoiled it !!! The costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 scores that the orchestrail score is wonderful, and retains with the classic spirit of the old timey Lone Ranger alive, the second score is a series of country music artest songs like Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and those songs like "The Man in the Mask" are so r uim that they are funny. This movie Strongest point is that he had a brilliant history, and one of the best of the West A little more time, and for a while it's fun to see John Reid recovering from health, after he and his fellow Rangers are ambushed. It's fun to watch him grow into his new life and identity as the Lone Ranger. his identity, and goes on a revenge race to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow guards with whom he walked. But sadly, as good as the plot is, it's all ruined by Merle Haggard Narrating everything as you're watching it happen (for the love of God why did they do this?) Between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers singing cheesy (stupid) songs like "Ride Little Cowboy" being played in the background make this movie impossible to take seriously. I would love to see a really good producer take that same script and story and remake the movie because at the center of this silly movie is a great western. I would say this movie as a beautiful woman in the ugliest outfit. I give it 4 stars out of 10 - if its 12 years old, and do not know better, then you can love it.
