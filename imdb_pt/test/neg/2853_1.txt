I honestly wonder why this movie has already been made. A Bulgarian-Italian co-production set in a version of Berlin, where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with a few Turkish words in the middle, is hardly credible. The vocabulary in English is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. In addition, racial tensions in Germany can be an interesting subject, but in Germany I know that there are no gangs shooting at each other in the middle of the street in broad daylight. And if all this is not enough, there's also a serial killer out there who kills Turkish children and paints them in white. To create some tension, we see the serial killer and we hear him humming Schubert's lullaby, but we do not see his face. <br /> <br /> I can not believe they actually recorded in Germany. There are a few street outlets that are obviously in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in those outlets. It's probably Bulgaria with some German signs added here and there.
