Oh Gawd I want to travel back in time to Monogram Studios and strangle someone in their 2 bedroom front room for this sloppy musical. It's a watt above the flat liner for 60 of your 61 minutes and so it really shows (for a fine minute, spread in thousandths of seconds for all the time) that there's real-life talent being poorly photographed. see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this movie that could easily be energetic and really funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing in sight. The weird plot shows the three-faced drama house wagon Grace Hayes making her way to a college where her rat-sack kid is a rich college clown. She'll fix her playboy ways, no matter what. Your Real-Life Son (Strange) Peter Hays plays his son on the screen. His real-life wife plays her secretary. Talk about nepotism. I suspect that this bundle of talents was almost the reason for Monogram funding this back-lot musical produced by the extraordinary Sam Katzman. As with other Monogram musicals, it seems one more reason to film recent new acquisitions of furniture and lamps to show other studios that Monogram Pictures is "lavish" in their B styles. Have a ghastly look at the SWING PARADE of 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just built this gigantic set of nightclubs and then found an excuse to film actors and musicians everywhere. Story? None. Anyway, the ZIS BOOM BAH is more BAH than BOOM. Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them? Probably standing at the gate of PRC Pictures wondering if it seemed safe to get in there. The heptter Jive Roland Dupree brings the rapper to life by playing his teenage legs around two faltering dance numbers, especially at the end of the 'grand show', set in the new, expanded malt store / club set. The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging from the back wall, and the scene of blended curtains also has a dark main cloth that is drawn back and forth as each amateur sequence passes through the previous one. The chorus girls and their very simple-looking partners at the end look like Monogram's office staff borrowed (from the typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. They have absolutely no dancing talent and are so common on the screen ... ALL the girls look like they're all called Joyce. There is even a calamity of fantasies where they wear ruffled tights ... on one leg. It's all so horrible and horrible ... and really annoying when one more tweak by all concerned would result in ZIS being really fun. The strangely interesting thing is the delivery of dialogues between Grace and her son-in-law: it's so casually delivered that it actually works despite the script and logic. She has a life very much like the presence, which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly convincing. The Dupree boy is the real star. He can actually do something ... even though he looks like a teenager with tap dancing. You read that right.
