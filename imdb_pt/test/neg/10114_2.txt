It's a shame. There's an interesting idea here, but it gets completely lost in a mess of Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad stories. The plot, as it is, concerns a soul-bounty hunter. It must be a rather straightforward type of story, but the director and / or writer seem to have forgotten what the movie should be when they were around three days of filming. Things are not helped by the fact that the main villain seems to be wearing an inexpensive Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with the flowing colors of the CG. Not much to recommend here, even the title seems to propel you into obscurity.
