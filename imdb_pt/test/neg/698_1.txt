I really like this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. While about 25% of my audience came and went during the screening (or totally left), I was stupid enough to stay out. The main problems with this story (there were many to list all) is that with this type of movie you have to do two things ... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they take you twenty minutes in the movie that is gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you really care if you get to it on time or not. I not only lost track of the girl, but I had a little view of her that she was just a blurry face and when I remembered that she was part of the story I did not really care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in a type of LSD flashback, they often made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals do not make up for the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example). do you know or care about what was happening to the women kneeling in that field and looking at the sky? Ridiculous.
