Detective Sergio Vince De Carlo (James Luisi) and the company are in the case of a serial killer / vicious rapist. Can psychologist Carol (Susan Sullivan) help or will she become the killer's next victim? And what about the hilarious White Dude Afro of the killer? Inspired by Ted Bundy's serial killer, "Killer's Delight," also known as "The Dark Ride," is a tale of the Serial Killer series of 1978 that does not offer much. At most, it is more a police procedural film than a horror film, since much of the violence occurs off camera. Of course, we have mutilated bodies, but we can not do much in the exploration department - especially considering that they are from the aftermath, not during the crime. Those who wait for things like "The Toolbox Murders" or "Maniac" will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, there is an awesome scene involving a woman trying to escape the murderer who has the right tone, and is quite suspenseful to boot. In addition, John Karlen is quite effective as the killer, despite his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with Afros always worth a laugh) is more than a little disturbing. "The Dark Ride" is very routine and mediocre to actually guarantee a recommendation as it does not have the proper scanning elements, and is dated even by weather patterns. Those looking for a better example should probably turn to "Do not Go In The House" and a few others, instead, since that is not enough.
