This film has the appearance of many directors "Fresh" (close-ups and focus on the emotions experienced by the actors). The film's point was presented from many angles and well expressed by the relatively inexperienced cast. The point is "Have faith in Jesus Christ and the Morman Church" Oh, and if you read or hear anything contrary to the Prophet's teachings, it is only Haterade. (Fuel for hatred)
