This is just one more of those "American meets romance with charming foreigner in exotic European place". This genre has been cinematographically bankrupt since the 1950s, but they continue to produce them. I let my girlfriend convince me to see this - a bad idea, we both hate it. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try watching "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a marginally better movie. <br /> <br /> This type of film is very similar to Hallmark Greeting-ish.
