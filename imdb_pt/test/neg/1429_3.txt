Estrangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider, Amal Rhoe. Disturbing scenes of torture "highlight" this disgusting and disgusting movie about a sadistic psychopath who lures teenagers into his torture chamber over the Internet. Snider (former 80s rock band Twisted Sister) plays the putrid psychopath, who is a dirty twist (no pun intended) in Hannibal Lecter. Penalty is wasted as one of the mothers of the victims. Harrelson (Woody's brother) offers one of the worst cop performances I've ever seen in a movie, and Rhoe proves why this is his only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is numbing, the torture scenes are very graphic and rude, and the ending sucks. CLASSIFICATION: 3 of 10. Punctuation: R for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
