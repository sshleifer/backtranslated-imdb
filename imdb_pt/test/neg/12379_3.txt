The monstrous, largely forgettable, 1950s film features truly terrible special effects - the "claw" in question is a giant puppet that would make Jim Henson want to kill himself. I just saw the movie last Thursday and I can not tell who was in it. That's a bad sign. I knew that when the movie debuted the audience, it laughed at the screen ... and that was in the 50's, when the patterns in special effects were much lower. Basically, I should have left the theater as soon as the words "produced by Sam Katzman" appeared on the screen if I knew what was good for me, but then I came across "Harum Scarum" too, so I guess I deserve it.
