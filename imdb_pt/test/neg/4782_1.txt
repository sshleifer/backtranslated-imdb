God! Where do I start? From beginning to end, I could not help but hate this movie. Came? Vines that make cell phone noise?! Ah yes, I am so afraid - I will rid the weeds of the earth! Come on guys! When the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and waved weapons in front of their faces, do not worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take it Photos! This whole scene really made me wonder why she did not take pictures of her boyfriend, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), cutting off Mathias's (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots threw the rope for the first time after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how she finally managed to stay about two or three feet off the ground. I can not begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie, there is so much to cover. I'll say the graphics, as far as blood was fantastic, but it did not work out, since the acting and the script were so terribly bad.
