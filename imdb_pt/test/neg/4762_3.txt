If you suffer from insomnia, then Radiant would be the best way to send you to a 7-year-old coma. The film is so absurdly overblown and mundane that it is hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could ignore this obvious stupidity. <br /> <br /> The story has an exiled doctor (who we can never see) move to the desert. create a vaccine that will cure all diseases, filling the hosts with antibodies capable of fighting any infection (yes, like that episode of Futurama). Vaccines do not work and human guinea pigs are infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. <br /> <br /> Not wanting to get caught by government guys in masks, the group goes into the desert to hide, waiting for sunlight to kill the virus. All this is narrated by Michael, the only one of the quartet immune to infection. And it is the most annoying narration of all. They might have someone with an interesting voice, but instead we get someone with less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the publisher insists on reducing fade by more than half of the film, giving it a strange dreamy feeling and increasing the public's desire to go to sleep. Not surprisingly half the audience gave up on this, I was not one of them for some reason. But I should have done okay. <br /> <br /> The ending must be shocking, intelligent and prescient. But of course and simply not. A relief yes, but not dramatic at all. <br /> <br /> The low cost of this production and the muffled sound that makes many of the dialogues unintelligible, could have been an interesting science fiction story if it had better actors, colder places and a sense of urgency. As it is, Radiant is a snoozefest.
