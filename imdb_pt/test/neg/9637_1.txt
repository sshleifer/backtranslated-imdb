After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself disappointed in Hollywood for doing such a thing. Gone are the glory days of the 1940s films that made someone proud to be an American, fighting the evil he wants to conquer abroad and death at home. What we have is dribble foam in the mouth of the rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men coming home after the war. One descends into uncontrolled madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts her country in a time of war and destroys her best friends relationship with her fianc√© at the same time. The third is truly the hero of the story, choosing to continue the fight that was brought to our backs almost eight years ago. What makes this movie bad is not acting but the premise behind it. We are led to believe that decorated soldiers are indeed enemies of our country. Desertion is similar to betrayal in times of war, and the main protagonist flirts with her throughout the film. This paradox is designed to weaken the public's reaction to the central act of the film. We should not find fault with King, since he wears medals, but his actions do not just deserve this, but they cry out for it. He is not an anti-hero. To accept the film, the public must accept the correction of desertion, because the story paints King as nothing less than a hero. I can not accept this, since it's like asking me to call the yellow sky on a light blue day. In addition, the derision of the royal hero is heaped up, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country. I would only recommend this stench to someone who needs to convince of the decadence of Hollywood, as is a clear example of this. No wonder he did badly at the box office.
