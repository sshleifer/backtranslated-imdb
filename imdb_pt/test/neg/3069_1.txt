I'm great at acting, writing and directing, but I'm not famous yet. My friends and I often rented bad movies, just for fun and good laughs, but when we went to the local Family Video and found a movie called Biker Zombies From Detroit, we knew it was the worst movie of all time and it was! Biker Zombies From Detroit has no script! They may say they have one, but they are liars! There was a 4-minute scene of only two guys talking about women and sexuality, and you could say it was improvised. And if they will improvise, it should be at least decent, but it was not, and you could tell by the two actors spoiling lines and saying things that do not even make sense. <br /> To give you an idea of ​​how terrible and retarded this movie is, here's the beginning: a girl throws a guy off, he punches her face and hits her, then rapes her. Then we see zombies that attack and they both turn into zombies. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie! Not to mention the main zombie voice that performs the entire movie, trying to be sinister and thought-provoking, but sounding like Marylin Manson having a perfect fit. Worst movie of all time. Bottom line, guys. But watch if you like movies without script, no plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music and more than 100,000 words used in the film. <br /> <br /> If this can get to the rental companies, my future films will win the Oscar.
