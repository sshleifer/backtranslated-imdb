Just do a little research on the making of this movie. Something as simple as a Google search. It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the elections. It's a great idea, but I'd rather see a DOCUMENTARY, not something edited by the Bush Administration and told its reality. The timing of the film's release, its tone and the fact that MS & L promoted it, raised questions about the film's intent. "According to MS & L managing director Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues also deliver targeted messages about the war in Iraq to specific groups," wrote Eartha Melzer. "Is the media center hiring in one of these constituencies? Is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to advertise the US population? No one involved with the film is willing to say who first raised the money for the movie or how they ended up being represented by the Army's public relations firm. "
