I am a historian. This movie is so wrong that it hurts. I tried to watch with an open mind, but if you go deep into a movie or anything of that nature, at least do some homework about the history, venues, church protocol, et cetera. Stop playing for the stupid audience, please. There are those of us out there who actually put on our shoes and venture into the theater when something like that, worthy of a theatrical version, comes to town. A little research, all I'm asking. But again, the book is based on a joke itself. So basically they caught a romance with many mistakes and decided to turn it into script, pouring millions, millions and millions of dollars into it and making an incredibly promoted distributed theatrical release, and at no time have time to do a little research on that. Do I know several of my colleagues who would have done this just for credit or at least given to a group of students as a chore for several weeks to research various aspects ?? or just pay someone a couple of dollars just to get through it, because believe me, there are many hungry historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if they had.
