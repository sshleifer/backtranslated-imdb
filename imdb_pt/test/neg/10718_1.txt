I would give a zero if they had that rating. The fun was not fun at all. I got tired of the movie for about ten minutes, but I held on to the end thinking I had to improve - it did not happen. The others who watched this movie also agreed. The acting was irritating. I'm tired of Jim Carey over the top ham working. The support cast was no better. Although this movie has been a statement of corporate greed and the suffering of the worker who is stepped on when a large company lags behind, the vehicle for this would have been better served otherwise. I really did not like the main characters so much (Dick and Jane) that their antics were never funny, but pathetic. I'm trying to remember a scene where I or someone I was laughing with and I can not. A worthless movie and a total waste of time.
