I can not believe this show was well-ed. First, J.P. Manoux does a horrible job for David Spade and Pacha's voice is very deep in comparison to John Goodman's. The theme song is so boring and the plot of the episodes are so stupid !!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain as the voices of Yzma and Kronk. This show is a waste of money and a waste of your time. Half the episodes are copied from the movie. In my opinion, The Emperor's New Groove was one of the best movies for kids in years, but they ended up ruining it by doing Kronk's New Groove and this show. You should watch shows like Spongebob, Faird Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible, but not this show.
