Fans of Rutger Hower DO NOT TURN OFF - he plays only one tip in this movie and that's it. This movie misses an extra point for this hit. I think Rutger Hower has a total of 2 very short scenes and 2 very short stories. <br /> <br /> The female lead for this movie is way above that poor material in looks and talent - she's great, this movie is a dog and she's lost in it. The story is of a lawyer waiting for this partnership one day in the company being fooled into having to carry the boss's niece across the country. They have several road encounters with various eccentrics and this is the vehicle for a variety of skits and the guy who played Napoleon Dynamite is thrown into the mix as a side character for good measure. <br /> <br /> A road trip in which extreme circumstances test our repressed hero and he slowly ends up loosing a little at the end of the movie, ah is not grand love, yadda yadda .. <br /> < > Just watch this movie if you want to see a hottie get bored with an idiot in a truck for an hour and a half.
