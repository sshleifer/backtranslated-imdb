Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid realizes the trash is gone again ... there must be someone stealing it from the curb. He goes out on skates after the garbage truck. When he finally arrives at the dump, he is surprised to learn that not only "other people's garbage" has also been stolen, but that there is a secret organization lying in the landfill. He's determined to beat the world's nasty naps, it seems. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster visit the police station and a Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, because Joan is also missing. Will they make their way through your problems? This is just a stupid and stupid movie, with the culprit being the terrible script. The books of Allard and Marshall are hysterical and only a few situations of the books end in this film. Arnold is really cool, since Mr. Stupid and the other cast members try very, very hard to make the movie work. Production figures are very high, with the dog and cat belonging to the Stupids adding a little force to the film. But, it's all for nothing, as the plot is wandering and weak. Maybe someday someone will make another attempt to translate Allard's fun books onto the big screen. So if you like to laugh, rent something else while you wait for a new production, and by all means go fetch the books too. But, stay away from being stupid, as anyone who watches this movie until the end could hardly be called smart.
