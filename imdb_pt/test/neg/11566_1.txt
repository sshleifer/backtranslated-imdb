Actually, it was awful. The topless main girl was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. It was filmed in some warehouse probably owned by family or friends. They also chose not to bother to invent a story. Of course these are ways to cut costs, but are smart ways to keep costs down? No they are not. At the very least, they could have found a high school student on a "creative writing" course. These children can have at least a lesson in the structure of the story. At the very least, they could have read about the three-act structure, but acting obviously was not a priority either. Watching these idiots running into funny clothes that were stupid by the 1980s was embarrassing. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably proof of the limited distribution that this film received. If the actors had actually seen the end result of their hard work, there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 10/10 stars, but it only deserves 1 by being released at all. This film should be screened to film students everywhere. It's better than 90% of the student films I've seen and wow is that movie a piece of shiiiit.
