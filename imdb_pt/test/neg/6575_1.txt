That was so bad that I can not even review it. So I'll write a few sentences about what I witnessed, and you decide. Captain Kirk, with tubby wig and gut, is climbing Yosemite's El Capitan. Spock finds him halfway to a floating hovercraft that looks like a skateboard. Kirk falls. Spock flies down, picks him up before Kirk reaches the head floor. <br /> <br /> Later that night, Spock, Kirk, and McCoy are eating beans around a campfire. Spock likes the beans. So Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" and they want Spock to join the triple harmony. Spock does not want to sing. And later that night, he disagrees. "But life is but a dream, Captain." Should I continue? <br /> <br /> Okay ... A renegade Vulcan, who is Spock's half-brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - holding hostages. The company's crew land on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two hundred pounds, lures the natives with bare legs. But they can not deceive the brother, who claims that he can find God. <br /> <br /> He kidnaps the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a great bearded appearance, claiming to be God, spits fire at Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's brother, realizing that he is not God - but is really a form of himself - or something like that - joins the apparition to destroy it and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> So, after things too complicated to explain involving Klingons who resemble Lorenzo Lamas ... <br /> <br /> The Three Friends - Kirk, Spock, and McCoy - return to Yosemite ( did I mention, Kirk was wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing some kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll.
