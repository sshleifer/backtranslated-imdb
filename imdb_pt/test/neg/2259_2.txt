This movie was NOTHING like the book. I think the screenwriter must have wanted the paper to write the sequel to And the Wind Took and have been turned down. That was his way of getting his ideas anyway. The only similarity between this film and the story it was portraying were the names of the main characters and the location of the main action. None of the events shown in the movie happened that way in the book. For a fan Gone with the Wind (both the book and the movie), this was deeply disappointing. If you love the book Scarlett, do not watch this movie in the hope of seeing it on screen. They only share the title in common.
