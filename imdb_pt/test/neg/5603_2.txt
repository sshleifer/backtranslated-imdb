Pretty. <br /> <br /> Beautiful actresses and actors. Very bad script. Quite frequent "let's undress for our underwear" scenes. Very fair F / X. Very shocking location decisions (the college dorm looks like a high quality hotel room - probably because it was filmed in a hotel). Very mild plot. Dialogue very terrible. Beautiful locations. Very annoying editing, unless you like the flash-cut style of the video clip. <br /> <br /> This is not a guilty pleasure - this is more embarrassing. If you need to watch it, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound of the movie - you'll see the beautiful people in their black panties and you'll probably follow the story very well. <br /> <br /> The cast may be able to act - I doubt anyone can look skillful, given the lines / plots they had to deal with.
