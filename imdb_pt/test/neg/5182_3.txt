After a while, I realized it was just my IQ falling slowly. Frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one, and I mean anyone, is trying. I rooted for the idiot hero to die inside that dump (how did he fit in there, anyway?), Traci Lords, the queen of the B movies, was horribly bland and ripped me and my friends off by not showing their breasts one once. The "characters," though I use this term loosely, are such exaggerated, one-dimensional people who might as well have used cardboard cutouts. The "jokes" (I use this term loosely too) are simply hilarious. The fart of a guy causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" receives an acupuncture from Traci Lords. Oh God, I can not breathe! The blind man uses the word F repeatedly! This is awesome !!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want about acting, but I thought Adam Grimes did a good job playing a mentally challenged snowboarder. Also, the only source of entertainment value here is breasts. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the film, scattered for maybe five minutes of screen time. It's five minutes worth watching 83 minutes of bland trash. Do not watch this. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that useless movie! (R # 26)
