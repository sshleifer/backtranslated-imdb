Interesting concept that just does not do that. I watched the entire movie, but I had to read the comments of the IMDb to find out what Code 46 meant. If / when it was explained in the film, I must have been in a coma, or possibly brain-dead by then. I just watched Tim Robbins. The fact that I did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip. We all have to start somewhere, but this movie should not be that. As for the 'anti empathy virus virus' - Holy Utility Belt, Batman! Where were the Joker, the Riddler, etc? Besides, why are women so ugly? If I want to see dolls less than simple, I'll walk down the street. The best part of the movie was the car accident. It was totally believable and not overdone like most movie flaws.
