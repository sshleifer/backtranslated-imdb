I've always loved bad creations, rhetorical critiques and my film teacher validated this for me in college. This is not as bad as Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing in the bottom of the lunchbox than this mistake. This movie The Fantastic Four, complete with Doctor Doom, who has no idea why he is overly tapering his fingers, is at the top of the list of colossal errors. Doom Dialogue "Kill it ... Let it go!" is classic as it is impressive in its joy. The editing is good, and the director of photography is not kinda bad ... those are the positives. I can not, however, subject all my friends to watch in their entirety, but if I can take the chance, I'll show them the "Jonny and Sue can come into space with us!" The scene that I make. I also include the final scene scene where Redd Richards in his FF outfit for some reason, next to his bride Sue in her wedding dress, get into the limo ... the reward is the arm sticking in the farewell as they depart . Most people are totally disbelieving that something like this exists.
