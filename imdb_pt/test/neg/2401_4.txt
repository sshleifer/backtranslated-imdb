When the American film industry tries to critically analyze its own government, it makes sure that it looks good even when it's bad. <br /> <br /> The film does the right thing, it shows perfectly what is wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be f ** k with who it takes to get things done! Mix an American congressman, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab ... just to fuck the Russians. Thank you to the US for giving us Osama Bin Laden. The disappointment of the film comes in the face of confusing the issues: using images of unarmed Afghan children and stories of Soviet atrocities and then making a blatant attempt to suggest a link between these and the rationale behind American aid. Every sensible person knows why the $ 1 million was raised ... and not the Afghan children who are dying for sure. <br /> <br /> As usual, serious issues are covered by the facade of nonsense dialogue. "Here's to you, your" Hoffmam chants at the end, all that's missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military solutes. The films can not fail to leave the taste of the sense of American pride and joy in how we (the Americans) save the world ... one more time. Not even the last 5 minutes of the movie can save him, where an attempt is being made to stop complimenting himself and waking up to the fact that he is just another American fuck. <br /> <br /> The acting and editing was good though.
