When my girlfriend and I went to see this movie, we did not know what to expect, but she assured me she had good reviews. So I went along with it. We entered the cinema and bought tickets and entered the screen. After a while, waiting for the movie to begin, no one else came in through the door. I was very suspicious, since you usually get at least two more people in any movie. The movie eventually started and we sat there. After a time of very little dialogue and very "arty" kind moody scenes I was beginning to realize why we were the only people there. It was disjointed with random cuts from the main story to the kids in a skate park, the story is self-does not make sense. The boy should have committed a crime when he did not and if he did, writing a letter to anyone is not an answer and you should not feel guilty just because you wrote this letter, he should have been punished. There was no point for this movie at all. I have no idea why we were not and got our money back part way through the movie. I tried to take a chance, I guess. There was little concept for this movie, and the execution was shameful. The writer and director and almost everyone else who made this movie should have realized what they were doing and stopped. It 's another hour I will never come back. I'm sorry for anyone who has enjoyed this movie, but ... it's so horrible, I mean really bad. Well, at least I never have to be subjected to it again.
