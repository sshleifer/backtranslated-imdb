I think my biggest mistake was watching this remake of '95 'Piranha' back-to-back with the original '78 from Joe Dante. I did the same last week with "The Omen". Interestingly, watching the remake right after the 1976 original, really made me quite appreciate the 2006 version for several reasons. <br /> <br /> But this approach backfired on the Piranha version of '95. This reinforced the fact that it is actually a smaller image. Basically, the 95 version is more or less exactly the same film, because it tells the same story and follows it practically scene the scene (only the character of Barabara Steele and the military intervention were written from him). But the cinematography was not so good. The acting was worse too. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing the character of Heather Menzies) showed me again what horrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (from the 78 version) had his way of acting from Charlton Heston, which was fun, while in the version of 95, William Katt does a good job at being William Katt. So I did not really care about him. But the entire cast is far inferior and the only event worthy of was to identify James Karen ("Return of the Living Dead", parts 1 and 2) in a special participation. The makeup effects of John Carl Buechler are not as good as those of Rob Bottin. The musical score had some touch, but the score of Pino Donaggio was much more memorable in the original. So all these flaws really shone through having just re-assisted the original as part of this double bill. Since the remake of Scott P. Levy follows Dante's original, I think it's fun enough to sit in, though it lacks the wit of Dante's original. But what really made me not like Levy's version is the fact that a good stock of the first film was reused during the piranhas' attack scenes. I never like it when filmmakers do this (and I'm not talking about using images for flashbacks or other valid reasons). I mean, if you do not have the budget (or imagination) to create newly filmed material, then, for God's sake, do not do a goddamn remake. But Roger Corman produced this remake (cheaper), so I guess I should not be so surprised with the reuse of footage. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch "Piranha", then make sure It's been a while since you've seen the original. You can enjoy this remake a bit more. And, yes, yes, that little stop motion creature from the original is not found in this movie, as you would expect. But what's worse, there is also no female nudity in this (the original had really some nipple shots, and that blonde girl from the opening scene until accidentally pulled her panties a little too far while removing her jeans! Figures like this version of 95 was made for TV.
