This homemade movie is basically outrageously crap, but you have to give it 3/10 to try. The blood is rubbish, but the granny who kills them is pretty funny, and I think the concept is good, and makeup is good for a home movie. However, thank goodness it was only 55 minutes long, and the turnaround at the end is literally Fight Club (as in almost as trash as the movie). Just read this comment, do not watch the movie.
