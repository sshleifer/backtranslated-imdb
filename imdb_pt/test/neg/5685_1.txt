I have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this movie. No plot, very limited action, and what's with the 3rd person comment throughout the movie ???? Instead of running around the planet to film in all these places, they should have spent some money on scripts and actors. What was acting there was bad. That was 90 minutes of my life I will never be able to return. I should charge the director for the cost of renting this movie. For the director and writers of this movie .... please leave now. This movie should have a label on the front telling you to watch out for boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the generation of computers. All right with the generation. This movie should never have a sequel ... ever.
