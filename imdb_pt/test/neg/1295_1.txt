Avoid this movie. If you're expecting "The Poseidon Adventure" (1972), you can experience nothing more than a case of "curves". This film offers nothing more than two extremely long and prolonged hours of complete boredom. <br /> <br /> Cast members act as if they are irritated by the irritation of a tub of water overflowing on a bed. of insignificant petunias. The script is totally unreal, and the movie does not even have the feel of a disaster film. In fact, everything about this movie is bad, except for Tom Courtenay. It is unfortunate that such a good actor has been dragged by a flurry of misrepresentation to appear in such a washout. When this movie was made, the Poseidon must have turned, in his aquatic tomb, into a sea of ​​shame. And Shelley Winters will rise from the dead (straight from Poseidon), to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie. I rate this movie 1 out of 10, but it really deserves a scratch. This movie will make you want to avoid, or turn completely against water. And it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It may even make you want to see "Jaws" (1975), and make friends with a great white.
