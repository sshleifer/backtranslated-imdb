The glorious Edward begins to rise in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop those dirty Swedish drama films and go up the stairs to the department of splatter and gore. Excited with his great expectations for the new kind of movie that he will soon edit, he asks all sorts of questions, about salary, his work space and lunch. Well, not really. Edward is perhaps the exact opposite. Calm down, fagot guy, on top of that, he has glasses on. Except when he's crazy. I think this has created a much more frightening atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed is rightly a Swedish film, but somehow a magical force has found the good actors and turned their lovely Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I think this is one of the specialties an actor needs today. The acting is very difficult, as if it were inflexible, not flexible (well, what did you really expect?). In addition, the film has a techno-themed Interference song, it sounds like your E-Type. Anyway, it just makes the experience of the movie get worse. Since I'm pretty tough against this movie so far, there will usually be a breaking point where I take the level of happiness. But there really is not much to say. The plants look good, but somehow 'Hanz' spelled coffee on it and partially destroyed it. That's how I look at this movie. If the movie ended where Edward is taken to a mental institute and they refurnished the parts from where he goes crazy and kills people, the result would have been much better, but that's just my radical vision. I would also like to see more footage of the movies losing members. <br /> <br /> There are also illogical things to discover in this piece of film. Let's say the actors are really American, living in America, why would they then work on a Swedish movie, like Edward did? And also, that deliveryman, why does not he ever use the doorbell next to him? Instead, he leaves softly knocking on the door. Good old Edward really has good ears to hear all this while editing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie had its moments, it's a shame that there were not so many. But that does not mean I would not recommend it. It's a very cheap movie, go ahead and buy it. It's almost like I see a pattern for the price and the movie. On the other hand; if you like watching dubbed movies getting worse by the second, that can be it. My verdict would then be a solid rock 4.
