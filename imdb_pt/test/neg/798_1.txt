I know a lot of reviews about IMDb are extreme, with publishers praising a movie to the fullest or inarticulately tearing it to shreds. I do not think any of these types of comments are useful, so I do not give that movie the horrible review I'm about to do. The film is science fiction art of the worst kind, dressed as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers attract you by showing what appears to be a cohesive plot, but in fact it is only a small part of a deliberately bewildering series of events that are never properly resolved. I like films that challenge the viewer and I do not need to be fed by a plot, so my complaint against this movie is not that it's too intellectual. No - the movie is just terrible. As the credits roll, you will feel a genuine rage at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's woodwork and on a faltering plot. Avoid.
