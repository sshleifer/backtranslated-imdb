I usually do not review movies that I have not seen in a while, so I'll post them or rent them to give a complete and new view of the movie. In the case of 'A Sound of Thunder', I remembered my vow never to see this movie again, so I'm just in memory. In fact, I did not think about how the film went bad until I read someone else's review and remember the experience I had in 2005 when I actually saw it in the movies. My friend from the movie made me see, although I was not interested, and wow. (Later, I forced him to see 'Wild Instinct 2' in the theater, reminding him that he made me see that crap. So I guess that made us balanced.) I certainly had my share of deep laughter (at the expense of the movie). , of course,) that did not make him happy as he really wanted to see. The time travel / butterfly effect movie had so many bad graphics, the loudest laughs of me were whenever they showed the dinosaur (God, did I love to see that dino and they really were scared of it?) It was hilarious! Ben Kingsley. It's great, Kingsley can remind us how human actors can be: going from 'Gandhi' and 'Schindler's List' to, uh, that. (Even a Meryl Streep can do a 'She-Devil' once in a while, so they're forgiven.) For months, I've done an MST3k with my friend, consistently referencing this movie to any low-income science fiction movie. Kingsley movie. Yes the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or intoxicated in any other way): horrible over-the-top acting, special "special" effects that even the Nintendo64 would change and ridiculous twists. The biggest disappointment was that the Razzies did not even name this movie for any awards.
