I am and have been a serious collector of Christmas-related movies, TV shows, special holidays, etc. for over twenty-five years. Please pay attention to my warning and do not be misled by comments and criticism from the media about this movie. This is not a Muppett movie as we've come to know them, and it's certainly not for kids. The fact that this was produced for a major TV network is / was not surprising considering their level of operation at this time. What's hard for me to believe is that Jim Henson's organization leaned so low to get involved in this Christmas farce. I wish there were reviews for me to read to warn me before wasting my hard-earned money on this play. of trash.
