"The Beautiful Country" is a big disappointment. It does not come to my expectation. Bihn, a tall, muscular man, is the son of an American soldier and a Vietnamese woman during the Vietnam War. We were told that he was treated "less than dust" in Vietnam in the early 1990s, so he traveled to America in search of his American father. Sounds like a material broken heart? Maybe, but showing in this movie. I find myself struggling to connect with Bihn emotionally because the movie is full of cliches and I just do not understand or believe in it. The writing of this film is a total failure. The plot is full of holes. It picks up a few events on a necessary basis trying hard to shake the public's excitement. We're not that stupid and it does not work that way. Let's see what the movie is trying to do. So you do not feel like Bihn's boat trip (yes he was on a boat!) It's hard enough, let's have a storm at night and let the ship shake a little. Not yet touched? Good! Ask a child to suffer the heat, hunger, disease, violence with adults on the boat, hopefully, do the trick to touch the public. Not yet touched? You heartless SOB, come on ... OK, I do not want to give any spoiler of the movie, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> The movie is very long and slow. It never tells us why Bihn was not meeting his mother and father, so far in the movie, when he left to look for his mother and father. What has he done 20 years ago before going to Saigon to find his mother? And guess what? He is lucky and everyone will say where to find the person he is looking for, and he will find someone without a scratch. I really think the Department of Homeland Security should hire the Vietnamese who helped Bihn. The beautiful country? Which? Both Vietnam and America seem like hell to Bihn.
