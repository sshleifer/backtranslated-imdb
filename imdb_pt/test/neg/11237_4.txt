I just got this movie from TCM and I can understand why George Murphy got into politics if that was the best MGM could offer him. It's so slow that trying to make it a real film-noir effort does not come out. He introduced two of my favorite players in Eve Arden (completely wasted) and Dean Stockwell (the best actor in the film), but what really impressed me was that the protagonist Frances Gifford went through about 90 years. minutes (it seemed longer!) without changing the expression on his face - his scene of fainting was comical. John Hodiak played his part, but the script left him and the rest of the cast very ill. I gave 4 stars mainly because of the photography. It would have been in the first half of the program, when dual resources were in progress.
