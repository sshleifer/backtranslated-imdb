Superhero Movie (2008) is the latest in the long list of "parody" movies that I so much despise. I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know it's not horrible enough to put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as much as Hollywood movies, the superhero movie is probably at the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just does poorly. <br /> <br /> Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebrities. There's Drake Bell (Disney Boy Drake and Josh), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and a few others scattered everywhere. Although it has the power to light a 40-watt bulb, the film uses no humor. <br /> <br /> This movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which is dedicated to following Spider-Man's plot, and no joke is funny. I did not laugh or laugh or smile all the time. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie. Do not even think about it. For the love of cinema, just skip this and maybe they will not go out with another. <br /> <br /> ... oh, who am I kidding? They will probably go out with another one in the fall.
