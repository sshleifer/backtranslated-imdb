Somehow I managed to make it all the way through this movie, but I was puzzled by the complete lack of entertainment delivered. My friends and I are fans of the HK movie, but WOW. This movie has it all, and by all I mean everything a movie should not have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters, over-the-top overacting, extravagant special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 two-legged jumps, impossible situations, bland gags and jokes, elementary school premiss, irrational killings, and also Long lead time for material. Add to the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent movie and this film becomes even harder to bear. Quite simply, if you're entertaining the idea of ​​watching this movie ... no.
