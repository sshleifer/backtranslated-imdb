Take some dark and stormy nights, fog from the shore, obsession and doubt, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred, a suspicious disappearance, a shoe in the night silently grinding a shiny cigarette butt, and finally a trembling heroine who is threatened both by her own doubts and by one - but which one? the men around him. Looks like we'll have a good 80 minutes noir. Instead, under the direction of Vincente Minnelli and Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent, it becomes a melodrama of almost two hours, a long menacing anguish amidst the perfectly dressed, hairstyle and dress cast. When you look at the clock in the middle of the movie and, heart pounding, you see that you have another hour to go, you and the movie are likely to have problems. Minnelli, in one of his first non-musical films, does not rely on the approach of the rococo greenhouse as strongly as he was later known to do. Still, what is basically a simple story of greed, murder and obsession is transformed into an endless vehicle of Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn shows us in carefully illuminated close-ups such as showing fear, love, anxiety, vertigo, happiness, doubt, suspicion and terror. Robert Taylor is more or less along the ride. <br /> <br /> Hepburn begins the movie as the pampered Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in pants who helps dad with his inventions. Your housekeeper is determined to marry her. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it is love at first sight. Garroway is the soft, handsome and dynamic inventor of the Garroway Distance Controller, which was vital in the war and has turned it into a millionaire manufacturer that charges a lot. He is an industry captain, as one of his many friends in Washington says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may still be a bit of a jerk, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all the congressmen and judges her husband knows. She learns quickly and eagerly. Both are obviously and happily in love. <br /> <br /> But wait. The cancer is about to chew. Ann realizes she does not know anything about her husband's family. None of your employees or friends seems inclined to talk about them to her. As she slowly learns that Alan's mother died in the old family home in Middleburg while sitting at the piano, or that he has a brother, Michael, who has disappeared, Alan is very quiet ... and sometimes gets furious. He always apologizes. But wait one more time. Did your mother actually play the piano? Did not she really die in bed? Michael was not caught getting money from the family company, and Alan sent him away? All of this plays against the hotel's exquisite suites, the well-appointed cottage in Middleburg, with the horse stable and the elegant seaside farmhouse. Everyone in the movie, except the employees, are dressed with care. There are exclusive cocktails and intimate dinners for twenty. Even in a black-and-white film, Minnelli can not fail to give us dinner tables filled with crystal and porcelain, tasteful and elegant furniture and many dresses. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie, when everything is finally known, when Ann on horseback is pursued by a high mountain trail and extremely well designed by the thug on another horse, when she is threatened to death by gravel and his pursuer finally finds death on horseback, it is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is unable to bring much tension to the film. What could have been in smaller hands a small B movie, instead, the A list is just an exaggerated melodrama, too big for his bones.
