You have to recognize Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He gave us both the most exaggerated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst movie in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with 'It's bad but not the worst ever,' let me explain. <br /> <br /> For over 20 years I've listened to the critics and avoided "Heaven's Gate" - in fact, this was not difficult because you are not bombarded with opportunities to see this movie. So a few days after watching the documentary 'Final Cut: The Making and Making of Heaven's Gate', I stumbled across a used $ 9.99 long version DVD. My advice after 229 minutes is to look for the most negative review ever written about this movie (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing all she can to put one positive inclination over your beloved son's film. Then you'll have an idea of ​​just how much a mess Cimino has made. <br /> <br /> Although virtually everything is wrong with this film, which ultimately knocks down the scale to make it even worse (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its blatant distortion of the story. Although the ranchers' association had sent a group of regulators / gunmen to Johnson County and had a list of specific names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were surrounded and eventually killed by an army of about 50 Texas ranchers and gunmen who had gone to Johnson County to clear "thieves." The citizens of the county then surrounded the regulators who were eventually arrested (or rescued) by the Army. The women did not participate actively in the fighting and, besides Ray and Champion, there were minimal casualties. After all, these were non-robbery harassment and there were no immigrant wagons walking in circles around the regulations camp (the first westerns unlike this was a film making device and not a real Indian tactic). And a few weeks before the regulators arrived, several Johnson County residents were hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, the guardian of a modest farm, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leaders and he even shows Averell living) . for a mature old age). <br /> <br /> There is no sin to make movies bigger than fictional history, if you will play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect unsuspecting audience members who can go though. a movie believing that what they saw really happened. Luckily so few people saw this movie that the damage was minimal. It may be hard to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape guilt anyway with a defense of insanity, the film offers much support. If Cimino was crazy during the production of Heaven's Gate, that would explain many things. But my vote goes to 'lack of talent targeting' instead of insanity. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about the Gate of Paradise. You can actually see on screen where part of the huge budget was; expensive sets - beautiful sequences of epic cameras - artistic dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange choice of cast that actually worked) gives a pleasant and enjoyable performance, although most of her scenes are extremely boring (this tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to be concerned about the characters ). Dialogue is generally solid, though common. <br /> <br /> But do not fall for the crap that this film experiences with the narrative by mixing carefully created moments of character interaction with texturized explosions of community action. This implies that there was a method for Cimino's madness. "Experiments" is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence that Cimino did a storyboard of a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it seems is that he just released his DP for stage action and for an endless selection of color photos - 1.5 million feet of vaguely staged scenes. So he tried (unsuccessfully) to reduce that and fit everything into post-production. <br /> <br /> The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious, as babushka wearing city women (perhaps borrowed from a tour company of 'Fiddler On The Roof') throws countless dynamite sticks at the regulators. Unfortunately, each explosive falls a little below the target and explodes without causing damage. Once you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath'), who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review. So, believe what you've heard about this movie since 1980. It's a sloppy, disconnected, underdoged, historically distorted mess. Worthwhile just as an example of "how not to make a movie" for film historians and as a source of fun for those who know the real history of the West.
