Ok, it was a "risky" move to rent this movie, but I figured I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. That is, next to "Bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" I've ever seen. Bad actors, low quality technical output, shit history and so on. The soundtrack, though, is not bad. That is why I give 2 to the vote and not just 1. And of course cats are a positive surprise. By far the top actors in this movie ..... Do not rent or buy. Stay away from this and hope for this horrible and horrible movie to disappear into some obscure existence and not become a "cult classic." He definitely does not deserve any recognition.
