It seems that people are attracted to shows that show pathetic lives that have no purpose. For me, I give my sincerity to NBC for their terrible efforts to make new television changes by doing free shows. They always seem to find great success, like The Office. When I started to watch, it seemed to me that I could have a great success. But after a few episodes, I really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people exhibited in these poor, shoddy, shoddy areas. And in the end where they show Earl and brother together in bed, it seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people struggling to pay rent and have no concept of what real world of normal people in society are like. I just seem to always be disgusted when I see the filth that the people in this show live. It's like Venice Beach, California, beautiful, but lots of hobos. Believe me, I'm not a rich, middle-class guy, and not a clean freak, a bit sloppy, but it seems to me that the show just can not get out of all the horrible and drunk people out there have a leg . I just wanted them to show a little more class, not all the crap and poverty and trailers and just below the average life, it seems to depress me. For me this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life, what not to be. It also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have, because apparently these two do not have an ounce of intelligence. This is an idiot.
