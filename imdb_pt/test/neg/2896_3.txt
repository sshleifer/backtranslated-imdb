I'm also fond of SF, among other genres, and I particularly like those 60's and 70's films with the premise of "ideas about effects" that produced so many clever and nice stories put on the screen. In short, I completely agree with the scott-886 review of this film. I heard about this movie, and being what I mentioned earlier, a 60's and 70's fan of FC, with a slump in science fiction with a twilight zone touch, I expected a lot, and my expectations increased with ratings classifying the effects of this movie "second best" to "2001 Space Odyssey" by Kubrick. What a scam "Journey to the side of the sun", was plain-looking, complicated, half-boiled-looking movie with special laughable amateur effects (and remember I love movies of that era and despise CGI), and can be fully compared more a The disasters of the 60's SF, like "Marooned", which "Journey" reminded me a lot. The idea behind it all is not so bad, but building the plot of a story from a twin planet to Earth, in which the same world is reversed, asked a master like Kubrick to direct. Needles to say Robert Parish is none of this, so he delivered boring and silly movie, which looked and looked like a TV series matinee of those days. Not worth wasting your time, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
