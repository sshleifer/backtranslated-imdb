In 1993, Sega released a monotonous and dull video game of one of the greatest films of all time. Realizing their mistake quickly, they released a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, harder and better. <br /> <br /> None of them were. Both were slow and boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be Dr. Alan Grant or ... a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant kill all those guys in the army (what are they doing in the game)? And why is a Raptor killing other Raptors? Weird. <br /> <br /> Obviously, not learning from her first mistake, Sega really dropped the ball at the original release and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, slowest and most boring platformers I've ever played.
