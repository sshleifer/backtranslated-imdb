"Eaten Alive" is a lot easier than Ruggero Deodato's "Cannibal Holocaust," but it's also a much sillier film. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally hilarious, but the plot is so stupidly stupid that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience until the end. Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) joins Janet Agren (The Doors of Hell here with an intolerable accent) to scour the jungles of New Guinea for Agren's sister, who has been brainwashed by the leader of a religious cult Ivan Rassimov). Along the way, they are witnesses of animal tortures (sometimes real ones) and some cannibalism made with cheese. As directed by Umberto Lenzi, the film is so exaggerated that it's hard to take seriously, but if you like cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
