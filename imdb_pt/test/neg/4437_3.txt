The best thing I can say about "Quintet" is that it's not as bad as I remembered being on my first show. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean it's good. <br /> <br /> This strange science fiction thriller is not like any other movie I've seen, which I think at least gives the mark of the novelty. But it's a disaster bordering on a movie, and one of the worst Robert Altman ever made. In the special DVD about the creation of "Quintet", it is clear that even Altman did not know what the hell the movie should be. <br /> <br /> It's set in the distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was filmed at the abandoned Montreal Expo '67 site, and I have to admit that this gives the film some interesting elements of production design, even though it looks like it's being filmed in an ice cream mall. Paul Newman, seemingly zoned and utterly disinterested in whatever is happening around him, and Brigitte Fossey, play vagabonds roaming this futuristic city in search of Newman's brother. Soon, Newman is caught up in a deadly quintet game, which all bored inhabitants play for lack of something better to do, and whose rules are never clear to the public. All we know is that the goal of the game is to kill everyone else with whom you are playing and remain the only person alive. This gives these nihilist inhabitants their only emotion, because, as one of them says at one point in a psychological soliloquy, only by being close to death can one enjoy being alive. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, ugly and really uncomfortable to watch because of its relentless sadness. It's almost as if Altman was purposely planning to make a movie that no one would like to watch. There are no characters - surely the actors are out there talking, but none of the lines really mean much and the impressive list of international actors that Altman has assembled for that record was not at all. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance that could be found in a movie like this. But it does, however, establish an atmosphere, even if this atmosphere is pure horror, and it is strangely fascinating how watching a man starving to death would be fascinating. <br /> <br /> Altman really hit a dry spell after almost a decade of great movies. "Quintet" followed closely the atrocities of the atrocious "One Marriage" and was soon followed by "A Perfect Couple", which is not bad, but almost forgettable, the terrible "Health" (which I have never used). seen because it is not available anywhere to see) and the disastrous "Popeye". Thank God he recovered. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
