The film uses random events of historical importance as background and, willingly or not, crosses the lives and timelines of its 3 central characters. For what purpose, can anyone ask? The problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives. <br /> <br /> It starts with a bunch of rich, goalless college kids (and a pair of not-so-so-riches) attracted to the Naxalite movement. Subject, rejection and separation follows. People go their own ways, apparently. Only until the heroine forces herself on them. Not once, but twice. After a break in the 'Movement', the next hurdle for these three is the Emergency imposed on the country by Indira Gandhi. Many political figures wander for no obvious reason. The subframes are very artificial and do not add up to form a logical whole. <br /> <br /> The film tries to impose a false rhythm, but never reaches a true rhythm. Barely coherent at times, there is no ripening and growth anyway in the bows of the 3 former college classmates. Even after being presumably married, committed, established or whatever, they are always eager to simply abandon everything and go to a village to have sex with their former lover or ex-lover. What a fertile imagination the screenwriter has. So many 4 letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that is absolutely abusive! <br /> <br /> Chitrangda Singh has a horrible American accent that she does not try to hide. It's hideous to hear her mouth cliche-ridden dialogue like 'What's up? I do not think you'd come '(this, after the hellish nightmare she just passed) or, at the beginning,' I appreciate your concern, but I can take care of myself. ' Yikes What kind of clown wrote the dialogues for that? She invites her friend to have a cup of 'South India' coffee (no less), wish someone good morning, and then wish good evening to one of the family. Now, what about this ?! <br /> <br /> The countless villagers and tribal uncredited are the best actors. The edit is really erratic with many cuts. Obviously, struggling to make a bold statement, Sudhir Misra got in a lot of trouble.
