Steven Seagal's intention is to be praised, and his acting in this film is equal to that of many of his other if you ignore the fact that he is supposedly portraying a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two items in the plot, which stretched my suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point. <br /> <br /> First, how is a carefully planned variation of an unpleasant germ whose antidote must be so carefully researched and designed by a large laboratory, is cured by drinking tea from a flower that grows high in the mountains ? and that Grandpa's family seems to be about the only people who know anything about it? <br /> <br /> Secondly, and this one actually takes the cake: Having gathered enough of the cure to fix an entire city, would not you wait for the army to land on the helicopter and start carrying flower bags for all the houses in this little town? No, they decide to sprinkle the flowers all over the city and force the sick out and get them together again. Simply foolish, unless, under native belief, the power of the drug somehow depends on the fact that it has gone out and gathered the flowers in itself. <br /> <br /> Add the cardboard nature of the villains and the inadequacy of the title, and You may think that my vote in this movie is really high.
