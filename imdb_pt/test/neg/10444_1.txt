This is one of the worst movies of all time. There is a scene where they should be submerged and they are literally walking ashore and they have added bubbles! The shark is annoying and it's just that big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is awful, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The direction is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in all the films. I love shark movies and this just disappoints. I've seen those studio movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing a bad job. I'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.
