"Do not be greedy" sums up the depth of this film. All the rest of the lie is great budget facade. The film turns to hide the ball annoyingly and revealing a lot. None of the potentially interesting tangents of the plot is developed, even though the trivial ones are truncated and replaced in excess. DD charm, as others have pointed out, was in the device of schizophrenia, humor interspersed in the fabric of the film, and more importantly, acting. There is enough wood acting in The Box to attract a giant mound of Martian termites. The biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this confusion is the blatant question: "Why should a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do some testing?" A terrible failure of a film.
