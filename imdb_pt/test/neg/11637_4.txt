Do I like science fiction as much as the next man? but what the hell was that? Apparently filmed in just three days using the excess inventory of films left over from his previous film, 'Nana (1926),' Jean Renoir's Short is a bewildering futuristic satire, produced on a budget that could not have been much more than zero . In the year 2028, after a great war, Africa became the most civilized region on Earth, and what was once Europe was termed "Terres Inconnues." An African explorer? played by Johnny Huggins, a black man dressed as a white man dressed as a black man, if you follow me ?? travels to the ruins of Paris in his spherical aircraft and lands outside a Parisian savage (Catherine Hessling, then wife of the director) and his companion primate, perhaps the scariest monkey-man outfit I have ever seen. The savage, as part of some bizarre ritual of sexual initiation, begins to show the explorer the Charleston dance, which he has the pleasure of learning alone. <br /> <br /> It does not help the film that Hessling, which was wonderful, the following year in Renoir's The Little Match Girl (1928), "is not much of a dancer, although the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony. Besides, am I very shocked that Renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object? It's no surprise to hear of the divorce just three years later! On the plus side, I liked the general concept of science fiction behind the movie, and the malicious twist of reversing the usually typical racial roles of such stories. However, why Renoir decided to dress his Black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all time. Bobo, raw and senseless, 'Charleston Parade (1927)' is a cinematic oddity of one of the most respected movie directors, and it may be an effort he would like to forget. The DVD version came without a musical soundtrack, but I compromised on a selection of Dmitri Shostakovich's pieces.
