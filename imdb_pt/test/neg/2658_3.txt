So much chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time the story about their relationship began to gain strength, the script was cut and dealt with some irrelevant sub-storyline that did nothing to advance the story. In fact, the subplots had nothing to do with the story. They were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie. Writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously did not trust themselves to write compellingly about relationships and the inner life of their characters. They seemed uncomfortable unless they played some battles with guns and barriers. Or maybe they did not trust the public to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how "boring" Casablanca was. Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and the Dutch had developed further and was allowed, writers would know how to close the story. This film is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances, but could have done more with a better script.
