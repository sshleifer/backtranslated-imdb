This 1988 film was recently screened on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie, which was supposed to be starting, but because a mix, Rent-a-Cop, was shown at that time. Never having seen it when it was released commercially, we had a chance on it. Bad decision. <br /> <br /> One can imagine what led the people behind the image to follow with Rent-a-Cop, or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. It looks like this movie has failed a lot. This movie does not add anything new to its genre. It is totally predictable, once the basic premise is shown, we know how this will end. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor could do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or maybe the direction given to him by Jerry London, had the opposite effect. Reynolds has an expression throughout the film. It just does not record any emotion. <br /> <br /> Lisa Minnelli, like the prostitute who witnessed the original massacre at the Chicago hotel, makes no sense at all. The romance between her Della and Church seems false from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this turkey.
