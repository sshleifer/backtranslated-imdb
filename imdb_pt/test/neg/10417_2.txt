I like Steve Buscemi. I really like his work, both as an actor and a director. You could say that I am - Steve Buscemi. An aberration of Steve Buscemi. I lurv Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember when I first saw Buscemi's directorial debut, "Trees Lounge." I liked the movie, although it was not as good as it could have been. It was almost there. He almost scratched that itch, the itch of wanting to see "small" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" cities. It was close enough to where I would say it was a very good movie - one that with some tweaking could have been great. But it's alright. I like the movie and watched it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about the Trees Lounge. It's about Lonesome Jim. When I saw the movie's description and then saw who the movie was, I was excited at the prospect of finally seeing the movie that I knew the Trees Lounge could have been. But what I really experienced was no different from leaving one of those small-town bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap cockroach, returning to his flat with a soft brain full of exciting perspectives that inevitably disintegrate into the reality of impotence induced by alcohol and regurgitation in the head. In other words, this film made me embarrassed and remorseful and sorry for wasting the time and money I took to get to that state - the cinematic equivalent. to wake up next to that cheap cockroach the next morning, or if you're the jerk, wake up next to that stupid stinking fart and not shaved. The film had all the substance of an old white bread sandwich (with white bread from the store brand, not less) and the thrill of a corpse. I'm not sure what the purpose of this film was, and how it should have some kind of objective and it was not an abstract surrealism exercise that can go without one, so that lack of a point is a sin of omission. Sorta like those new cars that no longer come with ashtrays, although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). Overall, it was a boring movie about boring people doing boring things and did not have the courage and credibility they can carry and save that movie. I mean, the Trees Lounge was about boring people who did boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame that on Affleck a lot. Why do people keep throwing these Affleck bugs? They suck the life out of anything they are connected to. One Affleck was in a decent movie (and it was not even the reason the movie was decent), and all of a sudden Affleck's buttocks were sniffing as many movies as they could. And Liv Tyler is not feeling better. Being a rock star's daughter does not necessarily make an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply do not come from the simple script page. People pay to watch movies and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a little charisma - these two failures together do not have the spark of the guy who distributes shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought Steve Buscemi was the kind of guy who would rise above that kind of pablum, but, oh, Steve, you let us down. This movie makes me want to put you in another wooden chopper.
