Yawn, that's my reaction to this movie. I was really hoping this would have been a good modern slasher, but it did not even fall into the category of slashers. Instead, he tries to be something he is not, which is a psychological thriller, and fails so miserably at it. Even the title "Freak" suggests that this may be interesting. Combine this with the cover art of the DVD and you think "OK, maybe I'll try". Not worth the time. <br /> <br /> The story really gets a little interesting with a poor, deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head being chained by his fat mother. She screams at him and probably hits him since in a scene we see her really beating him for no reason. After all this, he decides he has had enough and crushes his face with (I believe) a stone. Today, he is now in a madhouse and is being transferred. On the way, he leaves the van where he is and escapes. Also present the main characters, a little girl and her older sister. They are moving and they take the road. So most of the movie is that they walk around the car talking to each other. But, the crook "Freak" is now on the loose and it's about going in a flurry of grueling murder! (This is me being totally sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can not believe how boring this movie was. The budget was the lowest of all time with absolutely no special effect and dialog box that I could care less about. This is one of those movies where packaging is better than the movie itself. And to compare this with Halloween?! Garbage! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except 3rd), but Halloween is far superior to that. At least with Halloween, we have a great score and some genuinely scary moments. With that, there's virtually no music except a piano here and there, and there's nothing scary about that movie. Maybe this movie would have been better if it had a solid score, because even the worst of the movies is tolerable if the music is good. <br /> <br /> Well, that's just my opinion on the movie. I thought it was just a full waist of time and money. But since the movie has more than 4/10 ratings in the IMDb, there must be people who enjoy this movie. I'm not one of those people. 2/10
