I think Homegrown is a bit unfit for this movie - more like "Plantation Grown" - but it does not have the same touch. My guide described it as a comedy, but the pathetic work of these unfortunate buffoons is not my idea of ​​a laugh. More in the genre of the farsi-based thriller / drama. The characters developed well enough - a cast of stars made it so promising, just a pity that the plot was clearly absurd. Ted Danson made a great appearance, as did Jamie Lee Curtis on his part. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of your car! I think if you absorb it a little earlier, you should be able to sit through this - not to the paranoid types timid weapon though.
