If you saw the grudge, another mediocre ghost movie, then you should know what to expect, worse yet, much worse. This time, instead of being in Japan with all the people who speak English, we are in Spain with all the people who speak English. It's interesting that not even one photo of this movie really looks like Spain and could have been filmed entirely in a studio back. Oh, and a place with swings because there's a good 5 minutes of filming swings with no one in them, oooohhh how scary. <br /> <br /> This is terrible in every way imaginable. The acting of the mother and father of the lameinator does not help at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who performs a decent performance in the film, but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine my own hell seeing this movie. There is a good time in the film, however, when a villain is trying to explain the complicated plot to the character of Anna Paquin and she does not understand any of it and asks a lot of stupid questions and he speaks " You IDIOT, you did not understand anything! " I laughed a lot. Well, I understand that this movie is a piece of crap. 0 stars
