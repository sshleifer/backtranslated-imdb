Being a big fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/) I was hoping to be impressed with another French beach romance with a lot of honesty, realism and humor. The same director, the same actress - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is a big disappointment. It is very slow and talkative, which would be great if the dialogue conveyed insights into the characters, whether significant or original. But it appears as a typical novel alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and envious accusations. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" compared to Pauline. The source material is the standard fare (sexual awakening during beach holidays), but it could have been a decent movie, however, if any of the characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Although there are other flaws with the Rohmer season cycle, most of his later films are definitely farther away than this.
