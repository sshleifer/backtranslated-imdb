I watched this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely awful. It has the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without nudity. The premise was interesting enough, an award winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. The characters were banal, as were the remarks about human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For a movie called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with class differences beyond the first 20 minutes and the foreseeable end. This movie could have done a lot better if there were more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a "who did it?" <br /> <br /> The acting was not fantastic, but it's hard to look convincing with such a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I would like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. It's probably the only reason I watched the whole movie. <br /> <br />
