I just watched an episode (S1- # 5 A Boy in a Shrub), so maybe my review is not very fair. <br /> <br /> But based on this episode, this is a very bad version of CSI, acting sucks. The main character, Dr, whatever her name is, is so fake that it really hurts. I would not send her to make an add for dog food! <br /> <br /> The other painful thing is David Boreanaz's fame of "Angel", a good actor, does a great job, but wasted coz of the stupid performance of that woman. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is OK, but everything is ruined due to this stupid performance of Emily Deschanel. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing CSI version, very sad to see appears in the filmography of some potential talents involved. <br /> <br /> That woman is really bad, at least in that episode. But based on this view, I will not even invest watching, even if it was displayed on the screen of an elevator.
