I'm getting tired of movies that sound fun in a synopsis of a line and end up being the same as what you'd find in the center of a compost pile. Who knows: "Witchery" may have sounded interesting in a tone to the studios, even with a "big name" (such as Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge) and the effervescent tastes by Hildegard Knef (I do not know, some woman ... But in the movie, he just undoes faster than a papier maché sculpture in a storm.It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in a mansion on the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I think) is being targeted for a satanic cult to take the son of hell while the others are killed in grotesque, torturous ways.

And yes, Blair is possessed, as if you had not seen that down the main street, followed by a marching band. <br /> <br /> No star. "Witchcraft" - these witches will itch you.
