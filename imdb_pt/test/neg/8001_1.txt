This movie simply has no redeeming features. The story is incomprehensible and the script is rude, sadistic and stupid. Sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable pursuit of cars. The music is horrible. The performance is largely limited to snarls and smiles. A half dud star. Shame on DirecTV to put it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people may have thrown soda on the screen.
