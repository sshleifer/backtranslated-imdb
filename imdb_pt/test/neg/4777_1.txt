Plants in an ancient Mayan pyramid structure killing all who come near. Yes, it's strange, as travelers do not find out until it all starts to go crazy. And in a movie like that, I just wanted it to be absurd and martial bands were attacked by plants wielding machetes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of people from America travels and heads up into the mountains with a couple of other newly created German friends who know the place. When they get there, the Maya began to scream and hide in the structure. And when there, it is when the plants decide to take them away, imitating the sounds of cell phones, humans and ancient Mayan dead. <br /> <br /> Nothing was really scary about the movie and neither was it fun. Not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap. I kept looking for something really good to happen, but nothing. Oh well. "F"
