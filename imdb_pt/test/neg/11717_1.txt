In completing this hellish piece of junk, a friend and I solemnly vowed never to talk again about how we had just destroyed the last 90 minutes of our lives. This film is completely useless, a two-dimensional hero and heroine that we can not give a damn if they survive or not and some of the most terrible villains to darken the screen of horror (or any other) genre. To further prove how utterly useless this movie was, I would have liked to add a plot synopsis, but I can not write fiction. All and all, the only reason I can think that anyone would want to see this movie is if they had just murdered their entire community and are looking for some self-afflicted punishment that will haunt you for all of the following years!
