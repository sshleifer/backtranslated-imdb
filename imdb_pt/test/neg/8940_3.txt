I would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie recalls Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels' eccentric comedy "Something Wild," in which a rather eccentric free spirit relates to a conservative and very organized young man, and the two pose as a couple and basically your personality gradually has an effect on it. He loses and learns to enjoy his short meeting. That's exactly what happens here except for the eccentric eccentric shoplifter, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) as Melanie Griffith, and super cautious teenager Lincoln (the name is no coincidence, played by Devon Gummersall) by Jeff Daniel. This movie still shares the same twist and abrupt change of genre in which the scary and violent boyfriend suddenly appears at the end and things turn out badly. But here, instead of Ray Liotta rewind to the henchmen of 1950s films, it's Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenager who is in his own little world. He has some kind of fascination with death after his brother's suicide, and his parents have also disconnected quite strangely (the mother is convinced that Christmas will come soon, despite being August). So on a night out with the "guys" (one of whom is played by Jason Hervey of the Miraculous Years) trying to buy beer, he bumps into Alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car (with his permission of course) They take off for a mini-adventure through the deserts of the West Coast, stealing Robin Hood's convenient shops and, of course, indulging in routine self-discovery as each one asks more about the other's life.but, Alex left behind a partner in his trade in theft, and it's not going away easily.While we do not consistently remember it or something like flashback repetition or moving to the point of view of it.At least this was done smartly. > 'Do Me a Favors' (aka Trading Favors), is an underdeveloped story of criminal malaise and self-discovery that stays a bit for the first half of the film but delivers the products a little late, since Alex and Lincoln arrive at your the house in the middle of nowhere. At the moment the filmmakers give him enough encouragement, the film is unfortunately almost over. I would recommend that if this is the kind of story you're in the mood for, and although Rosanna Arquette always gives a good performance (even in a poorly written film), I still recommend picking it up at its best, "Something Wild."
