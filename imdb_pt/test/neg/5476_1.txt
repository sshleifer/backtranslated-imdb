This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell - and he did. Really horrible confusion of improbable / inexplicable coincidences and unidentifiable plot, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get clich√© snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the diminutive and handsome crime boss, who projects an exaggerated "tough guy" and casts a scrap of intimidation on the tough guys who were brought in to work for her. Nothing too surprising to look at in the film, except for a shot, when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest of a complete American set of Tourister) in a brilliant blue sky without explanation or sorry. Otherwise, it is visually standard - another exception is an attractive photo of a beautiful bridge in the CT.
