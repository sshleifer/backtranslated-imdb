The prey has an interesting story, unless you remember the ads for it in the newspapers in June 1984, you may have picked up on the Movie channel in the summer of 85, but little else is remembered. The plot is your basic killer in the woods again. But, ironically, this was filmed before Friday the 13th. The prey was actually filmed in 1978, according to one of the actors in an interview years later. But released for about a week on some drive ins, (yes Jim, Namans drive in showed it in June 84). But you have a dated look at it. Perhaps they have launched later to profit from all the other terrorist films that the market was flooded in 1984. Now in history there is some kind of history behind, a forest fire in the 1940s leaves many gypsies burned. die. But one of your children survives (our monster) so eagerly to this day, it would be in 1978, we have a middle-aged couple camping just to be dispatched by the Monster. The slogan of this photo states that he is NOT HUMAN, and has AX, but an Ax was only used in those first two murders. Now we have a lot of teenagers who look like them in their 20 years of camping. We all know they are the prey, and the monster knocks them down one by one. For an 80-minute film, it seems longer. We also have a lot of wildlife images to fill void for the 80 minutes. Overall, being in a horror movie from the '80s looks like much more of the' 70s than ever. Hey, the prey had the potential to be a good terror killer in the forest movie, but it drops a little .. However, it features a really cool scary monster at the end, and we have to wait until the last 2 minutes to see it. Side note, the monster went on to star in Addams family films in the 1990s.
