The most striking thing about 'anemic cinema' is its title: an anagram that is almost a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English, since in England "anemic" is written differently. <br /> <br /> I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he invented by chance, and which are just direct contact photo prints), his real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that was accepted as art than as porn. But surely that had to happen eventually, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes story. Back in the early 1960s, the second season of 'The Twilight Zone' opened each episode with a spin of concentric spinning circles. in black and white. There is an image in 'Anemic Cinema' which is so similar, I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' borrowed from this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a black and white spiral. In fact, if there ever was a movie that deserves to be described as a spiral, this is the case. Throughout the 'anemic cinema', we are treated (?) With shots of a rotating disc containing words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is dizzying and the texts - on incest and Eskimos - are almost given in their lack of meaning. I laughed at a smart sexual pun. <br /> <br /> The emperor is naked, personal, and this movie barely gets two points out of ten. Au suivant!
