Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than atrocities like "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and these films are terrible. The writer / director / star, Ron Hall, is devoid of charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the basic concepts of direction. Possibly the worst camera work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography I've ever seen in a movie. Rarely two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-weak illumination. Terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by an extremely untalented cast, extending the movie to almost 87 minutes. This is a truly ridiculous embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, aficionados of a terrible film production will want to see this, but it is very difficult not to know how experienced a bad movie viewer is. The fact that Ron Hall thinks this was really liberating is surprising. If you're a film director, and you really do think the opening credits for the film include a few frames of the SLUG words before the title appears, to the left of your approximate edition - and you apparently can not muster the energy to edit those pictures - then their standards are obviously so low as to be insulting. I am surprised that Lions Gate / Maple has agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite the brief involvement of Rudy Ray Moore, this film is a work of supreme self-indulgence on the part of Ron Hall - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor, and must also believe that he has superior writing and directing skills - but the film is so incredibly inept that it's hard to believe he really wants people to see him in fear of being brutally bullied like I'm doing now. A jaw-dropping movie and insanely terrible. I'm not kidding.
