The movie began o.k. Some vacationers in Mexico decide they should go for a walk. They discover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple as a fortress. Furious villagers appear and try to stop them from climbing, but because of the language barrier, people are shot and tourists come up with the stupid thing. It turns out that plants are evil-blooded things that the villagers will not approach, so they guard the temple so that tourists can not get out. There are a couple of scares in this movie, but nothing makes sense. I mean, they are PLANTS! Do not worry about buying or renting the d.v.d. Wait until it comes out on the cable.
