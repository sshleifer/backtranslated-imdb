This movie does not have everything. Except Bobby Deol, who in his own standards is mediocre, no one in this movie even came close to acting in a single scene. Kangana is completely false in her acting. <br /> <br /> The great Anupam Kher has a special turnout and is better in those 2 minutes than Bobby in the entire movie. The music does not complement the film as well. The contrast in Music between Bobby and Upen is not very prominent. Great concept was completely wrong. The movie does not have an adequate ending. Please do not waste your time as I did in this movie
