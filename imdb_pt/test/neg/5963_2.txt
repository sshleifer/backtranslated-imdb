Boyle Heights, Los Angeles: The legendary South American vampire-sucking vampire, El Chupacabra, is on the loose, feeding on anyone who is lucky enough to cross his path. Animal control officer Navarro (Eric Alegria) and Star Wars expert Chupacabra (Elina Madison) try to track down the creature, but find their progress hampered by a pair of idiot cops, locals eager to capture the beast for a fat reward . and a pair of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments. <br /> <br /> Stinky more than a two-week taco, El Chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies can struggle to sit on. Brennon Jones and Paul Wynne), laughable dialogue, and some of the worst acting on this side of a porn movie, I recommend this movie as much as I Drink the water of the faucet in Mexico. While Navarro and Starlina continue their investigations, viewers are treated with incredibly weak blood, the worst book jacket in history, the most unconvincing person I've seen since the blinking corpse in Dr. Butcher MD, and a high-tech computerized security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a pole. To be fair, for a guy in a rubber suit, the monster itself is rather scary (hairy, with large claws, and a face like a particularly ugly bat), but his appearances are few and far between. distant from each other, with more screen time spent on the tiresome trials and tribulations of police officer Navarro than on the killer's antics. of the titular creature (how often do you need to see Navarro h anding in paperwork for your malicious boss?). <br /> <br /> If, like me, you make the mistake of wasting your hard-earned money in this terrible Latin basement (in my case, it was an entire 50p), consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila instead of really watch it.
