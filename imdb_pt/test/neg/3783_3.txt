I am giving a three instead of the smallest number that deserves because of its history. A complete movie made by high school students! It shows, too, but it's part of the charm and appeal. Meet some of the things George Lucas did at UCLA; this is better. Maybe because it's a group effort. <br /> <br /> A monster made out of toxic waste and lots of crap - these kids were way ahead of their time! - begins to devastate the city of Milpitas during a dance in high school. . The monster randomly destroys, leaving garbage and smelly stares. <br /> <br /> The film has local radio and TV people, the Mayor of Milpitas, the director of the Samuel Ayer School, and a lot of high school students and their students. parents, not to mention the daughter of the mayor as the naive. <br /> <br /> Bobo? yea! Fun? yea! Great writing screen? Come on, they're untrained high school students! Copy this comment to the acting, cinematography, direction, etc. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is next to San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley; perhaps one of the graphic geniuses will update the video in some way. Now there is a challenge.
