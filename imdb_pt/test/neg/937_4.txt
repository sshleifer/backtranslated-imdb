The Lifetime channel aired in October, but I was only able to watch it now. Is the old eternal triangle again? Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) has a quick affair with his best friend's girlfriend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure for law school in New York, thinks about the next five years while he is not making contracts and briefs, runs to her again when she returns home after her father's death on the eve of a major exam five years later, and romantically engages her again. But director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss goes a long way, framing the whole thing in flashback, as Dave confesses to murdering Emily, her husband and another of her lovers in the front (here comes the spoiler) a lesbian cop who is also a call Emily. Weiss exaggerates the "flanger" effect by which Dave can see bits of his previous life shine before his eyes before he's really dead, cutting them off while Dave and Emily are having sex and thus ruining the soft- core that give even some Lifter films, on the contrary, a little appealing at least a little audience. I could not help but remind myself of James M. Cain and how much better he wrote women like that in their classic thrillers. "The postman always plays twice", "Double indemnity" and "Mildred Pierce" It also does not help that the film ends with the villains (the bad girls, in fact) triumphant and the decent hero, if naive and stupid, apparently on the way to the lethal injection table or the actors who play the people Dave and Emily are cheating they are cuter than they are.Accidentally, although this movie went straight to the US cable channel, there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where the bad words were blocked, so I assume this was a version theatrical somewhere in the world.
