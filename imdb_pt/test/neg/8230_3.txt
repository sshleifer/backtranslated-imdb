This is a weird movie. On the surface, it's no different than many other d-grid movies, but at least in some ways it stands out. First of all, the main killer character is really weird. How the hell does a guy who just sing like a chicken got free is totally beyond me. What was that member of the female parole board thinking, "He's totally reformed and rehabilitated." It clucks! Another problem with Luther, the Toto, is the script / direction for women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she were mine I would slap her. In an attempt to untie her mother from the bed, she struggles with us and does not seem to think, "I'll get a pair of scissors or a knife." Later, in a similar attempt to untie the mother, she goes down the stairs and starts looking in a box of material for some scissors, eventually she gets a knife. By the way, this is after the killer has obviously left in the car and just come back. Bizarre. On the plus side, the daughter made her kit for the shower scene, so that was fine, though again unusual. It seems that in many of these fat movies they happily show the throats being bitten with blood spurting, but the sight of a female breast is somehow too strong for the public. It usually worked, but it was annoying and unpleasant, even though her bare breasts compensated a little.
