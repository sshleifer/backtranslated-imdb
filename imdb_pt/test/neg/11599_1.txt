The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunken scene. It does - I was tickled to finally have the chance to laugh. And there were other times I found amusing - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the faulty plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by saying sweet things to a stranger. <br /> <br /> But overall, I was discouraged. I love Carol Lombard and more from Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions imposed on productions by the Hays Code. But that was embarrassing and horrible to watch. Of course I knew they would end up together, this is a romantic comedy after all. But it did not make sense, it happened too fast. Moreover, I can not believe in the professions of love when confronted with such harmful behavior, both physical and confrontational.
