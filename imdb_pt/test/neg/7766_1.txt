The first time I saw this I retreated on HORROR in what was being presented as modern and liberated women. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can not relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around sex without love and the acquisition of Gucci. , Prada and Louis Vuitton. The problem is that some may actually think that this is how career women live in New York. Definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic, and as another reviewer put it, they act as gold trainers. <br /> <br /> This is not a liberated femininity and I'm glad it's over. 0 stars and just AWFUL
