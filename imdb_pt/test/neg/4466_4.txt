After seeing the previews for some time ago, I was eager to see Steve Martin in a comedy I thought could be a keeper. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The problem was that the previews were the only funny parts of the movie. The rest of the movie was pretty much a bunch of crap, scenes that were made to death and characters that we've all seen thousands of times. <br /> <br /> This movie was a positive proof that if you put enough money on the table, you can talk to someone about anything. Steve Martin is one of my favorites, but this was a great clunker. The only actor in the movie that was worth watching was Eugene Levy; he was the best of a powerful lame group.
