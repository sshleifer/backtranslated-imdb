If you are a sensible person and have seen movies before, you can not tolerate this idiocy for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there longer then it will not be because you would expect akshay or paresh (no govinda please!), But because you value your money a lot and you want at least a nap in the plush seat in the multiplex in exchange for money they stole you! It's hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult movie like HeraPheri can drop to such high levels. It is repetitive, but now it is coming out of all third category and expects us to laugh because it brought Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No, sir, this will not work now ... especially with your stupid script! Even comedy movies can have significant scripts (Lage Raho Munnabhai, anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda did not Akshay Kumar was annoying, Paresh Rawal broke some of the worst possible jokes.Lara Dutta had real scope to act on this one, but she failed miserably ... the only high point of the film (possibly ) is the performance of Tanushree! But she's only there in the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie is worth more space ... (probably not so much!). So final warning - do not watch!
