The first time I watched this show, fine. There were some funny moments and I laughed a few times, but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is not at all funny. They make a stupid video from the internet, shout at the camera and make some really bad jokes. And then the laughing lane explodes?! One problem with the show is that none of the main characters is funny. Carly is not funny. The performance of Miranda Cosgrove is lackluster at best. His acting in this show is nothing like his acting of Drake and Josh. Her friend Sam is very rude and rude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like a hick. I mean, they make jokes about her mother driving a rusty old truck, her mother breaking an old TV with a taco, and then she has the jokes about Sam missing school, being detained all the time and running away from the police. None of this is funny at all. Then there is Freddy who is a computer nerd. He's not funny, unless your mother is treating you like a baby. The only funny character in the full-time show is Carly's brother, Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things, such as pretending to drive a spaceship as he makes spacecraft noises, knocking over a table of girl broom biscuits to do the same thing to him. Your stuff is the only thing worth laughing at. Besides the characters, other things make the show bad as well. How does the fact that some kids doing a local web show of an apartment in Seattle is a worldwide success and that they have a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is how a 26-year-old single jobless guy can pay for a 2-story apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of cameras and sound equipment, including a remote-control projector . a green screen and an HD camera? It looks like it was written by a 10 year old. What's worse is that the program contains some very questionable content. There are a couple of times when Carly (remember a 13 year old girl) shows up on her internet show in a bikini top. WTF So I saw an episode where Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he "just slept his socks the night before." I mean WTF? Then there's an episode in which Carly's rival Nevel blackmails her, taking over the rights of the site and agrees to return the site to her for a kiss. Creepy! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who just moved into their building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and Carly just lays there drooling over it. I can not believe Nick even let them show this sort of thing and I can not believe this was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under 12 and this is questionable. ICarly is just another addition to Nick's long list of bad schedules.
