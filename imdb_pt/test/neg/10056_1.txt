Filmed in Arizona by a mostly foreign team, "Nightkill" is one of the most awkward criminal dramas I have ever seen. Robert Mitchum (with a cowboy hat) follows Jaclyn Smith, a recently widowed widow, hoping to find out if she had a hand in her husband's death. Jaclyn's wardrobe is of the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... it seems that someone certainly bought in the American myth that all Westerners talk and dress like John Wayne's descendants! Joan Andre and John Case's script may have worked better if approached as parody; this mystery thriller has just been tame, with director Ted Post sleeping in control. Do not be drawn to the art of Jaclyn's video box screaming while you take a shower. She really does bathe in this movie, but it is not revealing (nor does it further increase the dark plot). NO STARS of ****
