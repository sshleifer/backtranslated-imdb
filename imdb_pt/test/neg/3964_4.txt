Beloved tale of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" the dog) which is many different things for many different people. On his busy day, Benji has breakfast at the home of two small children, talks to a law enforcement officer, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an old coffee owner to start the special day. Helper for some, fun for others, he is companion of all. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion he calls home. From here we know that only "Benji" can save the day. <br /> <br /> The plot is the routine of writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to make the effects of slow motion. However, the public will find it difficult to resist the adorable little dog, and boys of all ages will surely love it. The cast would never be anything but "Benji". <br /> <br /> It's not what you'd call inspired, but fun. Oscar nominated for the theme "Benji's", "I Feel Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
