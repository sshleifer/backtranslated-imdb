This movie could have been so much better. It is a beautiful story that goes through very difficult times and yet it has been so poorly executed. The leading actors have done excellent work and, for the most part, do a fitting job in this film. Although sometimes their dialogue seems pissed and forced. The direction could have been more concise. Most of the criticism should go to writers, who have had a good story and have become tedious. In short, there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours.
