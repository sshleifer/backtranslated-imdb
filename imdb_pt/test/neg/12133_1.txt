Heh ... I'm surprised that this movie still exists in any form, let alone be available for rent! <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the many horror movies that exist only for T & A and cheap laughs. The plot goes through some of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with a background of Mummy's background reminiscent of "Psycho," and some of the good old women-in-chains, hard as pleats in good measure-in other words , complete lack of originality involved in semi-nude women tempered with a dash of total idiocy! Looking as the director tries to make the land of the Quebec marsh pass like the land of the South of the USA, it is sad, I tell you! Funny thing to me is that I was at the premiere of the movie, at the time, I was friends with Ratchford, the star of the movie. It was painful to watch as Jeremy sank into his seat as the flick unfolded its mutilated wings. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see that Ratchford, after this farce of a first movie, became a hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly in the Canadian crime drama "Blue Murder," appeared in "CSI," not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood movie "Unforgiven" - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a difficult start, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> T.Paul
