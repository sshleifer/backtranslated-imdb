Jefferey Dahmer was a sick face. There is not much to say about it that has not already been said, except that the many documentaries and films made about it are probably better than this. It's ridiculously tacky. It's so tacky, a guy who posted the entire movie on youtube added some notes to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Carl Crew (Who is he?) Star as Serial killer Jeffrey dahmer, Who's killing binge started in 1978 with a young man who dahmer just wanted to be friends, finally in 1991 with a man with whom he wanted have sex and eat. <br /> <br /> I did not bother watching the whole movie. It's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks that Dahmer did before being caught. And since this movie was made in 1993, a year before Dahmer was beaten to death by a fellow prisoner, Dahmer's death is not shown. but it probably would have been as extravagant as this festival of cheeses. <br /> 1/10
