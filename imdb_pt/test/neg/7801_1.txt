This is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> The story does not measure up with most other episodes of TZ. It's very annoying, although seeing Peter Falk as a Fidel Castro look is kind of fun. Every time Twilight Zone aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown, I'd grab a sandwich and a drink and settle for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it turned out to be this episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mother (another TZ fan like me) as well. There were so many times that one of us would tell the other: "I was ready to watch the Twilight Zone and guess what episode was going on? The episode of the Cuban dictator!" Obviously, some people like this episode, since it gets a 6.7 rating ... how it happened, I have no idea - but that alone would make a great Twilight Zone plan!
