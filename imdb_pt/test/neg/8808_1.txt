There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even worse. Saw is just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is just plain bad at all points. The plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and I can not understand how this garbage came to the big screen. <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Saw is sifted. with plot holes. The beginning is attractive and leaves a lot to wait, but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a bit of credibility. The people who claim that this movie is bloody, violent, sadistic and scary are girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because it is far from it. <br /> <br /> So I'm warning you know, do not try to watch this if you have some form of intellect because you'll be disappointed. A real hole and a mediocre movie as can be.
