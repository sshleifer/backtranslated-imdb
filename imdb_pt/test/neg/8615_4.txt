I watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's horrible! I hoped it was great, because you know, we do not usually have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but it started badly at first: the introduction of the film seemed to have no end! The plot is so weak and if you take the fights and the soundtrack, you really do not have anything useful! The director of this movie does not seem to have any important notions about how much time to spend on presentations and flashbacks, for example (not to mention a few other things) <br /> <br /> For people like me who want to watch a great movie of vampires, I really recommend watching '' Lost Boys '' or '' The Interview with the Vampire. ''
