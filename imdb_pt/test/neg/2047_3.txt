As Americans, we expect the crap to be "on the go" when it comes to HORROR and unknown directors directing unknown actors who act for unknown writers. We actually expect this to suck and when they do not suck, it becomes a hit overnight. <br /> <br /> This is not a success overnight, nor is it one about the weekend or about the success of the month. This explodes from beginning to end and my only recommendation is this: UNDERSTAND THAT KNOW SUCKS, enjoy what is, what is not, and if you have something better to do, keep that in the back WAY BACK burner. It's fun to watch the elderly people crossing a busy street during rush hour, but do not expect too much - they're almost never run over by a real car, it's just a lot of commotion.
