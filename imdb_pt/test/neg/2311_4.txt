The first user comments are very detailed for a very vague movie. I'm not saying that I disagree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To get straight to the point, this is a lot like watching make a very bad amateur porn movie. There are some funny points in the movie but with the kind of things that happen in today's youth every day is really kind of boring. The lead actor in the film is a pompous jerk and both the guy and the girl in the movie are too modest to be in a movie like this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS MOVIE. The only reason I gave a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least one girl a little attractive in the movie and in the end you have to see almost complete frontal nudity of the girl, that's the only thing that is worth worth watching for. the end
