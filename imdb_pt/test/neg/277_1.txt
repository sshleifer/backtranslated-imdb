I was watching this movie and getting more and more bored with the silly storyline that was going nowhere, when suddenly, the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor interpreting itself. Oh how I laughed. Because it's so funny, is not it? We know that Julia Roberts is playing the character of Tess, and here they are, in the movie, cracking the joke that the character of Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone who pretends to be Julia. How well she does this, we will never know, because 99.999% of the audience does not know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine does not count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis appears! Apparently he is Julia Roberts' best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how would I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other or not? I'm not at all interested in the actors' personal lives - I just paid my money and hope they do the work they're paid to do. Anyway, they begin to tell jokes about the turnaround in the movie in which Willis (unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist ... the one with the little boy ... do you know the one? I do not, I have forgotten what is called. Willis goes on to comment on how well the movie did at the box office - what a modest Willis! The problem is that these scenes are not only terrible and horribly self-indulgent, it also reminds us, viewers, that we are simply watching a lot of actors strutting and making huge sums of money with very little effort. You see, when I see a movie, I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I'm watching actors - I want to believe the story I'm watching. When you start to pull the scenery down in the middle of the movie, you simply spoil the illusion for me. <br /> <br /> You know that a TV series jumped the shark when it started to feature celebrities, playing (get up and be counted The Simpsons, Friends, etc.), but this is the first time I saw a movie skipping the shark. I usually stay away from movies like this (eg Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is that I honestly never thought that the 11 Ocean films went in that direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So with the suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot now languishing in the movie, then breaks the most perverse joke of everyone in the audience - the assault really happened back in history, and the last 90 minutes or so of the film was a meaningless stance. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his fellow actors stand up, point to the audience and say, "Ha haaa ... you all have already ... thank you for your money!". Then they give us the greeting with a single finger. <br /> <br /> Well, back to you. I really did not pay to see this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How do you like apples? Now this is a turning point in history.
