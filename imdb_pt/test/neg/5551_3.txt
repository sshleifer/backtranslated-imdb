I debated a lot about what rating to give this one, because it's my favorite movie from Herschell Gordon Lewis so far, in addition to The Gruesome Twosome, but it has the best acting I've ever seen in a Lewis movie. However, we all know that it is not saying much. Once the film was made, I was happy because it felt like I was sitting in a 4-hour movie, despite being only 82 minutes long. I'm trying to watch all the HGL movies and that's probably the only reason to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Blood is as good as ever, the only thing Herschell seemed to do right. The acting is as bad as usual, with one exception. This exception is Frank Kress. Now, would I say he's a good actor? No way, but he's good compared to everyone else. The story is boring and flat and it's not going anywhere, and in the end I did not care what happened since it ended. I know this is a cult classic, but I did not really like it. I hope you do.
