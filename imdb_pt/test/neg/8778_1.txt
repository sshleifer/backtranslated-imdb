There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is difficult to choose just a few. Let's start with the silly and annoying songs. Like "Ride Little Cowboy," which only tended to accentuate the urban look of Klinton Spilsbury. The silly cowboy kiddie-style songs playing in the background during the movie undermined any credibility or impetus the story had for him. <br /> <br /> I had seen the media hype before the movie's release, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on several TV shows, and he had a sweet, sweet voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered who they were fans of Clayton Moore and the Lone Ranger series. Spilsbury did not help things by acting like a diva and talking about Clayton Moore after the producers got an injunction barring Moore from appearing at conventions and other events like the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not allowed to sign as "Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger". He could only sign up as "The Masked Man". The incredible amount of negative publicity this move gave to the film was only added by Spilsbury's petulant attitude, which was too quick to tell reporters that Clayton Moore would be quickly forgotten once the film was released! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even after the film was a total failure, the company owning The Lone Ranger refused to raise the Injunction against Clayton Moore, and he was never allowed to sign anything except as " The Masked Man ". "and he could not wear his black mask in any public appearance.With Spilsbury's diva personality and the negative publicity of the film, it certainly did not help to make a good impression on the public.More still, a few weeks before the movie was finally released , the news was leaked that Spilsbury's voice in the film had been copied by James Keech because the producers thought Spilsbury did not sound very convincing as a cowboy.The ridicule and scorn that this news brought on the talk shows and comedies of that time put the latter Naw Haggard, who had been working on the film for a long time, had been hoping that the macho image of Haggard (one of the Outlaws of Country Music) would add credibility to Spilsbury as The Lone Ranger.òÀÝ Merle HaggardòÀÙs narration was just another annoyance the audience had to deal with.òÀÝ Sometimes Haggard rhymes his narration, and looks like a stranger combining the rhyming narration with "Ride Little Cowboy" songs and any credibility that Spilsbury could have achieved was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. Tonto was played by Michael Horse, and as others have pointed out, The Horse had far more personality than the Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps because of Spitzbury's supposedly combative attitude during filming, it seems that Horse was given much more dialogue and screen time than anyone could expect from Tonto. Tonto takes over and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was hoping (or hoping) that Billy Jack would make an appearance as Tonto's brother (this would have made the movie so much better). The horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but he says more and has better scenes. Maybe it was a horse case robbing the Spilsbury show. However, since the film was so miserable, Horse did not get much recognition. Unlike Spilsbury, Horse had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Maybe the last negative about this movie is The Lone Ranger's Powder Blue outfit. The material chosen for Spilsbury was lighter in color than what Clayton Moore normally wore in appearances. This choice of color for clothing only made Spilsbury look more effeminate in his role. The comic strip had shown that The Lone Ranger also wore a red shirt and black pants, and that alternative look would have helped Spilsbury seem more compelling than The Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The support cast most often sent in their performances. Everyone seems to be working on a TV episode and no one seems very convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish lost his advantage due to the people around him. Overall, I'm sorry for Spilsbury. Not only did he do a terrible acting job, but it's obvious that the production and advertising were horrible and effectively sabotaged any chance the poor guy had. Even though he was an excellent replacement for Clayton Moore, I doubt the film did well as a result of other factors. As it stands, this movie is funny in a sad way.
