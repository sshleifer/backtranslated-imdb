"Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels," said Nuff. Just do not expect anything like "Devil Went Down To Georgia", old Charles talks about a song at the beginning of Whiskey Mountain (duh) and it's for the lyrics. Hey, but rape scene buffs will have fun with the Polaroid set-up (my second-hand copy is classified as a FAMILY movie) and who does not love endless scenes of peasants staring blankly at the purple ones? The box art made the film look a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that "you can lose your life - or your mind!", But mostly it's two couples who walk through the sticks and "act" naturally. I love this hermit.
