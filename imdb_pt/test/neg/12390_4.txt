The title does not make much sense to me. I'm not sure which door in the movie should not have been opened. <br /> <br /> The movie begins uneventfully with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train wagon. , complete with the sound of the traveling train. In fact, the man's house is a train car and he has a cassette of train sounds. The woman leaves and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she says her grandmother is ill and that she needs to go back to her hometown. She has not been there in thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to thirteen years ago. A shadowy figure enters a house. He caresses a sleeping girl, then enters another room and stabs the girl's mother. The girl wakes up and goes into her mother's bedroom and finds her dead with a knife in her. She screams and one arm comes out of nowhere and claps her hand over her mouth. She looks in fear. That initial scene in the murderer's movie muffled her scream, and the girl's look is one of the film's few strengths. <br /> <br /> It does not have much to do with it in the visual department. Occasionally there is some strange use of sound, and there is some strange lighting in an attic scene where many of the glass panels are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Back to the present day. The girl arrives at her grandmother's house. An old doctor is there, whom she does not trust, along with the man from the opening scene "Judge" and Kearn, the operator of the city's museum. She trusts none of them, and it is true that they inspire no confidence. She's a little cranky all through the movie. She wants to check her grandmother in a hospital. The men of the city want her house, and the museum operator wants things (his museum is already full of many grandmother things). Inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman begins to receive phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister whisper. He makes several threats and wants her to do things to wake him up. Such scenes recur frequently. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who could be are limited. Even worse, we see from the beginning who is making the connections. So, while the girl does not know (even if the caller occasionally falls into her normal voice), the public always knows: without suspense. Each connection shakes more and more. <br /> <br /> The ending was unexpected to me, so maybe I get points for not going with the obvious, but I'm not sure I care.
