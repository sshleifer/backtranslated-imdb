OK, yes, I know I'm a Philistine, and I have no knowledge or love of the opera. I readily admit that I could feel different about this movie if I did that. But I do not know. So for those of you like me, skip this, unless you want to look at the pretty girls (sometimes without clothes). For what it's worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (which I did not recognize) was the best of the lot.
