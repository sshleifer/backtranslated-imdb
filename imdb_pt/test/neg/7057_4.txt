One of the nicer surprises of this short Technicolor of 3 tracks was that a ballerina that appears here was called Maria Gambarelli! I wondered if Blake Edwards was naming the character played by Elke Sommer in A Shot in the Dark after this forgotten interpreter (though the spelling of the Sommer surname was actually Gambrelli). I watched this on YouTube primarily to see one of Judy Garland's first appearances as we watched her in profile with her two older sisters singing "The Cockroach." That was the high point for me that otherwise showed some dances (like Gambarelli's) that were fun and a dumb comedy between Andy Devine as a great fighter (yeah, right!) And Buster Keaton as a bull owner one that is obviously a man in animal costume. Just a funny part of those two is when they cry - with Buster supplying a scarf for "bull" - during the sad part of "The Cockroach". Also lame he was seeing Ted Healy without his henchmen dealing with a crasher that continues to confuse Healy with other movie stars. (Healy himself did not know that Zeppo had left The Marx Brothers since he had placed "Four" between "The" and "Marx"!) Speaking of Marx, it was interesting to see Harpo without his wig although he was wearing a hat to hide . his bald head. Also interesting was seeing Ida Lupino among the cowgirls at first, though I also recognized Toby Wing from her role in Murder at the Vanities last year (at least when announcer Pete Smith identified her). Oh, and Smith himself was not funny about his clever face story. Other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in appearances and not all are players hired by M-G-M! So with all that said, La Fiesta de Santa Barbara is worth looking at for anyone curious about film appearances by Judy Garland or the early use of 3-strip Technicolor.
