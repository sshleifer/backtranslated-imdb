I've never seen the other two "Ninja" movies and, as far as I know, are known, but for some reason I've watched that one. This one starts a bit fast as this ninja goes on a super kill. He is almost unstoppable as it takes a good number of bullets to knock him over. He is not out for the count though, as he ends up owning a woman and then he continues to kill ways to use her as his tool. Another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way to kill a ninja is with another ninja, so he volunteers. This leads to a great battle at the end, when the dead ninja returns to his body and does so in a total war. It sounds better than it actually did, but at least it was not boring.
