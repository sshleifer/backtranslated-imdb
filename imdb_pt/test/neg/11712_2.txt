I'm not a fan of the original book, but I was hoping to see a better adaptation than Natalie Portman's movie, which I thought was awful. This version is even worse. <br /> <br /> First, there is very little of Mrs. Gregory's book in this script. George Boleyn's entire sexuality subplot is completely eliminated, and in this version George is only a lackey between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duty to the king. I thought the title of the book referred to Mary as the least known of the Boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to Anne. Second, the script has the characters periodically speaking to the audience as if in confession. Apparently this is meant to give a bit of history and explain your motives, but is amateur in execution. <br /> <br /> In addition to the bad script, the direction is incredibly bad. There are many pictures made with a circular camera, which is not very stable at best and at best unstable. Several of the speeches are presented tentatively, as if in a first essay. The production values ​​for Henry's flamboyant court are minimal. Fantasies vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are the febrile imagination of some stylist. And the King, the source of all power and favors, is often shown ALONE. No fawning courtier, no servant in the background - where are all the people? I'm used to Hollywood turning the story into fantasy, but I expected better from a BBC production. Even based on a flawed book, this production is bad.
