I have this movie in a bargain box, waiting for a bad movie. Boy I was disappointed. (except for avon.) You see, the movie is really horrible, but so horrible, it's not even laughable. The plot, oh wait, there is no plot. I suppose you could say that it's about the main character standing in the ranks of street fighting. At the end of the film, the directors decided not to make more sense, or, more likely, they died and sent a monkey to finish directing the film. DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE FINISHED OUT! although the end does not spoil anything. The main character somehow ends up in a room full of mirrors, la Enter The Dragon, and then gets really angry, has a stupid flashback and hits a mirror. The end. Wheeee. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor in this movie was the Avon scene. He is talking to the rival street boss and says something along those lines, completely blank: "Do not worry about him any more, sir.I killed him in a sophisticated way.I kissed him, I dined, we went to a disco.We were having fun. "And then I killed him." at which point the boss says "good job avon. You are number 1." And avon says "Number 1! Alllriiiiight! Alriiight!" The scene continues with avon continuing to say "alllrriiiight!" again and again. The next scene is of a dead Avon floating in a pool. Intelligent? I think not. <br /> <br /> Finally, I own the "Homeboy" version of this movie, meaning that the title in the box I own is "Homeboy". It shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming. This never happens in the movie. This man is never in the movie. High quality. <br /> <br /> Note - I'm new to this review, but hell, yes, I'm going to keep it up.
