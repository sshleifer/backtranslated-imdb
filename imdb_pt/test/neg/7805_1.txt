I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at the time and because David Zucker was the director. I saw your previous "Naked Gun" (both sides), Airplane and Top Secret !, and I liked it, at least I had a good time and laughed. I'm not saying the films I mentioned were masterpieces, but they were fine. I do not remember any more stupid movies than that. It's amazing how the Hollywood industry is in complete decline. If a studio spends some money to produce this awful picture, then it's no surprise that such a story is more common these days. This is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization, where stupid sexual symbols and plots are produced to entertain ordinary people. I have nothing to say about this movie. If you plan to rent it or buy it, do not waste your money or your time, avoid it, no matter what. Even if you're a fan of one of the actors, it's not worth it. In fact, this could be a good example of what a director should avoid. I'm not going to see a Zucker movie again. (He's planning to direct the fourth sequel to the horror movie, imagine that!). Pathetic. Horrible.
