It's comforting to see that other IMDb analysts had the good sense to make this movie disappointing, at the risk of blaspheming the great Vadim, Malle, and Fellini. <br /> <br /> These directors can be talented and artistic in their careers. own right; however, in attempting to pass on this miscellany of attempts at eroticism and chic 60s * somehow related to the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, they exposed themselves as frauds. Either (A) they did not bother to read Poe's stories, or (B) read them, but they were so paralyzed by their own selfish agenda that they paid no attention to Poe. Imagine if Metallica switched on their guitars, switched the amplifiers up to 11 and launched three chords, claiming it would be Beethoven's 9th Symphony. That's the feeling you'll get after watching this movie. If you are a fan of Vadim / Malle / Fellini (Metallica), you'll enjoy it. If you are a fan of Beethoven (Poe), you will vomit. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a bizarre porn version of Poe. OK, "porn" may be a bit extreme haha, but at the very least you have to call it a version of Barbarella (including, I do not doubt, some of Jane's clothes coming directly from that scomp romp set). Vadim falls into old cliches: the girl lying on a bed being graced with some man, while from the pillow bed we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude, and the boredom of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. Cute stuff, but "Metzergenstein" is not the place for that. And aside from Barbarella's clothes and irrelevant erotic themes, the American accent and the unconvincing performance of Jane Fonda as a European countess made it the worst choice since Julia Roberts in that awful version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. <br /> <WILLIAM Wilson ... Here's a great Poe story about the madness that a man claims when he realizes he's not the only one in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, watch the Star Trek # 27 episode "The Alternative Factor." But here, Malle dwells on this central theme and focuses on ... any guess ...? Yes, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. Ho hum. The role of Brigitte Bardot is a complete invention to achieve this goal, and once again the director distorts a classic Poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of her own unrequited sexual problems. Do it in your time, Malle. I thought we were here on Poe's penny. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> The worst of the three and possibly the worst movie I've seen since "Staying Alive". At least Fellini showed some tact at changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and mood of the story is so vast, I wonder if he just chose this roll from his private collection of home movies, stamped "Edgar Allen Poe story "about it and submitted to this collection. I struggled hard to find any thread of familiarity with Poe's work, but there was absolutely none. <br /> <br /> Poe's original story ("Never Bet the Devil, the Head") is a short and hilarious fable about a man who constantly exclaims "I bet my head on the devil ..." On a morning of fog, the devil accepts your offer. The result is the sickest, dumbest thing you've ever read. This was Poe, the comedian, at his best (yes, Poe wrote many comedies. Also check out "A Predicament" and "Devil in the Belfry", if you want a taste of his spirited, satirical works). <br /> This version of Fellini? It's bland, soulless, and not funny at all (unless you find it funny to see a drunk stumbling on himself for 45 minutes). Here, Fellini's selfish discourse is about an artist who fights against the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. Most of it is at an awards ceremony where Fellini slaps us in the head with sarcasm, cynicism, and that classic attitude of "sour grapes" we find in all of Fellini's movie-dealing movies. Observe the sarcastic scrapes on "the critics," a recurring theme in Fellini's films. For someone who considered himself above the critics, Fellini spent a lot of time talking about them. Anyway, I feel that Fellini just pulled out some 8 1/2 outtakes, put them together and sold them like a Poe story. The worst "adaptation" of all time. I think I worked harder to write this review than any of the three directors involved in making a Poe movie.
