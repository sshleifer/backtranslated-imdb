I live in Mexico City, so I have to suffer with the trailers for every piece of junk that comes out of all these stupid Mexican filmmakers. Do you want to admire a Mexican for making great movies? Take a look at something from Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's Backbone), or maybe Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I really do not like his movies, but I respect them). <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmakers often produce the most terrible garbage of all time (Por la Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points of Mexican films of all time . If you respect your brain, please avoid this stick at all costs. It would be smarter to watch a video of a wedding or watch the reality show of Britney. This has more IQ than everyone else in this 'movie'.
