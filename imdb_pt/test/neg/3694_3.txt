I really like the science fiction movies of the 1950s. I like the really good ones (like The Day the Earth Stood Still, When the Worlds Collide, Invasion of Body Thieves and many others) and sometimes the Bad Worlds because they can be really fun and great to watch with friends (like Plan 9 from Outer Space). However, when a science fiction movie is bad but not bad enough to be entertaining, it should be avoided. This movie is just one of those movies. The posters make it seem like some kind of sexy beast is attacking mankind, while the actual plot is much less interesting. A woman is married to a womanizer. She is contaminated and starts to grow to a huge size and decides to track that worm and kick his ass and that's about it. Plus, many of the special effects really stink - especially the gigantic paper mache hand that walks into the room to pick up the evil husband.
