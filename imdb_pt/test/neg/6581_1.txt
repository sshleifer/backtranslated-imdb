I'm not joking: there's a scene in this movie where a rover hits his head on a cornerstone of the tunnel and explodes (no fireball, though) in a million pieces! This made a child in front of me scream in terror! ... In a film rated G! <br /> <br /> This movie can serve to convince children that Santa is EVIL! Your helpers are ugly, misanthropic, exaggerated, and petty! When Santa Claus (here an anagram of Satan!) Appears, all 200,000 elves begin to sing "Santa Claus is coming to town" as if it were a druid war chant. Then, in the reflection of the object "Rosebud" of this film (a bell that whispers tips of why you can not hear it touching: "doubt ... doubt ...)), the old Saint Nick appears, looking like a Stoic Donald Sutherland, his face shining like Moses' "K10C." When we heard him speak, his thunderous voice sounds less like an old elf, and more like the voice of James Earl Jones slowed by about 20%. <br /> <br /> Melody music is out of place, boring and repetitive. It does not follow any emotional chaos (as in the very effective score of "Titanic"). It just seems thrown at certain points to generate feelings of heat and magic. (no pun intended) where, out of nowhere, the sinister and symphonic beating sprouts abruptly in a happy, POLKA child voice over the title's locomotive. It just makes the movie all sound like it has been rushed into production! <br /> <b r /> Finally, I agitate ree with some other reviewers on how, well ... "dead" everyone looks. It seems a little macabre sometimes. The motion capture technique is good for allowing roller coaster tracks to seem compelling from a distance, but up close, "real" actors should have been used. Overall, a nice look to kill time in front of the TV, but not much else here.
