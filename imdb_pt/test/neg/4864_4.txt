Rarely did I see an action / suspense movie that was so annoying. None of the action scenes are exciting, the story is nothing special and, except for some actors, the acting is bad. Charlie Sheen (Platoon, Major League) is the head of the White House, who gets into the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people to die. Donald Sutherland (A Time to Kill, Fallen) plays a friend who tells everything he can and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation. Charlie Sheen is good as the star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who does a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives poor performance. With a bad movie, I can really like it if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very rough ending, with some laughable things.
