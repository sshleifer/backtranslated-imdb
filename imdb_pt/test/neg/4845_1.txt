I wish I had read more opinions and more opinions on this movie before I rent it. A waste of money. A waste of time. Very small dialogue. The dialogue was difficult to understand in every way. The plot and the plot were both weak. The only cool thing was the cinematography. <br /> <br /> The characters were interesting. At the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out, because of the lack of dialogue, that you will be rewinding the film a lot. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It was a mess and will leave you feeling a mess. <br /> <br /> You'll say, what the hell was that, when the movie ends?
