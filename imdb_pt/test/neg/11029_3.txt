This movie does not have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. There are some good bits when Stewart is on the screen and they give you some lines to work with. It works best at the beginning as a romantic comedy, but the story continues towards a more dramatic territory and gets lost in the process. In the last fifteen minutes, the twists and turns are just a series of dramatic cliches. <br /> <br /> The part with the airplane looks like a part of the rest movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason I can think of is if you want to be able to tell you have seen all of Jimmy Stewart's movies.
