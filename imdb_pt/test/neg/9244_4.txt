Korine established himself, by now, as a talented and impressive creator of images. Promotional posters for Mister Lonely include the film's most impressive compositions (although there is one in particular that I have not yet seen in promotional material: that of a nun dressed in blue teasing a dog with a stick, surrounded by green forest with torrential rain flowing). The opening images of this film by Michael Jackson (Diego Luna) riding a small bike on a track are strangely attractive and beautiful: Roy Orbison's "Mister Lonely" plays the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow motion. There is also a funny and formidable sequence in which the same character does a dance, without music (although a radio resembles a silent dog next to him), in the middle of a Parisian street; Korean amendments in sound effects and jumps that evoke both a feeling of futility and a stubborn release in the character's dance routine. <br /> <br /> The first instance of the segment dealing with the nuns is also strangely poignant; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns and throw food in nearby poor areas. In a scene that is both carefree and unaffected, Herzog must deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local who wants to make the plane trip with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops, Herzog takes from the man a confession: he has sinned and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife having left him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, gains a special weight after learning its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on the set when Korine and col. were filming - and his adulterous manners gave him, in real life, enduring and overwhelming guilt. From then on, the film is unpredictable; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that contribute to a frivolous and confused narrative. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural structures, Mister Lonely feels a victim of cruelty in the editing room. Some scenes were cut from the film, which would have painted more complete portraits of certain characters due to continuity errors in the costumes - a result, no doubt, due to the absence of a film script and Korine's improvisational trend. A particular deleted scene - in which 'Charlie Chaplin' (Denis Lavant) and 'Madonna' (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added much more emotional conflict to a scene later in the movie (I will not ruin it but it's there to empty any sense of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half-success). <br /> <br /> The two strands of narrative, literally disconnected, are best approached as two completely different stories. with the same allegorical meaning; one complements the other and vice versa. (It's something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the present situation.) But there are not enough Herzog scenes to deserve their place in the film, and so any connection between these two allegorically connected segments is inevitably forced. - and inclusion is, in hindsight, tedious. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step by Julien Donkey-Boy, who suffers mainly, at least in similar ways, from having many characters for the film. duration of the race, a flaw that would have been even worse if the big names of the stars touched everyone (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many of the images of self-sufficient beauty, and moments of real and genuine connection to the soundtrack, it would seem that it would be much more suitable for an art installation or photo exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of imitation, it would not lose any of its power-in fact, to me, perhaps it was more impressive. The loneliness associated with iconic performativity (as found by both the icons themselves and by those who aspire to be like them) is well captured in images such as the one in which "Marilyn Monroe" (a beautiful Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with a Seven Years itching pose in the middle of a forest, or when 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles in a post-dance rehearsal with his back to the camera, overlooking an incredible and tranquil lake. <br /> <br /> As it is, times like these and all those in which the randomly chosen titles Michael Jackson's songs prowl the scene, are married to one another in a film narrative much less affective than it should be . <br /> <br /> (To those who see it, I've lost all faith during the egg-singing scene. You'll know which scene I mean because it stands out like a sore thumb, kind of a puzzling attempt at the new language film for which Korine has already been greeted.)
