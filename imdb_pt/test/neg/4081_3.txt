Evan Almighty continues the Bruce Almighty franchise, this time with Buffalo congressman Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) at his center. A totally innocuous man (and not even indecisive in truth), God (Morgan Freeman) decides to impose some sort of search on Baxter, to illustrate the importance of ... reciprocal goodness, so that Baxter can "change the world" ( aka, pay it forward). <br /> <br /> Think of Evan Almighty as a healthy derivative of "Distinguished Gentlemen". Baxter is not a coup, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman), wants his unquestioned support for a bill that is essentially damaging to the environment. And the well-meaning Baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support him. <br /> <br /> In addition, with the new job comes more responsibility, and Baxter is, in a sense, defamed, for not spending enough time with his family. <br /> <br /> So God decides to give Evan Baxter some guidance, forcing him to become the modern Noah. His orders: Build an ark. Except, though it may be slightly humorous to see Baxter's transformation to the "bearded freak," there does not seem to be much sense for this whole thing that becomes clearer when the film's climax fails. (SPOILERS: if no one in the population is killed by the "deluge," then what was the point of summoning the animals ... or at least those who obviously were not from the suburb of Virginia? Or, more importantly, if all Baxter had to realizing that Long's designs were weak in quality, so why did he have to build an ark?). So although a comedy like this should not be a hysterical laugh, it was certainly a far less enjoyable thing, since it was filled with many homilies (and not all of Morgan Freeman's) and actions that looked like intended for a film of more epic events.
