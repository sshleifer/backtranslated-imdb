I spent a year in Iraq, and among the hundreds of movies I saw here was this little gem called Vampire Assassin. Judging by the cover (African-American with rows of corn with a curved blade, leather jacket and the behavior of a fuck), I expected a Blade hit. Fair enough. So I showed him and I watched an overweight African American, no blade, no braids, and, well, nothing, except ... I do not know. If you've read any of these other comments, you get the gist of the movie. Sucks. Bad. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it was the lightening of the Highlander-esquire after killing an immortal vampire, or the sound effects of karate kick for camera zooms, or the $ 20 budget in props, or the "Okay, we have 90 minutes to film this before we get caught filming in a Johnson & Johnson parking lot," or martial arts that are as exciting and speedy as two old people having sex, or the seventh grade acting talent, or the eccentric Asian master that is senial or acidic, or what, but the film can force you to question its existence. And this is incredible. <br /> <br /> Not many movies can be so bad that your head explodes like Scanners. If you mess up (or MST3K) with your friends, this is the movie for you. I've seen it three times and I think it may have caused permanent damage to my psyche. If you still have no clue about the quality of the movie, people were trying to give it away for free and nobody would accept it. Not even by force. <br /> <br /> Long story short, watch. Be it as masochistic pleasure or punishment. It will shake your skull (and for the most part, for the wrong reasons).
