Any horror movie that Robert Englund releases (Freddie Kruger!) And then kills him in the opening, 5 minutes before the opening credits are shown, should be immediately seen with only suspicion. <br /> <br /> Tony Todd (Candyman!) as a swamp tour guide (his impression of James Earl Jones's voice is hysterical, by the way, I do not know or care if he was trying to be funny, but I was laughing at it). Unfortunately, his role was also 5 minutes. More reason to suspect and rightly so. I have had to look for her to see what I remembered her, but she's half-naked!), Marcus the black symbolic face (Not Another Teen Movie) is filling a comedy role that is not really necessary in a horror movie, unless it is intended to be a parody. <br /> <br /> Joel Murray (brother of Bill Murray & Pete of Dharma & Greg) plays Shapiro, the guy filming the video gonzo with the two pretty girls. While they do a "Spooky Swap Ghost Tour" the 2 male characters meet other people and get stuck in rocks and have to leave the boat. So now they're all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain. <br /> <br /> Once the real story of Victor Crowley was told (his makeup looked lazy to The Goonies), we established that he is dead. (well, you're not coming back from being hit in the skull by an ax!) Once the old man is attacked despite pulling his gun and having a very clear shot, it takes over 30 seconds for Marybeth to start firing on a guy who is cutting an old man with a hatchet. Is she stupid? That's 29 seconds long! In terms of plot, there really is not one (I do not classify undead psychopath as a plot, sorry) and the pace is also very bad. You have a murder, some fleeing, some light relief and then some slow talk before you start the cycle again. <br /> <br /> After an extremely long scene investigating a faltering bush with a raccoon, Victor appears again (with some kind of power tool) and kills the dark-haired pornstar, he also manages to cut the tour guide in half with a shovel? Once Misty is left alone to keep an eye on Ben, I felt it was pretty obvious that she would be the next to die (I was right, but you can not see it). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers? The rain will not extinguish the burned gas, OK? Idiots! Obviously after the two near-misses at the graveyard, Marcus was the next to die and Ben was injured in the foot with the spike, but they managed to find a boat after impaling Victor on the spike. <br /> <br /> She is pulled in water by something invisible, he is trying to save her, then she is pulled into the boat by Victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly ends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's just like that. No clue if Ben was dead (he seemed to be losing an arm) and no clue if Marybeth was going to survive and what happened to Victor. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible ending and undoubtedly my verbal attack on the filmmakers received the last comment deleted. So much for freedom of expression, right?
