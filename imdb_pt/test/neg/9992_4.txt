Some describe CALIGULIA as "the" most controversial film of its time. Although this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: almost every big name associated with the film has made an effort to distance itself from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film, his reactions ranged from sonic revulsion to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for him to leave. <br /> <br /> For a while, it looked like it could. The CALIGULA was a major box office failure and critical (producer Guccione had to rent cinemas to do screening), and although the film was released on VHS for the domestic market, many censorship issues were raised edited, and the edited version was the only widely available for more than a decade. But now the CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in the edited "R" versions and "Unclassified" original. And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he did not live to see it happen. <br /> <br /> The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it's something like DEEP THROAT and DUNE from David Lynch going through Fellini having a day off. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to fund the project and attract the big stars - and then played most of Vidal's screenplay and brought director of soft porn Tinto Brass . So when Guccione felt that Brass's work was not explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly. <br /> <br /> Viewers who watched the edited version may wonder about the reason for all this upheaval. the original cut will quickly realize that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a huge amount of nudity, and this remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian and straight sex, eccentric sex and a great orgy complete with the dance of Roman guards thrown in for good measure . The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation on the agenda. In a particularly disturbing scene, a man is stabbed slowly to death, a woman urinates into her corpse and her genitals are cut and thrown to the dogs. <br /> <br /> In a documentary accompanying the DVD release, Guccione says he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula - and what little we know is questionable at best. In addition, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace in Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly oriental, strangely scenarios and space age costumes offered by the designers. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, these sets and costumes are fantastically beautiful, and although cinematography is commonplace at least it does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape reasonably well. The same can not be said for McDowell, but to be fair to him, he does not have much to work with. <br /> <br /> The film has an obscure fascination, but, after all, it's a weirdo, more interesting. design and strangeness flat-out than to content. Some of the bodies on display (including those of McDowell and Mirren) are extremely beautiful, and some sex scenes work just as well as pornography ... but again, some of them are so unpleasant that they can lead to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the movie weakens its eroticism. If you are willing to do it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
