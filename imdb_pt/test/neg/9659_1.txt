First of all, this movie is not nearly complete, my guess is that someone really bothered to steal all the other pages of the script. <br /> <br /> The film contains bizarre travels on time without warning, inconsistent dialogues, details out of place more, the music is not too bad, other tracks that are not put in the wrong place, plus the fact that the volume rises and falls between the different tracks. The cutting room has actually done a descent job, and that says a lot. Lost sound effects spoil the tension, however. <br /> <br /> Luke Perry does what he does best, just looking worried, and occasionally coughing up jokes from hell. <br /> <br /> I really rate this movie as the worst of 2007, and I've seen some bad ones. Do not spend money on it, it's not so bad, it's a laugh, it's worse. Ratings above 1 star should yield a blacklist on IMDb because it is a lie.
