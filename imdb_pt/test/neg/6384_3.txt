I saw this movie and, honestly, I was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie has no heart. I frankly do not care what happens to the characters until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was so much there that they could have done with the movie that they did not because they were so raped in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment about life, or trying so hard not to have them characters and history were completely lost in all this. I saw another photo of this director and I really enjoyed it. But I felt this movie lacking in the whim and heart of the other and I was wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it made no sense. Honestly, although I did not feel like ripping my hair out during the movie, I remorse the time lost in the little sad movie. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly I did not.
