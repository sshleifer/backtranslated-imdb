This is a difficult movie to judge. Although deserving its 3 (or maybe even 2), for a film by Al Adamson, it is exceptional - and pretty much the best in Adamson. That's because, unlike many Adamson films, there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost seems competent. But being an Adamson movie, you know that sooner or later, that kind of crap SHOULD come back to your ugly head! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a bizarre cult leader from a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy that looks like it's made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the cult guy has a heart attack and taken to the hospital. He apparently dies, but it also appears that many of those hospital scenes are missing and some of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the movie, it seems to have recovered - only to hear after it died. Because the guy is b.f.f. of Satan, however, his evil soul can not die and he returns to haunt one of his henchmen and to possess nurse Sherri. <br /> <br /> Now Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady - demonic possession. or not. Sometimes she acts like a zombie and in others she is violently homicidal. So I ask ... "Why did her boyfriend (a doctor) think that this was, perhaps, problematic ?!" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he does not get an exorcist nor commits him to the hatch !!! Oh, and speaking of breasts ... this movie is NOT the sex full of breasts that the title and the posters indicate. Although there are some naked breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and are only seen very briefly (Â½ second or more) in all but one scene. So if you're a pervert, this movie is not for you - although a few places in the movie (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the movie may have once been conceived as a movie. If you are a fan of bad movies, however, there is enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that are not like zombies - and I'm not even talking about Sherri. Especially remarkable is one of the final scenes - I've never seen and heard any acting and dialogue in my life - and that includes the Ed Wood movies! There are also some cheaper touches such as the bad animation of the "green stuff", the doctor finds a nurse murdered but continues to investigate in a house where the walls are covered in blood (I would pick up a police officer ... better yet, <br /> <br /> So, despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson movie? Well, the story is not all bad and he was able to build tension very well. "<br /> <br /> In addition, the car accident, although irrelevant, went very well and was pretty much a budget for Adamson. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a good movie and most people would be bored watching. However, Adamson fans or inept movies will like it - it does some entertainment in a tacky way that will provide some laughter.
