I will not tell the story of the movie as some people do. I'm sure people who read this will know the plot. I also will not continue talking about everything that is wrong with this movie, because I will be here for a long time if I do this. The plot is typical and the special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie fan (as most of us here are) little things will bother you the whole movie and ruin the experience. If you're a casual movie watcher, who likes to have fun watching a movie, this movie is perfect for you, great fun. It would also be a good movie to take a partner to. Just not for us, the movies. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 10
