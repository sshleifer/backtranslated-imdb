This is really a terrible movie by any of the regular standards. Plot, plot, acting, effects, direction - I could continue. Suffice it to say that you are poor. However, it has a certain appeal. Many sex scenes totally out of context appear, it's fun to look up the references of Batman. Umm - that's it. Poor really, do not bother.
