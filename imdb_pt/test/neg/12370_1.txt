Without a doubt, this is and probably will always be the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune of seeing all my life. Take 5 wooden actors who were kicked out of school because they were so wooden that someone sat in them thinking they were a bench. <br /> <br /> Next, add a cheap camcorder. You know the old types of VHS that cost 20 pounds on ebay. Add a terrible plot without effects and yes you have this movie. How shocking it was. They could not even save him by having a girl in shape. She was fat and ugly and the worst of them all. I really watched it all as I could not believe that this crap was already funded. <br /> <br /> MISS ALL THE COSTS
