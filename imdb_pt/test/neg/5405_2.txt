Scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery and, while cleaning a vase, are attacked and killed by a mysterious being, the Skeleton Man. Then a military squadron commanded by Captain Leary (Michael Rooker) looks for two groups of four soldiers each that disappeared in the jungle. They face the Skeleton Man, firing at him as he kills each soldier. Then the Skeleton Man goes to an electric power plant, and Captain Leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being. <br /> <br /> I bought "Man Skeleton" on DVD expecting to see a funny rubbish, but I found a very annoying, annoying and nonsense crap with sprouts and blasts. The imbecile story is totally disconnected and makes no sense, and the military team is made up of jerks, who insist on firing on the supernatural Skeleton Man until they are totally slaughtered. Their leader is also the most stupid, with the explosion of an entire facility at the end to destroy the supernatural blow of the alien warrior Predator. On the DVD, you can use the fast forward button throughout the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
