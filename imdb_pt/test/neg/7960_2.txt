The water shows the situation of the Indian widows in the late 1930s, says that ultimately the problem still exists at the end, refers Gandhi several times in the film before finally having a scene portraying it and does nothing extraordinarily innovative or new in the movie. Yes, cinematography is pretty impressive, but that can not be the soul of any movie for me. <br /> <br /> India had several problems like many other countries, but got rid of many of these problems in general. What if a film is made about racism in America in a given year, which ends with "a number of Americans still experience racism today"? <br /> <br /> a) How would that be relevant, and, b) How would it be something so extraordinary to be portrayed in the cinema? <br /> <br /> One view I read of a Deepa Mehta interview was that this film is being interpreted as a voice for the marginalized everywhere. From comments I've read everywhere, the common thing I'm listening to is how the director did a great job and was brave in bringing a problem to the world. The film is more about a specific problem that a society faced (and got rid of the reforms in general). <br /> <br /> I do not see anything shattering the movie. In addition, the film had no soul and changed between the plots of Chuiyya and Kalyani. Sarala, the young actress from Sri Lanka, portrayed the role of Chuiyya superbly and that was the only thing that impressed me about the film, unfortunately.
