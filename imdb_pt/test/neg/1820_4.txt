It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre movies? Judas Kiss has several wonderful actors, an intriguing storyline and intriguing twists, but his strange visual wandering and court editing ruined what could have been a great criminal drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? Why did he suspect the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly could not tell if the director wanted Judas Kiss to be a legitimate criminal drama or an exaggerated parody. Why else would he shoot a topless / alien / lesbian porn scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me fight for remote control since my kids were playing around!)? He purposely instructed his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use the terrible New Orleans accents? Like Alan Freak, I confess I still think Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a way, tired, "take-it-home-and-keep-home." <br /> <br /> Judas Kiss is not a great movie, but it has some intriguing moments, but I do not recommend it unless you're trying to dive into Alan Rickman.
