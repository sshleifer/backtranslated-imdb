I went to the movies to watch a preview of this movie without knowing anything about it. Recognizing the name of Jennifer Lynch and seeing the 18-year certificate, I realized that it could be disturbing. Actually I found the film a farce. I found myself laughing in disbelief through parts of him. The acting is atrocious - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous contorted face. I almost feel sorry for the actors, since the script does not offer them any chance of interaction with characters. After some shocking incident, (there is plenty to "tempt" and shock the viewer in this movie), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. Everything was exaggerated, or I thought I was being smart when it really was obvious! The performance of the girl's character named Stephanie was the best thing in the movie. Quiet and intense. I really could not recommend this movie to anyone. Its violent pointless, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and silly.
