Wow, what's that on the shelf of the video store in front of me? Nothing but a questionable "sequel" to 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definite ending and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, from the outline of the plot, an American diplomat, David Huxley and his fiancee, Tish Harrington, venture into the underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary, to find out who is blackmailing -with a porn video made with a prostitute, Risa. The whole story is based on several characters that make up these various sex clubs and strip joints across the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish discovers that the money of the ransom for the video and (essentially later in history) his fianc√©e, who came out of his trust fund, is basically returning to his future husband as the story. unfolds to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> I did not like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM. The only thing close to the original is the kind of thriller it was, the fact that David wipes out some kind of slavery contraption on him to keep him prisoner looks like the bizarre world of the first movie, and the fact that the whole movie has sex stamped on almost every major scene. Otherwise, it's a totally different movie. It made a terrible love story, even before the end was known, which made the ending more of a possibility because I did not believe the words coming out of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that could get him in trouble. There were scenes of ridiculous nudity at most of the "shocking" moments of the movie, which were trying to shake the emotions. in the audience to cheer for Tish to discover the plot so she can let this "infernal" sexual debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the DVD menu screen is nothing more than film with naked women to make the DVD look totally provocative. <br /> <br /> David was not a heroic person throughout the movie. You could imagine that it was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which could explain how they managed to get many of them undressing to gain "respect." There were plot holes (how did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father, getting the lease they wanted when David was so involved in this damn investigation to try to find a prostitute?) There were extravagant tech moments (like the mail dressed as a bondage queen), and a gay sibling character who did nothing but show how the director was trying to get an imitation of Joaquin Phoenix to play this character. The slogan presented in this profile for this video is also complete, because it was not a last breath. No one really dies. But they had a good sequence of car crashes that came out of nowhere ... but that was a good 10 seconds lasting an hour and 3/4 long movie. <br /> <br /> Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. It is one of the best and most original films of Joel Schumacher. You have everything better about this from this movie. I would not recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples with oranges.
