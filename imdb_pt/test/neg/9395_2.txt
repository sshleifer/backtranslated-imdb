This movie was completely harmful, unsettling and unsatisfying. In addition to some good photos from Italy, there is nothing to recommend this movie. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence - the next guy you know, with whom you sleep after knowing for a few hours, it must be Mr. Right. As for humor, there are some in the film, but I can not see how anyone could label this as a "romantic talk", since about three-quarters of the film is totally depressing! My recommendation? Hop in the theaters, wait until it comes out on DVD and jump there too. I want somebody to give me back the two hours I missed watching this dreck, drivel, scum.
