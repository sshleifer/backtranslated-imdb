Someone told me that Pink Flamingos was, in a word, "insane". Now I'm doubting if this guy really saw it, because that's not how I would sum it up in one word. Disgusting, absurd, disgusting ... would do that. Every time you think you can not get dirtier, that happens. One of my "favorites" was when Divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to blow up, they were slaughtered and eaten by the guests. I admit it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque that you just can not look away, but this is by no means a creative work of art. It's pure shock value. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this makes the Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.
