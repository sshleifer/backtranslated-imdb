Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in "cliché" cliché horror cliché with a more thriller-like rhythm. In a way, Acolytes is very successful, but in many other respects the film fails miserably. Acolytes generally avoided the typical archetypes of the ingenuity and innocence of the youth of endless horror films such as Cabin Fever, The Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films in which naive and innocent teenagers and innocent, have sex, run screaming and one by one are ripped off by some kind of monster. Instead, that innocence is replaced by pride, retaliation, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so because of their own personal demons. In the end, you got the feeling that there were (and maybe not) innocent victims. As the name implies, the film also touches a lot in following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of whether the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a recurring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Through all of this, the filmmakers also incorporated a lot of clichés, which I suspect are intentional and gave the film a unique blend of depth as well. as superficiality that I found intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters who, at first glance, are very superficial, but as the story unfolds, it becomes obvious that they are at least the two main male characters quite complex. <br /> Technically the movie has many problems, however. Cinematography, which is typically considered highly, I find quite sophisticated and overly stylized, using 2/3 stereotyped approaches very rigidly. Many transitions I felt were also super stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also widely used. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation to achieve a distorted ending that was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. The methods used to solve the climax are cheap and poorly prepared, the motivations are routinely unclear, and the main points of the plot remain untied at the end. Overall, the relative originality of the film, the themes and theses are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, overly stylized images, inaccurate motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists held only by lack or information. <br /> <br /> If the movie was better performed, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes gets only two stars in my opinion.
