I really wanted to like this movie, but the pace was too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a cool story, but it was like watching a slug run. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been better served if it had a little more action. I do not want to say anything grand, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It could also have been helped by songs that define the tone / mood of the longer periods that were missing in the dialogue. It's been about 10 years since I've seen it, so maybe I have to give it another try. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or 1/2 (of four)
