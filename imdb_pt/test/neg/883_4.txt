If you read the book before you see the movie, you will be disappointed as I am. The book was great and I was sure after watching the preview of the movie that the movie would be great too, however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters like. The movie is short and they never really make us feel like these people were really in love and they felt like they were single. Even if the film did not go in the same direction as the book, at least they could make the romance between these two characters seem more intense. I think Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry, but they did not develop a story long enough so we could see how they longed for each other. The book was a true love story and I think this movie could have been so much better.
