Carlos Mencia just is not funny! Your show is painful to watch because of it. His sketches / parodies are all very awful, and this really seems like a filler for the Chapelle Show, which though I'm not a big fan of it, it's a lot funnier than this crap. Carlos Mencia makes the speeches stupid and often he depends on finishing his monologues with a delayed voice and "der der der der". It's not funny. Often, when you talk to others, you make puns. They are horrible and painful. When people do not laugh, he blames them ... because someone laughs, he's not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does in this program, it's amazing that anyone under the age of three watches it. One of my least favorite things he does is wet all the threads and make it sound like a joke! I hope this racist idiot gets taken out of the air as fast as he can because he's dumbing down a broadcaster that does not have to be stupid anymore.
