I was looking forward to it, being a big fan of the book. However, when it came out, I remember thinking it was one of the biggest waste of money and time I spent in the movies. <br /> <br /> In principle, the performance, the sets and the music were excellent. , and are the main reason why I'm rating this as a 4. <br /> <br /> In this version, Sara is a bit self-sacrificing for my liking. There was no way to deliberately lie to Miss Minchin to prevent her from punishing the other girls; in the book, she makes a point of describing the lies as "not just more vulgar". <br /> <br /> There's also a lot of a Disneyfied end for me; Sara's father came back from the dead and they all trotted towards the Indian sunset. Although the book has a happy ending (and critics might say equally improbable), it does not make you think, "Oh puh-leeze." <br /> <br /> The only real things in the book were: 1. Sara's father being a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father ("You're learning me by heart I do not know who you are, but I do not know who you are. "3." Sara's friendship with Becky and she's 'adopting' Lottie (although the latter has not been developed as much as it could have been). Changing your room by adding several luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core - a rich girl being thrown into poverty all of a sudden - is there, but that's all it is. <br /> <br /> People may say that this adaptation is more for the younger crowd. Possibly. All I can say is that I have two cousins ​​- ages 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this movie until they read the book. <br /> <br /> If all you want is a 'feel-good' family movie, then this provides. If you're looking for a movie that tells the story of A Little Princess (actually, if you've read the book already), do not waste time on this movie. It's a shame; with a cast like that, if they had stayed at least in the basic story, this could have been fantastic. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about "read the book" and "read the book" that bit too much? Most likely But if someone tries to adapt a book - especially a classic - to a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. Preferably, more than once.
