I'm not sure if this comment contains spoilers, but I'm protecting it by pointing out that there might be spoilers. Regardless, it is unlikely that anyone watching this movie is unfamiliar with the book. <br /> <br /> There is an old dirty word about working hard and bringing a mouse. "Comanche Moon" is like a mouse. <br /> <br /> The novel focuses more on the Indians than on the Americans. In adapting it to the TV, McMurtry and Osanna correctly argued that the public would be more interested in whites than in reds. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel that we do not know about Gus, Woodrow and his friends. So the film gives us a preensah of what will happen in "Lonesome Dove". The Indians - who have their own story to tell - are largely relegated to the background - so much so that someone who has not read the novel will surely wonder why it is called "Comanche Moon." <br /> <br /> The novel does not have a general plot, or much of a "dot". This could have been fixed in the film by further attracting the contrast between the Indians losing their lands and the way of life for the invading Americans who bring "civilization." This opportunity was lost. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Lonesome Dove," "Comanche Moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. The extended scenes with the Indians were largely removed or shortened. And for a four-hour (liquid) film, it's incredibly episodic and agitated. One gets the impression that the script was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs. <br /> <br /> The script is mainly composed of dialogues, aphorisms and cliche clich√©s. Coming from the author of "The Last Picture Show," it's a surprisingly poor script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to solve problems with history and characterizations, but they could not. <br /> <br /> Some of the best dialogues in the novel are missing or altered for no obvious reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred of Woodrow (Jack) by condemning Gus (Ennis) for always running away to get his "pard". That little revelation of Clara's sexuality disappeared. Then there's the scene in which the Woodrow ur-dense warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon "compromise" her. Exchange in romance is shorter and harder; the film dims him and does not portray Woodrow as the emotionally stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (When I read this scene in the novel, I wanted to punch Woodrow's stomach-or worse.) There are other changes, some of them understandable. The Inish Scull eyelids are not cut; doing so would have required expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! (It may not have been reasonable to ask Wes Studi to rummage through such a large prosthesis.) And the Buffalo Hump character is "kind and gentle." He is not nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this almost turkey is the remarkable performance of Steve Zahn - not so much as Gus McCrae, but rather as Robert Duvall playing. Gus McCrae. Is weird. It perfectly duplicates Duvall's mannerisms and manner of speaking, without ever appearing "deliberate" or self-conscious. As it was Duvall, he's totally "inside" the character. And he really shows us Gus becoming "more Gus" in the third part. The best thing about Comanche Moon is that it will not spoil our affection for Lonesome Dove, not just a Great Western but a great American movie. <br /> <br /> PS: For those of you who think Rachel Griffiths was at the top - that's how she was in the book.
