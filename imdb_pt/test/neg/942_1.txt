I do not see anything funny-even remotely funny-in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, silly and ridiculous idea - completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted in any college. Even harder to believe is that no one closes the place. The actors portrayed characters directly from Characterville. We have seen it many times in many movies. Nothing new here. I found her on TV late at night, and since there was nothing else, I watched the whole boring, stupid movie. What a total waste. Maybe if you're a teenager, you might find it fun. Movies are made for an immature mind, so teenagers, go ahead. The rest, not at all.
