I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the trailer made it look so cool. But the fact is that this film is boring and totally confusing. There is no plot, and half the film is fast and flashing at football matches. Photos with zoom, which do not offer an overview of the games. I was constantly looking at the timer to see when the movie ended. <br /> <br /> There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound !! The soundtrack is amazing! ................ Do not expect anything from this movie.
