I was once a big fan of Olsen. I received this movie when I was six and watched almost non-stop until I was nine. So he stayed on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. I am wordless. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve-year-old children who are sent to spend Spring Break in Paris with their grandfather ambassador. Along the way, they find, as might be expected, two beautiful French boys who show them the most fun side of Paris. I think the two boys were fine, false French accents aside. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and the humor is superficial and tacky. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two superficial girls with lots of makeup on their face. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie if you do not enjoy the Olsen twins or family movies.
