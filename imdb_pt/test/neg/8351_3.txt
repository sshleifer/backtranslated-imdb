'Volcano' is a B movie, at best, and at worst is more of a disaster than it should be portraying. To be fair, you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for an important concept. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the boss of the Office of Emergency Management, and he's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue that the script provides. However, Anne Heche gives a frighteningly bad performance as a clever geologist who becomes the loving interest of Roark (while the city is burning, natch). Gaby Hoffman goes from the Field of Dreams and American President to once as a whiny, needy daughter and victim of Jones' life. Don Cheadle can sit in an office and call Jones, doing the work that Roark really should and should be doing. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie really begins to fade when Heche's geology partner arrives. They suck in a lava vent while they are invading the subway lines. The speed increases when Jones begins to suggest that they use buses to dam the flow of lava flowing down the street, the geologist from Heche (who likes to give a talk to everyone about The Science of Geology) being apparently oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and melts metal, and rock, and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect. It begins to suck when the film portrays Rodney King's racial tension between two malicious actors dressed as policemen and a rabid black man who can not understand why the fire department is busy with this great river of fluid lava. But in the end, the three will be working together to build a K-rail dam to prevent lava from eating their neighborhood, even if the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used does not stop. washes anyway. Also, K's rails are hardly watertight, but I think lava would not think of stuck its head in the openings, not when Tommy Lee Jones is looking at it. Do not even get me started on subway car stranded subway, where a tunnel of hot lava is coming down, but interestingly, it is not too hot to try a rescue, there is too much smoke to see, and there is no poisonous gas for everyone can breathe. This should be LA Lava or Lava Lite. You know, he eats cars, but it's environmentally friendly. <br /> <br /> There are pure camp moments here that almost make you wonder if this was supposed to be a comedy. For example, the two bodyguards who pack the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch have a completely senseless and absurd talk about weight, and in the end, as soon as the little boy Roark / Jones rescued, he notes that they all look alike when covered in ashes. the storm erupts and cleans everyone - and then the sun comes out and Heche says something like "aw, shucks, Roark." <br /> <br /> The 'Volcano' almost reaches the status of Battlefield Earth, but with the exception of Heche, no one comes close to Travolta evil and the technical aspects are treated very well. If you're from the LA area as I am, it's funny to think of a lava flow destroying the Wilshire Boulevard. I gave you three for the effects and the little tension you get out of it.
