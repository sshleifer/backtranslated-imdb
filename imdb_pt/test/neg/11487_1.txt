It will be hard to do this fill 10 lines ... But barely try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake I did - to watch this movie (horrible and annoying). <br /> / I like Patrick swayze - he did an excellent performance in films like Ghost - Dirty Dancing - Point Break - North and South (TV series), but in this movie ..... ARGH .... This movie is so booooooring, the acting is horrible - the script sucks - well ... I can not even find ONE good thing, nothing, absolutely NOTHING I was watching with two other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most annoying movies we've ever seen, and the fact of which lasts more than 3 hours (which we did not know) - when part 1 ended and said "continue", we almost cried "nooooooooooooo, we have to watch 90 more minutes of that movie !!!!" It's painful to see this movie: at no time do you get the impression that the actors are Russian, the action scenes are The only good scene is when th The truck explodes at the beginning of the movie! The rest is CRAP! Go clean your bathroom instead of watching this movie (and do not come running, crying if you see this movie - you've been warned!) Personally, I would recommend Patrick Swayze to call his agent and make him remember that movie . so bad.
