There is nothing new in this movie. Nothing you have not thought of before, nothing that you have not heard before. The story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be approached in many ways, and this film chose the most demagogic and muddy. One of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it's neither a movie nor a documentary. The director used the transcripts from the original interviews and made the actors interpret them as if it were a movie. The result is strange. And finally, I read in previous reviews that people who do not like this movie are anti-gay. I'm sure those comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but do not tolerate that other people do not like this movie. This is a funny world.
