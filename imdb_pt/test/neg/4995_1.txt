I can not give less than a star, I tried. At this point, I'm not sure if I'm halfway or not, but I stopped paying attention actively in the time when part of it was revealed as a dream. Or not. Or maybe it was. I think viewers who posted a comment that did not include the descriptions "horrible" or "horrible" or "made me want to swallow a bullet" are probably being cool because it's an indie movie. Do not listen to them, listen to me - there is no nudity in the film, skip it. I needed ten lines to send this warning, so I'll also tell you that the goth girl some users described as "hot" is fat. She has fat elephant legs.
