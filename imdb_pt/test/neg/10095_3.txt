"In the sweltering summer of 1958, Deuces, a gang of Brooklyn thugs, find their territory threatened when the leader of a rival gang, the Vipers, is released from prison. Leon (Stephen Dorff), the leader of the Deuces, tries to steer but when his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sensual - and dangerous - relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), the sister of a Viper, and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked, Leon and his gang are steeped in a total war to save their brother, his girlfriend and his neighborhood! According to the DVD cover description, this is definitely not "Basketball Diaries". in this as "West Side Story" being hit in the head with baseballs and steel tubes, stickball having left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some cool Hollywood sets, 1950's cars and soundtrack songs; and a lot of this is well photographed by John A. Alonzo The story and direction never goes beyond these strengths, which allows the film to increase during the initial minutes and proceed down the hill. The cast looks good when you read the credits, but does it translate into a mess, flaccid aging of fake tufts, blood and Brylcreem? and a wig of fear. A sense of sadness and regret permeates production. Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
