If good intentions made a great film, then this movie may be one of the greatest films ever made. The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme - at least one significant theme, a tone of existential exhaustion of the fifties, aerial scenes that should have excited the senses and the imagination, and characters that one could imagine . deeply cared for. It is about patriotism and patriotism in a healthy way. <br /> <br /> Not ten years after the movie, I knew Air Force officers who taught my R.O.T.C. classes at the university. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have a sense of humor. One had been a member of the crew on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. I wondered if any of them died in Vietnam. I imagine they flew missions there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie fails. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling and celebration of patriotism itself that underlines the narrative. No actress was worse used than June Allison in this movie. His Susan Holland is a woman who would run away, not hug. Colonel James Stewart (who at the time Colonel) makes a good attempt in the role of Lieutenant Colonel (and later Colonel) Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing he does on paper is bite a sandwich. I'm not kidding. Stewart was good at biting sandwiches like The Spirit of Saint Louis. <br /> <br /> One might think of Ted Williams, but not when I watch Mr. Steward on paper. I think of William Holden as Lieutenant Harry Brubaker in The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who seems to be lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> Filming a B-36 looks like an advertisement from an airline. Although beautiful, the aerial shots are worldly. For now, they may have impressed viewers. The accident in Greenland involves uninteresting modeling. You expect the result to be good. The tone - the subtext - for the film expresses the boredom Air Force crews must have felt during their long missions and banality that the Air Force used to do business - good business like any other business. Imagine how a director of La Nouvelle Vague can explore this theme and then start thinking about how someone with imagination could have filmed this movie. Few moments are lost. When the crews returned from long missions, the crew received a dose of scotch and a massage before questioning the mission. Showing that this might have helped. Banality was the image the Air Force wanted, and Mr. Mann accommodated the army. Maybe in that sense, the movie works, but not for me. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry when I watch the movie because I think we all, director, actors, staff, viewers and members of the movie. the armed services might have liked to give and receive far more than we got here. <br /> <br /> I do not think this movie was Dr. Strangelove or 2001, both presage, but he had potential never realized. I still like watching. I think of airmen on their long missions and on earth teams in isolated places. There is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and I celebrate that honor. <br /> <br /> I certainly understand why the people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it. If there were no intentional fallacy, you would receive 10 of me. <br /> <br />.
