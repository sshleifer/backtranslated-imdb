When I first saw this series, the impression I had was that the characters were charming and funny, Lorelai and Rory, in particular, were witty and intelligent talkers, though a bit too talkative. After watching it for some time, however, my opinion has changed. The main characters slowly turned out to be self-obsessed narcissists, who treated minuscule wounds of their pride as the worst insults in their lives. existence. For example, Rory had not talked to her mother for months, when Lorelai did not consult her about her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai left Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to the new circumstances of her life. These people are superficial, they see themselves as the center of the universe where all others must behave exactly according to their own rigid rules and, if they do not, they will hold grudges against them for an eternity. They do not want to see other people's problems and treat the slightest mistake as the most serious offense. Most characters do not seem to have the ability to behave in an adult way. They think they should do whatever they want and everyone be cursed. <br /> <br /> The series is based on characters, so when the main characters became so unpleasant, the show was also impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt I'll finish watching them. I will also consider anyone who thinks much about the program and its terrible characters with the greatest suspicion - they must be as horrible as Lorelai et al.
