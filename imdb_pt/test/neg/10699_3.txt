Most of the time, I considered this movie unworthy of comment, but the last 10 minutes led me to write one. You see, then we learn (SPOILERS ... if they can be called so) that the Devil's emissary has no chance to properly prepare for world domination by his master because he is not skilled in martial arts! "Prosatanos" has been in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to free him, but is defeated in a one-off match against former 54 year old karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would have happened to him if he had assumed Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
