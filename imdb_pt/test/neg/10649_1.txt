The Cool Review Joe - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> Starring: Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> Synopsis: This follows a timeline of the lineage of the Merchant lineage, which began with Phillip L'Merchant, who created the box that opens the door. to hell. Beginning with the eighteenth century to the present, when Pinhead meets Merchant and tries to break the lineage ... (he's the only one who can stop Pinhead, see you) and finally in the future, in space, where Paul Merchant finally discovered how send Pinhead to hell forever. <br /> <br /> Inaugurators: This is a movie hated by both the people who did it, and declared that the fictional director Alan Smithee would be the credited director. They just take Smithee out of the woods when they really think they've made a terrible movie, like classics like The Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I did not invent that. How did I like it? You're reading this, so I'm sure that's what you want to know. <br /> <br /> The Good: This movie is not as bad as you were led to believe. Oh I will not coat with sugar. This movie was filled with a lot of potential and ended up being a disaster, but it has some good points. Cooler cenobites this time for beginners, like the twins and the demon Angelique. Pinhead is still in a lead role, and still has good lines ("Pain has a face, let me show it to you") and it's a bit of fun everywhere. Gorehounds will love the movie because of its endless offer. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you have to look hard to see it. The Chatterer Dog is amazing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: But for a story about Hell against the accursed Merchant lineage that could close the portal forever, it was very complicated and kept together with duct tape. Nothing was really exploited to its full potential and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnaps a child and holds him for ransom! Random deaths only present more blood (not always a bad thing, but not because of the story). Pinhead is in his worst place here, he complains and complains even when he is about to die! For the very clever demon he used to be, he was reduced to nothing more than a Bond villain at best. If Hellraiser fans always needed a reason why he was taken back to a similar role, that's it. Runaway line for us all. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin tearing, piercing, hook impalement, beheadings and more goodies. The Chatterer Dog, though incredible, smells of bad special effects during the chase scenes. Final Verdict: This movie had the potential for something grand, up to Hellbound levels of greatness. But all this was wasted. Who knows exactly what happened to produce such crap, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to the rest: This movie is the worst of the Hellraiser series. Only for finalists. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 of of *****
