Not plotted, OK; it's not a character study, fine; there is no action, alright; does not make sense, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in Palistine and parts of Israel today in a state of violence, petty disagreements, deep hostility, and so on. But for the most part they are long, long scenes of nothing happening - or things that seem to be dripping with meaning (a checkpoint tower falling to the ground, a Arafat balloon floating in Jerusalem, crouched female tigers dodging bullets into a halo) but when you try to derive some meaning, it does not exist there. <br /> <br /> Bonus: You can watch this movie in rapid advance and it will not make any difference except that it can be a little less boring.
