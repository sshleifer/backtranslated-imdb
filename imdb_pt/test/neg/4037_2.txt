I let a friend convince me to watch this movie, and all I can say is - I want to kill this friend. <br /> <br /> This is an hour and a half of my life, I will never go back and I will always regret it. <br /> <br /> If you also had the bad luck to see this movie, you will agree with me that this is absolutely the worst movie ever made, EVER! <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie and are thinking of watching it - let me spare you a waste of time and warn you: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, SUCK !!!! <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails, the attempt at comedy and sensuality - this ends up being stupid, worthless and disgusting. Try to have women in the movie who are really attractive and sexy and not fat, ugly and thick to look at !! <br /> <br /> The acting is laughable as is the writing. Obviously, this was done by total amateurs, I can not believe these people could make such a stupid movie, is not there a law against it? There should be. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good "b" movies if you like that kind of thing, but do not waste time on this low quality movie. PEACE
