Scarlet Dawn launches Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron rudely dislocated by the forces of the Russian Revolution and now has to defend himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. It is also not very suitable for any kind of real work. Doug could have been caught by the Reds, but by the fact that his former maid Nancy Carroll did not denounce him. Nancy has a great passion for Doug and they get married once arriving in exile in Istanbul, which throughout the film is referred to by her former Christian name of Constantinople. They get married and calm down, with Doug now reduced to washing dishes. <br /> <br /> But Fairbanks' ex-lover, Lilyan Tashman, who is always playing bad girls in a movie, sees him and offers to go back to style. he has been accustomed to being part of a fraud against American father and daughter tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. <br /> <br /> Thankfully this movie has the incredibly short run time of only 57 minutes, usually those that were given to B westerns because they are tedious and melodramatic. The ending is pretty unbelievable. Doug knew he was on a Thanksgiving special and really struggles to cover up the flaws of an unbelievable story. <br /> <br /> What I did not understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why did not he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? It did not make sense to me. <br /> <br /> I would only see it if I were a dedicated fan of any of the top players.
