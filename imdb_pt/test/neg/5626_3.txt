That the Ring of Freedom has probably been made with the best of intentions, but it sends a curious mixed message to the final product. <br /> <br /> The people of a western town, where the railroad is passing, are overwhelmed by arrival. of immigrant railway workers, working on the railroad being funded by baron thief Edward Arnold. There are some ranchers and farmers whose lands are on the railroad track and these people are summarily treated by Arnold's hired men. One man who will not give in is Lionel Barrymore whose son is coming from Harvard to a lawyer and ready to take up the farmer's cause. <br /> <br /> Only Nelson Eddy decides that the best way to fight is to go Zorro on the bad guys. But unlike Charles Butterworth no one knows he's the Wasp (a very interesting choice of names along the way). <br /> <br /> What Arnold did is to use the tried and true methods of the political chiefs of the East, making the immigrants vote. Nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants only knew the truth about what an evil Arnold is, they will vote with the original settlers and bring down the alien urban political machine in their midst. He kidnaps editor Raymond Walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive papers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railway workers are a veritable bunch of immigrants, not the West Irish or the Chinese working to the east as history has. It's a real UN working on the Arnold railroad. The workers are kept on the line by foreman Victor McLaglen and Nelson has the unenviable task of beating a few senses in him as John Wayne did in The Quiet Man. Of all the films that starred Jeanette and Nelson and they certainly having entered the story as a duo, this was the worst of what they did at MGM. Nelson is about to be hanged along with Barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best, but certainly nothing is worth hanging. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's girlfriend, saves the day with a version of My Country Tis of Thee with which the immigrants come together. In the face of a revolt he pays for immigrant voters, Arnold rationally packs up and leaves the city to build his railroad elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding, that's the end here. What's the message, to vote with the settlers and lose their jobs with Arnold? But will you somehow get here? <br /> <br /> I wonder sometimes if 20 years after the incidents of this film happen and the city settles in a quiet and sleepy place of the west, while some cities where the railway passed are now cities, which the good citizens of that city did not rethink what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they would probably put him on a barrier. <br /> <br /> Nelson is naturally in a good voice and has a variety of popular and popular pieces to sing, including a ballad for immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg. , Where else but here. The song is a sincere tribute from an immigrant who did good in his adopted country. Too bad you do not have a better place. <br /> <br /> Nearly platinum blonde Virginia Bruce, I'm sure it's dubbed here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was so happy that she was not following Nelson on this trip west.
