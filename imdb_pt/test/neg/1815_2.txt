After seeing the film version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I've lost 100 minutes of my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how badly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he left out many bits of important information, the cast simply did not seem to fit into their roles and the whole movie seemed very emotionless. The book portrays vivid scenarios and details that are completely disregarded in the film. <br /> <br /> You'd think a director would be able to fit 76 pages of a book into a movie for at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's bride is indifferent to the fact that Kurtz died, he completely modifies the end that the book had given. Not to mention that the scenarios and scenarios used in the film were not as beautiful as they were described. Sincerely, it seems that Roeg was filming another story with references of Heart Of Darkness embedded in it. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie without knowing the title or expect it to be something like the Joseph Conrad story, you may find it good. Although I thought the camera work was bad and the cast was inappropriate, it's a catchy story anyway. However, if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, do not look for it in the Roeg movie.
