I saw this with high expectations. Come on, it's Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, who are all incredible in their comedy, I was actually waiting for a riot to laugh. Unfortunately, this is not what I have at all ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. There were times when I laughed at one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. In short, it was an attempt at comedy and, in a way, a little aspiring to Hera Pheri. Of the top three, I think Paresh Rawal's role was the most powerful. It was not the biggest role, but certainly stood out more than Govinda or Akshay. His performances went well, I think. Nothing special, just mediocre. Although Govinda stole Akshay's spotlight on more than a few scenes. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta also make appearances in this film, and both were very bad. Lara's role did not move me, it did not make me laugh, and the character of Tanushree Dutta got on my nerves! Music seems to be the only good thing about Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Tere Bin", followed by "Afreen", which I really enjoyed. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" also deserve to be heard. <br /> <br /> Either you'll like it or not. And judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction, I do not think you will.
