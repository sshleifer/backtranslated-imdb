"The Racketeer" starring Carol (devoid of the "e" which usually appears at the end of her first name) Lombard as a woman expelled from society because she left her husband to a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who became an alcoholic careless and divided between her love for him and the interest of New York crime boss Robert Armstrong (top-billed). It's pretty much a compendium of what was wrong with the early talkies: rigid steering, still cameras, theatrical performance and ridiculously slow delivery of lines. At the time, the sound crews were telling the directors that their actors would speak each line and not start talking their own line until the previous actor had finished theirs. Made about five years later, this might have been an interesting film, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows the dictates of his sound recorder and systematically weakens the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had when watching his later films. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that despite the problems of transition from silence to sound, however, gave us some legitimate masterpieces ?? "Hallelujah!" De Vidor, "Applause" by Mamoulian, "Hell's Heroes" by Wyler, "Ladies of Leisure" by Capra ?? all of directors with strong enough wills to tell soundboarding dictators to fill up and let their actors speak and act naturalistically. Too bad Howard Higgin was not that strong; as it is, watching a naturally fast-paced actor like Armstrong go through the ridiculous way he was told to speak, we can not help but wonder where the 15-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
