With the terrible acting, the terrible dialogue, the crowd of bad mood, the low quality plot and more terrible movie. This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king of finding bad movies. For the purposes, they just played false blood on people and things, did not take the time to create wounds and make special effects that are worth anything. Most people making low budget horror movies do at least something like tissue or something to make a sore. The dialogue was far from decent and the acting had no direction or effort. They just played some actors on a set and said, "Do it." I swear I've seen better movies from my movie than I did at school. How did you get a DVD release?
