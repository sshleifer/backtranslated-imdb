I know it's impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But this movie changed almost everything for no reason. In addition, many changes have made history illogical. Some examples: 1) in the film "Paul Renauld" actually finds Poriot before dying (in the book Poirot only receives a letter), saying that he is afraid of being killed. This is completely stupid because, had Renaulds's plan succeeded, Poirot would have known that the dead man would not be Renauld (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs. Renauld identified the victim). 2) The movie "combined" two people into one! "Cinderella" was removed by the film. The girl Hastings falls in love with and Jack Renauld's ex-girlfriend is one of the people in the movie! Why, for God's sake? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is a lousy golfer. Totally boring and stupid. 4) The movie tells the secrets very early (for example, at the beginning). So you know things you should not know. 5) The killer is shot at the end by a person who does not exist in the book. Maybe because the person ("cinderella") that stops the killer does not exist in the movie. 6) The book is very complex. The movie takes only 90 minutes. Of course it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but it is impossible to include stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (eg bike race).
