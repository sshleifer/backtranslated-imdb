it's embarrassing for me to have about 3 minutes on the way to a job to stop at the video store and it was 2 for 1 night and I was really intrigued by the 'nekkid' photo of the 'star'. <br /> <br /> I think this movie shows what the New York Film School and Mr. Father's fortune-judging by the biography of this clown in the lead-can do for you and you and why it's about that we have here and, moreover, a photoshopada photo of the main "actor" with the body of another person in a still image that does not happen anywhere in the movie. it's a strange cause, in many ways, that he had money thrown at him obviously low-budget buckets, but from the start, when all the extras are laughing at his horror scene, that would not bode well, he might have had some charm if had been made for 2 cents! Before long I skipped scenes and quickly stepped forward to see the image in the box that was all I really cared about. Strange, why do not I rent a porn or something? But wow, there is bad acting that is funny, I think and bad acting that is just bad. robert englund is quite pathetic in this along with everyone else. It makes you appreciate the most not so straightforward horror video that is out there. . . blah more than I would not bother. Should have watched uh hellraiser 3 if I wanted to see a pack of 8! I imagine that old, horny gay guys with 2 minutes in the video store are going to be the top tenants of this and should start class action!
