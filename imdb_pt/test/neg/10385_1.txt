As the metaphorical flies fled from this steamy, steaming stool of a movie, I felt like joining them. <br /> <br /> From the opening phrases, you soon realize that the actors are untalented. The script editor was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest, I could not finish this movie because about twenty sad minutes at the sight of the lead actress running down the floor like a Shetland pony that was shot in the butt was too much for me to stretch. I've never, and I mean ever, seen a movie as sweaty as this and I watch tons of bad movies. <br /> <br /> Turd.
