First of all ... I've seen better acting and more realistic makeup on porn movies. How bad was "Chris Molting" like Stewie Ungar? In The Sopranos, Chris is not taken very seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then play "Bobby Baccala" as one of your Vegas friends. It's too much to watch a dramatic movie. No actor can handle a serious role and is more suitable as a second banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I wonder who made the makeup for this disaster? I want this person to be my makeup person for the next 25 years, so I'll never grow old one day either. So that's all I'm going to write in this movie, since it's not worth wasting much more of my time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
