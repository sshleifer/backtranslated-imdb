I read several comments that ask the question "Why was this movie made?" I myself found that question hovering in my mind as the hour and twenty-minute appeal seemed to crawl in the middle, just to express the feeling that it was steaming at the end, when in fact it was not doing anything of the sort. So, "Why was this movie made?" I think it's a great question for those who are watching Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves. This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood and inspiration with this all-male choir, but I do not think Jensen has done enough to bring an exciting story to the table. Let me put this question to you: "Do audience members need more in a documentary than just a direct story to keep interest"? My answer is yes, and that's where Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from great. Jensen did a horrible job with the history and dedication of affairs. It was great to hear the songs, but over time, these songs seemed annoying, impressive and a bit precocious. From the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts in a blinding snow, I knew I was addicted, but as the film developed, I lost interest. Because? Jensen never took us, members of the audience, to the next level. He kept the level of the field of play and ended up harming the overall tone of the film. Was this a movie about the music or about the men of the choir? Again, I would like to say that Jensen did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who definitely saw difficult times and how they dealt with it through music, but it was as if the all male chorus was a bunch of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music superbly, but it was the characters, the subjects, that I knew nothing about until the end of the movie. In the mix, we had a 97-year-old man who still had his driver's license, we had a big man in a bathtub singing classic American songs, we had old men who were gay in their youth, we had some tension between the choir's youth and the veteran singers, and we even had an ex-drug addict who was only clean for eleven years. Jensen developed these interesting stories? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk more about it (see the politician who missed his political days), but Jensen seemed to move away from those sincere moments and go straight to interesting places that he could have the choir sing. For me, the song was set at the beginning of the movie, I wanted to be introduced and listen to the stories of these individual men. They were all catchy, but Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> In ignoring the main subjects of this documentary, Jensen was not successful in creating any kind of tension in the end. Without revealing the ending, I felt as if Jensen was coloring the lines. Instead of being daring out of the lines, he chose to create no moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen took our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to get involved in any form or format. I can see how the national feeling made this film a huge success in Norway, but for all the other watching (ie ME) more was necessarily needed. I wanted to feel for these guys. I wanted to know if they would do well when they traveled or if they met loved ones in their own city. There was no history, mainly in part for any development of the subjects. When you watch modern documentaries (strangely, this movie was made in 2001), you want it to appear in a similar way to any feature film in Hollywood. You want suspense, realism and drama, unfortunately, with Heftig og begeistret you can not get anything of the kind. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to ask the question again, "Why was this movie made?" My final answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how difficult times and a changing economy can still produce happiness even in the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human dedication and as something as simple as singing can unite a population. With that being said, Jensen proved perfectly in this film, but he did not create a good documentary. When you make a film of this nature, I feel that you should look inside the group, examine the choir participants and listen to each of their stories to bring about an ending that will grab your heart. The only thing this movie grabbed was my attention as it tried to leave the room at a rocket speed. Again, I do not want to sound negative about this movie because the music was great and the singing men brought a sense of honesty, but I needed more. With documentaries becoming a milestone in the film community, we expect a little more than what Heftig og chicistret has conveyed to us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and dance! <br /> <br /> Grade: ** out of *****
