I think South Park is hilarious, and I have no problem taking pictures of the people on the left, but you think that after making an entire movie to attack celebrities by risking their careers in an illegal war, then being GASP right, they would have the good sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. Bush seems to have a free run for these guys for being as stupid and messy as he is. <br /> <br /> Gore is a fair game, but, please, what do Republicans have to do, how bad do they have? to the country before these guys finally act as if maybe they were not just trying to do the best they could, and that they made some real mistake ... or maybe go after the limbaugh rush ... hes a good target .. or even make fun of the teeth of the condoleeza rice.
