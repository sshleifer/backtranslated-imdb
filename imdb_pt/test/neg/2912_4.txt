Let's Get Tough is one of those movies that people will probably regret for years after they did it. Filled with racist jokes and Japanese jokes, this East End Kids story details how the kids want to join the army to defeat the Japanese. Since they are very young, they decide to cleanse the city of these cowardly Japanese. They find one, throw fruit at him (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls a small sword to threaten them! The cops say to stop annoying you! He's just Chinese! He's on our side! When the children come back to apologize, the Chinese man is dead! It's all part of this huge Japanese and German spy ring! Children take care that this is interrupted at all costs! I'm sure all this was fine when it was done (1942), but seen now, you realize, of course, that this is clearly a product of your time. Full of stereotypes, Germans and Japanese. Funny how the East End Kids have a black kid in the group, and he's not spared either. Gee whiz.
