Miscast, misdirected and atrociously written, this is watchable if you have an hour or two to kill or are suffering from insomnia but only. Robert Carlyle fully realizes his potential as an actor of supreme mediocrity, with only one expression in his repertoire (that of a chronically constipated soccer hooligan tending to an incapacitating complex of inferiority), which he can sometimes alter slightly by dilating his nostrils and opening a row. (to indicate anger, tenderness, sadness, surprise, horror, hilarity, compassion, etc.). In his role as "the best naval engineer in the UK" and the son of a university professor, he is as convincing as My neighbor's cat. Tom Courtenay, equally mischievous, dragging and hailing every line, appears permanently enveloped in his eyes, and would no longer seem able to distinguish a flood from a puddle of his own urine if he were there. All in all, another silly attempt on the part of the British to imitate the Hollywood pulp in its majority of trash. Dialogue is a series of ill-delivered cliches; action is disjointed; the plot is useless and amputated; and the characters, if you can call them that, do not even reach the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
