In Los Angeles, alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of functions not only qualified to get enough money to drink and play in horse racing. Her main and unique goal is to write and be sexy with dirty women. "Factotum" is an uninteresting, senseless and extremely annoying movie about an irresponsible drunken bum who runs a couple of days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and play and is fired immediately because of his reckless behavior. According to IMDb, this character would be the fictitious alter ego of author Charles Bukowski, and based on this story, I certainly never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, it is best to watch the touching and heartbreaking "Ironweed" of Hector Babenco or "Storie di Ordinaria Follia" by Marco Ferreri, based on the life of the same writer. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum ?? Without Fate" ("Factotum ?? Without Fate")
