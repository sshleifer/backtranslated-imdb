It takes a huge suspension of disbelief when it comes to Will's "genius." Not only in mathematics - it is also very well read in economic history, capable of shrinking several psychiatrists, etc. etc. No, no, no. I do not buy. While they are at it, they may well have it wearing a large "S" chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets. Among other problems ... true genius (to file the problem at present of what he really is, and if he deserves such a meaningless homage) simply does not appear / ex nihilo /. It is not so multifaceted. And it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries. <br /> <br /> Better to have made Will a basketball prodigy. Except that Damon is too short.
