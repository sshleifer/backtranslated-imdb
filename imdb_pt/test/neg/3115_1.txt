Of course, there are stupid Hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring holiday, but these movies do not even claim to be serious works of art. But when someone struggles for greatness and poetry, but delivers a confusing (and often ridiculous) story, a lot of different scenes, pretentious dialogues ... So you get the worst kind of movie that some other critic has very accurately defined as " pretentious". crap. "For those who find this film clever or even masterful, I can only say - it is your intelligence and your imagination that you have obviously used to try to make some sense of this regrettable attempt (it is our human nature to try to understand things) <br /> <br /> One more thing: I can tolerate political imprecision very well, I am all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the female Slavic character was simply too much.I would like someone to tell the director that he is mean ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art film) portraying a Slav woman as a half-disjointed and disheveled creature tied to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that she had spent all her childhood. staring at the stars and milking cows on a stool of three legs.
