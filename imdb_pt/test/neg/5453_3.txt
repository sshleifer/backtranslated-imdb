I never found out what the attraction of Karen Black was. She always had those round eyes and a kind of odd look on her. She seemed often eccentric or cast as the "other" woman. In this, she is the psychic counselor and specialist in the occultism of a bad producer of bad commercials while learning the astral projection. He's a stingy sucker, even without the new luggage. Apparently, this is the way to immortality, because if you get good at it, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I think Star Trek had a plot like this with Jack the Ripper, hanging for several centuries. Anyway, this guy is very dangerous. He has a good family and makes them unhappy. He starts killing friends, just because they have an unkind comment to them, or he does not like them. You can see the end coming from the back row in the left field. It's a very hard and humorless film. Most of it must be taken as truth. Why are some called but few chosen? I found it long and not very satisfactory.
