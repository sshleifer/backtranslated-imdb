What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson), let's see ... a package store owner tells him "it's getting dark outside", to which he responds "does for better ......... 'night vision". What the hell does that mean? In fact, what the hell is this movie trying to say? There are plot holes by which you can drive the killer's van. Not to mention a drinking cop on duty, Robert Forster sleepwalking with this bizarre attempt to take advantage of the serial killer's madness, and a murderer filming his murders. That's all I remember. <br /> <br /> The movie happened in Texas, had some car chases and a clich√© ending. Maybe if someone watches this movie with their eyes closed - can it be good? After all, without being able to see it ... it would be better for the night vision. Did that make sense? No. And not even this movie.
