The Gun is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very poor, the dialogues sound as if they were written by a 13 year old teenager, the plot (which plot?) It is another "suspense" in which it is very difficult to enter. Finally, nothing in this movie is good. A big affection for all involved and particularly for the Montreal Film Festival that presented this film IN COMPETITION!
