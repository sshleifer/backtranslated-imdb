... but had to see how bad this could get. The plot was thin to begin with, but it continued to worsen. A genetic engineering student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male because a biological weapon used in World War III killed 97 percent of the world's male population. The survivors are high-priced gigoloos in alley clubs or crazy crazies in football stadiums planning to overthrow the "Lesbian Conspiracy." The whole process resembled the microwave of a large bowl of gelatin. Press a few buttons and ding you receive a baby. Not only that, but it will age until the mid-1920s in a month, and then it will begin to age normally (as convenient). Eventually poor Adam gets bored with the isolated cabin in the forest where his breeder created it and steals his car to 'see the city'. <br /> <br /> This starts 90 minutes of improbable chases, convenient twists and various subplots that we never see resolved. As Adam quickly learns, what men have survived is treated as outlaws, because they are dangerous beasts that can not help the genetic predisposition to violence. The propaganda machines are at full throttle, scaring the women and believing that all men are rapists and murderers. This led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of Christianity, female reproduction via cloning, and world peace among other implicit results. All this seems unlikely, considering that only 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to another, being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to actually do much on his own. With the FBI in its wake, madams looking for fresh meat and its creator trying to recapture it (by itself, it seems), he discovers that violence is not limited to male species after all. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> I liked, however, the portrait of Veronica Cartwrights '' love to hate her, '' director of the FBI, and Julie Bowen did nothing wrong like Hope. hetero 'geneticist cabinet' as well.
