This movie is exactly like Ridley Scott's "Someone To Watch Over Me," which is a classic. It stars Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers and the bandit of Fugitive. It is a quality film, with good direction and great acting. This movie is the polar opposite. It's the same plot, just minus any good acting and adding direction of TV movie. I have to say that I like the interaction between Lowe and the woman. She's hot and their romance is believable on many levels. Unfortunately, this alone can not save this copy of the classic film Ridley Scott. <br /> <br /> Usually bad TV movies have some redeeming quality that makes them at least watchable. I think for me, the redeeming value of this film is that Rob Lowe and the main woman have chemistry. This and I could watch and compare the plot with another quality movie.
