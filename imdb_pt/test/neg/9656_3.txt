I can see what this movie was meant to do. Unfortunately, this never ends the deal. The "crime of reality" aspect works well and the shots are all top notch. In fact, some of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a sullen way. Remarkably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beaten woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and his father tying flies. Occasionally, some scenes get too much in dialogue. Instead of showing the viewer, the writer treats much like a book. But the real problem is in the issue. The story does not flow. You can not make a whole of the sum of the parts. In the end, you are confused as to what is really going on. Those who enjoy this kind of detective film like to follow, setting up the puzzle at the same time as the main characters do. With such a bad edition, it's hard, if not nearly impossible, to do that.
