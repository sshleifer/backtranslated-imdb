This soft-core / sci-fi SOFT B movie is what you would get if you took an early Fred Olen Ray movie and got the fun out of it. Or, conversely, it's like a 'movie' by Uwe Boll, but without so much ineptitude. A young nubile gang member (C.C. Costigan) agrees to pose as a space marshal in order to stop Kim Dawson's crazy plans of ... making everyone else have sex with everyone else apparently (that vile devil). Anyone who has entered this movie in search of serious science fiction, well, you get what you deserve for not doing any homework on the film. First of all, when Kim Dawson NEVER starred in anything other than a crappy Skinamax level. For that matter, take a look at the curriculum for Costigan and the director before you beat up by saying that you expected something else. Do not get me wrong, for a space / action / soft-core / titillation movie, this movie STILL is not good, but if you expect something like "contact", I do not feel sorry for you. <br /> <br /> My notes: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw: Starz-on-demand (available until December 8, 2005)
