Is this a bad movie? Do not take my word for it. Consider the following press reports from people who tried to watch this movie: As he watched this film, the brain of Mr. Harold Faber of Sandusky, Ohio, expelled by force of his skull for more than 200 km / h and preceded himself squirm on the floor screaming NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. Mrs. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a retired 69-year-old housewife, performed seppuko ritual with a butter knife while watching. Janine Hosmer, of Columbia, South Carolina. South, gave birth to a severely deformed baby while watching this film, although she was not pregnant. As they watched this film together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Francisco, California, exploded spontaneously with such force that Mr. Wells's left tibia was later found embedded in the wall of a home in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who have not suffered any more serious effects, as detailed above, at least 75% have become incurably, violently and understandably insane after seeing this film. Of the remaining 25%, most had already been insane before watching the film; the remainder were blind and / or deaf or in a persistent vegetative state. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying you do not rent, if you want. I'm just reporting what was in the papers.
