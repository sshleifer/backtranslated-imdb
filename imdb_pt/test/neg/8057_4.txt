This movie is about the painful journey of a young man to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and unpretentious. It does not depend on spicy sex scenes to attract viewers. Although the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times, some events are not explained correctly. I can understand this, because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director. The subplot of your sister and mother probably does not have to exist in the movie, but I can certainly imagine that these are very important events in your life. <br /> <br /> The film's low budget is clearly noticeable. . It's a shame that the sound effects are poorly made. The narration and some dialogues (particularly the scene in the classroom with the French teacher) have much echo, which makes it difficult to understand what is said. The ambient noise, the remarkable noise of the traffic, is also captured throughout the film. When one scene splits into another, the noise level of the traffic changes. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably not fun, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embrace his sexuality.
