Excuse me, but my tongue was also on my cheek when we shot this piece of poo. As the evil sister with hair that Mommy would envy, I did my best to channel Tim Curry in Rocky Horror. I'm sad that this has not happened ... Ah, well, a friend compared it to a "SHOWGIRLS bottom fund budget" with a warm white spoon. I'll have to settle for it. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that nobody mentioned the endless (and monotonous) wet t-shirt contest. It's seriously the biggest wet T-shirt contest in movie history. And the only one where competitors wore industrial cotton polyester shirts that defied every effort to make them wet and translucent. <br /> <br /> And no one caught the director's participation as the guy on the pay phone interrupted by our hero? With the line "Are we filming yet?" Clearly audible? Jeez, this is the bad movie sky for the REAL aficionados ...
