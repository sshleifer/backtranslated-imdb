Clearly this would have potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's record, it would have been surprising if there had been any merit to this farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes are a classic monster movie madness. - even the horrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe-type soldiers feel they've been taken from another venture in the same genre. <br /> <br /> You will be doing yourself a favor by getting out of the movie right now. . You have gone through all the highlights and you will have saved yourself from the suffering of going through some of the worst performances in recent history. <br /> <br /> Then enter the absolute rubbish talent. The protagonist has the same amount of charisma you will find in the garden slug. <br /> <br /> There is a strange piece of invented romance - it seems so wrong that you can only speculate why this scene was conjured up. first of all. Usually, the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject a bit of humanity and sympathy into other characters cut out of cardboard - here it backfires on all cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action unbelievably boring. Where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget constraints - here it seems that everything was spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There is, in fact, redeeming features here - not even the "it's so bad it's almost good" applies. It's bad, and in a bad way. <br /> <br /> Our hero questions the main actress about the night they spent together and how she would rate him. She gives him 2 out of 10. I give the whole case 1 (I would have gone to 0 if that was possible). <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this dribble, there are many Crap cinema out there, which exceeds this ridiculous bang in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Oh and finally the movie has little or nothing to do with the popular game Far Cry (at best it is extremely loosely based on this.) <br /> <br /> Horrible, follow in front!
