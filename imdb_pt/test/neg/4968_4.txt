How could this get a rating of 6.0? Do we, as horror fans so accustomed to horror movies, feel so bad these days, that when someone shows up and repeats 'only a few', redeeming qualities, we get very excited and give a note that it's just a A little too loud? The director has a certain visual talent. There is no doubt about that. But among some decent photos he forgot a good story, humor or scares. He had a very slow first act, a lazy murder scene, boring, boring characters and a very stupid and unbelievable touch. And what about the portrait of American teenagers in so many of these types of movies? Do they always have to be so stupid, annoying and so superficial? I do not remember teenagers being like that when I grew up here in Holland. All things considered, in can not give this film anything more than a rating of 4 out of 10.
