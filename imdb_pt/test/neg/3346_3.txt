I really want to believe that the above quotation (specifically, the subtitle translation in English), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter that a publisher sends to the protagonist, was made to be self-referential in a language spoken -chek way. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently forgot to inform the actors about the true nature of the film. They are so terribly serious in their interpretations that I have to conclude that Carax really takes himself seriously here, or else he has so much disdain for everyone, especially the audience, that he can not be bothered to let anyone into the joke. Some authors are able to make oblique and bizarre films because they do so with personal and unique style (eg, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach as they weave surreal elements into the story's plot (eg, Krzysztof Kieslowski and David Cronenberg's less bizarre later works). In Pola X, Carax throws a disjointed mess in the viewer and then dares to find flaws in it. Well, here it is: rhythm is erratic and agitated, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; there are superfluous characters (for example, the gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are exaggerated; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the often discussed sex scene; disjointed scenes are put on the film for no apparent reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> In order not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there have been some edifying exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonic industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex in which the main characters retire in the second half of the movie (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's 'Factory' of the 1960s?). Much of the field photograph was beautiful, an obvious attempt to contrast with the grimy city settings. And even in middle age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has 'that'. His performance was also the only one among the main characters that did not sank into bathos. <br /> <br /> There was an earlier time when I would consider these films as "Pola X" more charitably. Experimentation is admirable even when the experiment does not work. But Carax does not try anything new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from numerous previous films, and after several decades of film viewing and literally thousands of films later, I just do not have any more patience for that kind of non-original, badly crafted trivia. At the beginning of the 21st century, the question remains: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is there a director in France who knows how to make an assistive film? Rating: 3/10.
