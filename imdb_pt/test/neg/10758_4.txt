As anyone can praise this raw version of the movie after seeing the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, it is beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> Myra is far from the role played by VIVIEN LEIGH in the film. redo She plays an average American girl with a Brooklyn accent and the "Yeah" answers are a bit shocking when one is expecting a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in the final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is incredibly unlikely as a soldier in love with her no matter how many times she disappoints him. BETTE DAVIS is not part of anything. <br /> <br /> Your melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the movie are unbelievable (extravagant pieces of overacting) - even considering the fact that this is more difficult. version of the story when the sound was only a few years old and silent acting was still the rage. <br /> <br /> Just horrible. And it ends abruptly with Clarke losing his life during a bombing on the bridge. The End. <br /> <br /> There are none of the beautifully shaded performances in the remake of the 1940 MGM, including a supporting cast of the pound sterling. Instead, this is set up with low budget production values ​​(and I mean a shoe string budget) without any subtlety. And there's no pre-code bravery in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she should not marry her son, Roy. It simply says, "I got you on Waterloo Bridge." Explanation terminated. Nothing daring there. <br /> <br /> In short: at least once, the original is not the best version. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR were never surpassed like Myra and Roy in the 1940 film classic.
