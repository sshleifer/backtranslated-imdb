I'm Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I love all the comments. Some were not far enough. <br /> <br /> The movie premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was packed with friends and family. We all applauded. <br /> <br /> Five days later, he was removed from all Bay Area screens. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in hearing some scene detail per scene, you can make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know. <br /> <br /> We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen holding the radio transmitter on Bud's deck. House. <br /> <br /> Or how Gideon spread the bomb in the original version. <br /> <br /> It did not help. It still bombed. <br /> <br /> Bring it.
