Spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre: despite being a comic magazine very well made, this is the first series that added a real psychological depth to the main character, had a complex moral issue, characters and also highlighted social and political issues. in other words: Spider-Man was the coming of comic books. This TV series does not have all these components. It's just a good TV series that suffers from obvious budget constraints that make the action scenario moderately stimulating. Spiderman's nylon belt is as convincing as the cardboard stones in Star Trek. Nicholas Hammond is too old for the role at that time. I think he was in his thirties, where Spider, the man was really teenager at the time. For some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book, which again resulted in the tension between the characters basically disappearing.
