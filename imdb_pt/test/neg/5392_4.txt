Dear Science Fiction Channel: How have you been? How was your summer? I've been fine, but I feel like our relationship is not the same anymore and we are separating. I do not understand why you do not love me anymore. I just watched your SciFi Channel Original "Skeleton Man" and once again you demonstrated a blatant lack of respect for my feelings, killing ALL THE HOT GIRLS IN THIS MOVIE !!! I mean, I understand you're just at it for instant gratification. All that matters is to produce a film in which people are sliced ​​and bitten by a spirit / creature / legend / anything homicidal indigenous. So you really do not have time to think and work on anything else - like finding a fantasy for Skeleton Man that does not make you like Skeletor's gay lover "He-Man." Seriously, his cloak looks like a satin sheet and his skull is flat like a baby's, he almost looks like a Halloween killer to a 6 year old boy as he marches through the woods in a homicidal riot. So we gave it a bone, because we're not looking for Oscar-winning performances, intriguing plots, or realistic character reactions to the situations in question. Because we realize that although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls have to be trained as Special Ops agents, they are mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops, who can not shoot or see right whenever Skeleton Man appears. And we also hope that nothing - bullets, explosions, electrocution, anything - can kill Skeleton Man until there is a minute in the movie and we need to find a way to tie things up perfectly. We hope to see blood and courage. But you have the knack of attracting the least attractive actress from the entire cast and making her the only woman who survives. And honestly, I think you do that just to antagonize me. Because this movie, as silly as it may be, has the potential to be a classic "so bad it's good" and killing all the cats ruin everything - and forces me to lower their rating. All I ask is that once, just once, you take into account my feelings and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. Please.
