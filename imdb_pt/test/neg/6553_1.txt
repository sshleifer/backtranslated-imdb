Sherman Hemsley was great at Jefferson and especially at All in the Family. He was also very good at Amen, why the hell would he do that movie? This movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does the best he can, but this is horrible. This movie was the beginning of Sherman Hemsley's bankruptcy. I think he's very funny, but this is a terrible and meaningless ghost story. Stay with the Ghostbusters.
