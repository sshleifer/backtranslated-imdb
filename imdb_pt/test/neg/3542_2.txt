This is awful even for a TV movie. I can not believe it took three people to write this movie. I'm not familiar with the novel on which this movie was based, but it has to be better than that. I'd rather watch a "Full House" marathon than this stupid movie. I gave it 2 out of 10 stars just because it was done better by commercials.
