Macbeth's story was one of Shakespeare's most successful ever written. This may be due to some characteristics that put him near the genre slasher, murder, murder, kill, kill, blood gallons, a tense sexual relationship between the main characters etc. More than that, the original game is very attractive taking in considering the extent (it is only half the size of Hamlet) and the focus on Macbeth, for whom we are constrained to care, despite its bloodthirsty nature. The game seems ideal to base a movie. It is not so long that it gives directors the ability to explore their various levels, a good actor can play the role of his life, the film has a deep meaning in any historical period. Unfortunately this was not the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version comes very close but insists too much in the medieval period. Welles's film is very personal, with an interesting twist in relation to totalitarianism, the TV version of 1990 is very superficial. This 2006 movie is no exception. It's a long way from a Shakespeare movie, but it's interesting to see how the director understood the story and where it put it in contemporary life. No knight in shining armor, but gangsters in shiny cars. Many drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original game. Macbeth's idea is so simple that in order to implant it in modern life, it does not need Shakespeare. The worst part of the movie is the lines. Most moving scenes in the play, such as the dagger scene, are trimmed so much that they appear to be useless. Replacing the knocks on the door with doorbells and horses with cars seems funny. If they wanted to make a movie about power and their temptation, they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a loser with a brain injury, not a valiant, brave, ambitious warrior who wants so much power that he is prepared to kill and is caught in a web of fears and despair. The film does not make clear what leads Lady Macbeth to madness, does not give a reason for some of the characters to fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascension to the throne, which has no throne and everything) and puts Macbeth in an uncomfortable position, since the leadership of a gang is so far from royalty as this whole movie is far from any Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two overlapping ideas that never get to become a movie that ultimately is useless ... Do not get in the order of your way, but go!
