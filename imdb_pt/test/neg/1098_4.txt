This movie is very similar to all other modern horror movies. It is predictable in how it accumulates and progresses and can never bring something original or shocking to the screen. This is really the biggest disappointment of the movie, which overall still had a promising main concept for such a movie. <br /> <br /> You can call this movie a great cliché of modern horror movies. It has all the elements that make modern horror movies not so good to watch. One of these aspects is a little boy moaning and very naive. Why do they keep putting that sort of thing in the movies? The same goes for the kind of aspects of drama that involve the family. It simply does not work for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. Instead, it often causes the film to drag in parts and become annoying to watch. So you have all the clichés present, but you can not bring any of those cliches to the screen either. Like a horror movie, this is simply very poor. It does not handle horror or tension very well. For fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. The film its story is not very well connected and develops within the film. Often the movie sleeps in parts and does not allow its horror to begin to appear. <br /> <br /> The film is also often obscure (no doubt as an attempt to hide its relatively low budget.) and shows very little blood too, mainly due to the fact that you can not always see things so good. <br /> <br /> You can simply say by looking at this movie that director JS Cardone does not have much talent for the genre and does not know how to properly handle his current ingredients. He has made a few attempts in the past, but all his films have failed so far. he just keeps trying, unfortunately. Who knows, maybe with the right people behind the cameras (like Tobe Hooper, who was initially nominated for directing) this movie could still have been decent. <br /> <br /> It's a badly made movie, with most unknown. in that. The film's biggest name is Ben Cross, but its role is very small and in some ways also not relevant enough for the film and its story. It did not even seem like he had a lot of fun playing. <br /> <br /> Just skip this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
