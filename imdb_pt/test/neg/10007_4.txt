"Tokyo Eyes" tells of a 17-year-old Japanese girl who falls like a man being hunted by her older brother who is a police officer. This lame film is about 50% filling and 50% talk, talk and more talk. You'll see the cast of less than three stars as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and cut their hair, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on the phone, go out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something happen. The fine thread of a story is not enough to sustain a film with low end production value, a sparse cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just incessant yadayadayada'ing.
