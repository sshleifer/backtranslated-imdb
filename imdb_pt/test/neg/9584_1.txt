This is a miserable movie, a suitor to a genre of amazing films. And a genre that was made much better before. The plot goes on, with a predictable ending. (Yawn) Characters are unpleasant, and some are so unpleasant that they are almost impossible to find. Matt Dillon, a good and intense actor is totally misled here and is hard and polite. The others are forgettable. Much of the dialogue is sophomoric, again a suitor trying to be witty. I would not hire the writer to write my shopping list. Yes, it is so bad, turning from the misogynist to the simple brute, as well as beyond the house of the fraternity. With so much real talent out there, I'm really surprised this movie was made. This shows the total lack of imagination of office suits ...
