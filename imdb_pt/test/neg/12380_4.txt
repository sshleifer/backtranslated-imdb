Personally, I have no problem with the acting, nor with the script. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was just awful. Pure and simple. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is to roll around when you see yourself. What were they thinking !? Budget be cursed. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. <br /> Of course, in my opinion, if producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then they would have the special effect that people would create beast. Oh well. What's done is done. This will be the case of the eternal joke in them that was not intentional.
