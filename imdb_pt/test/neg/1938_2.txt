I did not watch every episode of idiots. It was slightly amused if nothing else was happening. But after watching Jackass # 2 I liked Bam and Dunn. They had a good attitude on the film's idiot, so I figured I'd call the live Bam. Boy, I was wrong. Seriously, you could pair up a lot of 2'graders, provide them the same budget and I bet they could knock something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At age 23, where most people are tuned in, you give us that crap. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so forced. You do not know the characters because there is no attitude. You can not appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone for that matter. If only there was a tiny nudge of thought. Anything we will not forget as soon as the next scene continues. <br /> <br /> They finally manage to make a good photo and you like what's happening. You sit there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some idiot closes the scenes with two phrases and a bang. Was that the end of that shot or what, please? If I was there, I would freak out and laugh. Do some insane things and have my adrenaline pumping, but these guys ... Just stupid scripted reactions. <br /> <br /> Yes, they laugh at the audience with cheap crude jokes, or gigantic jokes that, in my opinion, are such a waste of money. Many normal humans who were not brought under the wing of Jackass could, in the blink of an eye, write a much more entertaining script. Or impress with the visual camera work. Even spontaneous guys who want to be smart without a script would pull a better job. MTV could, on a whim, bring more comforting material onto the screen. You just need to dismiss the writer of this stupid show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes really require a little courage and therefore, 2 stars.
