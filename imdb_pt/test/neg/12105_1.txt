Almost a class on how not to direct a movie. From the misinterpreted and often incomprehensible script, Dr Rey draws on a number of wrong decisions that make the film an unbearable viewing experience. Unfortunately, the film never goes beyond an old-fashioned, almost misogynist type of gay camp where women are forged, OTT and middle-aged, and men are young, empty and always in search of sex. The director was unable to cast the tone of the film or the level of performances. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a lot of 'acting' going on. Dianne Wiest slides in a pale representation of her performance on Bullets Over Broadway and poor old Jane Birkin in her attempt to make a comedic performance. Although you have to pity her, as there is very little real comedy here. The whole thing looks like a very low version of Merchant Ivory's Le Divorce which, to be honest, was not good either.
