I watched "Deadly Voyage" because David Suchet was in it, after enjoying it in the series "Poirot". And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I walked into the movie with an expectation of being a potentially valuable movie. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. <br /> <br /> I will not bother criticizing the performances, the rhythm, the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on these elements. The only thing I want to address is the film's message, since it proclaims in the introduction that it is based on a true story, and in it is pending the supposed importance of the film. <br /> <br /> "Deadly Journey" focuses primarily on an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the United States because he believes he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less - your motivation is totally selfish. (Of course some people will prevaricate saying he was doing this for his family, but in fact he decided to have children with the income he could earn in Ghana, so he actually created his own problem.) To that end, Kingsley decides to to board a Russian freighter bound for New York. In the process of doing this, he faces harsh conditions, racist crew members and other challenges. <br /> <br /> But that's where the movie makes me unfriendly. Why should the public care about Kingsley? Simply because it has a purpose? Objectives are not such a rare good that your superiors should be privileged, say, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn son. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US government. It is also illegal insofar as it steals from the Russian shipping company. If he arrives in the US, this would entail the withdrawal of a system he did not place. And if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $ 45,000. I very much doubt that any of the clandestinians mind the course of action chosen for the other; they are clearly out for their own gain. He could have spent the $ 1,000 he won on the lottery at the beginning of the movie, for legal passage to the US, and applied for residence and work permit. Instead, it takes the illegal (and dangerous) route. So, since Kingsley's trip is illegal, selfish and can not be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because it faces challenges? Why should their challenges be privileged above the challenge of the Russian shipping company to reach New York without clandestine passengers? Why is he black and the shipping company white? The reason seems to be that Danny Glover (executive producer of the film) and other involved want us to cheer for Kingsley, as if he were a hero on some kind of noble journey. But once you accept that illegal immigration, robbery and the mission of a fool are not noble, you can not really care for him. <br /> <br /> Before anyone plays the race card, I guarantee that I Feel the same, no matter what ethnicity / nationality the parties involved were. Imagine if a Briton decided to get a train to Bhutan, sneak across the border and collect "unwanted" Buddhist antiques to bring back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy the challenges he faced can generate? Very little, I'll bet. So why do we feel different to Kingley? Why is he black? Why is he poor by American standards? Filmmakers are betting on us by sharing their views that the ends justify the means, and that a trucking company fined $ 45,000 is irrelevant compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled worker gaining a little more in the US than he could have if it had just stayed in their own country of origin. I did not buy it for a minute.
