Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so filmed, the focus is not even on this so-called "real mestizo", it's more about the Hollywood team coming to make the movie. No cinematic significance, and if I could take back the nearly 1 and a half hours I spent watching this movie, I would feel so much better. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, it begins to give the impression that it will be filmed a bit generically, like a real Hollywood production. However, they enter the storytelling and are filmed so terribly. It's supposed to be a version of the "Blair Witch Project", since they use a lot of what you think is "real camera footage", is not it, make no mistake. <br /> <br /> Worst movie I've ever seen. . . On the plus side, it has a semi-scary scene, and the mid-caste visuals are not that bad. DO NOT RENT
