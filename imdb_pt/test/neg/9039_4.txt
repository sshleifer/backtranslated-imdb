You might think that a movie that starred three of the greatest male movie stars of the post-WWII era would have become a classic. These three who are also three of my favorites, walk in a state of torpor, looking like they would rather be anywhere but there. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that The West Way definitely had some potential to be a classic. In these days of political correctness, a film about the American pioneers and the difficulties of their migration to the west is something that is not done now. It should have been better done back then. Kirk Douglas is a former US senator who is driving a freight train west to build a settlement in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Being a former politician, he ranks above the hoi ploi he is leading. The script asks that he not only have a covered wagon, but a carriage to guide the train. <br /> <br /> You think it's ridiculous, you should see the whipping scene where Douglas orders his black servant, played by Roy Glenn to whip him. I'm not going to ruin it by saying what makes Douglas demand this from Glenn, but believe me, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is the guide of the track and the three stars he seems more bored. There would be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum just passes the film above all else. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the friction has helped a bit, because the film asks Douglas, a widower, Keep an eye on Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now she's the most beautiful thing in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film says the introduction of Sally Field. This was done between Gidget and Flying Nun days. She plays a piece of junk with the name of musical comedy Mercy McBee. We first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents' wagon, akimbo and inviting legs. Of course she accepts your invitation. <br /> <br /> Your character is something like what is found in all the RV parks in the United States and, again, what was a wagon but a great moving trailer. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, Sally Field made a career in the Oscars. What this woman had to overcome. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen's son, Andrew, directed this item and, along with a bad script, turned it into a turgid mess. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, he certainly made it better in his career. <br /> <br /> And so do you, unless you're a stargazer.
