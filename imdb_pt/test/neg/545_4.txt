The basic idea of ​​ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent - two very unhappy wives meet and decide to raise their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To cost even more costs, they receive two other strangers. What makes it interesting are the relationships before and during these holidays - in particular, showing how beautiful this setting really changes your outlook on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is totally undermined by two key cast performances that are so bad that they spoil the movie. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her look ridiculous. Her expression of "doe eyes" and empty stares really make you wonder if this is not a zombie movie or if she just wants to be an idiot! And to make matters worse, Reginald Owen plays such a detestable and bombastic character that I was very close to turning off the film - it was so horrible and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10 - which is very, very difficult to understand. Of course, the film has a great atmosphere and a good plot, but these two seemingly bizarre performances can not be neglected as they undermine the rest of the image. Sorry, but this movie was hurting for a redo!
