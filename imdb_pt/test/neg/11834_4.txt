Screen treatment of the Broadway hit "The Gay Divorce" (a title considered too scandalous for American viewers, although it was used in the UK) concerns a man and a woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) reunited in circumstances embarrassing while she in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, they argue, they compose, they dance, they argue a bit more and they dance a little more. Betty Grable is very attractive in a brief moment (singing and dancing in the number "Let's K-nock K-nees" with Edward Everett Horton), but the couple of stars seems distressed and unhappy throughout. The surroundings are sophisticated, but the characters are no more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 of ****
