The scariest thing about director Carter Smith's new horror film, "The Ruins," are the final credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What Stiller thought when he sank his money in this cooler over a cursed carnivorous undergrowth that infiltrates its victims and devours them. Scott B. Smith of "A Simple Plan," adapting his own bestseller, clings firmly to the standard cliches and conventions of all the scary 20-year-old sagas where reckless youngsters do everything except signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. . If the stupid characters are not enough to deal with this nihilistic absurdity, we will be yet another movie in which American tourists will find themselves in danger simply because they are Americans. In addition, unlike really good horror movies that explain why monsters need to feed themselves, "The Ruins" provides no explanation for the supernatural antics of their villainous vines. The set-up of "The Ruins" resembles the horror movie "Tourists" in 2006, where trapped South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and collected them into their internal organs. In fact, "Tourists" generated some legitimate emotions and chills. "The Ruins" does not generate anything in the form of emotions or chills. A malicious mastiff who suddenly enters the camera to attack our heroes is as close as possible. The rest of "The Ruins" is borrowed from another movie: "The Descent," an excellent 2006 chiller about a bunch of babies immersed in a nightmare experience when they get lost in caves inhabited by caves . albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other films that served intentionally or unintentionally also come to mind. They are the classic 1968 horror Hammer, "The Lost Continent," about murderous vegetation that threatens innocent bystanders in a sea of ​​abandoned ships and Roger Corman's cult class "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) about a florist of New York that grows A man-eating plant in his store ... "The Ruins" unfolds in scenic and sunny Mexico, where four American college boys, Eric (Shawn Ashmore from the films "X ("The Mistress"), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of "The Covenant"), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of "Sleepers") and Amy (Jena Malone of "Pride & Prejudice") are wrapping up their spring break in the form of tequila. Stacy loses an award winning earring in a motel pool, but a Teutonic tourist in his early twenties, Mathias (Joe Anderson of "Copy Beethoven") retrieves him, and the group embraces him as his newest best friend. These people live to celebrate and have made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his restless brother who accompanied a cute archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that is not listed in any guide. He offers to take them with him and they accept. <br /> <br /> First rule of horror movies: if no one knows about where you are going, it is advisable to avoid it. As they have only one day and have done nothing adventurous, our two couples, along with their Greek-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid. They take a bus to the hinterland of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A taxi driver looks at the map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to stay away, you avoid. A sharp twenty dollar bill helps you to change your mind, and he takes them to their destination and then slips in a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> So our heroes have found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth, which looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle, from which superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted and they kill Dimtri without fear when he tries to dispel his fears. The remaining protagonists rush to safety on top of the pyramid, while paranoids surround them to keep them from escaping. Eventually, the vineyards sneak in to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, "The Ruins" becomes "Bug", Ashley Judd's recent and ridiculous film about insects that lie under her skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other out in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. A particularly horrific scene shows the Americans cutting off the German's legs to save his life. In comparison, this causes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition to appear mild. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" classifies as just another mess with nothing to redeem it.
