This thing takes the adolescent genre excited, very little respected to begin with, and empties it completely into the toilet. The only people I would consider recommending it are teenagers, for a "revealing" scene in a men's locker room. And in the end I would not make such a recommendation. Doing so would contribute to the delinquency of a minor. An absolute piece of junk with absolutely no redeeming quality.
