I was pleasantly surprised by this. It's really very interesting and engaging. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields became an actress. The black and white must have released her, because I've never seen her in this command, playing a conventional character. If marketed correctly, it can be a medium-sized hit.
