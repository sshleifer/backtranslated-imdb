Worst movie ever seen. Worse also. I can not imagine a movie worse than that. Nothing to see. No acting. They should look for another job. I can not understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. It must be difficult ... I can not imagine how much your mortgage should be to justify the job! <br /> <br /> The women in the movie ... maybe it's better to stick with XXX. <br /> <br /> As for the leader man ... what a clue! He better be put in the lead and stay there! I can see him being more successful at barking than acting. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: Do not rent ... DO NOT BUY!
