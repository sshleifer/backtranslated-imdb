Just re-saw this last night and, to be blunt: "Style instead of substance". We can already imagine that there should be much more to Jerry Lee Lewis than what is shown here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis in this movie is not represented as a real human for a minute during all the time and a half more time of execution, but again, all the other characters are just a pencil stroke of being full cartoon characters . <br /> <br /> Let's get the start. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart approaching the black jazz club and we see Jerry taking inspiration. It may be possible. We see how the two cousins ​​choose different paths in life (also possible). So we cut to Jerry Lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it's exciting and a little scary. Cut to a scene where he meets his second cousin, Myra. From then on, the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events presented in a style commensurate with a high-speed newscast. <br /> <br /> Not that the film is not a little fun and it's great to hear new versions. of the songs that Jerry Lee did. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also one reason why you should at least take a look at it, an indicator of your biggest hits in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most famous character in the film. She jokes, she sobs, she chews chewing gum and plays flirtatious and that's about it. Never, for a minute, was given a reason why she ended up being the third Mrs. Lewis and talking about wives, where are the first two? That is why this can not be classified as a biographical film, but rather as an inaccurate news. We see Jerry having his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top 10, we see his third going to the ninth. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable fall. Absolutely, no basis in reality. <br /> <br /> To conclude another minor fight: The film takes place from '56 to '58 and yet Myra says: "I have only 13" to the end.
