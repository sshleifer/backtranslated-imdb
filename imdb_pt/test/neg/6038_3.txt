Friz Freleng's "Snafuperman" is one of the smaller short films of Private Snafu. A warning about the importance of studying his field manual, "Snafuperman," makes him point a little awkwardly. The story, in which the Technical Fairy, First Class, turns Snafu into a superhuman, in order to help him see the error of his ways, is predictable and bland. The first 'rumors' of Freleng's Snafu were full of ideas and laughter, but here the director is overwhelmed with a rather boring subject and he struggles to make a brief summary of it. Even with about three minutes in length, 'Snafuperman' seems to creep and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, looks like an instructive first and second entertaining film. Although they were eliminated faster than Warner's standard designs, Snafu shorts maintained a surprisingly high standard. 'Snafuperman' is a reflection of the kind of quality you expect from a group of less talented creative minds.
