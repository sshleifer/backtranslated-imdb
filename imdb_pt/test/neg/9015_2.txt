Another winner of that era of the 50's, 60, which I love so much for the comic value they give with each of those days. The Koran never leaves you with these movies, they take themselves seriously and have very low budgets, a recipe to watch for sure. Ed Nelson, a very competent actor started with Corman, as well as many other favorites appearing in Superman and many of the westerns of the day. The costume is really bad and the sound of the alien talking, well the reverb was a bit off, but that's the beauty of it. Making movies out of love, without seeking perfection, just starting the action of doing it. These movies are fun! Even better is the MST3K version !!
