SPOILER !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm .... I had just watched the nightmare in elm street movies and had just found out about Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi had not done any horror, so I registered. We saw "outpost" (mind ripper) we checked in my Tivo for it. There was a date in the air on Sci Fi. So I was set. I got my corn ready came and put it on the couch and what the hell is this? A daring guy in blue pants running around screaming! Nothing is scary about this movie at all! If anything is funny! Funny how low the budget is, funny how predictable it is, funny how bad the acting is and funny how much money it did not. Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this movie is dumb. This is so stupid. They killed him at the end and then they get on that plane and the "monster" is in it. They shoot him in the head with a shotgun and she falls to the ground a lot. And -GASP- The end of the killer is still alive! WOOHHH! Spooky! woooohhhh! Lucky fat bag of trash waste of 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: You have somewhere to go and you need to kill some time. Ripper of the mind is not the suggestion. I'd rather sit naked in the snow than watch this movie a second time. GENERAL CLASS: F - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNA)
