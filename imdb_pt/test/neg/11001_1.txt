I had to suffer with this movie three times while I was an extra zombie in the new movie from the director After Sundown. The first time I saw this movie, the director was standing next to me and an apparently fake and tasteless hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I could not take it anymore, I ended up laughing right in front of the guy. The film has no direction at all and the only thing that could make this decent movie (Female Nude) was far from being found. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but that was too much for me. The worst part was that I had to watch it so many times. Also do not expect the new movie to be better.
