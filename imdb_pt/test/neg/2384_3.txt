Talk about marketing. The poster / home video cover of 'The New Twenty' conveys a half-naked man on a 'Wolfe Video'. For those familiar with movies with gay themes ?? this conveys a "must-see." (I loved reading a reviewer (from another website) saying that they had been "cheated" when watching a movie "Sodomite." The slogan itself as the word "gay." The Lord gives you eyes, but you can not see ??) That said, despite the number of gay characters, stereotyped, no less (see: lonely gay, gay AIDS victim and gay arrested) is more about long-term friendship and characters who separate . In fact, if there is anything, there is more (here's one for Christians to complain about) heterosexual couples having sex out of breath, panting! Not to mention backstabbing, over drinking, and drug use. I see this more of a feat for the TV-Logo or Showtime movie than the big screen effort. Of course, I loved cinematography, some of the actors could act and I always love seeing a large group of friends who really act like they knew each other a million years ago. But we've seen this before. Nothing really "new" here. Just an original idea? then bringing back the same 'ole' I have AIDS, let's deal with it 'for much of the movie and the kid, our friend has a serious drug problem, but we will not deal with it until it's almost too late. That's so (US) 'Queer as Folk' and 'Broken Hearts Club', respectfully. The movie deals with a group of college friends, now grown up (in size, not minded) who have to grow up and each trying their best while they fail. Strangely, as in most of these independent films, the most interesting, at least to me, was the heaviest, Ben. He stole every scene, but then again, there was not much to do.
