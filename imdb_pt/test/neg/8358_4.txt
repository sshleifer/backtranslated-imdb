I found it almost impossible to empathize with Ricci's character in this movie. If she was to be depressed, I think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because Ricci's character was more of a selfish, worthless portrayal than a victim and a survivor of depression. The forced attempt of introspective narration was as ridiculous as the painful interactions between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I could not buy it. This is straightforward for the schlock video. I'm glad I did not pay to see this.
