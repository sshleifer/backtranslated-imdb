This movie is terrible - honestly. The acting is terrible, the script made me shudder, the effects are completely bad (which I usually do not mind in older movies, but this was done only two years ago), and whatever is happening irritates me. Some friends go out on Halloween to the forest and find a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before this has the clich√© "Do you really believe it? Ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged out for a while. The cannibal son of the witch was retarded (I do not know if it was for comedy or it became scary, but this movie failed in both). It has a minimum of blood and no nudity, which made a bad movie even worse. Heck, the only good thing about this movie is the eating scene of the leg, and even that could have been better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do not even waste your time watching on the cable, and certainly do not consider buying or renting it, otherwise you'll be giving yourself time to waste time that could be spent doing something more constructive or fun.
