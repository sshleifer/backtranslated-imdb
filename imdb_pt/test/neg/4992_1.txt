This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Boring, illogical, terrible. Do not waste a minute in your life to watch this crap! I hope that the directors do not make another film because this movie leads them to bankruptcy. The movie seems to be created in a day or two with some of the directors' friends (if we can use that word for these two guys). They only use the camera in hand. Many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen. Many scenes (80% of the movie) are only in conversation. ! There are movies like Vampire vs. Zombies, which you can laugh at, but this one is simply bad, it makes no sense to make such films. Please stop Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbel. Do not make more movies!
