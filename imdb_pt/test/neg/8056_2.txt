I'm probably one of the few people who advocate and even like "Frisk," the project that put Todd Verow on the map, if that's where he is. I appreciated that someone had the courage to face Dennis Cooper and not get away from the material; Verow practically rolls on him. Judging by what he has done since then, he is well suited for this type of material and should probably stick to it. "Vacationland," a "coming out" movie, is so mistaken that it becomes an unintentional comedy, and I'm disappointed to have to report it. <br /> <br /> First, our hero, Senior High School "Joe" is too old in appearance to play 18. When later we meet a man who should be Joe's teacher, it is confusing, already that the sweaty face looks much younger than the student he is teaching. Joe's mother seems younger than him and does not "age" older either. Second, in Joe's opening scenes, he seemed to be playing or going through mental challenges. To his credit, he improved with the movie and I realized he was "playing young" but it was not working - it was weird. <br /> <br /> It's 15 minutes before anything is done. revealed about who, what and where these people are and why we should care. The second scene of the movie is a bit more business in a male bathroom room that, considering where the story goes after, is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher does not lead to anything, even as a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero ... one minute Joe is nervously trying his hand at the sex of the bathroom stall (such a erotic scene that does you really imagine what someone sees in practice), the next minute he is an expert on sexual blackmail and violent crossing. This is followed by an extensive scene with the character that we will later learn is "Andrew", and it is about everything we have learned about him, apart from that he is apparently gay, but not yet out. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of huddles at the execution time of 1:44 (which is about 20 more minutes - I can not imagine how he played with the deleted scenes of Joe walking around); a sub-plot copied from "Gods and Monsters" with an old patron who utters a rhetorical answer of nothing interpreted by an actor who obviously can not remember his speeches (he is conveniently dispatched in a way that Dickens could have invented in a slow week ); a nearly four-way mix-n-match between boys and their girlfriends, a gay toilet bum, a pretentious sage in the form of a nellie queen (not the nellie queen suddenly took on the role of "prostitute with the heart of gold "as the most tired stereo type?) that only exists to be degraded; blackmail, robbery, homicide, alcohol consumption, and abuse of looping music software for recording soundtracks. <br /> <br /> What you will not find in this movie is any interior that establishes master images; We are expected to imagine that we are at an airport, in the grocery store and in the classroom, because all the scenes in these places consist of close-ups and badly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of ​​locales that production should not have been capable of to provide. One thing they managed to do seems to have been a real gay bar; or is it the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in Bangor, Maine, as the bar never has any customers in it. Another good laugh came when the actors should be yelling about dance music that obviously was not coming from the speakers, but it was just another looping music from the "score." <br /> <br /> Plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "movie language," meaning that no human being really speaks that way. Since we have not received any information about these characters, it is impossible to care what happens to them; it is as if Joe et al came out of the ether one day and could simply cease to exist once the credits rolled (surely Joe's sister character, an aspiring Jennifer Gray who is crazy about Bohemia, seems to simply "stop", we I never know where she is in LA or what is her problem ... but again ... does it matter?). Visually, the movie looks pretty good at times, plus a testament to new developments in high definition video than anything, I suspect. The edition is very awkward (there was a great edition; Joe is posing naked and says "I wanted to play sports, but ..." and we started to show his "butt ... ha ha"). The composition is also strange at times (I thought I was watching SCTV's parody of "Persona" when the boys were chatting in bed and it visually looked like their noses were stuck throughout the scene!). One of the senses that Verow is really restricting himself from making a "more or less" rougher film as he usually does, and maybe he should not have insured (the sparkling toothpaste / sex fantasy worked a lot well, I thought, although the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie) ... he produces and directs this "age-sensitive" story very much like Herschell Gordon Lewis directed bloodless movies ... sexless porn movies in them. I had some involuntary laughter of it and it was not annoying, it was not very good either.
