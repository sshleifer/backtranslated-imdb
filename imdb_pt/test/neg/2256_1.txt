I'll start with a few quotes from other reviewers who describe you as the best. <br /> <br /> "This is easily one of the most overrated movies of the year and probably the worst movie Tarantino ever made." "The ONLY good thing about this movie was Mr. Waltz's performance." <br /> <br /> "So I was very disappointed, and watching this movie in the # 40 place of the biggest movies of all time is the only thing about it, that leaves me with my mouth open" Now, for more details , read "Hated" comments. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate about a movie is when it comes to public speaking like a bunch of dumb people. (Spoiler ahead). Now I know that Tarantino's style is based on fictional fantasies and plots, but Adolf Hitler and 200 Nazi officials will be attending a movie in occupied France and you have only two guards all over the theater and the surrounding area? Where also an African American walks freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire. These 2 guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler in point with about 100 rounds ... very dumb. At least challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (go watch Valkyrie). Also, Mike Myers' impersonation of a British general is more realistic and authentic than the guy who does Hitler, just imagine it. <br /> <br /> What spoiled even more is that the only intelligent and powerful character who preached to all the film with his psychological and curious interrogations is easily fooled by the most foolish character in the film. After watching the movie, I was sympathizing with the Nazis, who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our bastards !!! Imagine that. <br /> <br /> My recommendations, if you have insomnia, 2 hours and 33 minutes to lose or want to pause your mind, go watch this movie.
