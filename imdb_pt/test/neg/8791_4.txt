Ridiculous movie where two college graduates move to California and one becomes a movie star and the other his entrepreneur. <br /> <br /> With the passing of 10 years, the popularity of the star is declining, so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for your affection. <br /> <br /> The film is nasty and ridiculous. The girls who dispute the boy's love seem silly. Only one girl seems to be the producer's choice. She's really an amateur against some of the other women, but she's healthy and brings good ratings to the show as well. <br /> <br /> In the third scene you realize that the manager is falling in love with her. We know Ryan really should be single. While the ending is a bit cute, you really know where this was going.
