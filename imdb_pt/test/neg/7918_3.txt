If you've just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven, and know there's a sequel, do not watch it. It's awful. It's absolutely awful. They run the characters to develop. Sasha, for example, begins to sing about how you can tell her out of love. And in the end, this looks more like a dramatic romance movie than a comedy and adventure movie. They rip Charlie out of his character and replace him with a soft, yet rebellious version of himself. <br /> <br /> The mood behind Carface's character is completely lost. He's a totally different dog. He no longer has a cool voice, he's no longer that villain that you love the most, he's just a coward of none other than Spongebob's Mermaid Man. Speaking of voice actors. <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And though it's not horrible, I do not like it. It's terrible compared to the excellent work that Burt Reynolds did for the character in the first film. Dom DeLuise is wonderful as always, like Itchy. This character remains true, which is why this movie gets a 3/10. Purely because Dom DeLuise was still expressing Itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but Charlie completely forgot about her, or what? No mention at all of her in the second film. I mean, even a small mention of Itchy would have been acceptable. (eg "Charlie, we have to go back.You can not take care of all the children who need ransom.) Or something like that.I mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention. Do not watch this if you are looking for a wonderful sequel.
