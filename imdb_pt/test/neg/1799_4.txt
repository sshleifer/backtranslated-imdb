The film 'Heart of Darkness', based on Joseph Conrad's 1899 book, is little or no detail and has an almost schizophrenic plot. If you have read the book, you know that little or nothing of the important "story" scene has been put into the film. In the book there is so much left over for the imagination and I feel that this is one of the parts that make the book what it is. An example would be when Marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and that the whole scene was left out of the film. Again, if you read the book, you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main topic of futility, the best. Finally, I feel that the film was very cut and dry. Not enough, though, was put into the original text and how it made history be what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet read the book, 'Heart of Darkness' (preferably Norton Critical Edition) then do not waste time renting or buying the movie. However, if you have read the book, then I think you will appreciate the book much more if you decide to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
