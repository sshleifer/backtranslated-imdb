I remember very well the bad press that this film received because of the producers' court order against Clayton Moore using the name "Lone Ranger" or wearing his black mask on personal appearances. Regardless of any consideration of the quality of the film, this was the absolute height of myopic arrogance and stupidity on the part of producers and their lawyers. And I suspect the lesson was well learned after this movie collapsed, which was widely perceived as kind of karma for the morons responsible for the court order against Moore. <br /> <br /> In more recent times, it has become a reality. the custom, when reviving a legendary film or TV project, invite the star or the original stars to special appearances, and rightly so. Show some respect, you idiots! And even if they look at the prospect, what happened, at least the offer was made. This is positive proof that filmmakers, studio executives and entertainment lawyers are not so stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.
