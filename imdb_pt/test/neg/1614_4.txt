A friend of mine, who is even more into 70's cult movies than me, has recommended this to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that I watched. However, I was not as enthusiastic about the outcome as him? Or, for that matter, Michael Elliott? was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and The Texas Saw Maassacre (1974): in fact, I would venture to say that it served as the basis for the 2005 remake of the former much more than the 'original'! So we have a remote and abandoned Wax Museum of incredibly vivid puppets (guess why?) With its seemingly harmless curator (a little Chuck Connors) being "invaded" by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers (among them Tanya Roberts). Does he have a crazy brother, too? PSYCHO (1960) tones incorporated for good measure, up to the same twist? which is supposed to be a mechanical genius (presented in a "poltergeist" that inexplicably accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from a Donaggio Pin score but, being so derivative and not especially well done, essentially turns out to be just a redundant (and rather confusing) gender effort.
