I watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and I will not make that mistake again. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes show that a group of people were brought in by some tragedy, but you do not see what it is. It does a 12 hour retrospective and we can see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless for what is about to happen. When the ending is finally revealed, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a great reward that does not happen and does not mean anything to what you are watching. The only connection these people have is that they all had a "bad day" - but even that continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If this were a "Crash" clone, a complete failure.
