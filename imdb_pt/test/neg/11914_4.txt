Not one of the better Monogram (not trying to be entertaining here) Chan tickets. The Shanghai Cobra has a lot to offer, but in the end it is too confusing and confusing to be overly satisfying. The movie begins with a killer named "The Shanghai Snake" who had already played twice and is now on stage at some restaurant. We have a guy, a girl and another guy having some implicit connection when a guy dies on the streets. Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, because that really is at the heart of the problems with this movie - it has a lot going on without any real and satisfying explanation. I did not even get into the diner that has some involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone does not seem to have a problem with that! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then Chan enters the cinema working for the government and flying to help a friend. He also has the right to check the radio store of a bank and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages that he helped to arrest in Shanghai many years before. I found the plot very involved as stated previously. Toler is back like Chan. He is always affable. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are back too. Both do good jobs and are very entertaining. But the complicated plot simply did not convince me, and much of the film was watched with a strange and questioning look. This is not a bad movie, not just very interesting, except for the more dedicated fans of Chan.
