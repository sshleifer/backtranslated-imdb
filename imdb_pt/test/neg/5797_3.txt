If a movie has an unimaginative and banal story, it needs to make up for it because it's very, very funny. You can get away with it a lot if it's funny. But while there are some fun times scattered here and there in Grandma's Boy, they are so far apart and few of them can not begin to make up for the hack work that the movie exhibits in such abundance. <br /> <br /> The movie certainly does not aim to surprise anyone. When Alex hides marijuana at his grandmother's house in a can of tea, you know what will happen later and this happens. The film appears to have been written by a committee that did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any joke that appeared in more than one of them. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual scenery. . The game happens in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some smart comedy. But make no mistake, this is not a movie about video game developers. This is basically a fraternity college movie where all the frat boys were pushed into a great room to play video games. <br /> <br /> The way the film completely fails to think of its scenery and use it for the original laughs can be seen in the JPJP character is I find more or less conspired by Doom creator John Carmack. At least inspired to the extent that he is a strange genius who makes games. <br /> <br /> In the movie, J.P. is a strange, nasty nerd who is despised and ridiculed by the company's game testers. That does not make any sense. If you're one of the most important people in video game history (as it's supposed to be J.P.), even if you're weird and unpleasant, people will still admire you and respect you on some level. If Stephen Hawking is detestable, his associates still will not get him to be seen in his face. <br /> <br /> In addition, game testers are as likely to be geeks as JP, but in the movie they are basically fraternity boys. He's a normal, fun guy against the hateful dweebs movie. And although this formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a gaming company. If you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, do not just fit all movie conventions of different settings into that movie. Unless you're a hack. <br /> <br /> About two thirds of the way to the movie I gave up. Something happened that I knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. And I realized that I had not really laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. So I quit (though I went fast just to make sure I was right that they would follow the most predictable cliches, which they did). <br /> <br /> Normally, if a movie is bad, I just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally poor quality production that it deserves a long diatribe. <br /> <br /> Shame in the movie for attracting a good actress like Linda Cardellini to her, then surround her with no one of talent. I'll give the film 1 point for giving Shirley Jones the chance to be the anti-Shirley Partridge.
