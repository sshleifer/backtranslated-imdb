Occasionally on talk shows a good topic debate awakens some interesting opinions from the audience, unfortunately there is always a desperately sad person in search of acceptance that will wipe out any interesting debate instantly standing up and saying the proverbial "Everyone should get along and love to each other "as they know, it is guaranteed that they will receive applause and affirmations, since no one dares to disagree. <br /> <br /> Well, they are the same people who marked this movie as good, why did they do it? INSECURITY. Anyway, that's all I'm going to say about it. <br /> <br /> The movie starts reasonably interesting, so you expect it to be built, and if, like me, you settled in with a good pair of wine glasses and some cheese, then you're going to get a chance even bigger, simply because you can not bother moving. <br /> <br /> But then you dream awake, wander, your mind wanders over other things, why? because the director too! he took his foot off the accelerator, and then he noticed 'ooops' so to compensate he accelerated a lot, but then he came back to skid, and again you too, the story slows, the plot narrows and it almost disappears, you even ask yourself for yourself So, what happened again? as you reflect on your screen, will show Nick Nolte running with some supposed purpose but you will care what he is doing and he will appear as nothing more than a screen saver in the background for your day dreaming. Michael Moriarty, who plays John Converse, has an incredible ability to speak without moving his lips or even his face like a ventriloquist, he must have gone to Nicolas Cage's facial expression school, or he was attacked by the Phantom injector Botox. <br /> <br /> Tuesday Weld was to play Marge Converse, but instead she played Mia Farrow to perfection. <br /> <br /> In total there are hundreds of thousands of movies to watch, so leave this to one of the last ones, you see, I just wasted one night watching when I could have seen or done something else, learn from my mistake, relaxing nights are precious, so do not waste anybody watching this annoying tale, do anything else, dust off that old game of Cluedo, practice gurni Ng for the night or have a discussion with a loved one, cut the hair of the nose , getting rid of unused files on our laptop, will be better spent time than ever you should choose.
