Ed Gein: Plainfield Butcher is located in the small American town of Plainfield, Wisconsin, in 1957, where lonely Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives alone on an after-death farm if his mother and brother. Local police have had a series of burglaries to be resolved and when suspicions of local waitress Sue Layton (Supper Coley) grow that something nasty is going on. Ed is a violent and sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls and kills them, police will find out the truth in time to save Erica (Adrienne Frantz) the daughter of the sheriff (Timothy Oman) ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Michael Feifer, this was an attempt to base a horror film around the true events surrounding the notorious serial killer Ed Gein and ends up being a great bullshit. Ed Gein was only convicted of two murders and died in 1984, but several films were inspired by him, including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000) with this recent addition, possibly being the worst Gein movie ever. Although Ed Gein is real, almost nothing in this movie is based on facts, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims was related to any of the police, there was no casualty of car accident, although Gein keep his name had changes of name, kidnapping and murder of the two women portrayed here actually happened with four years difference in reality but in this movie happens over a couple of days and while here Gein is shown as a great muscular man in reality He was thin, thin , old and very soft. As a factual drama Ed Gein: The Plainfield Butcher is useless and as pure entertainment is no better with a deadly bland rhythm, I feel that everything is boring and when it is not killing someone Gein is shown working or just walking around and it is very boring. There is no suspense because we know who the killer is and it's just a tedious wait until he gets caught up in the end. There is no real attempt to get into Gein's mind with manufacturers that give him no more motivation than he occasionally hallucinates from his domineering mother. There is not much blood here, there is a scene with a woman hanging on a meat hook, there is a very poorly edited scene of Gein cutting a leg, there are the usual jars of body organs and skulls out there , as well as a little blood, but there is not much here to excite. The film was obviously rendered to take a lot of color from the picture, since it is not too far from the black and white at times, I personally think the lack of color makes it even more dull to sit. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 1,500,000, I can not really see where the money went in a forgettable production. Although set in Wisconsin, this was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong with the role of Ed Gein, just from a physical point of view, Hodder does not seem to be far from like Gein and he gives a very poor performance because he just looks at the camera making many faces. Ed Gein: Plainfield Bucher sucks and is as simple and straightforward as that. As a factual drama or pure exploring entertainment, it's a total tripe from start to finish with nothing to recommend it.
