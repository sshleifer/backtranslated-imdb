It is difficult for a lover of the novel Abbey of Northanger to sit through this BBC adaptation and avoid throwing objects on the TV screen - in fact, if Jane Austen herself saw it, she would be a little amused and possibly discarded. The adaptation of Maggie Wadey made of Northanger Abbey what satirized, the gothic romance (and the readers of gothic romances). <br /> <br /> Catherine Morland's role in the adaptation is portrayed rather close to Austen's Catherine, an open book. A generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But Henry Tilney, of the novel, is not a hero of a gothic romance, snuff, hawking cane from a gothic novel - he's a teaser, a handsome man with a messy room and a life , Henry Tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely removed from the script). Some of the best scenes in the novel, when Henry, utterly impassive, plays scandalously with Catherine's literary mind about Catherine's diction, magazines, Mme. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large part of Henry's personality is lost when these scenes are not adapted. In addition, the appearance of Peter Firth is not accurate - Henry Tilney must be 24 or 25 years old, dark hair and dark skin, not 35 to 40 years old and blond. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation. who invokes surprise and disgust - who is the marquise, and what is she doing in history? Why is John Thorpe less dull and more intriguing? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of Romance, with her romantic visions, awaits hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is indeed a comfortable and modern home - another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have these strange visions of Mrs. Allen sticking her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only flees with her in Northanger, with Henry there to gently correct her. And finally, why have so many facts about the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death changed unnecessarily? To make the story more "horrible"? All these oddities are simply too strange to be neglected. <br /> <br />
