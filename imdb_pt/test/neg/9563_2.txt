It goes without saying that a minimum of subsidies have to be done when a true story is being adapted to the big screen. But if you shoot a fairy tale that has almost nothing to do with what actually happened - why call it Bugsy and make the audience believe that this was a half true story? The Godfather trilogy processes many real characters and events, It was once in America too, but they do not claim to be telling true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * In the movie, Benny has this great vision of a player's Eldorado; in real life, Lansky had to argue to go to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​a counterpart to the Monte Carlo idiot, and he preferred to continue his life as a playboy in Los Angeles. Not long after, Benny calmed down with the idea. But of course he's the hero of the movie, so naturally the idea had to be his. In the film, Benny wants to use Count DiFrasso to approach Mussolini to assassinate him because he was Hitler's partner and Hitler killed Jews in gas chambers after all. Obviously, we should like Benny, so the writers invented this nonsense. In real life, at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers, let alone Benny, who was completely disinterested in politics. In fact, he used the connection of the countess and visited Mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell explosives for him. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> Greenberg's entire subplot was absurd. Greenberg did not turn pigeon, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (this depended on Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they got the name right. <br /> <br /> I think it was very romantic to have Virginia come back to Benny, offering her the money she had stolen. The film even tells us through panels of text that she returned the money to Lansky after the murder of Benny. Let me just say that revisionism is simply no more impudent than that. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive - there is the question of Benny's family not living in Los Angeles, the way Benny handles Dragna and Adonis, the portrait of Costello (a nasty corporate type ), Lansky (a lovely teddy bear), Benny himself (an aged windbag that would not have reached the age of 12 if he had regularly gone bugs in situations like those in the movie, and besides, who does not have the good looks nor the charisma of Benny Siegel) and many others. In addition to some concrete facts, nothing is right in this film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> In the end, this is the only Mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than Harlem, NY. But honor where honor is due: this is a feat in itself.
