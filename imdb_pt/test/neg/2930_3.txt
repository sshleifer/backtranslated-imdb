Well, I usually like Iranian movies, and after having seen "10" by Kiarostami the night before, I was expecting a great movie. I was very disappointed. This is by far the worst Iranian movie and one of the most boring Asian films I have ever seen. If you've never seen a Kiarostami movie before, watch "Ten" instead. If you want some good Iranian movies, you can also try "Sib", also known as "The Apple". This movie is divided into 5 parts, and only the fourth, with some funny ducklings, is worth watching. If this is the first Iranian movie you see, you probably will not want to see anything else. I do not blame you, but you're going to miss great movies.
