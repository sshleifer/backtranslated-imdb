The movie is being televised while I write. <br /> <br /> I just forgot how a horrible experience I watched in the movies. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the movie is flawed. The fact that intelligent Europeans and Americans, stranded in the desert, forget all the concepts of morals and civilization in a few days is laughable. The madness of the Lord of the Flies was more time consuming. <br /> <br /> Details that are boring are many. One is the only divine African character who mysteriously survives the horrible weather and does it for centuries without losing his head and seems to have no supply problems. Ridiculous. The same is true of the attempted rescue of the tour guide, an Indiana Jones look-alike whose attempted rescue ends in tragedy and death a 5-minute walk from the cabin. Then there is the choice of Lear, imposed on the group by a joke of an artist's guru. He reminded me of my high school hippie art teacher. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is Lear's choice for Levrings. Obviously, it's an intellectual brain fart. As this was never a passing time it is never clear to me. <br /> <br /> The positives are few and far between. It's a beautiful movie, but that's never important. <br /> <br /> Intellectualism of high school. Strange because of the stranger. It's a complete waste of time, unless you like to spank useless art films.
