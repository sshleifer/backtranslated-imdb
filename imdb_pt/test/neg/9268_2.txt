This is perhaps the most ridiculous crap I've ever seen. Three disjointed stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a tedious monologue on relationships by a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people got involved in it. Highlights: Green refrigerator man reads Jean-Paul Sartre, slob mans dinner guest and her horse manure hair products, a ridiculously unreasonable woman in the short third, who suspected a man of foul play just for having interest in its generic activities, Blowers. <br /> <br /> I need to use some more lines apparently, so I can also mention some of the more stupid things about the movie. The first film involves a man driving a talking car and obeying his irrational demands for absolutely no apparent reason. The only way to watch this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. It's kind of funny in an ironic way, but also extremely tiring, like being forced to chew for a long time on a stained rug.
