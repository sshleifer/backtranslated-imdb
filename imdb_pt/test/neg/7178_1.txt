Yes. It takes a Norwegian to ruin and shoot down two great books and a concept that would work well on films - this film is really the worst Swedish film ever. I hated it so much that I even considered quitting, something I never did. But it was so horrible that I was almost convincing. I just had to sit to the end. Much like some of the 80's Stallone reel action, this really takes Swedish action back to the Stone Age. So full of logical mistakes and stupid mistakes that it's almost fun - but who could see anything good in the terrible performance, Mark Hamill is surviving a minefield or dumb, useless and irrational action? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: do not we end up with the clocks to zero, the hero escaping in time and two friends to become enemies to meet in the end? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And one more thing: the product placement in this film is unbelievable. While other countries understood that it should not be so obvious, the Swedish film industry apparently did not understand: just look at the credit card that Hamilton uses to open a window? Either or or .... this movie really drives me crazy.
