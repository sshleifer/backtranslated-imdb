I was actually planning to see this movie when I noticed this in my TV guide, but after about 5 minutes decided that time is definitely more precious than "Who's That Girl" it might be worth. Describing how bad Madonna's acting is, and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured in the film. This crap is an insult to film and intellect. I almost never! I would rate a movie that I do not see from beginning to end, but in this case the first is impossible. 2/10
