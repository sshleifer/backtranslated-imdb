My friends and I have seen it so many times that I have lost count. This is worth seeing for those who are in the right frame of mind, which means that this is not so much a good horror movie as a movie to satirize for its funny quotes and bad effects. This movie is best watched with other individuals who think like you, so you have someone to laugh with. <br /> <br /> You'll laugh when Greg jumps and walks through the lab, stroking his pet rabbit while his hunchback moves from the right. to the left of your back. "Greg, stop doing clowning!" Reprimands Dr. Brandon. You'll laugh as J.G. Patterson gives hand signals to direct Greg to the other side of the operating table while his hand is in the shot. And you'll probably laugh when you realize that the end woman does not have any of the features he used to build her.
