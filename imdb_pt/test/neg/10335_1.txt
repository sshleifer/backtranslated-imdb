If you've made purchases at Wal-Mart, you probably know the $ 5 box from the DVD that's in the electronics department. Well, that's where I found this movie. However, I was fooled! You see, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock on it and even listed his name as a "headliner." I caught myself thinking, "Wow, did not I know that Sandra Bullock made this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch a cool movie from Sandra Bullock. To my surprise, Mrs. Bullock had a small role ..... a very small role. She plays the girlfriend of the CIA agent's son. Talk about supporting the actress. It may not have more than two lines in the movie. In addition to being fooled by being a Bullock movie, I looked back and continued to watch an action-packed movie. Negative! At one point, for special effects, a weapon was glued to the camera. You have to watch it to laugh at what really is horrible.
