This is a truly terrible horror / science fiction film from 1957. In fact, although Ed Wood Jr. and his horrible movies have a lot of publicity, this turkey is as bad as Wood's worst. Now the acting is a little better than you'd find in Wood's epics (like PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER), but the special effects have managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However, bad movie buffs will be happy to know it's so bad it's still an excellent view. Like a Wood movie, it's great to watch this crappy feast and laugh along with your friends. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a scientist flying over some tests in his jet. However, out of nowhere, a UFO passes and its reporting on the radio causes an Air Force panic. However, later they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and they think the scientist is crazy! But when soon after the planes start to disappear, they realize that there must be something in their vision. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is not great, but it's watchable. However, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. First, through the horrible use of low-quality movies and models, airplanes continue to change in flight. Some might not mind that, but with airplane lovers like me, seeing an F-80 turning into an F-86 for an F-102 fighter drove me crazy - especially since the planes do not look at all like one with the other. Second, through "smart" cinematography, everything you actually see of the monster is a fluke for half the movie! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally see it clearly, it's worth waiting for. Well, do not be so lucky !! The "monster" looks less realistic or scary than the duck on "You Bet Your Life" by Groucho! In fact, it's significantly less realistic than any of the giant Japanese monsters !! In fact, Big Bird's "Sesame Street" is even scarier and more realistic !!! It's just horrible in every way and it could be the stupidest movie monster in history - as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or OUTSIDE SPACE ADOLESCENTS !!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely terrible movie that sane people do not like. Fans of bad movies like me (who are crazy) will probably love it! Everyone else ... be afraid, ... be very afraid !! <br /> <br /> FYI - You may notice that some clips from this movie are from other science fiction movies !! I'm sure the scene of the Washington Monument was stolen from EARTH VS. THE PASTURES OF FLIGHT, but I've also seen some other scenes that I swear are from other movies. What a hack job!
