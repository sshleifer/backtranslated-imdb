GINGKO BED is a strange movie. It is very complicated, as if you had many ideas, but did not have the ability to integrate them into a coherent story. Instead, we have several plots that diverge in their separate small movies. Oh, of course, they end up meeting at the end, but everything seems a bit ... superfluous. Of note is the girlfriend and her troubles at the hospital. Was that ... interesting? Then there were the elements "we are spirits, therefore we have no physicality", which leads to the same problem that people had with GHOST, namely: if the characters have no physicality (ie no body form) and can cross walls and what, how exactly do they not fall to the ground, or float to the ceiling? <br /> <br /> GINGKO BED was praised as a new generation of South Korean films. There are many special effects, but the film itself is hollow and its fake melodrama will only "touch" those that are easy to play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
