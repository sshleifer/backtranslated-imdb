I do not really think it necessary for me to write a review in a movie with a title as derisory as "Snake Island," but even within the abstract boundaries of its own genre, that set a new record, so my anger must be known. The only reason I even bothered to watch this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad, it was late at night, I could not sleep, and in the past, really bad movies drained the energy of me and me It's been a long time for sleep. It quickly became too early that this movie would be horrible, but he condescended even below those expectations. <br /> <br /> The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars the film as a movie. tour guide on the African river, who ends up having to strand his crew on a remote island called Snake Island, until another boat descends to pick them up. They leave, get drunk and then become subject to attack by venomous snakes who are on a mission to purge their island from humans. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped in the last sentence of my second paragraph, do not bother to reread it, you got it the first time. Frankly, I prefer my creature characteristics when the creature (s) only attacks the absurdly idiotic humans of hunger, not because they have some kind of mission. These are not mutant snakes. They are not giants like what you see in "Anaconda". They are just ordinary, everyday African snakes like mambas and snakes - only they have the brain to form armies, take on causes, work together to arrest people, understand our language and even dance! Has your draw fallen again? Well, it will drop even more. In the middle of this horrible B movie, about the part where I had already given up, the human characters start drinking around a campfire and all of a sudden they turn into a kind of orgy. And while they dance naked and such, the snakes that hunt them suddenly stop and start playing next to her. The combination of this scene with the scene where we found that snakes, some of the meanest creatures on the planet, formed an alliance against humans for some weird reason, proved too much for my poor brain. And when I thought the filmmakers could not take it to an even lower level, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> The people in the movie? Well, let's just say I never made the creatures kill them all so quickly. I just could not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I really do not think I need to continue; Do you get the photo? If there is something that makes "Snake Island" different from its other rivals, it dares to try to be even dumber and that is not a compliment. Why only because I keep submitting to these really bad movies, I guess I'll never really know. But "Snake Island" hits a new record. It's a cheap and cheap excuse for a movie that makes "Anaconda," a brainless snake movie, looking as bright and sophisticated and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws." You have been warned.
