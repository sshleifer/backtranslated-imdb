"Shadows and Fog" is certainly one of Woody Allen's weaker films, with "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (though none of what Allen did is equal to the horror of "Anything Else"). <br /> <br /> "Shadows and Fog" is Allen's homage to the German Expressionist style of making movies, all the lights and shadows are hard and stylized and ... you guessed ... a lot of fog. But you can tell that Allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care. <br /> <br /> Luckily, he did "Husbands and Wives" the same year, so things did not wash out completely for him. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
