We will never know the truth about 9/11. And this shoddy movie proves that. <br /> <br /> Recently I watched a YouTube report claiming there were no airplanes involved in the destruction of the Twin Towers; that all the newsreels were supposedly provided with double angle shots of the Towers from a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?), and to that extent the CGI airplanes were replaced by the real-life MISSILES that actually hit the towers. <br /> <br /> It's a compelling video, and although I'm not a Wacko Conspiracy theorist itself, I'm still not sure if the planes hit anything that day (the Towers, the Shanksville Camp, the Pentagon ) - because there are no airplane debris available. (And the famous "black boxes"? No one has recovered.) A million other theories abound, all courting a drop of Truth flooded in an ocean of speculation. But you're going to drown in the malarkey before you find anything true or worth speculating about, a no-budget movie that's trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have escaped. Writer-director Leigh Scott is obviously a concerned American citizen who wanted to enlighten the public about what the 560-page report might reveal. It would help if his movie had actors, rather than a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a girl who looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy I'm sure he's trying to be Sean Bean . It would help if your camera operator did not have Parkinson's; if the director of lighting was not trying to save electricity; would help if his editor did not have Attention Deficit Disorder, or if the soundtrack was not an esoteric new world order unarmed; and the lace probably should have been inserted when people were actually stirring their mouths. <br /> <br /> We can not even call it propaganda. It's very funny And funny, I mean unwatchable. <br /> <br /> You can not squeeze a problem out of this complex into a two hour movie, but Leigh Scott tries anyway, including all those sexy phrases we grew up for: Bin Laden's intention to attack, buy weapons from Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi attend flying school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: we know it's all retrospective, So any discussion that agents of concerned intelligence have with each other smacks of a false retrospective view, all squeezed into an organized conversation. Like planned reverse engineering, all that is pertinent is mentioned succinctly, so that we may shake our heads, wondering how incompetently all these branches of government have made a mistake. <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculous interrogation scene with a fat bimbo a guy with tomato sauce on his face. Now - this would be considered torture if most guys did not consider it an attraction. <br /> <br /> The slogan is: "What if the attack could have been stopped?" From the account of this film - and, presumably, according to the Commission Report - the CIA and other underground agencies were ready to capture bin Laden and did not do it. Everyone involved with the "terrorism" reports (do you mean you actually read those reports?) They are so concerned that we just want to slap at them for their bad acting. <br /> <br /> But the whole story is much deeper than banal soundbytes the negligent Ku Bush Klan foisted on the American people after 9/11. We now know that even capturing bin Laden before the September 11 attack would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels were moving with or without the Taliban figure whose involvement was the possible invention of someone's imagination to unite the United States against a enemy. . Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not "attack us". As Ron Paul tried to elucidate, it was a case of Middle Eastern blowback - "they" were so tired of America planting their infidel feet "there" that they brought the war "here." So, while George W. Death likes to defend the absurd, "We're fighting them there, then we will not have to fight them here," in reality "Because we're there, the fight was brought here" <br /> < The September 11 attack was not so much about the intricate planning of terrorists as was the gross neglect of the Bush administration, which we know (without the investigation of the Commissions) had all the information of the Clinton administration on; information on terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. But the Texas Oil Sucker, who refused to read his Daily Briefings and prefers to vacation at his Crawford ranch to spend another day at work, nullified the duty he vowed to perform - protecting the American public. And then the scum calling itself president used the attacks inflicted by its neglect as a political hammer against its own idiot country to mark a second term, to destroy the American Constitution and to lead the United States to a False War based of a lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks. Strangely, the film never approaches the Ku Bush Klan, offering no opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott wanting to remain neutral. Tell this to the rapees and plundered hundreds of thousands in the False War against Terror in Iraq. By pure coincidence, I realized that I was watching this DVD while wearing my "Bush lied. Thousands died." T-shirt.
