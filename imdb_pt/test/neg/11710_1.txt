This film twists the facts of the life of Anne and Mary into something unrecognizable. Making Mary Boleyn, who was actually a rather obscure and foolish creature, and making her the "good" sister is simply silly. It's Anne, who was actually the most interesting character, and that's why it's her life, not Mary's, that's been told so often. <br /> <br /> In response to a previous review, I failed to see how Anne's life was so "criminal" ... to me it is Henry who was the real criminal. Whatever Ana's motives for winning the king and withholding her affections to win a crown and a husband, this must be brought into the context of the time when these real-life events occurred. Anne, compared with most of the courtiers of her day, was a relatively innocent figure. Most modern historians discount or disapprove most of the myths and slanders this movie perpetuates about her, and I have never heard of anyone who truly believes the rumor that she slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone, knowing nothing about this period in history, could come out believing in anything this movie has presented as "fact". <br /> <br /> I won. Not even get into the strange footage of the movie ... but I'm sure the cameras were not invented in the 16th century, so I do not understand why Anne and Mary are talking to one over the course of the movie ... it's a really bad plot and it's shocking and annoying, to say the least. Anne of a Thousand Days is also not accurate, but it is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women in history. Do not even think about renting it ... it's two hours you will never come back!
