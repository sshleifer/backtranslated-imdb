I like the concept of CSI, but the show is spoiled by some seriously wooden performances. The medical examiner has the best lines and the improvised delivery that animates the story. Unfortunately it has little screen time. <br /> <br /> In addition, why does Jorja Fox always look and act so completely unhappy? I know that forensic investigation is a very serious business, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with lack of humor and complete lack of personality. I can not imagine dating Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; What would you talk about? I'm waiting for the episode where, at the end of a turn, Catherine picks up a remote, points to Grissom, closes it and puts it in a closet until the next day.
