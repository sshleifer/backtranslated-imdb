I'm sorry folks, but these enthusiastic reviews about this prestigious website about this movie "Respiro" are very strange, to say the least. The madness is picturesque, I ask and I did not find an answer. Of course, the film is beautifully filmed, in part it's almost a documentary. But then, the fact is that when it comes to women Grazia, she shows all signs of a deep sickness and I was thinking about all the movie the heck she has. Their behavior is of utter concern, and the (shocked) citizens of the village are really right about wanting to send it to a proper institution to see what can be done about their condition. She needs treatment urgently! Behavior like hers is hell for everyone around her, her husband, poor children (especially) and fellow citizens. Let's not be falsely romantic about this! I hated this tolerant portrait of a mental patient. Why, for God's sake, does not the husband want to heal her or at least try to do it? Why the horror of going to Milan (a big city of course, but many possibilities of people able to cure it)? Narrow Lie? Irresponsibility? Anyway, I was inspired by this site to rent the movie on DVD and after seeing it I had to post this to others to get an opinion on it. Frankly, I understand why the film did not go as far as INDICATING for the selection of Cannes ...
