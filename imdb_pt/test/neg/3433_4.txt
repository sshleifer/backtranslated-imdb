I found this movie to be just fine. <br /> <br /> On paper, this movie has everything a person could want! Romance, comedy, drama. A bank robbery, a unique cast, great music and stories! <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie turned out to be rubbish, and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> a) This is my biggest problem: editing. This movie has by far the worst issue I've ever seen before the local car dealer commercials. The issue could have been made better by a deaf Parkinson patient, using iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see your lips moving and the audio / video is not in sync because it is clearly dubbed. Why was it dubbed? I do not know! Your English dubbing English! The voices were made in a studio at other scenes! Could not they find a boom? They are not expensive; Jesus, even I have one! And I do not make movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan's performance was not good. It really did not look like he wanted to be part of this project, and his acting was the equivalent of a skit performed by D.A.R.E. for school children. At least John Krasinksi showed some enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason I rented this movie, and it's the only real reason worth watching. He did a good spirited performance and was the most three-dimensional character. The character of Dean Edwards was quite skinny, just like what his face is. <br /> <br /> Final word? If you are a fan of John Krasinski, it's worth it. If not, do not bother. The edition
