In addition to the fact that this is just a badly made movie (imagine giving a camcorder to the middle school theater club) people who think there is something "real" about this legend need to grow. This is the 21st century. Guess: ghosts do not exist. Most people learn this from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You really need to grow up. <br /> <br /> The fact that a fraud was perpetrated almost two centuries ago does not make fraud less. The fact that a large number of inbred Tennessee hikers believe they do not either. Go to college. Or at least finish high school.
