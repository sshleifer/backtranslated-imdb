This P. de S. was highly recommended to me by two friends who have great taste (similar to mine) in movies and have seen more than anyone I know. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and repulsive is good in an entertaining film, but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as a low-level intellectual movie. Or is he an intellectual of short stature? The old clich√© of the generation gap "no redeeming social value" comes to mind. Bill Pullman is trying, maybe a bit difficult, and with the exception of the kid, the rest of the acting seems embarrassing and kind of dumb. <br /> <br /> Save yourself this and watch a feature film of "No Frio". Blood "and" The Hitcher. "<br /> <br /> As someone said, this would never have been done if Jennifer Lynch had not been David Lynch's overrated daughter.
