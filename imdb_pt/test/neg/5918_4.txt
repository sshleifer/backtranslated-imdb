Peter Yates's film, from Steve Tesich's pen, is a relatively low "thriller" that really can not take off. The story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential Asian businessman and the subsequent involvement of a pathetic Vietnam veteran (James Woods) who, according to police, may have taken revenge on his former employer. As an "eyewitness," William Hurt never believes that his friend is capable of such an act. <br /> <br /> Hurt is well below his usual strength, and finds it difficult to sympathize with him or an uninspired Sigourney Weaver. James Woods and Christopher Plummer do a little better in their supporting roles. It is worth noting the appearance of Morgan Freeman as Detective Black. In retrospect, Steve Tesich's story is just an unlikely novel, dressed up as a mystery movie. The plot is very invented. <br /> <br /> Friday, October 17, 1997 - Video
