When viewers hear that two popular characters / villains will be fighting, they head to the theaters to see how the battle will end. There's Freddy vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. And, more like that, there is Godzilla Vs. (Insert Name Here). But the very generic Komodo Vs. Python is just a horrible title and an even worse premise. Obviously, the movie is a D-list image, but at least invent a more compelling name, perhaps something that might fool the unsuspecting viewer into watching it. With a name like that, you know where you're going. <br /> <br /> A group of military men / women, including a sexy female scientist in her early 20s, is left to die for the military on an island inhabited by a giant Komodo dragon. As long as they can get off the island and the boat, they'll be fine, but ... no ... there's a giant python protecting the ocean and leaving. Let's hope all these guys get off the island, and that python and komodo do not tell each other in some kind of horrible special effects battle. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is bad in almost every way. The acting is pretty bad, or maybe it's because the special effects are so extravagant that the acting is unbelievable because nobody believes that these people are in danger with creatures that appear to have been made in a computer of the 90s. However, this movie is really very funny. The creatures are so clumsy, and the actors really give their all pretending they are in danger. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh * squawk! * ... but I can not. This PG-13 rated movie really stands out. Every time a word of curse comes, a parrot noise whistles the word. Even words that can be said on the television network. As we squabble cheaply they uttered words and with a parrot no less. Eventually, these parrot noises came up to me and I could not help but laugh at the incompetence. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad, from the silly start to the ridiculous ending of the Night of the Living Dead style, but it's also a little bit funny. Like a horror movie, it fails miserably, like an action movie, it fails a little less, but it's still very bad, and like a comedy it shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * out of ****. 95 min. PG-13 for some violence and Squawked out swearing.
