As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a bunch of actors who, well ... are not really actors, a lot of heavy metal to compliment rap and, of course, a crazy freak in hip-hopeless leather, and we've stopped being half past budget. Why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in such films? <br /> <br /> The FBI captures two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz," where the first prison prisoner to be executed has unexpected guests. First performance rate, particularly any scene involving tragedy for the good guys. Seriously though, the director tried, and got a modern and hard edge to the movie as best he could. He went to the pit very often and HALF PAST DEAD gets boring too soon. What else can you do when the inmates just keep talking while the hostages continuously ask what motivates the main villain? An irrational action movie that equals little, if not "right."
