Where do I start? The story was so bad, it must have been written in a high school movie club! The acting was so wooden I felt sorry for the actors! An actor even reminded me of how a deer should look when looking at the headlights of a car! Another actor has this constant look of being constipated! But it was the dialogue that takes the cake! <br /> <br /> Our hero tells his captors - all with submachine guns - if you put a finger on a female prisoner, you're dead. Moments later, the stronger guard, built like a truck, and the only woman trapped in it. When our fearless leader, who has this annoying, gangster voice, captures the breeze of this transgression, he quietly walks to the guard, while machine guns are trained on him, and in a fraction of a second he grabs the neck of this giant face as if was breaking. a toothpick! He then gets in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing but essentially scream at him! <br /> <br /> I could go on and on! This movie is a jewel of the camp; and if you have some sense of humor, it is guaranteed that will make you laugh so much that your eyes will rip!
