Rented (free rental thanks to God) this as supposedly filmed in CT where I live .... could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matters! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt at a low-budget movie, which can be good if done right. In short, about a group of young adults who witness the fall of meteors and subsequently are victims of aliens on an island lighthouse, attended by goalkeeper and wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - acting = dreadful <br /> <br /> - writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - story = done a million times before with different settings <br /> <br /> - (lighting) to budget <br /> <br /> - effects (creature, digital, other) HORRIBLE, VERY CHEAP IN SEARCH <br /> <br /> So, you has the essence of it. To add insult to injury, the final credits have filming errors - really now ...... who cares! Distributed under a Universal company, shocked, they even did it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> Finally, alternatively try "CREEP". Low budget but well written, well represented and quite, well, scary!
