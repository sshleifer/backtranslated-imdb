For anyone who cares to know something about the true Diane Arbus, or who values ​​psychological veracity, this movie sucks. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and disturbed person, but this film describes her as completely self-involved and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her as pale and vague as she was someone who knocked people down with her charisma. The totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is unbelievable, and Robert Downey is really irritating in his smiling portrait of someone who seems to think he is superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. The film portrays this encounter as being the source of Arbus's interest in freaks, which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the twentieth century. The mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to get involved with this movie anyway.
