This movie is like porn with all good parts removed. It is as if all the porn stars who did not want to fulfill their obligations would unite around this horrible, banal and useless gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> This is a useful film if you are in a mood to torture a loved one (or not a loved one). It is important that if you choose to use this film as a method of torture, put earplugs in the ears and put a blindfold on not to go crazy. <br /> <br /> If I could choose between this movie and The 700 Club ... I chose Girls Gone Wild. Overall, it is best if you are drinking. But only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
