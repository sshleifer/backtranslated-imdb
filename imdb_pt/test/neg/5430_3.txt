I just saw Congo on DVD. In most cases I love this kind of movie, but this one is different. That made me write my first comment for a movie on IMDb. I was amazed at how such a seasoned team of filmmakers managed to create that movie as a result. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production, but you can not make a good movie if you do not have a good script. And as a producer, Frank Marshall gave us many great movies to watch; he should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients but if you can not cook stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a suggestion, do not spend your money on it. If you want to watch it on television first and make your own opinion.
