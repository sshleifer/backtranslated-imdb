I'm very open. I watch all kinds of programs until the end ... good or bad ... just to take a chance and learn from the good and bad aspects. This show had the potential to be good. But my God, what were the writers, casting director and director thinking? The cast of actors are terrible ... with the slightest exception of Meryl (Mimi Rogers), and Darcy (Joy Osmanski) occasionally getting good lines with the best execution of the batch. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast kills the show. It's the same plot in every episode. Sam has plans to do something. Your boss interrupts these plans by giving you ridiculous work plans. Then, silly ways like Sam try to accommodate both in a way that is basically stupid and has no real intelligent humor. This is every episode. It gets very tiring. <br /> <br /> Season 2, they drop eye drops. The two hot girls on the show are written (but does the brother stay? Explain this casting to me, please). I can see why they wrote them ... they did not play a substantial role ... but they did not add anyone better to replace them. <br /> <br /> Derek Tricolli's arrogant character has a continuous appearance in Season Two. His acting (along with everyone else's) looks like many poor sitcoms from the 80's ... may have been funny ... but painful now. <br /> <br /> The show could have been much better with some good writers and some people who had some talent to perform them. This show does not have everything. The production quality is the only good aspect of the show. It's great in that respect ... unfortunately the content is painfully sad. My goodness. FOX, was not there really anything better to choose from? I get shows like "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia" or "30 Rock" for now. The bar should be defined by programs like these that actually assume that the audience is smart and are not continually drooling in on themselves using all their brain power in continuing to breathe.
