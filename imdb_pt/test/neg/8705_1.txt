I appreciate the effort the filmmakers wanted to describe the story of Moses and the exodus from Israel, and that the film helps viewers to take Moses 'place and gain an understanding of the heavy burden placed on Moses' shoulders. As excited as I was to see this movie, I was very disappointed with the story. (I will leave out the videography, special effects, and artistic ability in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and how far it is from the historical accounts of the biblical texts. One of the basic principles of the Bible is that * God * led His people out of Egypt, and He promised that He would take them to a land that is flowing with milk and honey. He not only gave this promise, but led His people into a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire at night. He never left them; He was always visible to the Israelites. The film, however, depicts a God who remains silent throughout the desert pilgrimage. This film has changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead portrays God as a silent, cruel and disciplined void. <br /> <br /> In addition, Moses' representation was equally wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (why else would he be a father figure to Israel throughout the Old and New Testaments, even if Moses is known as a man of great faith). However, the film describes him as a pragmatic, irritated and insecure loner who despises the call that God has placed in his life. OK, I'll allow some creative freedom for the filmmakers in the history of the Exodus ... but this is beyond creativity - it's heresy.
