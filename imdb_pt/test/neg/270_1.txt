I did not expect much when I went out to see this, but my god what a disappointment. The original was fun in the genre, but that is so bad that I felt bad when I left the theater. There is no plot, it is not funny, it is not pleasant to watch, it is directly embarrassing. After an hour, I hoped my patience would be rewarded, but now I'm sorry I did not leave the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore this, see when it comes to the small screen. Or check out the budget DVD, whatever you do, do not waste money on it. Do not say I did not warn you.
