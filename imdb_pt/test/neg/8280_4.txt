Horrible horrible glare at someone killing members of an athletic team after their star dies during a rendezvous. <br /> <br /> Christopher George does a hilarious and exaggerated performance as a track and field coach. I do not think ANYONE has taken the battlefield as seriously as Chris did here - not even in the Olympics. It's a typically divine CG performance, and if you're a fan of the man / legend, you should run out and get a copy. <br /> <br /> But we watch slashers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and Graduation Day fails to deliver most counts (there's a pretty good kill). The real horror only comes during a performance by the band "Felony". Never heard of them? Watch Graduation Day and find out why.
