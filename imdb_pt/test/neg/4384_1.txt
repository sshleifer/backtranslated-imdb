If someone at National Lampoon is reading this, PLEASE STOP EXCELLENCE YOUR PUMPING YOUR BUM, actually now! Why the hell are you making movies like that? They are not funny and watching you for sexual content is a complete waste of time, in fact. It's such a horrible movie that you might want to kill yourself while watching. I'm serious, folks, this makes Harol and Kumar look like a real movie (and we all know that H & K is one of the worst movies ever made). It's really bad, it really does. How bad is it? Well, even the losers who really like National Lampoon will hate this movie ... they're going to want to murder the director, I swear to God. I hate you, National Lampoon, already die. Die.
