Is there a clich√© of firefighters that is NOT used in this movie? From the opening line "I'm getting too old for this" through the firemen's "antics", to the "worried wife" the loss of her best friend in the barracks, to the final funeral of the fallen brothers, this movie looks and seems which was written by Disney's marketing department ("Our studies show the audience really likes when ..." and then they put it on). <br /> <br /> There's nothing original here. Any emotion we feel about these guys is drawn to our admiration and feelings for firefighters. <br /> <br /> Go watch rescues me if you want to see real heroes: everyday guys with glitches who think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers.
