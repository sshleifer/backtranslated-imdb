It amazes me that anyone finds Pauly Shore entertaining: it's basically a joke that becomes obsolete * real * fast. He has his little idiot "Californian" vocabulary and a basic stock of idiot jokes. Mostly, it's just nasty. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I watched this movie because I was sick and there was nothing left but infomercial, otherwise I would have turned off after 30 minutes. Anyway, the movie might have been good if Pauly had just turned off the speech and only played him as a comic actor instead of Pauly. <br /> <br /> Either way, I'm sure Pauly fans will enjoy it anyway - but if you're not a Pauly fan, stay away from that manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this review after seeing that another reviewer actually gave this movie a 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) Personally, I gave it a 3/10 because they had no picture in the frame, they did not bring down the camera, and the support cast was very good.
