Let's see how many ways you can insult my gender: 1. Of course the number 1 girl is a horrible skank who betrays her boyfriend and sounds like a heroin addict. <br /> <br /> 2. Of course the # 1 girl sleeps with the guy on the first date after being wasted. <br /> <br /> 3. Of course lesbians are "Germans" who are in S & M. 4. This was really a surprise. Ending the film with a note of torture celebrated by most of the characters was revolting. Seeing a battered woman is not my idea of ​​comedy. <br /> <br /> 5. Director's comment - Talk about actresses in the movie, just so you know, is rude and incredibly unprofessional.
