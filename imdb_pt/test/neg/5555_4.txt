Some may remember having seen the movie Juno in a scene in which Ellen Page has a moment of praise for Suspiria, her favorite horror film by Dario Argento. The character of Jason Bateman asks if she has ever seen a Herschel film Gordon Lewis, and that he has a copy of a movie (I forgot that at the moment) and shows it to her. By the time I saw Juno, I saw Suspiria and some Argento films, but not Lewis. Now I can see that it's not just one of the "in" references to Diablo Cody's pop culture, but something that really is an indicator on the tastes of the characters and, perhaps more subjectively, how to judge them based on their tastes. In other words, the reputation of Herschel Gordon Lewis is maintained a few years after he finished making his bloody movies - and it is that of a Schister-Meister, no more and no less. Actually, less. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to take Argento as a basis for comparison, because both filmmakers are approaching, at least in the case of The Gore Gore Girls and, well, any photo of Argento, similar material. Where Argento is extraordinarily conscious about his craft, getting an audience involved in any small story that exists by the power of camera movement and music and style, Lewis takes the easy way out to reach an audience that has an immature script . and (placing lightly) dull direction. The Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who is not interested in entertaining his audience in a compelling way as a horror movie, but as a side-scrolling program or a brothel. He can not drive worthy actors, he lights up like a porn movie, and for every one possibly smart or funny, there are ten who either totally smelly or are very clever in half or not smart enough. That said, perhaps as the best substantive thing to say about The Gore Gore Girls, a mysterious movie about a detective (the second-rate guy from Sherlock Holmes played Frank Kress) and a newspaper reporter (dummy Amy Farrell) . ) investigate a series of murders of go-go dancers, it serves as a model for countless other Troma-like images. Maybe this is a little compliment, however, and really the best thing that can really be said is that Henny Youngman - "Take my wife, please!" - has some scenes and steals each of them without having to try a lot. It's sad, since it may be the kind of image that could entertain you at an incredibly bad level. But even at this point, one may laugh more out of shame at the production, some of the actors (ie, that guy who plays the cop, my God) than for some guilty pleasure of pleasure. <br /> <br /> Even the gore itself is a little disappointing. At first, it is thought that Lewis is at least fulfilling this goal, showing that these women are murdered in a mad, cruel and exaggerated manner. But with the murders everything goes on longer than necessary; I do not mean that in terms of shock value, because that's okay. But there needs to be something else to really "stand," that showing women's faces dissected and their eyes scratched is good if you're 12 and see it as one of your first "horror" movies. It becomes, dare I say, dull. Dangerously tedious for a movie called "daring." <br /> <br /> This was Lewis' last film until 30 years later, a seemingly swan song came with a sequel to a film he did earlier. film retirement, and writing jobs on how to do it in business. However, any experiment he has done with it does not appear. It's not a failure, but it could have been, and it's just ... schlock. It's either take it or leave it.
