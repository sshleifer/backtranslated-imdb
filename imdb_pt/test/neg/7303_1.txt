For many years Ed Wood's Classic 'Plan 9' was considered the worst film ever made. Forget The Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast is composed of brothers of famous and almost famous people or has been actors and actresses. The plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. The runtime is not done in Ed Wood's classic style of using stock footage. Instead, there is endless slow motion and repeated action. And as for The Roller Blade Seven, it's not even seven! <br /> <br /> You should see this movie just to know how bad the movie really can be. Give independent filmmakers everywhere they wait.
