Strangely, I have very little to say about "The Box", so that will be very brief. I've never read Richard Matheson's novel "Button, Button" on which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation," there could not have been much resemblance to the work of such a legendary author. "The Box" is about a family who discovers a strange contraption on their door that has a button on it. Frank Langella appears and explains how they will get a million dollars if they push the button - the only 'trick' is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? Do they push that? END OF SPOILERS ?? This whole concept was interesting in itself, but somehow they managed to extend the film to a complicated imitation of the Stargate, to a very decent ending with a very deep message. While I'm trying to be as "fair" as possible, I still have to say that this was not my cup of tea and it bore me severely. I think it's from the same director as "Donnie Darko" that I remember liking when I saw it years ago. "The Box" would have worked well as a short film, but since it was so lifeless adapted this way, I can not come close to recommending it ...
