The Emperor's new cast returns to the Disney Pictures parade, but this time the focus is on Kronk (voice of Patrick Warburton), who is no longer the captain of Yzma (Eartha Kitt). Kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant. Things go happily until Kronk learns that his Papi (John Mahoney) is coming for a visit. Kronk is worried because he knows his life will not impress his daddy. One thing he always wanted and never received is a "thumb up" from his father. A flood of mistakes and a gigantic burst of cheese in the restaurant leaves our friendly hero very shaken by trouble and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from your friends. <br /> <br /> Other voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
