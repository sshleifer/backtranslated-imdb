An airplane carrying a rich scientist daughter descends into the dense desert. He rides a group to go and find her and the others, but the rescue team soon suspects that something is chasing them. Then, ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and this only increases the already existing tension. <br /> <br /> The film is a decent idea and an take on the popular Sasquatch legend was doomed to end up in the movie sooner or later. However, the direction of the film breaks a fundamental rule of terror / suspense direction and this is showing too much too early. Of course the audience knows there's something chasing the characters, just read the title! But show what should have been the kicker of the movie, which soon spoils most of the suspense and, as a direct result, much of the fun. The film also does not have a good atmosphere and there are almost no pictures of landscapes that show the vastness of the desert, but there are many monstrous shots in the point of view that add nothing to anything. They really knock 'Predator' shamelessly. The low-budget horror film 'Wendigo' has made what this movie tries to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the character's tensions and a non-clich√© ending can make up for this climb up the pile of garbage, but it's still poor and given the premise and potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Ranked like R for some violence and profanity, but is rather meek compared to most horror movies.
