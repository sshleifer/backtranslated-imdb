The fact that this crude series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of "votes") speaks volumes about the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Read Proust, you idiots! ! Or at least the anthologies of Dave Barry, Calvin and Hobbes. Chuck Norris. Wrap your brain around the fact that in order to evaluate or write about this series you would have to have spent minutes..not, HOURS ... watching this poor walk threshing the boards and spitting out lines with less emotional impact than the girl who used to cancel the correct time at your local service. <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW !! ASK YOUR FEW REMANESCENT CEREBRAL CELLS!
