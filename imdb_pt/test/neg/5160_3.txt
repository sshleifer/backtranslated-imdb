I should have realized that it was a sign of things to come when the trailer for this movie bored me. Having watched several indie films with the force of reviews here, and subsequently finding this my opinion is completely opposite to these other reviewers, I began to wonder if it is possible to watch completely different films of these people , or are they perhaps friends / family, etc., of filmmakers trying to 'big up' their work? Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Are you interested in seeing a tribute from Amador to Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except made with worse actors, a silly score (mine several scenes) and unbelievable leaps in logic? If not, then skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Here's my open letter to two of the players in this movie. <br /> <br /> Alfonso Morgan, please, please, please stop trying Be Samuel L Jackon to Pulp Fiction. No one can do what he does as well as he does. <br /> <br /> Director, please invent something original. You do a disservice to dump this thing by pretending to be Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Simply terrible, and I really can not see how anyone could say that this is a good movie. It's a disgrace that people have somehow managed to put a score of 8.5 on it, the same as movies like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. It's not where close to these movies; a 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I'll give it a 3.
