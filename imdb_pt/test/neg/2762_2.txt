A good cast ... A good idea, but it turns out to be flawed, since hypnosis is not allowed as evidence in court. So many good actors and they are all acting so bad! So why were they all attracted to this mess ... And yes, it has its good points, like lighting, etc ... But, in the end, I asked myself two things ... How many talents can lead to Such a bizarre mess? What is the accent Nigel Hawthorne is putting? He is / was a great actor and so what is this accent? Is it impossible to identify? What was he trying to do? Maybe it's his subtle indication, as if he were telling us, "I got involved with a turkey, so here's a shit accent to go with!"
