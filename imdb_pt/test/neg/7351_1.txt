I agree with the user "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is horribly the worst of the whole show. Now I'm not interested in many episodes of the later series, but this one takes the cookie! It was bland and not offensive. As for the ending, I'm sorry, but it made me more angry than any other episodes combined. <br /> <br /> I mean, the boys think they went well, but the ending was so disturbing, that they think the whale belongs. on the moon and on the credits, we see that he died. What could have saved the episode was if the pranksters could confess to what they did. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Ok, South Park may be guilty of preaching too much and it's always nice to see a non-original (like Make Love Not Warcraft), but this episode was just wrong! Avoid at all costs! Helen xxxxx
