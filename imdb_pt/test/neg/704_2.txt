I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> It's not just terribly bad, but I can not stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick. <br /> <br /> Mostly I can not stand watching this terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there's no reason to watch this horrible movie. The plot is just plain stupid. The actors surrounding Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really very bad and Laurel and Hardy have been funnier in their previous films! <br /> <br /> I notice that you do not watch, the images will haunt you for a long time!
