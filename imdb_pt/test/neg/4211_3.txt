I've always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he accomplished and his films. For now I was wanting to watch this movie, but for some reason I did not have a chance. Apparently I did not lose much. This has to be one of Chuck's worst movies. So this trucker, Billy Dawes (Augenstein) has the chance to make the delivery, but along the way he is diverted and forced into a city where the corrupt and corrupt Judge Trimmings (Murdock), who runs the whole town, . and false accusations brought about by him. He denies the charges and makes a run for it. Local police beat him and he disappears. But now his brother JD John Dawes (Norris) another trucker will look for him. He soon discovers that the city is run, buys the losing judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. Not long after it starts to hit almost everyone in the city. Meanwhile, the female of the film calls the local truckers on a CB radio, and they all come running to the city demolishing it. LOL with large platforms. Eventually Norris finds his brother and beats more bandits. <br /> <br /> This movie was really bad. It actually starts well and you feel good when Norris starts to crush some of these corrupt local cops because there are such losers. But there is practically no story, the acting is bad, and the ending is ... well, there is not one. The judge has your house squashed by a big platform and you never know what happens. He lives? Norris never quite destroys him. Meanwhile, Norris faces some thug cop at the end. Who cares? Norris also manages to face everybody in the city, has his hand broken and shot in the side and continues fighting. Let's go! This movie was apparently made to profit from the CB craze of the time, as there was one is beyond me. They even barley use the CB in the film. Adding to that, the film near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is bad, but if you are bored and need something to watch, it will pass the time. As far as Norris is concerned, he made much better movies than that. 3 out of 10.
