Initially, I was enthusiastic about this movie and hoped it was a combination of Equilibruim and Farenheit 451. Unfortunately, I was continually disappointed with the lack of depth and interest in the plot and subplots. In the middle of the movie, I divulged the fun of the characters and scenarios to avoid having to turn it off. I liked the premise of a future with mixed cultures and separation between those who have and those who do not. What could have been an ingenious and intelligent vision of the future has turned into a light-heavy, semantic movie with horrible acting, cheap sets, and a free finish on Tim Robbins' vagina. Maybe he should stick to his socialist policy - everything has been difficult since Shawshank.
