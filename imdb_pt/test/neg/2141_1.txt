I can not get over how horrible this movie was. My eyes want to leap out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible soundtrack of a horrible song. There are four children and a dog and they flee a hospital and leave stealing two cars and a bus. Nobody gives them any punishment or something to correct them. The acting is so horrible that it sounds like an instructional video for social studies class. I can not think of anything I like about this movie. Anything. Even the boy who loses his dog made me want to vomit. He takes the dog back without the woman to see the dog running through the door. Maybe the dog was trying to escape this movie. Then there is some horse manure in the whole mixture. It was torture to watch this movie. So, in the end, the older boy says that something like being together is not a crime and everyone embraces and loves him. Stealing gas is a crime. Stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have gone to the parlor or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
