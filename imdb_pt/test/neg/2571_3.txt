Steven Seagal made a really annoying, bad and annoying movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!!!!! ??? This movie has some action scenes, but they are misdirected and have nothing to do with the rest of the movie. A group of American Nazis spread a deadly virus, which is capable of ending the state of Montana. Wesley (Seagal character) desperately tries to find a cure, and that's the story of the Patriot. The Patriot is an extremely annoying movie because nothing happens. It is filled with a boring dialogue and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors. Steven Seagal was totally different in this movie, and I would not recommend this theft to my worst enemy. 3/10
