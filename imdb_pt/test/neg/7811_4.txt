It was stupid. Kind of like a Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were some funny but not so funny parts. <br /> <br /> I liked some of the actors. <br /> <br /> There were some Saturdays. Night Live people in the movie. But I would not recommend it unless there is nothing better. And it was even better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
