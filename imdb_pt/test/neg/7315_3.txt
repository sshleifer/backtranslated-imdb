University professor Justin Thorne (Jimmy Smits) did this. A beautiful and sophisticated teacher with a loving wife and two lovely children. He plays saxophone, owns an expensive car, and his students love and respect him. But when the temptation calls, in the form of one of her bright, beautiful, sexy, and willing students, Jennifer Carter (Naomi Watts), he foolishly gives way. The next day he is being charged with rape, and his perfect life could be eternally ruined. <br /> <br /> When we see an American actor in Australian cinema, we know that we do not have a masterpiece. But even seen with low expectations, "Gross Misconduct" is a big flop. Based on a game with an unimaginative title and then adapted into a fairly enjoyable book, he can not engage, convince, or even remotely interest his audience on a more fundamental level. The script is clumsy and unconvincing; the acting is, for the most part, not much better. Watts gives an acceptable performance, demonstrating one of the first times on the screen his raw emotion, but she is the only good thing about the film, which seems almost can not wait to end. <br /> <br /> The steering is not horrible or distracting in any way, but it is just painfully mediocre. In addition to the aforementioned Naomi Watts, who could be forgiven, since this was early in her career, the acting is made of wood and gets worse and worse throughout the film. The normally trustworthy Jimmy Smits does not seem to be trying to do this, and who could really blame him? All these small failures, however, only contribute to the film's last fatal flaw, which is to focus being totally in the wrong place. Any empathy for the characters or interest in the outcome is lost in a sea that is basically a soft type entertainment. In the end, the audience will probably be bored, tired and wishing they had done something else with their ninety minutes. Unless you just want to see Naomi get naked 4 or 5 times, you could definitely afford to give this non-obvious movie a lack.
