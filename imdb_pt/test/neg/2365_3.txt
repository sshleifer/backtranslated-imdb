"TNT Jackson" is not completely unwatchable. But either the version I saw on DVD was edited with a weed killer, or the script itself is the lowest level of grind-house / blaxploitation sausage. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell must have been a Playmate at some point in her career, and the film takes full advantage of the connection by displaying her breasts at least twice as much as was really necessary. (including a hilarious topless fight scene that I'm sure should be funny). I'll admit, they're pretty cool. Still, she has a medium-sized look and does not have the charisma of a Foxy Brown, not even a Cleopatra Jones. She has her moments as an actress in the film, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the script had given her the chance to do more than thrill "attitude" and kick people. Speaking of kicking people, the fight scenes (the other putative reason to watch a movie like this) are pretty badly made. There is no real choreography to speak of here, only people posing and punishing their feet and fists in the general direction of their opponents. One small exception is a good time with an opponent equipped with folding butterfly knives; another is a near-final sequence where an obvious trick for Bell (and maybe for Stan Shaw) to jump in and do some decent sweeps and basics for a minute or two before Bell / "Jackson" punches his enemy's liver, Shaw falls apart and the script just for. (Again, I'll admit this is very much in the tradition of Shaw Brother's quickies since time immemorial). <br /> <br /> There are some supporting actors who are really better than the movie deserves. thinking of "Joe" and the colleague throwing the drug lord's right arm. There is a funky soundtrack that complements the onscreen action and adds a star to the rating by itself. There is a semi-dishonest sex scene that can be effective almost in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for hardcore blaxploitation fans. I saw it out of sheer curiosity, and I do not regret having time. But I can not imagine wanting to have time to see it again unless I decide to write a dissertation on the intersections of pop culture from "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown."
