1960s children's show with ex-vaudevillians throwing men by hand for rent. As you might expect, they are a disaster in everything they do. Throughout the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15-minute interval), they do things like mount a fence between warring neighbors, help a wizard on stage and deal with a trunk and a wallet found. Growing up I had never run through this show (which seems to have been filmed in New York). I thought I had heard or seen most of the children's plays of the period, either by having seen them as a child, or by having seen them in conventions of nostalgia. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD, I was unaware of its existence. The show plays like the Three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello, made by people who imitate the routines. (Actually, one of the two claims to have created the legendary routine "Slowly I will come ..." that Abbott and Costello perfected). Not bad, but really not good, because everything seems diluted. Time is often turned off (though this may be due to bad direction) and the jokes were recycled years before the first show was performed. Odds are you've seen it all before. On the plus side, it's the kind of thing that would be perfect for introducing very young children to the magic of vaudeville-style comedy, however it will be tempting for parents to sit down even with the short episodes. <br /> <br /> Just for nostalgia junkies. All others should look to see an original from Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges.
