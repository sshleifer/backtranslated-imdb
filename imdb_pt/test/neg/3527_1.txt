"Nuts in May" may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Ed Wood were still alive, that would be the kind of movie he would make. To say that this movie is bad would be the euphemism of the century. But how bad is it really? Well, here are two levels of harm I've gone through; "it's so bad that it's good" or "it's so bad that it's AMAZING GOD". This movie falls into the last section. The unintentional little humor it has does not make up for the slow, difficult to understand and tedious majority of the film. <br /> <br /> Two middle-aged angels take a trip to the countryside for a bit of R & R and camping, there they met Ray's future Jim ( I'll explain later), which is the tent next to our main couple. For most of the film, the two protagonists pass by the beach, a quarry and other exciting places. Among these adventures, they talk incessantly about the environment, vegetarianism, fossil collection, the duty of a proper citizen and a proper diet, everything I want to see in a comedy. They support anyone who listens to them. The dialogue is not only bad, but the pace in some scenes is so slow that sometimes I felt like making a dose. Scenes would last forever and only when it starts to build itself and something is about to happen the scene ends. Halfway through the movie I thought to myself, "Nothing is going to happen in this thing, it's really a movie about nothing." <br /> <br /> Characters are annoying and constantly repeating things. In one part, I felt the director was making a cruel joke with his audience. The scene I am referring to is the "Sing Along" scene. In it our two bravest Brits play some of the music for us, in fact, they were the same four and four lines over and over again. The idea was to get Ray to sing along with them, but Ray knew, just like us, that they are the worst composers known to man. This scene was beyond boring, for the fifth time the song was played I began to question the existence of a merciful God. <br /> <br /> Words can not describe the horror of this movie. The first thing that catches the eye is the indecipherable British accent that most cast members have. Remember the thick Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Times that by 10. <br /> <br /> At the end of our tree hugging, incoherent, couple get into a row with some of Ray's friends who have full disrespect for the rules of camping. Our hero gets so enraged that a climatic battle begins between our hero and the head of hell. To resolve the dispute, the two men engage in a fight. That's right a stick fight! Now that's when unintended humor begins. I laughed so much at the ineptitude of everything I thought, "That can make up for the other 80 minutes." After this heroic battle, our hero runs behind some bushes to cry and the other calls Ray, calling him Jim for some unknown reason. <br /> <br /> A stick fight, a tearful nature loving 40 years of age. and a character's name changes 3/4 for the movie, Ed Wood would be proud. <br /> <br /> Although, I have been forced again to endure the last 10 minutes, which, to sum up, ends with a long catch of a pig. . Because? who the hell knows. In a moment, we see a pig grazing and then the credits begin to appear on the screen. One of the worst ending to one of the worst movies ever.
