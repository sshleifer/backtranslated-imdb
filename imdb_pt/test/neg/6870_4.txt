There really is very little positive that can be said about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a truly unconvincing hero and even more so when he tries to "disguise himself" as a villain who, we believe, drinks too much and beats his wife a little. Margaret Leighton as the undercover wife / sergeant is a bit more convincing, but it's still hard to believe any cover worthy of her salt would not have seen through her charade in less than a minute. The plot, about a cookie steal, is silly, and the action drags instead of grabbing. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way that David Tomlinson seems to play all his roles, is the only glimmer of light on a totally monotonous subject.
