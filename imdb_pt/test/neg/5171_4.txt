First of all I'm going to give this movie a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing more than a pretentious movie. I felt very disappointed watching this movie. I was taken to people, it would be more drama and more facts about the true story on which it is based. Instead I spent more than an hour watching middle aged means breaking the law and taking drugs. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like the football factory, but without a real plot and not a good ending. After watching the movie I kept asking myself "What was that movie?" If you like movies without a real plot and lots of drugs and swearing then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of gang movies and gangs, but this movie did not end for the hype. I can see where the writer was trying to go with the movie, but it never reached its destination. One of the worst British movies I've ever seen. If only the movie had more than one plot, this would have a great and bad movie.
