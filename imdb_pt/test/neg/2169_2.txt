While the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "crap" was the breast count, but that was not enough to make me watch it again. All said and done I'm really dumber to watch this movie. This was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman starting the movie using a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what I was getting myself into. This was by far one of the worst ever made by the Troma team. The best place to show this movie would be invalid, as they can not get up to change the channel. To conclude, this is not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.
