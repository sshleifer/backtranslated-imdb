There is no reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First, the acting is horrible. There is no line that is not misinterpreted - but this is not surprising, given the banality, stupidity and repetitiveness of the dialogue that actors must do. It is terribly written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that writers seem to know only one way to keep their characters talking after a certain point and this is for them to repeat the most important words of the previous character's line. <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yeah, they repeat, for the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. <br /> <br /> In movies like this you usually know who the bad guys are and what they are after. (All the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys.) Setting up a good "Mwahahaha! With X within my reach I'll rule the Universe!", The villain is the first stop in any SF plot) but in this turkey? - you tell me. <br /> <br /> From what I understand, our "heroes" are a bunch of mass murderers sent to the past on a Dirty Dozen-type mission. They are sent by a fascist totalitarian state to prevent some other mass murderers from altering the course of history. The new story would not include the rise of totalitarianism, and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the Earth a dead planet (we know all this because this movie has one of those long situation reports on the screen before the action starts) who is who and what is. "It's an indication of who producers think their target audience will be, which is narrated and appears on screen - just to prevent the public from overloading their brains by doing a lot of reading.) So who are we who are cheering for here ? I think we are asked to believe that our hero embarks on some sort of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding as we shoot at many people - but that does not work like a bow because we are shown to be a decent human ish) Being right in the beginning, when he tries to rescue all civilians aboard the rebel station. <br /> <br /> I think the creators were aiming for some kind of deeper complexity than normal in this movie, but they did away with a profane mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or more your average crap SF movies. <br /> <br /> The opening credits were good.
