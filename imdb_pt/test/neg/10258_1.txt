This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen; that makes Plan 9 of the Outer Space look wonderful. The acting is made of wood, the silly storyline and the non-existent SFX. The only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long movie. The scenery is sometimes quite beautiful, assuming you like trees, if that helps anyone!
