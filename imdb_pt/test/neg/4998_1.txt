So you've seen Romero's movies, yes? And you saw Jacob's ladder, right? And the later Hellraiser films? Ok, now let's make a movie of all three, let's just put it together and make a big mess, seems like a good idea? <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Absolutely awful. Yeah, it's an indie movie, who sucks? Is this a pass to make film excrement? The film tries to establish credibility, focusing on the interaction of characters, this is very evident. Unfortunately for writers, they are not good at character interaction. This is not the night of the undead; the characters are nonentities screaming their futile lines at each other in a vain attempt to get picked up by the microphones on set. The dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses so much on character interaction, you'd think the characters would have something more to say than "WHAT WE WILL DO" "I do not know" "WELL WE WILL DO SOMETHING" "Well, what are we going to do? "I do not know." "We should leave." "LET'S ACCEPT OUR FATE." "No, we have to leave." "Well, let's leave it then." "No, maybe we should stay." <br /> <br /> This is no exaggeration, there are changes in this film that reach this level of redundancy and inanity. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is half a dream and it really has a zero purpose. in the dream has any relevance to anything else in the rest of the film.The writers could not decide whether to make a zombie movie or a movie of monsters and then they would do both.It is patently ridiculous, the cheapest trick of the book, and it is maddeningly insulting, especially since I'm sure they stole the idea of ​​Jacob's ladder, who dealt with the concept so much more competent than these clowns could expect And then there is the issue. Years of watching MTV and playing horror-themed video games must have inspired filmmakers, but it's certainly a sad thing they did not realize what made the editing and the obfuscation choppy in these effective media in the first place. In this movie, you'll be confused frequently, not in the good, David Lynch way, but in the bad "Wait I thought she just got killed, did not she?" "Who the hell was that?" "Wait, who is this guy? "How did they get here?" Kind of way. It is consistently and consistently bad. <br /> <br /> This film is a laughable piece of crap and should only be looked for if you want to mess with some friends and laugh about it. <br /> <br /> And as a final note: as for the "comedy" that people from other reviews are talking about, everything is not intentional. There is not a single intentional piece of comedy in this movie. Everything should be a serious serious study of characters, because filmmakers want to have credibility in their concept of horror. Unfortunately, his claims do not match his ability.
