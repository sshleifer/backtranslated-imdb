Beginning of the movie Jackie Chan, where there is no sign of the persona Chan we know. This is Chan in a traditional tale of revenge which has been cloned and re-cloned by numerous producers and studios in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China. It's a very serious story that shows nothing of the mood and heat that would catapult Jackie Chan into super stardom. It is also clear from this that if he had not reinvented himself, we probably never knew him because his career would have been painfully short. As a movie by its own merits, this is a beautiful movie, but that is not worth noting. I was watching in the middle of a martial arts marathon that would last all day and that would have blended in with all the other movies I watched that day if I had not noticed Jackie in the movie. Honestly, I do not think the movie really pays any attention (there are many other better variations) except if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.
