Simply miserable vehicle Lana Turner-Ezio Pinza. Pinza had a beautiful voice but rarely uses it in a movie that reminds me of "The Student Prince" with adults. Pinza is also not the protagonist. He looks like an old man ready to collect social security and fish. <br /> <br /> The plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of Barry Sullivan, Marjorie Maine and Debbie Reynolds has so little to do. Sir Cedric Hardwicke arrives at the end to announce that our king Ezio must return to his people. As far as I'm concerned, the faster the better. Is this Lana Turner really singing with the Pinza? Not bad if it's her. The image would also remind me of the movie "The Prince and the Showgirl", 1960, with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier.
