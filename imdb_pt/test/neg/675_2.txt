Watching this for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - asking what kind of girl wants to be a "model" and two - run to the nearest ice cream parlor and have a low-fat sundae. /> <br /> I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of ​​this reality show competition. No other "famous" model has thought of it, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series continues and I have come to the conclusion that this is a lot of people trying to make a mountain out of a mound. Women should not watch this, teenagers should stay away from it unless they are reporting on it. <br /> <br /> Many women try to compete for "Americas Next Top Model." They live together, fight together, weep together, go through senseless modeling models, and model useless people and fashionatas, and they're eliminated, and almost all of them say, "You'll see me again." Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the winners, actually. <br /> <br /> This is some girls dream and good for them. While watching this, I hope the other girls will see it and run like Hades another way - like college. <br /> <br /> I just watched this recent season because of the "trick" to figure it all out. models that join the group. It even made me think more about it as a lot of people. The "full models" were no more than the mid-size women competing with what I think is the thinnest set of models they chose - so of course that would make them even fatter - a "trick" fashionatas uses all the time. Bad, bad, tyra and crew. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, "Americas Next Top Model" is not about "complete" models, it is about designing an imagined image, a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the best in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. That's a great deal of judges, photographers, associations. So Tyra and her consistent "this was me" connects every camera angle you can get. But again, that's the only thing I like about this show - the former model giving others who would not have the chance - a chance to get in the door. But after that ... everything else is status quo for that industry, and that's why there are no surprises or weekly interest in the program.
