The growth of tax funds and leasing schemes has led to a number of unsaleable films that are accumulating dust in laboratories and warehouses across the British Isles because they seem to have been made just because they fit the financial criteria rather than potential audience. A few lucky few have a week on a small screen in London before they go to DVD budget, but The Riddle is distinguished by completely ignoring the movies, the TV or even the rental market to debut as a free gift DVD in Mail on Sunday. It's very easy to see why it ended up being literally donated. In addition to a few flaws (a boom microphone is clearly visible in a single shot) is not particularly badly done, and while Vinnie Jones appears as the modern version of the British cinema of Freddie Mills Mills as the greyhound reporter who wants to pass to crime table and the support cast from ham to vaguely passable, no one stands out here for being exceptionally good or exceptionally bad: mediocrity is more the norm here. The real problem is that, like so many movies about sales and lease tax funds, it's a 'soft' movie - there's no reason to watch it. It exists because circumstances existed for it to be made, but lacks pace or forward momentum. It seems to be targeting the audience on Sunday's television (despite being filmed on Scope), but it does not cut. There are some okish ideas in this harmless tale of an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript and a pair of suspicious deaths in the modern Limehouse, but the mysterious element is so painfully obvious - as is the supernatural last-minute turnaround (you are I'll never guess who really, it's Jacobi's learned tramp. "" What, you guessed it? "" You're almost expecting the Scooby Gang or Double Deckers to show up to solve it. "" It's a very wrong movie. the types of motives: some cast members are playing double roles when they should not be playing one, and the whole revealing shock of the truth of Dickens' manuscript is completely wrong because it's all told in the first person by Dickens than the supposed character of the novel The main murder of the film is clumsily integrated into the main storyline, with characters reminding Vinnie suddenly that he has already forgotten about it, announcing a half hour c again more desperate to see developer's secretary Jason Flemyng putting some of Rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so she can take her bad way with him and leave incriminating pictures behind "to make you look like an idiot with your girlfriend," prompting him to have a dream where he talks to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's in a Name?"), which offers the somewhat less likely suggestion that "you read many books." But all this is nothing compared to the end, which falls into the absurd, with logic and common sense coming out the window, like a tragedy of bizarre Jacobean revenge with pistols on the banks of the Thames with two-day guests. Flemyng and Vanessa Redgrave looking like they'd rather be somewhere else (Mel Smith appears in a one-day appearance, so it's clear that the movie's "names" are there for only $ 10,000 or to pay alimony payments). The final image of the film is so absurd and useless that it is almost worth watching. One curiosity is a rather prominent role in the first third of Vera Day, a kind of prototype of Liz Fraser and once the basis of the 1950s British films - the barmaid in Hell Drivers, the Quatermass waitress II - here promoted to pub owner, while comedian Kenny Lynch briefly appears to give the best performance as an old school gangster. Oh, and the late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow as - oh, the irony - a medical examiner ... Just to complete the package, the free DVD also included a trailer for the other film director with Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, a British horror with transatlantic scientists and Vinnie in Elmer Fudd, a duck hunter terrified by a reanimated 2000-year sacrifice victim from the nearest marsh ("Be wewwy, wewwy qwuiet: I'm hunting" dwuids ") I can not wait ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I can guarantee, however, is that every indie producer in the UK will spend the next few weeks trying to figure out exactly how much the Mail paid. (they paid Â£ 250,000 for his new CD.) With so much evidence of British tax shelters on the shelf and money so hard to find at the time, this could become an interesting retreat market for British films.
