This was an attempt at a romantic comedy and one that did not work out. Although the film was interestingly released, the dark script betrayed the best efforts of all. The director's fey mannerisms may have succeeded if he had taken a point of view. It was embarrassing to watch William Baldwin, and in particular Armin Muller-Stahl.
