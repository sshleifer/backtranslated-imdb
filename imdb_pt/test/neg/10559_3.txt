"Shade" strives to be another "Sting," replacing poker by horse racing as the means of overthrowing an enemy, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> I watched the whole thing and still could not understand it very well because the young man wanted to cross the partner. Is it because your partner stole your girl? Is there a woman in the world who is worth facing so many problems? If it exists, it certainly was not this shrew. She did not have redeeming qualities, and really now, did she really have a special room so a surgeon could remove the kidney from anyone trying to get her into a bar? Dina Merrill makes a small appearance as a wealthy woman who hosts, of all things, poker parties paid for rent in her palace house. And then the players say things like, "I'm going to see your thousand and raise you five thousand more." Give me some time. You can not call ("see") and increase, you do one or the other. Any child playing coins and coins on the kitchen table knows this; you think that men grown up playing for such high stakes-or at least the idiots who wrote the script-would know that too. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned that no high limit poker game would allow players to actually distribute their own cards and I agree. You do not allow two of the best-known car cheats to enter a game where the buy-in is $ 250,000 and then allows them to trade with each other. This is not poker; That's just seeing which one can fool you better. And I'd like to know what sane person would buy for a game where two of the best known cards are playing and expect him to have a chance to win? And above all, which boss of the mafia would command such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith stepped on the screen I was so hypnotized by those gigantic red fluorescent lips that I completely lost the plot, and seeing her and Stallone together was more like a wrong plastic surgery public service announcement than a love call. Stallone mentions that she used to be a swindler before buying the restaurant she now runs but we do not know what kind of fancier she was and we've never seen her working with Stallone in her younger days, so we wonder if we even care about it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the entire movie but he is killed right off the bat and we get pieces of cardboard that sound like they're re-reading their lines from a teleprompter off camera. <br /> <br /> The ending does not make sense either. The kid gets his cut of the game and just walks down the street with a suitcase full of money and your partner is far from seen? Is not the Mafia watching every move it makes? Do all the others just shrug their shoulders and silently accept the loss of millions of dollars without trying to regain any of it? I think not. <br /> <br /> Most of all, this movie is a great injustice to professional poker players around the world, implying that the only way to win is by playing cards and playing juiced. "decks.And why are they always cheering kings and aces? Sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a whole house or straight. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole movie are the tricks of sleight of hand during the initial and final credits, everything in between is ridiculous.
