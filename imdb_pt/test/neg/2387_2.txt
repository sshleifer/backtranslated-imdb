If you see the title "2069 A Sex Odyssey" in the video store, BEWARE !! The cover has Tori Wells and three other porn stars of the '80s, and is copyrighted 1986. If you're like me (and I hope it's not), you're going to think of "80s porn" Tori Wells? " Deception It was made in 1974 and dubbed German Stars! There's nothing intrinsically wrong with German porn from the 70's, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like what the cover takes you to believe you're getting. After I got over my anger over the ostensibly deceptive jacket, I watched anyway. It's a bad and bad movie. Sorry, I guess I was not angry.
