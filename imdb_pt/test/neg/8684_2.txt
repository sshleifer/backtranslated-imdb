This movie was a total yawn that took forever to continue, but never did. It was just boring to watch, so much so that I could never really get into it. This movie is not a horror movie by a stretch of the imagination, the cover of the videotape made out to be one. Instead, it's a movie-type thriller with some horror elements released to make the film more interesting. Of course, this does not help anything in this movie. Mostly all I remember is that this movie was like a 1970s movie called "The Deep". Bunch to look for treasures, rival groups that kind of thing. There are also supernatural twists, but to tell the truth, I was so bored when I watched this movie that I sort of jumped so I could not really tell what the supernatural elements were. I kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea, so maybe it was some kind of undead, or maybe I was thinking of Lucio Fulcio's movie "Zumbi," like it was a horror movie that was set on a tropical island . Strange as it was, it was a lot more fun than this movie. On that day, we learned a valuable lesson, never rented a movie based on its cover.
