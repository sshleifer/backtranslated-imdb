I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it a rating of 4, and in my opinion that's too loud for a softporn movie. The current plot is kind of corny (who could expect otherwise), but Hafron is incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a cyborg voice, so it's easy for him. Who wrote the script had some sagacity definitely! I must have laughed ten times, and that's not the reason someone would get this movie. The only softporn movie I saw that had any other merit besides beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is very beautiful ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, considering also that the film was not meant to entertain artistically, so to speak, it gets at least a four in my book. I mean, who would not watch this before they stopped! Or is my mother going to shoot?
