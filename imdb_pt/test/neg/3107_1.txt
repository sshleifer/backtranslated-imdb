Do not rent this movie. I ended up buying the "previewed" ribbon for $ 4.00. That was close to the price of a rental, so I thought, I might as well buy it. I'm throwing away after finishing this review. The film, starring Lowe, is a video clip with few lines of dialogue, taken in slow motion and poorly made editing. I thought I'd be watching an irrational action movie, which is what I wanted to see, I did not even realize it. This film is an exercise in slow moving shots, with no script, close-ups, terrible editions and an underdeveloped plot. I can not believe this really ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. At the end of the movie, we still do not know who they are. Believe in hype, stay away.
