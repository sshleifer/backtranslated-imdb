This is just one of those movies that continually make you moan and that I wanted it to end. The problems are many and the positives are few. I feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what a cheesy plot and they try to make it an epic movie, that a movie about super bad and smart monkeys who sign is not epic, it's cheese. When you eat cheese, it makes the movie more fun. Granted, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very enjoyable to watch and more of things of that nature were needed. Instead, the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the film has a rough plot amidst all the tension the movie is trying to create. The plot revolves around a woman trying to figure out what happened to her missing ex-husband while also looking for some sort of legendary diamonds. She uses these two guys who trained a monkey to make sign language and now want to return it to wildlife as cover to enter the country and begin the mediocre adventure of her life. The only things that make this movie a bit bearable are the character of Ernie Hudson and the laser attack at the end.
