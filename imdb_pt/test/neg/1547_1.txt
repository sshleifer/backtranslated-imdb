I bought this movie at a garage sale when I was 15 years old. I hated it then, and watch it again, just the hell of it, it's even worse now. You can hear the director and videographer in the background shouting commands like "Zoom, zoom, zoom !!!". There are no special effects, just a piece of meat that is supposedly a brain. That sucks, and I originally thought it was a home movie or something I bought. But this was distributed elsewhere and it is very strange to know that other people have seen it. Oops I need 10 lines .... well .... this can be an interesting thing to see how budget-less movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. That sucks. In fact, yes, watch this just to see if you can sit with the worst. If you can get through it, you can go through anything.
