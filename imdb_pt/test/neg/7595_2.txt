This film is an awkward mix of various phantom-thriller and suspense-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them quite annoying. The script was superficial. The performance, idem. The scary FX was mostly laughable, except for an exquisite moment in the bank that scared me, even though I saw it coming a mile away. Now, explain to me somebody why you would need ghosts, And black magic, And mysterious ritual objects, And count GC buddies, And psychic investigators, And familiar curses, And Irish superstitions, And bowls of milk left for supernatural beings, And he had dollies, all in the same movie? With everything you would expect more than a good moment of horror, but this film is lame, lame, lame.
