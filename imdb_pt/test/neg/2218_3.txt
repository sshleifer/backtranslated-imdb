"At the Core of Earth" was on television yesterday. I was on my computer working and by chance I looked and saw what must have been one of the worst action sequences ever made. I was instantly delighted with the film's poor production values, with the hideous acting (including Peter Cushing) and creepy, unintended action sequences, and puppet monsters. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Victorian scientist. who takes a Stereotyped Buff American Hero on a boring trip in the Welsh countryside. Little do they know that a great evil hides in the center of the earth's core ... Forget the fact that the title does not make sense. (If they were really in the center of the earth, they would be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and would burn alive in a sea of ​​iron or whatever down there.) Forget that the puppets used in production rival "O Master of the Beast ". for being the cutest of all time. No, the true genius of "At the Earth's Core" is its naive stupidity - a spectacle of action without real action and without real spectacle. In essence, it's just a movie and an idiot in that. People who like things in the MST3K style will love this - it's terribly bad and actually it's so bad that it's almost nice in a weird way.
