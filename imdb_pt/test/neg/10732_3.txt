A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for very bad disguises (afro wig on a white face?) Travels in his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer quite easily just leaving the local pool and looking for anyone who looks strange (again, the afro wig comes into play). Following the killer to his house, DeCarlo decides to set up a risky trap involving a female police psychologist. <br /> <br /> Inspired by Ted Bundy's crimes before being caught, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a very predictable and inexpensive serial. killer movie Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to tour a movie or even make suspense. He knows how to show off many killer closes by twisting his hands! The only thing you really have for this is the atmosphere of the 70's captured (look at the bathroom wallpaper). Well, that's a pessimistic ending. The DVD Media Blasters / Shriek Show has many good things, including an audio commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternative opening.
