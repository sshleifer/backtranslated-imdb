This movie was physically painful to sit in, maybe because (like many people my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and I loved his books - funny, clever, capricious and subversive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" sucks all interest and awakens the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly baffling. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the dull standard, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless outfit? I had to go back and reread the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> You do not expect every child's movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this movie sets a new record. How could Mike Myers need the money?
