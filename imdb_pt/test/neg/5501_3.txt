Several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. First, the setting and the special effects are incredible - the best, and if everything else worked too, his austere presence could have made him a great movie. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in their hiding place watching a movie. The story itself is full of clech√© and melodrama, and dialogue is one of the worst I have ever seen. And as if that was not bad enough, they made a fool of themselves out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you do not want to do this unless the movie is a comedy. <br /> <br /> I had trouble getting into it and would not recommend it.
