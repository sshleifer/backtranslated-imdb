Interesting topic. Pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, thaws and has his first lifetime restoration surgery. This is where the fun begins. The underlying question is that Miles has no soul! This is used to explain his almost erratic behavior of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I believe this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the bright side, Miles prefers the strange glass of brandy, red-hot fireplaces, and his young, mature cousin. The ending, in fact, does justice to this film. <br /> <br /> Some Thoughts: 1. The $$$ producer split up to create that gut. J.D. Feigelson was the writer and one (or the only) producer. It seems he has not learned a lesson about "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" when one sees his other writing credits. This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! This is really scary. It should always be "Bottom of the Shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A human reincarnated, soulless, will be the pattern of an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The score provides minimal support. Not even a fit Jerry Goldsmith could save him. <br /> <br /> 5. Deserved Schedule 0230 on TV and a touch more fun than the infomercials + test patterns I was competing with at the time of my viewing. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately it did not spawn any franchise from Wes Craven's "Nightmare." Chiller Too: Return Return of Miles, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting career or screenwriter. This should apply to the direction, however Wes Craven will be eternally exempted due to his only good piece of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" 1984.
