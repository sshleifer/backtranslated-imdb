I love ghost stories and I'm going to sit in a movie until the end, even though I do not like it very much. I rarely feel like I wasted my time ... BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was awful! <br /> <br /> It was not scary at all. What about moments of comic relief? The dialogue was tedious. Inconsistent acting The film was very long and some scenes were unnecessarily prolonged in my open space. (Like at the birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can think of to mention is that the costumes and accessories were well made. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about another adaptation, but until then, I'll be reading about the story.
