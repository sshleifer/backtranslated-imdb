I'm not sure who's having the most fun, the people who wrote the reviews or the director of the movie. I could no longer read these comments or watch this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I can see a western low budget movie that is done with passion and interest in detail, but using a garage with art deco letters, pastel colors, actors who seem to be falling asleep because the script is so annoying and the "boom" getting in the way of the camera every two scenes, is definitely not my definition of "one of the best western movies". produced in the new millennium. "<br /> <br /> Please, if any of you had friends in the movie just say it!
