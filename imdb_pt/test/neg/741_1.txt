Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production does not make his tongue wonderful on the cheek romance any justice. Starting at the top ... ill-adapted. The writer deserves more low grades for trying - come to think of it, I do not know what she was trying, but suffice to say she missed the mark for light years! Couple this with all the exaggerated and terrible production values, this is an adaptation that should never have taken place. It would have been a lot better if they just gave all the money they spilled on this flop and donated it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor, read the book. You'll almost certainly have a thousand times more fun than trying to get through this excruciating production!
