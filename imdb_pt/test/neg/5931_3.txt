Congratulations to Baxley's DP for making it look like a real movie, the first time it happened in this series (with the notable exception of F / X scenes). Approaching film production figures, however, lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. They were very much in the 'so bad they are good' category of horrendous entertainment movies. Can one argue that the "believers" were simply trying to make a generic action movie with prayers? There are so many times in the movie that they dismiss their own belief system as being annoying. If everything that happens is according to God's will and they are simply their instruments, than the people who are infected with the virus have to happen as part of their plan, right? Apply this to every situation where someone in the faith does not submit to the will of God, and you get a little hypocritical movie from the director of 'Action Jackson'.
