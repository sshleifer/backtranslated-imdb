I'm not surprised to find user reviews for this movie full of absurdities, like the fact that this movie "[proves] that when it's predestined, love will find a way." I start this way, not to criticize a specific reviewer, but because this quote typifies the hyperbolic and uncritical deal that was spilled on this film, even before it hit theaters. Even the best films do not "prove" anything, nor do they claim to do so. The best films entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails on both criteria. I remember very clearly the promotion of "The English Patient": "From the producers of 'Amadeus' and 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' he announced grandly. An ignorant or careless listener may lose his crucial word "producers" in this statement insincere and misleadingly associate the director of "The English Patient", very inadequately, with the really great director, Milos Forman.This comparison is offensive to Mr. Forman's memory. While the novel by Michael Ondaatje on which the film was based is a good one, it is unfortunate that the film failed to capture any quality of the book in any way. In addition to plot elements that seem only coincidentally similar, film has little resemblance to the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the doubts that started when I heard this blatantly misleading promotion, I went to see this movie in the theater.When it began to unfold, I realized that the interpretation of the peculiar magic of the novel had failed, that the actors knew their words, but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, bland and uninteresting. The film was a complete farce of Ondaatje's novel and a cinematic artifact completely native to the worst description. <br /> <br /> Those who fight for this movie are very apt to speak with adjectives such as "sweeping" and "grand" and "hypnotic". Well, it's nothing like that. In fact, not even Ondaatje's good novel could be described as "comprehensive" or "grandiose." It could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" - however, these are precisely the qualities that the film so completely failed to deliver. It is almost as if Minghella, as a reader, had totally lost what was valuable in the novel, and could roll only a pale, skeletal version in celluloid, a version that not only missed the spirit of the story but also the wrong characters. He produced a filmic transliteration that not only had no respect for the metaphors of history, but also had no apparent knowledge of them. Minghella pushed the central focus away from Hana and Kip and placed her on the Patient and Katherine Clifton, thus losing the narrative trail of the novel as well as the "essence" of it. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas performed non-emotional, uninspired, uninvolved performances that they obviously intended to convey. a great love affair of conduct and passion for the spectator, but which, in fact, transmitted only an inexplicable and superficial connection between two adulterers, flat, slow and uninteresting. Both actors are physically and emotionally inadequate and uninteresting, and neither performance provided the viewer with the great emotional response obviously intended by Minghella's grandiose and exaggerated presentation. The "grand, sweeping, David-Lean-like" qualities to which the many indiscriminate critics of this movie enjoy reference simply are not there. The comparison with David Lean ("Dr.Jivago") is insulting to another great director. Take, for example, the "patient" sandstorm scene, which is undoubtedly one in which these "grandiose" qualities are believed to have resided (or should have resided): the sandstorm is not grandiose - not even is convincing. The subsequent burial of the characters in the car and its aftermath after the storm, which was bound to affect the viewer in a dramatic and emotional way, lacked drama or emotion altogether-in fact, because it was so patently weak, it had a comedic air about it , where the comedy was clearly out of place. <br /> <br /> This movie failed. It failed as a translation of the novel and failed as a movie. It seems to have been the "anointed vehicle of the Oscar" of the year (joining the deafening cinematic nonsense like "Kramer vs. Kramer" or "Terms of Endearment"). One can only thank God that even hyped-up acadamy had the good sense to present the award for Best Actress to Frances McDormand for her truly deserving performance in the truly excellent film Fargo. There was not a single performance in the execrable "English Patient" that was not either embarrassingly horrible over-acting (Willem Dafoe) or truly forgettable, mediocre acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Why This Not The identity of a movie keeps a coven of fanatics (and clearly insipid) devotees will remain a mystery. Fortunately, the sands of time will bury this mediocrity of a film permanently, and will not, fortunately, have the force of digging.
