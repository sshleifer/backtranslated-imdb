When I saw the trailers in this movie, it seemed like a good romantic comedy. I expected some light and cute fun. Instead, I was bored and a bit depressed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there was no chemistry among the leaders, and the movie had little or no fun about it. The girl was adorable - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might have used someone a little younger on paper. <br /> <br /> Either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or bloating opera music. I'm not anti-opera, but I'd rather have them spend that time allowing us to meet the characters, who were all rigid and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with this movie. All the time I watched, I wondered how much better it might have been.
