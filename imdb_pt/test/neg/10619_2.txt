Now this is a bad movie, if I ever saw one. In one of the biggest years of the cinema, in 1999, Detroit Rock City fights with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West by the vacancy in a barrel of addicts. The plot is masterful. Four skinny young high school students finally got a chance to watch KISS's hard rock theater for the third consecutive year. So when your tickets are sold by an ultra-religious mother and chain smoker, friends strive to get to Detroit, and I'm sure you can find out the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; the film goes to extreme measures to explain how the four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) will get those tickets: lose their virginity in a confessional; save a smoked bimbo and his mother's Volvo (from the soprano Steve Schirripa, however); prevent a steal in the midst of a failure for a 12-year-old's debt; and of course undress for your essential essentials for MC Jeremy Ron after transporting a blender complete with bourbon scraps. Sounds funny, does not it? Maybe Detroit Rock City has a point with all this nonsense on how extreme sometimes these fans can go. And we understand that this movie is a comedy; is supposed to be filled with clowning. But does Detroit Rock City target the right audience? It is classified as R, meaning the only form of pre-teen teens - the public as I see it, to which many will end up hailing this a classic voyeur via illegal terms. <br /> <br /> Detroit Rock City also failed to give itself the touch of the late 1970s. The quality of the camera's texture is too bright and too bright, leaving out the necessary talent of films like This Is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would allow the audience to feel "more at home" with the times. Simply dressing kids in pre-90s grunge wear and putting other people on "hells disco" does not do the trick. Environment means something you know; I doubt Detroit has looked so glamorous in '78. If there's anything positive coming out of this movie, it's the rock soundtrack from the late '70s to the early' 80s. Van Halen, AC / DC, his name is everything. on here. Of course we can not forget KISS, the band appropriately submitted. <br /> <br /> What the film notably fails to interpret are questions as to why the service of the Knights of Satin (actually is just KISS) was so frowned upon by mothers across the country. Of course, high rock and diabolic makeup can be part of that; incentives for young people to explore and have fun can also be just reasons. But, what is KISS saying in the song we heard throughout the movie for this highly rebellious group? What separates these anthems from "rock [ing] and roll [ing] all night and partying everyday" from the rest of the song? Most likely, these issues will remain in a music communication class and not in the movies that should answer them simply because it is KISS and they are wonderful and we must do everything in our power forgiven by God to see them. <br /> 1.5 / 5 stars
