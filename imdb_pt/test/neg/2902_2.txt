... and boy is the deafening collision. A female telephone operator is dominated by the spirit of a newly deceased ninja, strips of her dirty clothes, dumps tomato juice on her body so her boyfriend can lick it, does a seductive dance, and leaves to kill the cops who killed the ninja she owned. Just to be hunted by a one-eyed ninja master. Just like in real life, huh? Excited only by Sho Kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his decline in putting his nasty boys on it), you really have to see this to believe. It's the ultimate blend of genres totally in odds.
