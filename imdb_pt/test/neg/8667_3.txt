For a teenager who has never read Austen, this adaptation may be good. But only for them. This is a disjointed version of Mansfield Park's "Cliff Notes," and if you did not see another version or read the books, it would be scratched in the head. <br /> <br /> Why has it been so difficult to make a good adaptation of this book? The one of the 1990s took such liberties that it hardly seemed to be the same book - the mindset was completely modern and lascivious. <br /> <br /> Here we have Billie Piper, who looks like a beautiful peasant. She has a charming personality that develops very well - but she died blatantly in blond hair, with black eyebrows and - through much of the photo - dark brown roots. So much for untouched cousin. It's incredibly disturbing, and the rest of the cast is in oily hair, sort of rumpled clothing that shows a real disrespect for the accuracy of the period. <br /> <br /> One thing is good here - Haley Atwell is the best Mary Crawford of all versions. It is a perfect note, flirting without being modern or suggestive, irreverent and completely without any moral or ethical compass. Henry here is really handsome enough to be a little temptation for our heroine. <br /> <br /> Jemma Redgrave takes on one of the most interesting roles in the story and manages to make her really annoying until her last scene - also sensible. This is just a production that really missed the mark, a real low for Austen fans. <br /> <br /> The only version that can be used is that with Sylvestra La Touzel (despite the very gay Henry Crawford - he's just laughable).
