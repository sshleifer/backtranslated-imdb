I love movies ... and I rarely see a movie that I hate ... but that was the worst movie I've ever seen, or at least close to it. Any movie that ends with a rape scene is horrible. Hands down ... I can not believe I lost 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm very angry, I want my money back and my time back. HORRIBLE! Do not go see, cinematography is horrible, the plot is horrible, the end is horrible. I did not know what was going on during the middle of the movie because I could not see (and I was watching on a very good and big TV) Rent saw, the hills have eyes, or house wax ... any of those are better if You want something scary.
