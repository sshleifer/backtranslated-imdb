Hulk Hogan plays Rip a professional wrestler who has a big heart but is pushed to the limit when his girlfriend (Joan Severence) is kidnapped by bandits who force him to face another wrestler (Tiny Lister Jr.). The bottom of the barrel actioner is such failure that even Hogan seems ashamed to be in it, and with the evidence portrayed, he should be.
