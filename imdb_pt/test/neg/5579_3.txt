From the opening shot of the meteor falling toward Earth, you know you're doing something special. <br /> <br /> This is an ultra low budget photo in a video movie about a group of teenagers trapped on a lighthouse island. with some monsters. The story is not worthy of note and nothing you have not seen a thousand times before. The acting is not great but it's not completely horrible, however, the special effects - of which there is a good deal - are laughable at best. In fact, if you can read that phrase, it's better than 50% chance to do a more reliable job by creating the blast effects of video and composition in that movie than the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The saving grace of the movie - if you're in the mood for a turkey from a movie - is that there's always something going on and it never gets boring. And if you like to make fun of bad movies with your friends, you may find it worth renting a dollar. <br /> <br /> And I must say I enjoyed the opening joke, "This is the stupidest name on an island. I've heard of it." Probably the best moment in the movie.
