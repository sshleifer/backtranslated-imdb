This movie is scary at times, maybe no more so when a naked George Kennedy tells his prostitute girlfriend that he wants some more sugar. Fortunately, your nudity is covered by a blanket, but the image is even more horrible than anything you can find, for example, on Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film was inspiring; inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a stewardess talks about male pilots, Kennedy asks, "Why do you think this is called a 'stick' pit?" Lovely. <br /> <br /> And yes, contrary to what some wrote, this movie is very, very bad.
