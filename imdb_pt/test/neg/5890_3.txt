I just saw this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews, I was expecting a good emotional movie. What I got was something boring and boring. Yes, I found it annoying. I saw the all-star get hurt long before the game. I figured maybe they expected him to collapse until, you know, the game before the "big", but I think the first game is good enough. <br /> <br /> Parents' relationships were also very clich√©d, with the drunk parent dominant (I would say McGraw impressed me, though), and the boy who wants to stay and help the (sick) mother. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who have been in the movie for 5 minutes, and simply put there to cause football players to do some off-field action. I thought "ok, now how does this work in the plot again?" Maybe I missed the point, other than "Well, they play football in a city that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet." The sports action had some good points, but for the most part it was so rushed! I think the first game lasted longer than the whole playoffs set up! And I was not so sure about the clock continuity at the end of the game. <br /> <br /> I think I could see this movie winning the ESPY for best sports movie if it was the only one released. Honestly, I thought it was a boring movie full of people obsessed with hog skin. For a better football movie, see Remember the Titans.
