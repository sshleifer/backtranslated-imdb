This is another alien imitation and not very good at it. Replace outer space with the South African desert, throw the same ingredients, a group of people trapped in an inhospitable landscape, have them hunted by an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very common movie trying to imitate a classic movie A group of miners and scientists goes in search of some missing colleagues and finds their bones in the fleshless desert. Their vehicle breaks down and they head for civilization while they are pursued by the monster. The African location is quite beautiful, but that's basically all this movie. There is a vain attempt to increase the tension, but I found that this did not really work and made the movie rather boring. The creature did not appear much, and when it did, it did not create a sense of horror. a scene where someone ripped the flesh off the arm, but it was basically in front of the blood. In conclusion I found this movie as exciting as watching paint dry. I give this film 4/10 and that is only because of the interesting location that by itself is not enough to save this movie from being a total snooze-fest
