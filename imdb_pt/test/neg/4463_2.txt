The film begins very well in 1872 with a violent and bloody fight between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves in powder - van Helsing also dies. Someone gathers the ashes of Dracula and buries them in the grounds of a church. Cut to 1972 - this is where the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> We are instantly hit by the head with high and bad songs of the 70s, HORRIBLE fashions and silly dialogues. When this was done, Hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to achieve a success. Putting Dracula in the 1970s was not a good idea. Fashions, music and dialogue date the movie horribly. We're introduced to a bunch of annoying kids in their 20s who decide to have a Black Mass - "for a giggle." Of course, they have in the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive Dracula. It is good that a descendant of van Helsing is around ... but Dracula goes after his niece (Stephanie Beacham) in revenge. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing are great as always in their roles and whenever they are on the screen, the film gets a much needed dose of energy. The opening and ending battles are the highlights of the movie (although the ending is very spoiled when playing a bad music of the 70's). Also the main leader of the children is called Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) - a really stupid name dating back to the 1940s. The film also has the screaming queen Caroline Munro looking absolutely great. The film is well directed and well-played, but the plot is stupid, the constant barrage of the 70's fashion, dialogue and music get annoying quickly and I was basically bored. Most of Hammer's fans agree - this was one of Dracula's worst films - it's accompanying (Satanic Rituals of Dracula) was the worst - and the last Hammer Dracula movie. That earns a 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
