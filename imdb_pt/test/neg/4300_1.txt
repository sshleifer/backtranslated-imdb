Wow. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We started a tradition. We found a copy of this movie and went from person to person. Whoever has the film watches, and then passes on to someone considered worthy to see this unique, creative and horrible film. I hope he travels around the world a few times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Very painful. It's even so bad that it's funny. Well, okay, sometimes it's so bad, it's funny. But most of the time it gives you that feeling that there is something sucking your brain inside. <br /> <br /> Wow. Watch and pass.
