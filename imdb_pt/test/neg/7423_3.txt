Lance used to get quality support work from James Cameron. Heck, he even had his own TV show (Millenium) for a coupl'a seasons. Why is he doing this? Could not he find a better way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I love a good low budget movie. Some of them you may laugh at simply because of their ridiculous premise, their stereotyped characters, or often because the actors are related to the director / producers. But this movie has no ransom value. I did not laugh. I did not cry. I just had this feeling of being sick in my stomach. This feeling was quickly identified as a penalty. At one point, Lance Henriksen was a supporting actor on a list. He was in Terminator (he would be terminator before Arnold appeared), Aliens, Aliens III, classic movie-Pumpkinhead, among many others! I wanted to send him money after that. Maybe we should start a support Lance fund or something. <br /> <br /> So again, for doing this thing ... maybe not.
