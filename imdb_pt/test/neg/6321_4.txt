I was prepared to love "Where's Poppa," which shows the regular Lear sitcom characters actors' link that, when I was growing up, felt like extended members of my broken nuclear family the size of raisenette. How fun it would be to see Barnard Hughes-free censorship, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner and a pre-SNL Garret Morris. <br /> <br /> But, sadly, "Where's Poppa" crawls. It is claustrophobic and dingy, and breaks the ground rules of farce, the lightness of humor and a fast pace. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to get rid of his authoritarian Jewish mother, who lives in his gigantic apartment in New York. Along the way, we are exposed to ridiculous characters and situations: a comic group of assailants who repeatedly assaults the main character's brother, a rape involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden pulling Segal's pants and biting her ass as he serves her dinner. Why does not this work? Part of the explanation is the sense of disgrace generated by the dark and gloomy interiors and antique decor. I absolutely ate New York cinematography during this time, but watching this movie felt like I was flipping through the Police Diary in a dark bus terminal. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, is the slow pace. MTV-style modern fast cuts have changed what viewers consider to be a comfortable editing time, but even with that in mind, camera shots are held for an unduly long time. Plot developments are also very slow. There is a situation where this works: a strange love song, George Segal, sings to Trish Van Devere, gently, very close to his face and for an extremely painful time. It reminded me of those stunning photos in the British version of "The Office," where you find yourself mentally begging for the camera to cut, and at the same time you can not stop looking. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, most of the film is more "rushed" than "can not look away." Which made me wonder if it is possible to have a black comedy that is also a scam. The dilemma is that the seriousness of the subject in a black comedy tends to lessen the lightness of the farce. Movies like "M * A * S * H" by Robert Altman and "Dr. Strangelove" by Kubrick prove that this can be done. They do this not only through speed, but also through fun subplots, something that "Where's Poppa" neglects. Although the film features several stereotypically funny characters, almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama. how to deal with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes that characterize Garret Morris and the Central Park burglars are as close as the viewer comes to a mental break. The robbers appeared almost Shakespearean, following the tradition of the comics ne'er-d0. If the rest of "Where's Poppa" had stayed a little closer to the stage tradition, it would have been a better movie. Edgier is not always better. It's as if all these talented actors and director Carl Reiner were enjoying themselves before the creative flurry of the 1970s. Random notes: After taking off Ron Liebman's clothes, the robbers mention "The Naked" by Cornel Wilde. Prey "(1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to the" Planet of the Apes "of 1968. As politically incorrect as it is, it is disturbing to learn about the death of a hero of "Linda Harrison, who played" Nova, "Taylor's silent companion, said that James Fransicus in the sequel appeared to be cute and tiny compared to Heston.
