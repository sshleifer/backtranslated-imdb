The script appears to have been attacked (ahem, cough) "borrowed" from another film involving a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two films were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed on this one to avoid a copyright infringement process. <br /> <br /> But besides, I have to say that I find this a little fun as I like deep-underground-in-the-genre film. It's a little stupid about science, but if someone is willing to squeeze their eyes hard and pretend they have not noticed that scientific gaffe here and there and everywhere, that film is almost bearable. Much better than "Supernova," which was another movie that Luke Perry played an important role in was so stupid, dumb, dumb that nothing could save him. A note to the filmmakers: employ someone who knows something about the subject with which the film deals. It would be a very small part of the film's budget, but it would have a great overall effect on helping to keep your audience from laughing at you for doing stupid science. <br /> <br /> Production values: almost passable. I've seen much worse in my time. <br /> <br /> A new thought for disaster films: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world is saved once again, how about some things that are a little bit more realistic where sometimes even the best efforts still end in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be solved was caused primarily by sheer stupidity. Disaster films caused by stupidity, with bright and moving endings, justify stupidity, stating, "No matter how terrible a problem is caused by stupidity, this can be solved." Which is definitely not the case. A self-inflicted catastrophe movie with an unfortunate ending would best serve as a cautionary tale of "Do not be so stupid in the first place." Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and seen everything else in the science fiction section of your local video store, why not. But avoid "Supernova", how can I assure you that you are not so bored. This was definitely not one of Luke Perry's best films. This is better. That's not saying much, but it's better. <br /> <br /> One dead for being an underground genre film. A dead hull for pulling out the script of another film of the same genre.
