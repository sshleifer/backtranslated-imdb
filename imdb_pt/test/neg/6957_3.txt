Firstly, this movie leaves you in a limbo wise state of mind. You do not know what to feel. So much so that you do not feel bad about Caines' character when his son is murdered (which was actually due to a bad edit). The script was very insipid. None of the situations matter when you watch them. The soundtrack, or lack thereof (if it was not good enough to remember) does not help at all. Just a good surprise for this film was the performance of Andy Serkis. It was at par, if not better than Caine's. The story would probably have been better if Serkis had killed him. Because, frankly, you do not feel any kind of redemption at the climax. Just a feeling of lack of feeling, if you feel me. Basically, this movie lacks lots. Leaving the public alienated by the whole thing.
