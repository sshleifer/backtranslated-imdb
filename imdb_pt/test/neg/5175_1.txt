I'm a big fan of British movies in general, but especially gangster movies. Unfortunately this movie was shockingly bad. I think it's pretty depressing that this movie is getting good customer ratings. The idea that this film is brave and realistic is laughable. I read and heard a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they almost all were glorified with violence over, etc. The only real and brave event in the whole movie was the Range Rover, where some exaggerated security guards were eliminated by tinkering with people they could not handle. This movie is a disgrace to British cinema! It has no plot and does not have decent acting and only depends on being violent (brave and realistic as some people like to say) The kind of person who made this movie should not be allowed close to a budget or film camera as well as type of person this movie is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent tale of no consequence.
