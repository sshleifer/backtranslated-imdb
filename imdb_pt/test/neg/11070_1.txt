If I could give that excuse for a movie of 0 or negative rating I would do. I was stupid enough to get this DVD in the store, read the synopsis and think, that sounds great, I'll spend 10 pounds and buy it. all I got at the end was a Â£ 10 roller coaster. Absolutely awful, I do not even know where to start. I have no idea why someone gave it more than 2 stars because I can not think of a good thing to say about it. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically, 7 people enter an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. nobody else knows they are there. When they enter the cave, they can not leave and they are killed one by one by a monster. It turns out that there is no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has a few demons from the past where his ex girlfriend drowned in a cave 2 years ago ... there seems to be no relevance or reason for it, just a crap attempt at character development, I assume? Anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy who went into the cave like a normal child and lived there all his life. This unreasonably makes him superhuman, able to shine, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in two places at once and have insane force (able to move boulders, carry men grown as dead weight, etc). <br /> <br /> At the end of the scene there are 2 women left alive, they wake up naked, just covered in some kind of rug or something. They then find a picture of a child. The Monster then explodes in the door, wrapped in a rug with some kind of animal skull on his head (says in the directors' comments that it was a raven skull, if it were the biggest frekin raven I've ever seen in my life) and it literally goes "Raaahhh" as a child on Halloween. I was watching with my boyfriend and at that point he literally started to laugh. The guy then sees a picture of himself as a child and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his whole face burned and then standing up and wandering around the cave. That is the extent of the story why it mutilates people and this leaves you feeling a bit cheated by a story. The monster kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other, cut off to finish the credits. I know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it made me feel really bad and it was the thing that affected me the most throughout the movie. He could have killed her and cut her to pieces and eaten her and it would have been less horrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that go unanswered in the end. On top of all this, the scenes in which there have been minutes in a time of just black and nothing else was boring and the constant and angsty camera angles where everything is upside down and you can not see what is happening. I almost hung up. An absolutely terrible movie. You could very well get the money you would spend on it and set it on fire, it would be money better spent, like a smart person posting above me said, once you watched, you can not watch. this.
