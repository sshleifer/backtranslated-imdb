and parading around a 14-year-old girl wearing a thong swimsuit is one of them. For fans of this movie, I'd like to ask: would you allow your daughter to walk in a resort dressed like that? And your 14-year-old son would be able to deal with the reaction she would have on men? If so, I would like to know why, in both cases. Such a suit is a clear invitation to men; It is hypocrisy to suggest that it is not. <br /> <br /> And at another point, what teenager would say that your father was your lover, without the excuse of serious mental problems? This is almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. <br /> <br /> Put simply, some things are not funny or appropriate, and they never will be.
