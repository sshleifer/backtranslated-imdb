Some things just will not stay dead. They just have to keep coming back for more, whether we like it or not. I think some people like to hit a dead horse. The first 'Ghoulies' was a success and the first sequence was an even better film. The third film took a more comical approach, and from that point on, the little insects were beginning to overtake their welcome. I think someone out there in Hollywood thought it was a brilliant idea to resurrect the franchise, but the result will probably disappoint fans from previous entries. <br /> <br /> Pros: The acting is really good for a movie like this. A silly, but fun. It moves at a certain pace. A little cheese for those who like it. Some pretty action-packed sequences. It has a bit more plot than the others and, unlike II & III, at least tries to connect to the original. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not as fun as the predecessors. Although it has more plot than before, it is quite ridiculous. Poor effects. The original Ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they are replaced by two trolls that are no good for anything other than being comic reliefs. Speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are idiots. It's a direct sequel to the first movie, but there are so many loose ends. For example, I thought Jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? Not that this has been spectacular in others, but the direction of the film is especially bland. Final Thoughts: The first three 'Ghoulies' movies are a bad dream for movie lovers. This fourth and final sequel (Let's Wait) is a little disappointing. Of course there's something fun, but it's not the same. The others are low-budget too, but the people involved put a lot more into them. See if you are a complete or you want to see beautiful women in tiny clothes. Otherwise, just stick with the other three. My rating: 2/5
