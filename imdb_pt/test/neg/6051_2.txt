I really thought it would be a good movie, lad ... I was mistaken! For a quick summer: grade C grade C acting special effects D grade for the film in general. Do not get me wrong, the story was very good and it's not kiddish, so an adult also walks along with it, the "hero" is beautiful, so most women will like it :-), not a total girl movie, because it contains some fighting scenes and a bit of blood <br /> <br /> but the way it's filmed ... horrible <br /> <br /> the special effects-> would be more suitable for TV-> in a children's show <br /> <br /> and finally ... send some of the actors back to acting school if they attend a class there. <br /> <br /> Trust me, there are much better ways to waste 2 hours. <br /> <br /> You've been warned.
