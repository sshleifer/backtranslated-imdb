The animation is great, I'll admit it. But Disney has perpetuated all the stereotypes that we in Alaska have tried to overcome in the last two generations. And the names, I mean, come ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana and Denahi (tacky takeoff from Denali)?! These are real places where real people live! And the real people that these real places have received that name are probably struggling to get out of the earth seeking revenge because of this small, banal movie. Disney, you're out of California and Florida, right in the middle of the other states that still treat us like a foreign country. If you can not stay with what you know, at least hire and / or work with people who know what caricuture you are trying to area. Maybe then it would not be so insulting! :(
