It's a pity that these guys, the so-called judges, are so dumb, even those who are nominally "sensitive." It's the tone of self-congratulation that really makes me sick; these guys have no perspective on their behavior. I think the real problem, however, is the quality of the competitors. Not a single soft or truly charming on the lot. They choose the most pathetic girls in the crowd because they are the only ones with whom these guys have a chance. Let's see some real players trying on a truly unattainable girl, and maybe you have a show. Otherwise, you have a half hour of revolting self-esteem. And real sexual tension takes two.
