Imagine every stereotypical and exaggerated clich√© of all the movies and TV shows on the streets of Brooklyn between 1930 and 1980. Fill it with a cast of interchangeable cartoons instead of real characters. Add a mix of "period" music and electric guitars during the "rumble" scenes. So spend time trying to figure out (or care) which Deuces will be killed in the final (anti) climactic crash. <br /> <br /> I'll give this film points for not just being a romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sex comedy, children's musical or Oscar nominated vehicle. But bringing something new or interesting to the gang's tragedy genre may have been good.
