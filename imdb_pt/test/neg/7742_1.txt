Boy, this movie is bad. And not in a good, extravagant and fun way. Even MST3K could not stop it from being boring, and it's also confusing when everyone leaves. But the most annoying part of this mess is Ireland's hideous voice, which I was tired of hearing in the first five minutes. Not to mention how really nasty your character is. Even her father ran away and abandoned her! I can see why, frankly. If he had to hear her groan in his mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he would have been tempted to do her great harm. Like I was at the end of the movie. In addition, it is useless and irritating. When she fell into the long hole in the earth, like Alice in Wonderland, she would have been ready in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably Australian-accented miner had not saved her from all the various difficulties she was still experiencing. . He should have tied her to the Atlante version of train tracks and finished with that. And this subterranean Atlantis with the strange and confused obsession with bone density, I have to ask: where was the light coming from there? Do they have generators that mimic the sun? Does not matter. There's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly dressed gothic wannabees running around trying to get Kathy (probably so they can stick a gag in her mouth). Stupid and meaningless movie. Thank you Golan Globus, for this cinematic abomination. May you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.
