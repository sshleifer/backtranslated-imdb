Okay, I'm usually quite open about movies. I usually see a good side in a movie that has been totally won over by others. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste a lot of energy telling you what happens, but I find that along the lines of Bill and Ted meets the worst Police Academy movie of all of them and you've won 'What I really drew attention to this film was the stupid racism purely evident throughout the process. The general theme of the Latin / black guys = cool, white guys = lame is a little fun for the first couple of jokes, but when the same joke was reiterated for the 500th time (not an exaggeration by the way) it gets tiresome and offensive I spent months waiting for the laws of Karma to return to John Leguizamo for this film. I almost lost hope when the 'My VH1 Awards' were shown live in the UK. What followed was Mr. Leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage. You would have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him. Ahem Ha! There is! There is!
