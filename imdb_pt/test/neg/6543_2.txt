Although the film looks quite stylish for an indie made with a really low budget, that's not what I'm going to the movies for. There was no character I thought was nice, they all seemed to be losers with no concept. Everything they try ends up bad, it's all very hopeless for me. The comments refer to Puffy's chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like a fugitive from an institution. When Josh talks to his girlfriend Emily about his brother, he almost hints that Rhett does not play with a whole deck. However, Josh makes a "marriage" to Rhett and a woman Rhett met only a few hours earlier. There were some interesting performances from some of the characters found on the road. However, for me the most revealing thing was that people were coming out of the movie ... and I saw it in a free exhibition.
