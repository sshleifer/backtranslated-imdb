Possibly the worst movie within the genre in existence. It was heralded as a comedy, but it's simply tragically pathetic. I do not think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and annoying if they were specifically requested. It is the mood of the bathroom at its poorest, I would avoid even watching the trailer. I just went to see it because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you're bound to love it. Whoever wrote this was biased or seriously disturbed. I'm still puzzled how anyone can honestly believe such an assertion. Rarely do I leave the movies, it takes a lot of effort for a movie to have that effect on me: it was done in just 30 minutes.
