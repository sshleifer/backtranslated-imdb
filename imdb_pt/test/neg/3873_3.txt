The original title always seemed to me a rather exaggerated definition for a band of armed vagabonds. Still; her presence on the screen was at least highlighted by a group of high-quality actors to support Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars by themselves. <br /> <br /> However; this first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group now composed largely of B and C list players, who were more mediocre than magnificent. It was a similar setup. Brynner's "Chris" had to recruit another trench team to solve the problems of Mexican peasants again. Another tyrant was giving them pain. <br /> <br /> With the originality and freshness of the first film now spent, this remake had little else to offer. The budget was evidently very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the under-the-pair script, which lent much of the previous classic. It was also over half an hour shorter than the original John Sturges. However, we still had a replay of the dying and moralizing that made even the first somewhat turgid at times. However, here there was no decent work of action, action or location to balance things. Filmiing was less expansive. It failed to convey the wide variety of landscapes that were a large part of the original. <br /> <br /> Generally; only lacking imagination. The first film was a great success, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently set up as fast and cheap as possible in order to profit cynically from previous success. And it shows. There is so much a 'made for TV' feel about it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
