I knew I was not about to see a quality movie when this title was included in a 'Level B video night' at a friends place. Despite the warnings, I was still surprised at how bad this movie was. It was fortunate that there were many of us there to share the pain with each other ... The movie tries to tell the story of a dark future in which Hawk (a type of Mad Max character) heads to rescue a damsel in distress . In fact, the plot is a poorly disguised excuse for producers to promote their own philosophies about life (watch the final credits and the statement 'these people are not real' at the end for a real laugh). The film is often lacking direction, and can not develop its characters to any degree. What's even worse is the editing of this movie. The movie repeats scenes (usually 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. I think this was an attempt to imitate things like Jean Claude Van-Damme fight sequences, but if that is it, it completely fails. The movie would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we were not forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). I give this film my "worst movie I've ever seen" award. I doubt this will be put up soon.
