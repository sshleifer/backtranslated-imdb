What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought it would come to that? A gigantic mess that gets lost in half and can not be redo. I was surprised at how bad this really was. Same! I've never seen the ending itself because this movie is simply unbearable. I'm a big fan of the first, but this is an excuse for a sequel. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the robbery if they returned the money? The movie is just boring and at the same time, I can not sit with it. That's really bad. Just stay as far away as possible, repeat as much of this movie as possible. It's useless.
