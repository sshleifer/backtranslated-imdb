Jeff Leroy wanted to make fun of Scientology to build a horror movie around a cult similar to him. The difference is that instead of the frail old L. Ron Hubbard as cult leader, there is a centennial space monster that turns his followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty college student who is researching the occult. Her landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to cleanse his life with the help of the cult. It does not take long to discover that she's only after one thing: his blood. "The Screaming" was filmed very cheaply on video and I just plain ugly. The spatial monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually mad and has no fur) is alternately a miniature of Freemasonry and a large-scale animatronic doll, both horrible. The acting and writing are terrible and the director does not even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. Avoid this little excuse not scary and unfortunate.
