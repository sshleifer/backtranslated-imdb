Why I did not like the film, besides the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves, is that someone can really believe in such crap. <br /> <br /> First of all, the Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of the words, and when Jesus Christ will come on the day of judgment he will not come as he did before, in human form. He will come in all His glory as God and will be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will! Secondly, I saw the eternal gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all-around "I read the Bible last night and it's not written anywhere." Well that's. Moses cites on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men, or women who make love to each other as if man and woman should be killed because they will never inherit the kingdom of God as they are evil! If it were really for us to follow the Bible word for word, there would be executions now, would not there? But I think misinformed people do more harm than that ... That was in the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are many lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are The Son of God, but to make a movie after it really makes you think about how many idiots out there can make a movie.
