I just watched this movie and I have to say, it was a good movie, I loved some of the good ones and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had some holes in it. <br /> <br /> The name of the people was kind of ... stupid ... I think people should sue the maker of this movie for how bad it was in the end ... the first half hour was good, but then it crawled. I was happy ... it was over ... but I still loved the killer robot and some of the good guys in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think it was the best I've ever spent because I do as stupid b-movie like this and come on .. it's a b movie all.
