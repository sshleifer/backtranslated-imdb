"Congo" is based on the best-selling novel by Michael Crichton, which I thought lacked the usual charm of Crichton, smart characters and punch. Well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the movie. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple tale of alert morality. A C.E.O. megalomaniac (Joe Don Baker) sends his son to the dangerous African Congo in search of a diamond source large enough and pure to function as a powerful transmitter of laser communication (or laser weapons?). When the contact is lost with his son and staff, his daughter-in-law (Laura Linney), a former CIA agent and computer freak, is sent after them. In her quest, she is accompanied by gadgets and some eccentric characters (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh), and a crazy Indiana Jones type looking for King Solomon's Mines. Tim Curry) After escaping some land-to-air missiles and some African wild animals, everyone discovers that many times what we most want is the source of our downfall. Actors Dylan Walsh acts like a pathetic weeping baby, especially in the end, Ernie Hudson is not convincing (no wonder he went on to star in TV movies?) and Laura Linney is nothing special. surely say the only talented actors in this movie had very small roles : Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry, an always pleasant actor (though sometimes marked by life constantly being reminded of his "Rocky Horror Picture" days). <br /> This film also had a few other problems including style of horrible direction, tacky dialogue and a plain boring plan that was completely confused when compared to Crichton's novel. <br /> <br /> Not even Stan Winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. I am deeply disappointed with this film; there was not even an exaggerated quality to redeem. It was simply horrible, tacky, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of Crichton's worst movie book productions. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
