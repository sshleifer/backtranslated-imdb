Luscious Candace Bergen as a primitive Victorian beauty, abducted by Sean Connery as a diabolical Sheikh desert! How can you go wrong? As? Oh, let me tell you the ways !!! Earth's primitive Sean Connery, just the right man to tame a classic and fragile beauty like Candace, is. . . well, lower than expected on paper. This is because, instead of having a dialogue about the real issues ("you are a woman ... I am a man!") He has to babble nonsense about "Allah's will" and "the wind blows the fate through the sands of the desert. " "John Milius, a director best known for the worship of naked male bodies and crude military force than any perception (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has a maddening way of keeping his lovers out of the desert every time it seems that Candace can be kissed Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape, we are treated to endless scenes of Brian Keith showing off his walrus-sized choppers and lecturing on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but seeing him testing his new rifle or making speeches about the heroic death of a great bear does not excite me the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have ... if he had ever The strangest thing is that Milius spends most of his time building characters and plots that have no resolution. Candace's little ones in history gain more time on the screen than she does. There is no humor, no chemistry, no wheezing in any of the things that happen to her in the wilderness. Unless you think it's funny that after weeks of galloping around your hair is still perfect. The only "real" moment in the story is when, late at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little girl from a deep sleep on soft cushions and says "we should run away." The girl turns and, without losing her rhythm, replies: "but mother, I was asleep!" This line sums up what is really missing in the story. No danger, suspense or hissing in the basic plot of a cultured lady in captivity. She (and her children) are so comfortable and well cared for that it is hard to believe that anyone is worried about their fate. <br /> <br /> Remember, if Candace herself had said the phrase, it could have worked better. . If the tension came from his captive pleasure (or his pleasure in being in the arms of Sean Connery) and his guilt for all the problems caused by the kidnapping, the story would have had some tension. But Milius makes the odd assumption that the public is as excited as it is if Teddy Roosevelt gets a chance to prove his manhood five thousand miles away. In the end, the beautiful girl and her children do not seem to care much for him. . . and as they are at the center of the story, the whole thing seems quite dry and endless. . . like the burning desert sands.
