Although I watched this movie alone (thankfully), I still felt embarrassed as I watched. I was fooled into renting her for the comments on the cover, and the bloody, bloody camera stopped in the back - which led me to believe it was some kind of documentary. These actors are laughable throughout the film, not convincing at all. The story involves an Australian Australian gang (?), Just fighting against other gangs, and then running, fighting, repeating. Supposedly, they train extremely hard, which makes them much better than other gangs. For some reason I do not believe they could really hit some of these guys that are twice the size of them. I could be wrong ... no, I'm not wrong, this movie is not nice on any level. The jail assembly looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a horrible actors' sausage party, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. This movie is not worth your time, it saves your money, or throw it in the trash, just do not waste it on this movie.
