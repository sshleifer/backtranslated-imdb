That was a waste of $ 9. the movie was terrible. all the "scary" parts were useless and sadly repetitive. Apparently, all the tense parts could be completely foreseen, and did not seem to have any public attention. In addition, the plot line did not advance throughout the movie, and it was all just a great setup for the 3rd grudge. When it looked like the movie was about to make a breakthrough in the plot, it turned out to be just to be a scene without sense. these directors must follow Hitchcock's example: each scene has a point. Please, 90% of the scenes in this movie could have been left without any changes in the plot. Final opinion: do not waste time, energy or money !!!
