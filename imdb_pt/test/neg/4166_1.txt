This film was released in all major cinemas in Australia. I watched the movie over the weekend of August 7 and I thought it was absolute nonsense (and I'm using that word extremely well). As it was released for all the big theaters without idea. The plot seemed pretty simple about the world being divided into subclasses and people needed ID badges and actor Tim Robbins playing an investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate an employee stealing ID cards, which ends up being actress Samantha Morton. > <br /> You think that from this summary, the rest of the story should interpenetrate, but this not only confuses the audience further with different, unrelated plots. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie, let me save you from the problem DO NOT DELIVER THIS MOVIE.
