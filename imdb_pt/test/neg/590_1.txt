2001 is one of those movies where, if you do not like it, you are told you do not understand and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You are told that you clearly have a slow attention, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot delivered to you on a tray. <br /> <br /> Let's break the movie, shall we? Three minutes of darkness, with something that looks like a hippopotamus dying in the background. So we start the opening credits. One minute of fascinating Savannah photos. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the "Blue Danube" hits the bottom. A lot of meaningless dialogues, and a group of Moon scientists finds another monolith. <br /> Cut to a spaceship that is too long for the complement of the crew - three people sleeping, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only a little more personality than the rigors of hibernation. And then there's the HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that runs the ship. Predictably, it grabs and begins to break the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. A bad, cold, ruthless super-mind that controls the surrounding environment and can predict every move of yours. And what does he do? He lets a guy float in space and turns off the hibernating machines so the three sleeping guys sleep, leaving Dave floating in a cocoon. He simply uses the camera, puts on a space suit and decelerates HAL - agonizingly slow. So apparently there is a psychedelic "evolution" on Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here is the movie with the pauses taken: Monkeys see the monolith, they kill things. Scientists find the moon's monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave receives a pre-recorded message and evolves into Jupiter. <br /> <br /> I'm not the one who did not understand. This is me being bored to tears for long periods of absolutely nothing. Of course, it's realistic, but I do not think I have reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being funny. Frankly, each character could be replaced by Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.
