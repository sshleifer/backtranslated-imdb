I do not understand why anyone would waste their time or money on total junk like this ... Do not get me wrong - I love a good western - Note that I said "GOOD" - this is just rubbish > The acting is horrible - Val Kilmer must meet someone or owe a favor or something to them just to use his face and name on this ridiculous piece of crap ... <br /> <br /> For those of you who enjoyed this movie , I'm making a list of their names to make sure I DO NOT watch anything you suggest - our tastes are definitely different, but it's your right to express your opinion, no matter how far it is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 just in case they throw away all theirs and not count them .... Just bad in all areas ...
