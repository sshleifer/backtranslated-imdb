Words fail me for this terrible waste of two hours of life for anyone. History is invented to the point of complete unbelief. <br /> <br /> The acting is heavy and a lot of it is ridiculously terrible. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful at Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is unbearably horrible and unbelievable as Mike Sullivan, a journalist. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not remember to see a worse movie. It is worth noting the terrible lapses of continuity. After Jones is delivered a huge beating, he emerges without a scratch on him. His girlfriend drops a drink on him and he chases her, emerging from the dry pub. It is very terrible, made worse by the talented actors who appear in it.
