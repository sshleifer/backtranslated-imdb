The lack of character development, motivation and justification for character behavior makes the film very disappointing. I sat watching and waiting for some explanation of the bizarre actions only to find out that Shainberg was letting me peek into a story that must have been someone inside the joke. That the few facts presented did not coincide very much with the life of Diane Arbus, nor did they help to clarify things.

And the trapdoor ladder was a good demonstration of Diane's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family. (However, I do not see how this trapdoor in the ceiling of her dining room could connect directly to Lionel's apartment, which was two bids <br /> <br /> Maybe my analysis is a bit too literal to look for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond a phrase or a comment.I would also like to see at least one of Diane's pics I will not wait for the continuation.
