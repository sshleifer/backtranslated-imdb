This movie is a terrible attempt at a parody. His attempts to parody various sports films are kind of confusing and not funny. <br /> <br /> Even things that should be funny - like the Indian boot, which is always wearing traditional clothes over its uniform - are not. Really funny. The fact that the football team studies and gets good grades that leaves the coach crazy does not laugh either. <br /> <br /> The plot of having a traditional loser has another chance to train a high school football team. staff really had potential as a parody. It is a classic and banal sporting theme. But unfortunately, the script was too weak for any cast to achieve. And this cast is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is free use of women in bikinis and underwear, so not everything is bad in that aspect. <br /> <br /> But Animal House or Talladega Nights, This is not it.
