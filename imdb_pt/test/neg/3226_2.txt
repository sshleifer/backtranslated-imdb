Although this is one of the first films of John Cusack and Demi Moore, it is one of the most hardcore fans can lose, unless they have to complete the collection. I have rare moments, where I can deal with Better Off Dead, but this movie is worse. I'm not just a fan of Savage Steve Holland, and he did both films. So if you do not like tacky comedy and amateur animation, stay away from it. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: she can not sing and 80's synthesizers have not saved her. There are many predictable twists and jokes that are very easy. I suppose if you want stupid entertainment or something you can leave in the background and ignore while you do something productive, then go ahead. Otherwise, do not watch this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) could not save him, you know it has to be bad. They are the only reason I did not give this movie 1.
