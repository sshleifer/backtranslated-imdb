I was impressed with director Kontroll of Antal in 2003. His first American project, the Vacancy, was less impressive, but a decent start. Armored is its second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns. laps and the cast with many quality actors must be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great movie of assault, but prefers an action movie. Then again, he could have made a legal action movie, but neither is he part of that department. <br /> <br /> What remains is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters fight and fight for a sum of money. If you look beyond the cinematography, the cast and the soundtrack, you'll be left with what might have been a below average direct video with Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in some time.
