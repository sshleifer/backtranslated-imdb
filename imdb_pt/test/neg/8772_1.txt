One reviewer wrote, "Good acting, good special effects, great location, even better." All I can say is: "Ugh." This movie was painful to watch. Let me start by saying: I am a Christian considered extremely conservative by many people I know. So what I'm about to say is not biased by the "Christian content" of the film. I'm not going to hit because you're a Christian. I'm going to give it a 2/10 because it's a horrible movie. The writing is bad, and much of the "preach" style is simply irrelevant to the story. This only makes for bad scripts. If I agree with the writer's beliefs it is irrelevant, make a good script that flows well, stays on the right track and is believable. The performance was amateur at best. But when you pitch amateurs, you have amateur performances. Dirk Been may have been in "Survivor", but this show requires ZERO acting ability. Playing on your name and reputation to sell units is in bad taste. Unknown cast that can act and you will get a much better movie. The effects were HORRIBLE. The scene with hail and subsequent falling stars was embarrassing to watch. And what was so good in the end? It did not make sense. Yeah, I know what Tim Chey was going for, but he missed the mark, big time. I bought this movie and expected a lot more based on comments and misinformation on their website. And while I was hoping for more, I got what I always get when I watch "Christian" movies - a subaltern budget, poorly written, pathetically rendered, a piece of poorly produced ka-ka. Maybe someday someone will finally surface with an end-time movie as well written and as well done as Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
