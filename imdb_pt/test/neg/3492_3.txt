Given the incredible reviews of this movie, I was expecting something truly exceptional. It certainly starts well with a witty and sharp dialogue, and a beautiful cast in place. A series of entwined stories in the style of Robert Altman attracts the viewer with some eye-catching scenes. I found exciting entertainment until the second half of the movie, when, unfortunately, it collapses like a pack of cards. A series of ridiculous coincidences and messages on the right accumulate until I was deeply disappointed and imagining the motive of all this fuss. Paul Haggis tackled the subject of the race in LA, and that alone seems to have elevated this film to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy voters live in Los Angeles and have experienced racism to some extent, this movie will surely have an impact on them. This means that the Oscar for Best Picture will go to the running film or to the gay movie. Let's hope it's the latter, because Brokeback Mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.
