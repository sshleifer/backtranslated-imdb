Do not worry about checking the logic. There is none. But on the other hand, there are MANY really great movies that have no logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and do not like this movie. I like it because the action sequences in the air are great, you can see a lot of dog fights. I also like the F-16, which is a really cool airplane. <br /> <br /> But there are a lot of idiots that I really enjoy. I think it's not fair to want some kind of continuity, since it's hard to make a really good movie - but I also think there should be some sense. <br /> <br /> And I have a question. : Do they fly from California to the Middle East in F-16 without air refueling? I would like to see this happening.
