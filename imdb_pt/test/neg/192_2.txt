Sadness was the emotion I felt after the screen went dark. Intrigued, it was another. Why would two seasoned veterans like Matthau and Lemmon subscribe to this putrid project? I got the impression they did not read the script before the cameras started rolling. The whole cast is wasted, in this bland, uninteresting, unimpressive film. Unfortunately, this was one of the latest projects of the fashionable Edward Mulhare, here as the heavy one. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'connor reciting some lines laden with profanity. (?? !!) I'm not with the "Legion of Decency". What I mean is that they were exposed purely by the strangeness of hearing him use sulky language. This is a desperate attempt to infuse "humor" into an image. He actually made the film's only entertainment film when he stayed on the dance floor. I hold my harshest criticism for the leads. Walter Matthau should have known better. It even offers great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, though affable, is rather monotonous and one-dimensional. He saw it once, saw it all. Jack Lemmon gives another of his "too sensitive" male portraits. When he starts this mode, I indirectly want to hand him a box of tissues. OUT to SEA is painfully bland, and who produced this mess should be made to walk on the board.
