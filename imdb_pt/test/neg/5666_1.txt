this show is just awful. I enjoyed watching Drake and Josh, which was great, and before that Amanda show, also funny, but that's just awful. in my opinion, watching it was like watching those Seltzberg movies, painful and unbelievable. That's about 3 idiots @ $$ kids who do a low quality show (while stealing the Ithing hole) while their retarded brother is making sculptures (he has no life). the cast sucks, Megan from drake and josh is carly (AHHHHHH!) an ugly b tch is sam and some kid they took the fred street pieces. All I've seen of it (ugg) are random "jokes" that include brother making a clay action movie, he also played an arcade game called PAC-rat (genious), Sam and Carly being retarded in their show at web, and Fred being an idiot. the only episode a saw (I can not remember the title) where Fred gets unlucky by not predicting an email. I find videos on youtube funnier than this crap. and why the hell do they get the youtube jack @ $$ fred, ask AVGN to cancel the show with his dirty mouth. just skip this show.
