"Curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece to deal with a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing disappointment on Halloween 5, the series came to a soft spot in plots, with a silly bounty on witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "Curse of Michael Myers" increases blood and blood stagnation, but actually represents a decline in the series' integrity. It's too bad, because this is the last Donald Pleasance movie as the character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments (precious if you're a fan of the series) like the now very aged and as he says "very retired doctor". Unfortunately, he died before the movie was completed, and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories of the original climatic scene were never realized. From the initial credits, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made-for-TV movie than the horror movie that began as in 1978. Any former Halloween student should have demanded more from this movie, ... Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more.
