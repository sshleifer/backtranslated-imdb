The four LA cops in fedoras driving in a big black convertible look a bit absurd, and even more ridiculous when you see that Nick Nolte, the dumbest of the lot, is in charge. The writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the members of the squadron, and the director can not uproot the joint of the mountain man Nolte. Foprget questioning someone. Nolte's character lights a cigarette, gets angry, and beats the interviewees in a pulp. His methods lead him nowhere, until, at some point in the action, he is wandering from the residence thrown to the residence thrown with his mouth open and his brain closed. He crushes an FBI squad and launches two military officers on an airplane in flight, with only a vague account of anger against the HQ and no punishment. At the end of the film, he is as breathless and muscular as he was at the beginning. How he got a beautiful prostitute to fall deeply in love with him is a mystery, as well as the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his unemployed wife. Two interesting images in the photo: one from an atomic explosion, the other from a gigantic crater, ostensibly caused by a bomb. It is almost as broken and swollen as Nolte's face.
