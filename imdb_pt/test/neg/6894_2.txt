"This movie is great! I watched with some friends and we thought it was proof that a movie does not need to see commercial success to be a success!" ... is what I'd love to be able to say about this movie. In the words of the film itself "you are very very bad!" I went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once, so overall, I agree with the moral of the movie. <br /> <br /> I would include a spoiler, but the lack of plot makes this very complicated. in general, a cinematic disaster. <br /> <br /> Quotes; 'You're not a leper at all!' 'You're beautiful, and I bet you're cool too' 'Have you ever seen the body of a naked man?' 'you can not break a piece of straw'. <br /> <br /> cameos in the dubbing; Micheal cana x3, harold bishop, steve erwine, benjamin netinyahoo, yoda.
