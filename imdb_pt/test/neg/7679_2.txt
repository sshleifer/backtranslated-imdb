The original airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two hits from movie B (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were fun, at best, amusing the camp at worst; but this gross and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and exhibits a shocking contempt for its audience. It's unbearable and not good for laughs. <br /> <br /> All three "Airport" sequences were released by Universal's television wing, but this is below the modest standards of a TV movie of the time, producing cheap, grotesque, visual ugliness and without taste, without grace "comedy". The project was clearly condemned by the "creative" efforts of Universal's executive Jennings Lang, who personally produced and received a "story" credit. <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) may have provided an element of auto-burlesque, just like the previous films (especially the notorious Airport 1975), but there is nothing which is worth it in Roth's incoherent and incoherent script and even in the comedy Airplane! It left this crude untouched. <br /> <br /> What makes the Concorde: Airport '79 particularly offensive is its insulting abuse of professionals. The worst victim is the supremely talented Cicily Tyson (Sounder, Miss Jane Pittman's Autobiography), relentlessly reduced to a vomit subplot involving her escort of a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. A special kick in the groin is reserved for the wonderful George Kennedy, who is the true leader despite being buried in the cast list. The official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actor to appear in all four films, Kennedy had more than deserved the lead role and his turn on the Captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry beyond the compression of a last buck. Kennedy provides the only real warmth and humor in this mechanical ploy, leaving aside the machismo of bravery and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself, and his adorable and heroic Joe Patroni character. Unfortunately, we are never allowed to forget how fat, old and overweight Kennedy is, and the overweight boy Alain Delon calls him relentlessly "Porky Pig" as part of a marriage of friends that falls completely. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only human part of this plane wreck, turns out to be just a preparation for a hate joke against Patroni, Kennedy, and the spectator's expenses.
