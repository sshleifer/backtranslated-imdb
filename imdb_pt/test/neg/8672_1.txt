Please ... if anyone has a chance to read this before watching the movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it ... do not waste your time !!!! I also watched this movie shortly after finishing the book, and I was seriously disappointed ... the main character is basically a new fan made up as she shows no resemblance to the book ... she is so excited and laughing the time everything ... if there was one thing the author wanted to define was that she was a very shy and introverted character ... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story, which should be transmitted to the liver, are simply not taken into account ... and the rest is invented !!! I think it's best to take the time to read some of the real romance or just do nothing.
