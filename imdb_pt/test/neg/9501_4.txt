Underwoods goofy story about a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is written ridiculously, the direction is strange, the dialogues are out of place and shuffled, the actors also did not do much justice, Arquette is annoying, Ian Nicholas was non-existent, Macy was decent, but only because he is a very good actor and probably just tried his best not to leave this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. This is a stupid movie in my eyes, boring sometimes, not fun, just a movie I would not recommend to anyone. Rate Movies Rate TV Shows IMDbPro IMDbPro IMDb Resume Content Licensing IMDb>
