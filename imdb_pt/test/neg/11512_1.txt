For those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this movie is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a dancer. Viola Essen at the time was with the Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but with the exception of Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateurish and Checkov is completely exaggerated ... embarrassingly! I saw this movie when I was 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, I was very impressed. However, later in life, long after I had completed my career as a dancer - I bought his videotape, curious about what it was after so many years. I could not believe how naive Hollywood could be about the world of ballet. But it was made in the mid-1940s, before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, the latter giving a real picture of the world of ballet. The entire cast of Specter has passed away ... Ivan Kirov (fictitious name) died at age 79. It was his first and only film, then held by a Chicago businessman.
