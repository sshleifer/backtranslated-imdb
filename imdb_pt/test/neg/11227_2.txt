I've seen worse, which is an indirect way of saying how bad this movie was. The plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a policeman and five more take him hostage? In a dimly lit, dimly lighted school in New York - and somehow this clich√©d hostage situation takes 24 hours to solve? Are you serious? A full-day hostage situation - with a NYPD officer injured not less, it takes all day? I know this movie was made before September 11, but still. I looked at the clock and wondered how they could drag this overboard plan for another hour and 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performance was mediocre at best, and the characters were apparently thought up until the 7th. graders. The kid of child abuse, the pregnant and frightened girl, the violent gangster, a confused and unhappy victim, the smart white guy. Please. <br /> <br /> Trying to turn this hostage into a mission of "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please - this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a boy shooting a cop. They are confused and ignorant idiots who engage in a stupid situation. Do not try to paint them, suddenly, as noble. The most laughable is Ziggy, who lives in the attic of the school and admires both Michaelangelo who paints these remarkable scenes on the walls. You have got to be kidding me. <br /> <br /> Does "racism" sign the Protestant crowd? A black boy shoots a black policeman and a black negotiator tries to fix everything. This is a random message. <br /> <br /> I understand the general message, which was poorly portrayed, though by some actors who went on to respectable careers. <br /> <br /> Was that a joke the red marksman's lasers on the roof? The worst scene was the child, the fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his friend on the roof, "promise me" etc. As original. The epilogue of "I went to jail, but now I'm pre-law at XYZ University" ... a fitting way to end a joke of a movie.
