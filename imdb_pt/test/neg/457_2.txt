An ineffective feature of Universal Pictures about a mom's movie actor doing criminal investigations for the military, driving away the breakthroughs of the impetuous young woman assigned to the novel. Robert Montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the tale "Come, be my love," and his acting performances of that time are indulgently lazy. The plot is nonsense, predictable things, and writer Robert Carson gave all the really funny lines (as usual for the films of that period) to the somber black maid. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support, but they can not do much with this mushy material. * in ****
