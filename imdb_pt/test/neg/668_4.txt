All right, let's be realistic about it. No one walks into a WWE Films film (whose owner challenged God for a fight), directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Blowfish trilogy), starring a wrestler named Kane, and wait a while slice of art on a golden tray. If you do, you'll probably need to find something other than watching movies to take up your time. <br /> <br /> So what exactly do we expect from a movie like that? Well, here's what I was looking forward to: 1) Bad acting. 2) A reasonably non-existent clich√© plot. 3) Kane walking around with a smashed and sour face that indicates that his nostrils found the potato salad he lost a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of blood. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're hungry for some "so bad, it's funny" entertainment, then this can satisfy your appetite because it fulfills every aspect. <br /> <br /> Of course, movies like this are best viewed for free, but if you choose to sacrifice office bucks then have fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are kind enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents, showing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easy for you to note down which ones you want to see dead and in what order. You and your friends can see which forecasts are most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest that you and your friends write down every moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them at the end and see who comes with more. I think my grand total was 107; Can you beat that? I personally wonder how, after 35 years and a fire, this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a working elevator? <br /> <br /> I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this, you obviously do not pay much attention to what you spend your money on and therefore probably will not think much about how the film it's a fool, but that does not mean we can not point and laugh <br /> <br /> I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be doomed and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) homeless and they think the best way to get it clean is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> I think you know full well what to expect, but I feel the need to give you some warnings. First, if you hate the interaction of the crowd, no matter the movie, then you may want to stay away. The people in the audience acted as if they were in a real fight show. Cries of "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" echoed through the theater, showing what I hope is not the best that America has to offer. I generally do not appreciate this audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this, I thought the comment added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others might get annoyed with this. <br /> <br /> Second, and this should not justify the explanation, the film does not run from the blood. If you watch a big ugly guy rip eyes off your orbits do not yell "fun night at the movies!" for you then you know well and well to save your mass. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was a bit surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I was not expecting him to set up a practice clinic, but I was hoping he would have a little slogan like "Say Good Night" (his character's surname is "Goodnight") just before he killed a victim. Instead, he uttered four words throughout the film - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But he, he delivered them without fail! <br /> <br /> If I were a bad guy in a movie, then my slogan would be something like "Put your BETTS!" or "All BETTS are OFF!" <br /> <br /> That would rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror movies like See No Evil, which induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedy. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now let's call them HOR-larious!
