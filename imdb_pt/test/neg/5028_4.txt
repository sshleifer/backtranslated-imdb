Will there be an end to sensationalist films that are dealing with social conflicts or other human disasters? Ok "Care" is about child abuse, "Care" is about perverts who abuse boys in a school and how disgusting it can be, if it is a bad script movie and made with bad actors then it gets a bad movie. "Care" is a movie that could have been, but it's because it was a TV movie that I do not know, but everything seemed so limited that it appears as a cheap movie that will be seen by some housewives and parents who decide not to go to the bed. There are so many unanswered things in this film ... the relationship with the mother, for example, or the death of a battered boy, of whom we know nothing else. "Caution" should have been much better.
