Not finding the right words is everyone's problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy. They do not know what to say, and do not know how to say it, and that is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-arranged quick dating. Unfortunately, they all appear as cardboard characters rather than real people. The story follows a conventional three-act structure: meeting the handsome cast in their sad single lives, the true dating circuit, and a final stretch of romantic scenes, showing some of the craziness of newly discovered couples. Because everything is so predictable, I would say that, as a narrative, "Shoppen" is a failure. As a comedy, most of the time it's too silly to be really funny. Thumbs up for Kathrin von Steinburg. She stands out from the multitude of telenovelas as the independent and independent Miriam. Great makeup on her too (Verena Wei√üert): Heavy shade accompanies the lip gloss of skin tone, creating a melancholic and bohemian effect, even as a girl. Thumbs up also for Stefan Zinner as the love machine of Bavaria and Tanja Schleiff as the hot nutritionist. They ignore the challenge of communication through the timeless body language of copulation.
