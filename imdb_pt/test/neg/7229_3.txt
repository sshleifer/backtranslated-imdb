As if the world had not already received cheap imitations of Jaws, writer Boaz Davidson decided to continue his chubby, but reasonably pleasant octopus, an octopus from Spielberg's classic. a police officer nobody believes, and a mayor more concerned about his July 4 celebrations than people's lives. Even in the hands of an extremely skilled director, it is unlikely that this junk could have been anything other than the fake junk from B movies, but with Yossi Wein (yes, Yossi Wein!) giving away the letters behind the camera, a man with a fraction of the talent of Mr.Spielberg (I estimate in about 1 / 10,000), Octopus 2 is as bad as you can imagine! The predictable and extremely clich√©d plot is not worth describing in detail (replace Amity Island from Jaws for New York and Bruce the Shark for a giant rubber octopus and you'll get the essence), though several points about the film are and definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all octopus attacks involve actors struggling to make incredibly fake giant tentacles look real, which is hilarious of themselves to see; Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, is little by little New York, and the overuse of images makes the illusion even less convincing; best of all, a silly sequence of dreams that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero at the top of the Statue of Liberty, is not only stupid but also features some truly awful special effects. Davidson's script also does not know when to give up: there are several points in this film where he could have (and probably should have) finished, but the action continues and continues, with the octopus surviving several explosions and causing a tunnel to collapse (arresting the love interest of the movie and a bunch of boys), before finally being blown to bits by the hero. <br /> <br /> Sometimes very silly, always technically awful, but never really scary, this stinker stv can find fans among those who actively seek out the cinematic junk. Most normal people, however, would be advised to orient themselves well.
