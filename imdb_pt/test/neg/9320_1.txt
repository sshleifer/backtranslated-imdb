I do not know about you but I go to horror movies to be afraid and this was not scary at all, the movie had several chances of being truly scary and failed miserably EVERY TIME! Several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst moments you'll see this year, maybe a decade! I mean, when I say cg looks like daytime TV, I'm giving a bad name to the TV during the day, I've seen better things on the science fiction channel. For whom I really am sorry are the actors, (they have their names attached to this movie) they did a good job, I cared about most of the characters and I felt that their performances were very good but that was not enough to bring that movie out of the gutter. What is really fun is the reuse of some of the sets, if you have seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to identify the reuse of some of the buildings. However what I thought was the worst thing about this movie, even above the CG problems was the main demon, he was not just scary anyway, his way, the way he spoke, he was extremely bland. All in all this movie was a horrible experience and I would have left the theater if it was not for my wife wanting to see the end.
