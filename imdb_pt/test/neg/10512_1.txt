I rented this movie hoping it was bad, and it did not disappoint me. I rented with some friends as a joke. But what we got was worse than anyone could imagine. <br /> <br /> It starts to suck before you even take it out of the box. It looks like a Blade hit and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. Your vampire named Killer, but is not some killer someone who kills to hire you? Well, this guy kills of his own accord, so that does not make him a killer. <br /> <br /> So when you actually put the disk in, it gets worse. First of all the animation on the menu is lame. But when you really start the movie, everything from set design to lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible. You know that a movie is bad when the credits are bad. The acting is laughable. The action is childish. Writing is elementary. And the direction is the worst>
