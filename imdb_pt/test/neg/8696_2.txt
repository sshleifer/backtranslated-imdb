For a really wonderful film, you can also try to see the film about San Francisco de Assis - good for any audience. The best thing I liked about this movie was the landscape of Mexico, and the movie reached 2. I was surprised that these actors did not have a terrible burn, they were not the inhabitants of the desert. And it is said that Moses has an impediment of speaking, but he is certainly not here. Even the scenes of the "miracle" were invented and unbelievable. And what's the point if you can believe anything in a TV story? Speaking about dumbing down, I thought this Hallmark movie was pathetic, and I can see why others hate Hollywood. I do not, just some of these corporate profits generators. You do not need to be any type of religious to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth", but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored, with nothing to do, dumb and religious. And for an actual movie experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana," a highly rated film.
