This movie fails on many, many levels. The script is the first flaw, and from what I understand, if the script stinks, there's nothing that can fix it. The plot is annoying, after the first 45 minutes, I'm looking at the counter on the DVD telling myself, "how much longer?" Cinematography is pretty awful. I'm not sure how the transfer was bad for the DVD, but it looked like a VHS copy. Also, the sound was bad. I realize this is not going to be remixed to 5.1, but, it seems, it did not sound like it was in Dolby Stereo, which already existed almost a decade ago when they cut this movie. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was much like Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember correctly, the pointer scene occurred during the last 20 minutes, usually should occur in the first 20. Most people will be totally confused about what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie's music was excellent in parts and then completely inadequate in others. Elmer Bernstien made the score but it looks like someone else has taken part in other things elsewhere as it does not match the good orchestral score (with some synthesizer tunes). <br /> <br /> There were great actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley and Bill Paxton. And they did a great job, breathing in the little life available in their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was very stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him.) I'm not sure if a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the movie.) Again, a major flaw with the script. Thank God I watched this for a DVD based mail service, not theater. Overall, a big disappointment to science fiction fans, or fans of Paxton or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you will never return.
