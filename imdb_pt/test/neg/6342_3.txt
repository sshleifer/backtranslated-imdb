But to be a bit more accurate, I do not think it's as bad as it really could be. Although the actors (famous for semi-famous) have not done a great job. Board Failure? Could the script be so difficult for me to say? Anyway, if you're after lots of cool guns and action, this is not the movie for you but they run around with a bunch of vintage ww2 weapons. Kind of fun :) Well, I guess I could say more, but this does not seem worth it. If you are desperate enough or a Hackman freak see you otherwise do not do it! Live well and thrive
