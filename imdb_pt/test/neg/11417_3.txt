For simplicity, it was a pompous piece of canine poop. Overly stage manager and everyone being the queen of total melodramatic drama every moment. After a while, I was beginning to wish that each character in the film was not a stuffy anal retentive. <br /> <br /> And this movie has another one of those really annoying things that came in recently. in vogue and should not have: all the scenes are in a kind of blue-steel-faded greyishness. Hmmm, the last time I checked, candles and torches are able to put a wide spectrum of colors. In fact, the light they emit tends to be more in the range of orange-yellowish and hot spectrum. So where does all the blue-steel-gray light come from? <br /> <br /> This movie has fancy backgrounds and flashy cgi fx, but still sucks. It's pathetic trash laid out for today's movie goers who are easily placated by pathetic trash. <br /> <br /> I really like vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices, but this was a total hack job. Universal Studios' "Wolfman" of 1941 is infinitely superior to this, though its fx is quite primitive compared to what could be done today. <br /> <br /> I ended up with this franchise. The first film was reasonably decent. The second one is still a little fun. But this I could not even finish until the end because it was very annoying.
