The worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw it allot. Act is horrible, the plot is horrible, the idea is terrible, and no research was done, which is so! Okay, I admit, 'Air Bud' was a very good movie, but not 'Soccer Dog'. This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he play football? Even for 10-year-olds, it will not be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to stop the stupid dog in the middle! It's horrible, I do not watch this movie.
