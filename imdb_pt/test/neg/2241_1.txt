Countless historical and cultural errors 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jew named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) Brilliant Detective was catching the less intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers !! That was funny. (4) Hitler and his main weapons were to watch a movie in the center of Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! shoot me (5) Brad Pitt abused and it was painful to see him. (6) Mr. QT is rewriting the story, "Hitler was killed in a theater ?? really!" The funny thing about this is that people "and I mean stupid people" will actually believe this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally someone can tell me how this movie made the 250 best movies of all time !!! Shame embarrassed shame, still wondering how anyone can like this movie.
