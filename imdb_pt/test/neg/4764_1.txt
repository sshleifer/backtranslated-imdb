This movie is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful virus created by man. They are pursued by government men in the desert. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is quite interesting, but it is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely tedious. At no point does the film involve the viewer at any level. Granted, the tiny budget is a problem, but it is not the reason for the failure of the film. Much more to blame is very expensive delivery. There is a great deal of narration, but unfortunately, the narrator has an annoyingly overly dramatic voice. Very little seems to happen to these people and well before the end you'll be rooting for the government men - the sooner they kill the protagonists the sooner the movie will end. A far better title for this movie would have been Four people running in the desert with some pictures of a helicopter. Overall, very tedious.
