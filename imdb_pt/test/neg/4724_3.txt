This movie was a Mexican horror movie from the late 60's. Not so good, but not bad either. There is a lot of slock and he is very accustomed to nudity and violence, but he had a plot and at least tried to keep it (even if the plot was the same damn inspired Frankenstein "do not mess with God's dominion."). There was some padding mixed with female wrestling, but it was made in Mexico and wrestling seems to be popular in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying of leukemia. The other doctors gave no hope to the poor boy, but the father has the idea of ​​transplanting a gorilla's heart to his son to save his life (I do not know, I'm a lawyer and not a doctor). The transplant works, but the boy-sonny ends up becoming a monkey man who terrorizes naked women and kills whoever gets in his way. There is also a subplot involving a police officer and his girlfriend who is a fighter (this really did not add much, but if they wanted to put some fighters masked, here's a good reason to do so). <br /> <br /> The movie was kind of cheap but not too bad for a movie of the day. The plot was basically just recycled and there were some things that were not tied up in that well. However, this movie is entertaining in its own way (I do not know why, maybe because it's a Mexican horror movie and stands out in my normal diet of bad movies). I think it may be because it is a mixture and blending of some very strange things. <br /> <br /> See if you like weird movies, nudity and female wrestlers.
