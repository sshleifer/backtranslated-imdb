Have you seen all the great adventures of the last few decades? If you do not mind, you've seen most of the scenes - and I can guarantee that these scenes were originally in much better films. <br /> <br /> The story (I am sure true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that getting thrown into a morgue would result in a bunch of dead angry). Each character is based on a cliché and ... well, they are nothing but cliché. And yes, again, all you need to be a hero is to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland they announced that this would be the kind of movie for which the DVD was made. Maybe I should sell my player then ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
