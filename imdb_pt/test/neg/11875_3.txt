Unlike some of the reviews written here, I did not hate this movie. It's a movie that could have been a lot better than it was. It's not Oscar stuff, it's true, but it's a lot better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good hook and a line. Granted, this movie was poorly written. AND TERRIBUTE directed and produced. I mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of the opening sequence? It seems the producer (s) watched American Beauty a few times and thought 'I'm going to use this in an action movie!' I thought the movie was not so badly represented. Wesley Snipes did a credible job, he just came into conflict with some bad direction. And as soon as this movie reached the production room, things got worse. The main actress, I think, had the same problems. Some of the other performances were suspicious, yes, but it was a low-budget movie. Again, I would say the director's job is to pick it up and fix it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I would agree with the first review I read that this movie is not worth seeing. Or maybe it's worth seeing if you're a film student and want to see what not to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and that's complimenting you.
