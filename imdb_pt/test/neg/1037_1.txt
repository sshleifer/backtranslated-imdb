Unless you are interested in seeing 2 hours of scenic mountain scenes with hysterical characters, many histrionics and cheap things from the 70s (not much of that either), I advise avoiding this movie. It is long, long and has a rather irritating feel to it. Masterpiece? No, a medium-shot thriller, filmed in a common way, in a beautiful Italian landscape. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of 1970s slow-motion movies, when there's a plot to delight and entertain you. In this case, it did not work for me. The plot is banal, entwined with superficial and stereotyped characters, supported by hilarious angry mobs and his typical Italian widow dressed all in black sobbing. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with the country of Italy, the film may be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and quite stunning. This film is not, however, anything out of the ordinary, there are far better Italian horror films than that. Not much more than a yawning party. 5/10
