"Inuyasha" was awful. This show was incredibly overhyly, but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime cliches. The characters are annoying and lifeless, the plot is boring and endless. I think it might have something interesting if it had a better writing, but it seems the writers of the show have more intentions in showing Inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying over his tragic love triangle with Kikyo and Kagome and many circles in around the same thing over and over again. The script is tacky and dumb and the animation is bad. The design of the character is very ugly, I do not know why everyone loves, everyone has the same face! : Big eyes, small noses, a line like the mouth and the typical anime haircuts. I think "Inuyasha" is incredibly annoying and stupid. This has to be one of the most exaggerated animated shows of all time.
