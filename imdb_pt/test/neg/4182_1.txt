After sitting on the train that was the first movie of the Black Harvest, I could not leave myself bad enough alone. Seeing that there was a sequel (or rather, what I believed to be a sequel), I had to increase my level of pain. Seeing that this had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, that should have been a good thing. We did not get any scarecrow killer in this movie, instead, we got an idiot walking through a cornfield shouting things like "Girls!" and "Can you hear me?" Sometimes. Also, we have two (four if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in The Shining) detestable little girls who could not act. And the cherry on top of this mess would have to be the Corn Cop. I should have known that this movie would be terrible when the dog had an initial credit. How I managed to stay awake through this movie, I'll never know.
