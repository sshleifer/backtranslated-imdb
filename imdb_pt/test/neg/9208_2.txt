This is the kind of movie that could have ruined multiple careers if garbage could ruin movie theaters these days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-improvement days, she really should have Been dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely lost, but luckily for him and for us, he has gone through much better things since ... that ... this ... well, hell, piece of crap. <br /> <br /> Oddly, all of their top players have moved on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here has also been lost, but deserving of a reluctant admiration. I mean, anything that is not worth doing is not worth doing well. But he did it well, anyway. <br /> <br /> Still, there was a bright and shiny look: Ray Liotta, who is named down on the credit list, simply stole everything. Liotta was mesmerizingly mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Amazing. <br /> <br /> I saw this piece of junk while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason my friend loved it. I kind of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her blouse (and, honestly, honestly, she should not), though he tried to say that they were other, more artistic reasons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought that even after his first scene, Ray Liotta would become a big star, or at least an important and respected actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the bad aspects of the script, the sheer ugliness Of all of history, Liotta was almost worth watching. In fact, it's worth seeing, once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, on the one hand, your name is now usually listed at the top or near the top. <br /> <br /> Even so, even in a pile of crap, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> /> Just, if you see this garbage, be prepared to hold your nose. Every main character is amoral or immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea. <br /> <br /> Added Review: Many people respond "Was this review helpful? with a "no" because they disagree with the expressed opinion. Maybe IMDb should ask this question: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
