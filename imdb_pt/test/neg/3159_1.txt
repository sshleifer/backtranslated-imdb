Okay, you hippies are probably wondering what I have against an "educational" and "informative" show like "Barney"? Well, I have a lot of hatred against this for these reasons: 1. Teaches that having personality and individualism is immoral. No one on the show has personality. Everyone dresses in the same way, talks so much, acts and dances. Even in the episode called "Being an Individual," the kids try to tell Barney what they like, and EVERYONE on the planet should do what I like. Do you want to teach your child that being an individual is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. "A stranger is a friend, you have not met" Episode. Although seemingly harmless, program producers soon realized that it could also be extremely dangerous for young children. In fact, several young Barney lovers from all over the US were victims of pedophiles, who were using the program's friendly message to draw children away from their parents. The episode has already been removed, but the damage was done. So-called "innocent" programming mistakes, like this one, clearly show why parents need to watch television with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you are not happy all the time, you are a bad person. No one seems to show any emotion other than happiness, no matter what situation they are in. If the child's parents get mad or sad for some reason, the child may think of Mom or Dad differently. Not a good message. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! It seems that every problem is solved by magic. At least in programs like "Fraggle Rock", it teaches us that magic can backfire, it is better to solve the problems on their own. Barney teaches this? No of course not. There has to be magic there. And the problem is that many two-year-olds can not distinguish fantasy from reality, and may think their parents, siblings or relatives can use magic to solve everything, but they get confused when they can not use magic and think they are strangers. Another horny tug again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. He even specifically said that "stealing is good if the person you steal does not care". Children can learn that if you really want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not something preschoolers need authority figures to tell them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I have the right thing, I can solve all my problems." Whenever children have a problem, Barney gives them everything they need to solve it. The message being sent here is "Do not try to think about solving this! It's a lot of work, and the solution probably would not work anyway, just use that." Because of this, children could stop thinking about things (Barney said it was a lot of work) and became dependent on the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right exercise machine ...) This is obviously a good message for Barney's marketers, but it's not good for preschoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message that cheating is okay. In another episode, children are involved in a contest to carry a peanut in a spoon without dropping it. A child puts peanut butter on the spoon and wins easily. The child is then rewarded for his creative thinking when the child actually distorts the rules and changes the game so that he can win. This teaches that cheating is good, you win and people think you are creative, when in real life you will often be disqualified, or worse, and seriously hated by other competitors who have complied with the rules. <br /> <br /> 8 Do the children at this show eat anything other than cakes, cookies and sweets? This teaches that it is okay to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy foods despite Barney's so-called "Food Food" music. Other than that, EVERYONE at the show eats junk food. No wonder there are so many obese children in America and Europe. <br /> <br /> And finally .... <br /> <br /> Most children's television programs teach creative problem solving well without having to resort to "magic." Barney could also have done this, but decided to use the method that was A) better for marketers and B) it took less time and money for the scripts. It's a blatant sale that shows how little the Lyons Group really cares about kids. <br /> <br /> This is my speech to you all.
