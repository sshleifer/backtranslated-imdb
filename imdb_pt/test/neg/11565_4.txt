Okay, there's no way to sugarcoat it. The plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was inconceivable, the effects were laughable and all the outdoor scenes seemed to have been filmed in Central Park in New York. Having said that, there was something about this movie that I could not give up. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil supervillains or the Amazons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm not the type that stands by and criticizes without pointing out some redeeming qualities, so here they are. <br /> <br /> A violent upheaval of the women's movement is portrayed in a wild environment (central park, of course), and all the young masochists out there will be very impressed. In addition, some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are playfully dramatic (you'll notice that I write dramatic, rather than convincing). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people like B movies and I am one of them. If you are one of them too, then give it a try. Congratulations, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for the ages.
