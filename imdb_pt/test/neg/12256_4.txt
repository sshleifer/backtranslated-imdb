QUICK RIGHT <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) who live in a remote country the houses are separated by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who ends up being a carnivorous alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite the tight budget and the leaden leading A The continuation of Norman J. Warren to SATAN's SLAVE (1976) amounts to far more than the sum of his meager installments, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently his only credit): Faulkner and Annan an obsessive relationship while living in isolated splendor within England (made alternately beautiful and menacing by the attractive cinematography of Derek V. Browne), although Annan's discovery of bloodstained clothes in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of them. beauties as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, who seems to have lived in the house one time or another and 'left' under mysterious circumstances. The unexpected arrival of Stokes puts the relationship in disorder, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, creating tensions that result in a violent climate of violence. There is an extraordinary multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner tries to "castrate" his clueless visitor into women's clothing, though Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the mockery he wants. In the earliest scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is portrayed with unusual grace and dignity, but this sapphic bond quickly turns into pleasing episodes of sex and neatness, culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan lets himself be snatched away. by Stokes after a violent argument with Faulkner. The final sequences are (literally) distressing, especially Annan's final scene, which seems to have been cut short for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what's left is still very vivid, so get ready!). Excellent performances on the three lanes, reinforced by Warren's discreet direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning locations of the forest, thus offsetting the budget deficiencies of the film. Originally released in the USA as ALIEN PREY.
