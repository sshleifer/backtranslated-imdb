SPOILERS <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * This is Tenchi? This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Virtually everyone is written horribly out of character ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. <br /> In addition, the villain is not punished for his actions, which amounts to mental rape. If a male villain had done with one of the women what Haruna did with Tenchi, he would have bought (rightly) at the end of the movie, dying horribly, and the audience would have applauded. But not only does Haruna pay no price for his crimes, Ryoko truly forgives and understands his actions. Not! The real Ryoko would have disintegrated her for what Haruna had done to her beloved Tenchi; the audience with whom I saw this, including me, all booed audibly in this scene <br /> <br /> Anime fans, avoid this movie. Tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.
