This show is based on the concept that loud + obnoxious + funny = repetition. The comic writing is non-existent, in fact I face serious repercussions even comparing it to entertainment of any kind. Here is the premise. Two girls accidentally take their adventures on the internet and the joy happens after the initial success, they come up with the idea that they should make a webcast to show their brilliance. <br /> <br /> OK, so where should I start? Let's start with the laughing trail, the often-used but never-successful reminder that we, the audience, should laugh at. According to the foley guys, this show is the funniest thing on the planet. We should all be putting loads on our pants because of the brightness of the mood placed before us. The laughing track goes seriously every few seconds. It is quite likely that usurping Scooby-doo to the king of the overuse laughing lane. <br /> <br /> Then the trick of words glued to the top of our lungs, the craziest of grouping words to look silly is also employed little or no success. Whoa and let's not forget to create new words to sound funny trick. Is that web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, the acting. I can not complain completely here. The actors are young and inexperienced, but this should and can be corrected with good professional help. Because of inexperience, the nick must help the actors define their craft. Instead, in the usual fashion, the actors are placed in front of the camera and say "act." That mostly is robotic recitation of lines, lack of time and overall epic failure. <br /> <br /> The lack of anything in this show makes it a disgusting representation of how not to be funny. Do not waste your time. This show is degrading to all mankind
