Sorry, folks, but all of you who say this is a great documentary ... and the award he won at Sundance ... well, all of you were cheated. I heard a few years ago how I had to see this documentary and I finally watched it. Maybe in 1999, when it came out, and the reality show did not have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have seemed fun. But Mike and Mark are so obviously playing themselves, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny and some of the lines seem improvised, but most of the time they do not sound real. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they are not actors, but that's overkill, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe that many people think it's the real deal. I was not mistaken, so it was actually a bit annoying. Interestingly fun, but not missing much if you lose.
