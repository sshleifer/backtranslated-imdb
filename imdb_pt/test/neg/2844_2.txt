This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" show in 1971. The episode was starring Sue Lyon (from the film Lolita fame) and Joseph Campanella, who play a nanny and a vampire respectively. The vampire hires a nanny to watch over his son (who seems to be some kind of werewolf or monster) while he goes out in the night in search of blood. The nanny is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she sees him for the first time and only starts putting two and two together when she realizes he has no reflection in the mirror, has a strange collection of books in the library on the occult, and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she originally thought he was. She runs out the door, the vampire comes out looking perplexed and the episode is over. I do not know what was the purpose of making such an abridged episode that lasted only 5 minutes. They should have just expanded the previous episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this. A total wasted effort.
