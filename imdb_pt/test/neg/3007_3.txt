This is one of the most beautiful films of recent years. The fact that it was made with a bit of virtual money (about $ 1.8 million, according to them, on the DVD: they infer that they ended up with less funding) makes it even more impressive. Not just photography, but the design and particularly the places (Eastern Montana) that are both authentically American and supernatural. <br /> <br /> Too bad that there is not a coherent movie to follow. An extremely promising configuration of the last 48 hours of cleaning a rural town in 1955, before being flooded by a dam, is washed with pretentious jumbo mumbo, alluding to the angels and a dying child. And what is presented as the "real world" is hopelessly arched. Note to the Polish Brothers: Coen Brothers are funny - you are not. <br /> <br /> No doubt many filmmakers will find Northfork's abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some kind of depth, the kind that sophisticated types struggle all night with cafes while the masses watch "Charlie's Angels" or something like. (Sigh) If you insist ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for their 'impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.
