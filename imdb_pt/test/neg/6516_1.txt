If you've never read the book and never want to read it in the future, go ahead and watch the movie (6/10). It's a good fantasy film with well-done CGI, nice acting, a beautiful setting, and an above average fantasy story. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book as I do about 10 times or more and really love it, do not expect too much (or better: do not expect anything). The story is totally different from the original book. This may explain that the film is voted 1/10 people with about 40 or more (like me) and a lot better of people who have probably never read the book before and therefore expect nothing. <br /> <br /> The differences between the film and the book are not really necessary and they change the scenario (in my opinion for the worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic of the book works with rituals of classic magic effects. (Changing the climate, creating illusions, turning into animals, ...) In the movie, magic is more like "Jedi school for the middle ages" (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil is resembling the emperor palpatine (after part III) does not really make him better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book is not totally cut out of the world like in the movie. In the book, the story is set close to Dresden, which Krabat visits once with his master and also visits a few neighboring villages for the festivities. (This part may have been changed to reduce costs.) I also do not understand why in the film the factory is located in the hills while the nearby cemetery sits in the high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The whole environment is the middle run of the medieval fantasy style of the mill. Lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, just very rustic houses. The book never suggested such an environment. <br /> <br /> In the book, the master tries to make Krabat his successor, but Krabat rejects. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film, Krabat always rejects the master openly as a stubborn student. <br /> <br /> - The film is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories of his youth probably out there. 170x. OK, the stories are missing anyway in the movie. Also some of the explanations given in the book would have been useful and would not cost so many minutes: In the book all the work done in the day is effortless and the night work is like a normal work This explanation is missing in the film. Sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only a few "Gesellen" try to confront the master: If the master dies for any mundane reasons, the "Gesellen" is free and maintains its magical powers. If the master dies in confrontation, all will lose their power forever.
