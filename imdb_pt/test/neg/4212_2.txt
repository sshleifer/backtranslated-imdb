Breaker! Breaker! Chuck Norris, as a truck driver and karate master, talks about juggling two different careers. He gives a charge that he can not hand over to his younger brother Michael Augenstein, and then when the young man does not appear, Chuck will look for him. <br /> <br /> What young Augenstein got himself into is a speed-trap run by Judge George Murdock, who comes from Roy Bean law school. Of course Norris deals with matters in the usual Chuck Norris way and when he gets in trouble, the call is made by the CB so that all truckers come and help their good friend. This speed trap known as Texas City has a bad reputation and the riders are very happy to help a friend. <br /> <br /> Chuck of course, a little younger and with no facial hair on this one. He has the tight-lipped look of a man who realizes that the Academy will not be looking at this gobbler. George Murdock is exaggerating as would-be judge Roy Bean. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for Chuck Norris fans.
