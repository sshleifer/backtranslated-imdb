I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the city where Zombie Planet was filmed. I've heard about the movie forever, from several people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. So, for several years, I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found you sitting alone in the video store, looking forward to a rental. So, being the movie buff who I am, I decided to give these local filmmakers a chance. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Planet Zombie is awesome, boring, misinterpreted, miserably shot - and that's just the good thing. I tried my best to take advantage of it, which included removing my brain and putting it on the table so it would not get in the way of the horrible plot. Unfortunately, nothing worked. Planet Zombie is so bad it's pathetic. And the very idea that they are planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have not heard any of the criticism that I am sure they have heard. Move on, folks. Please. In fact, refrain from making movies completely. Or take part in some classes on rhythm, narrative and, well, basic direction. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, for God's sake, turn it off.
