"Tank Girl" was, I suppose, "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and was marketed as such. The comparison is admittedly appropriate; both films have so many things going on in any movie frame that, as impossible as the story is to solve, is certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is a fun enough ride if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise, you'll end up with a reasoning headache like me.
