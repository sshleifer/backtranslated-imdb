Chuck Norris stars as Danny, a cop who killed a serial killer, but when the killer escapes, Danny knows he's the only one capable of stopping terror. However Danny hides a secret, he knows it was pure luck that the terror was arrested and even luckier than Danny survived, now a final battle is fought, but Danny is ready? Right there in my description says what the problem is in this movie. Norris is playing a weak hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a great suspense. At the hands of a Norris thriller, that makes it ridiculous and irrevocably nonheroic. Also on board is Steve James of American Ninja and Ron O'Neal of Superfly, but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script. There is also virtually no action and I've always preferred a Norris movie with more fighting and fewer conversations. Given the rating on this site, I should not be alone. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (Bad)
