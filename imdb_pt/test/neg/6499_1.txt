Defined in a post-apocalyptic future, the new Highlander is an effeminate twerp named Quentin MacLeod, who is being led by a new Ramirez, while his little sister marks on his quest to prevent an evil immortal lord. To do this, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this suzerain, Korton, does. <br /> <br /> In short, this is pure junk, much like the Highlander sequences. Quentin is a pretty stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and complaining in a "woe to me, because I am a reluctant hero", and he never realizes that he is an immortal and can not be killed, less not easily. Ramirez would have done better to abandon him and thwart Korton himself.
