I suppose to say that this is a terrible movie would be unfair, but it's too bad. The sub-Disney plot involves dogs playing football and falling in love (aw, how cute!) The acting is not bad, but definitely could be better, especially that of the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who, throughout the film, seems embarrassed , as if he did not even want to be there. Either way, kids will love it, but parents should beware!
