I have to admit that I'm disappointed after seeing this movie. I expected a lot more from the trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It lacked a real plot and the performance was not exactly the best. Do not waste your time. The movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is. I would have to say that I do not usually write anything about movies on IMDb (actually, this is my first), but this movie was a disappointment that I recorded just to let people know they are not wasting their time or money. The plot is that of a robbery that is about to happen and looks like it has potential to be good, but the things that happen in the movie are a little hard to believe. Watch another movie instead, maybe the man inside ???
