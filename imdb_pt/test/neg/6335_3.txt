Another movie about a hardened adult who knows a cute and intelligent kid (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc). And again, it is not funny or interesting, for anyone to watch - children or adults. I'm sure some people might find this movie fun, but I have no idea why. Again, I feel sorry for the poor children who were forced to work on this film so that everyone else and their parents could make some money at the price of a rough movie.
