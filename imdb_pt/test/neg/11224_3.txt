What are Forest Whitaker and Clifton Collins Jr. doing in this? Light It Up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece about problems in low-income schools. While the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses all the clich√©s of the genre and comes out as a popcorn movie from textbooks. The characters are clippings from the urban version of The Breakfast Club or even from The Faculty. Watch this with your children as they turn 13 or 14. With them, it can be a way out of a lesson on current social problems. For any older person, it is nothing more than something to watch and spit at 4 am, as I did recently in Bravo. In fact, what was that doing in Bravo?
