I could not believe it. This movie was a total waste of time of my life. The title is appropriate. Love did not hit the hell out of me, this movie did. I kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and waiting for something, anything to happen. And nothing happened! Anything!! Terrence Howard could not even save this boring work called movie. It was dark and confusing and I could not kill the girlfriend in the end. The tone and rhythm of the film should be coming to a dramatic end. This only served to confuse the audience, because the film just dragged on going where. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
