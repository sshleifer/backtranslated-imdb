All Joe Rogan's act is profanity with bile. He is a marijuana smoker who entered Fear Factor, thinking it was a joke. He said he would fool people because he did not know how stupid people would be. The producers of the program he explained were following the premise of joking with unsuspecting competitors to see how far they would go. The level of evil involved is a bit skewed. Mr. Rogan's special is filled with complaints from someone who is too good for ordinary humans. I found him offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even makes a five-minute set in the word N. In general, ignore this special.
