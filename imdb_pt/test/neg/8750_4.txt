Despite all its flaws, I am inclined to be charitable about "Thing." There's the nugget of an interesting, scary, and claustrophobic Hitchcock story here. Put it in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer the British perspective) Robert Bloch, or the guy who wrote "Day Of The Triffids", and you may have had a nasty and disturbing story that was the best. thing in a book anthology of stories of terror and suspense. <br /> <br /> However, someone chose to tell this story as a feature film, and a cheap, second rate at that, and so most of the potential is wasted. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon's to reveal interesting aspects of the character in a better light. His classic story "The -widget-, the -wadget- and Boff" is an example of how it can bring together an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most fun, that you have already met. A good writer can, with a few chosen words, make the reader "see" some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to mark their emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we have a movie in which some of the most annoying and unpleasant characters of all time are grouped together and made to interact in an unconvincing way. "Where did this come from?" moments that just stay there. (Ie the blonde psychic girl declaiming that "You are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We have the rhythm of lead and slow motion blocking and tedious sets and rigid actors. I blame the director for the "hard and shallow" part. These are all third-degree actors who have never made the big time, but they are also 'real' actors, and a good director could have gotten better performances from them. We do not worry about the lesbian tones that make the viewer feel uncomfortable and exploited without delivering any kind of payment. (If I'm going to have my most basic instincts explored and feel guilty about it, I want to do staged things better than that). And we have over an hour of scary buildup spread in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climax I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "Thing"? Well, some of the close-up plans of the wizard's head, silently expressing his guidelines, were very effective. The covetous and cunning widow seemed true (even if I wanted to stick a sock in her mouth). The first scene where the big, simple hand of the ranch silently turns the oily cowboy and the woods had a little shock value because the plot went to the trouble of establishing the big man as a very nice character. And as I said earlier, the idea of ​​an insidious force of the past that transforms the members of an isolated community against each other is good and can sustain the interest far above the actual merit of poor performance. <br /> <br /> It definitely is. <br /> <br /> But as I said, I'm inclined to be charitable because the director was probably working with a hefty budget, risky time constraints, and the best actors he could find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge easy crap like "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or the remake of "House of Wax" 40 years from now. I hope they are charitable towards our own taste in supporting our generations of film stock waste.
