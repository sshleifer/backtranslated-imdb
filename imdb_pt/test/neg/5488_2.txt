The story is: a troupe of actors at the turn of the century, along with producers and theater owners, have very complicated relationships. A resident playwright wrote a psychological drama. He wants a good production on stage, but he can not, unless he convinces a particular reviewer to revisit production and make a positive review. If your production does not continue, the troupe will put The Doll House, recently written by Ibsen. Many different relationships among the principal are explored; None of them are interesting. But the involvement of the characters with each other leads to give the resident piece a second shot. <br /> <br /> This film is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie. . The story lines are incoherent for those who are not friends with one of the stars. The only reason I did not leave the theater after half an hour is that a fat woman was resting a full meal on her stomach at the end of my line.
