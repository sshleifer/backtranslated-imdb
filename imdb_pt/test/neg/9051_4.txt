I love Umberto Lenzi's crime films - ARMED TO THE TEETH ROME is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS practically legitimized the Italian Euro-War phenomenon by being a good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking hard and it's hard for him to make a mistake. <br /> <br /> What a shame, then, find your FEROX EATEN ALIVE and CANIBAL. They could have been by anyone, in fact, and one of them observes them with the feeling that he was under contract, was told what kind of film to make, was assigned to the cast and to the team and received a budget, term and script. Lenzi then went out and ran his movies the same way a guy at McDonald's brews a batch of chips. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is the most original - which is kind of surprising, considering that it features extensive scenes copied from three other cannibal films - and easier to enjoy than CANNIBAL FEROX, though not much. <br /> I'll let others outline the plot: What fascinated me in the film is how staged it all seems, and yet, what a rather infamous reputation this movie has as a sort of total attack on good taste. It is not, although the film is a tasteless exercise, complete with a scene of winning the title where two of the pretty supporting ladies are literally sliced ​​and eaten alive by the cannibals, which is the high point of the film. The problem is that Lenzi allows us to have a good and long view of the cannibal banquet scene and has the compelling touch of a STAR TREK season 3 episode complete with a fake selection of stamps for the really bloody photos up close. And I do not know about anyone else, but if someone cuts off pieces of me and eats them, I would not just lie there looking distressed. <br /> <br /> My problem with the film may be I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a filmmaker, and again this could have been directed by anyone. All of his cannibal film conventions are played, but they never seem to be filmed with any real conviction, other than trying to intimidate Ruggero Deodato out of the litter box. The two directors must have known each other and either had a kind of youthful rivalry or a dislike of each other's work and a conscious need to overshadow others. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with DEEP RIVER MAN, Deodato released with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi fired back with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato blew it (and everyone else) with the superior CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, and Lenzi fired one last farewell salvo with CANNIBAL Ferox, which is almost as realistic as the commercial Krazy Glu, where the guy glues his helmet on a beam and is suspended in the air. <br /> <br /> This film is less desperate and a bit more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss. with all that is sacred than the Ferox, which remains as a sort of misguided attempt to cover up the CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. This is yet another mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure interspersed with a Jim Jones suicide cult - the cannibals seem to have been added as a belated reflection rather than the reason for making the movie. I think fans of the genre will get a better impression of the film than fans of Lenzi's movies looking for something new by the formidable director. It's not as much fun as SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, adventurer as his own DEEP RIVER MAN and certainly does not have the wallop of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with recycled footage, scenes of animal violence, misogynist scenes of sexual violence and theatrical method of filmmaking, and what you get turns out to be an OK jungle thriller with two or three prominent scenes, and Umberto Lenzi was able of much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; Gore freaks will go crazy though.
