First of all, let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of Thomas Howell's career since "The Outsiders" and "The Hitcher." He was a rising star in the 1980s - with hits like "Soul Man" as well. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to continue from there and really affirm himself in Hollywood. Put it this way - Tom Cruise had a small turnout in "The Outsiders" while Howell had the lead. See the cruise today !!! But choosing material like this will only further detract from Howell's career - if that were possible. Why does he choose things like that? A small part in a big movie would be more beneficial to him than this crap. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story here happens in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a shepherd - protecting the flock from various religious leaders, killing all the unwanted. He is a hit-man in other words. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad they would not seem out of place in an episode of the Thunderbirds. The use of slow motion repeats unnecessarily throughout the film, but is well backed by bad acting (and bad is a nice word here), no continuity, scenes that are played for no reason, vehicles that appeared to have been made from a box of Corn Flakes and a style of direction bordering on stupidity. Oh yeah, and the plot was pathetic, too. <br /> <br /> I hate writing bad reviews about movies - especially those in which I really like the star - but this movie is so bad that I do not believe it for a second. that anyone could be proud of it. I'm not a filmmaker or a director, but I'd hide my head in the sand if I spent any amount of money and time on that film. <br /> <br /> In short - this was a monumental waste. of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to see this movie. It came for free with a DVD player I bought, but I still hung up the thing in the middle because I was embarrassed by Howell. Come on C - give yourself some credit and struggle with these wonders without success and try to strive to get a good share - no matter how small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and just because there is no setting for 0/10.
