Since Roger Corman attached his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Corman directed many memorable low-budget horror movies in the 1960s. I particularly liked his adaptations of Poe's stories, such as "The House of Usher," and "The Well and Pendulum," and "The Raven" starring great late Vincent Price. These films had solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and provided some chilling moments. Unfortunately, "House Of The Damned", for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of tacky low budget special effects, gratuitous nudity and mindless gore, with quick edits and cliches and camera angles. <br /> <br /> `` House Of The Damned '' starts off interestingly with some pretty pictures in Ireland, but it's a direct descent from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters with whom we would like or building suspense - the director chooses to start increasing body count. After a brief introduction to the protagonists, a young couple and their daughter, the audience passes the balance of the film jumping from a "scary" event to another that, in this film, replaces the coherent development of the plot. The main characters are so poorly designed and so misunderstood - the audience does not care what happens to them. To make matters worse, "scary" events are either totally cliché or unconvincing due to the special effects of low budget and low technology. The soundtrack was taken from "The Omen". The plot, the little there is, borrows heavily from "Poltergeist" and "The Legend of the House of Hell," but has none of the qualities that made these films compelling. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing haunted house movies well, I recommend you check out classics like 'The Haunting' (1963), 'The Innocents' (1961) or look at the first films of American International of Corman and passing on 'House Of The Damned' unless you are masochistic or irrational. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
