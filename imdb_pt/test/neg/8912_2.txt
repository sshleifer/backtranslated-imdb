Oh, one more Seagal movie. In less than a few months they come to populate the shelves of video stores. Is it as bad as Submerged? No. But that's not saying much. I like perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> Seagal is a professional thief who wants to resign but goes to a last job only to be betrayed by his boss. He arrives in prison and is helped by a gangster who helps him get out and get the return. It's good to see Seagal finally not playing an agent, a cop, or what he usually plays. We actually have a US location in Las Vegas. So, an Eastern European territory as usual. There is no yarn here. Don Fauntleroy does a good job. <br /> <br /> However, most of the action scenes and fighting with Stevie are clearly double. <br /> <br /> Other movie glitches, a lack of realism and logic in even the tiniest situation.Seagal and Treech make a so inspiring (unintentional) team time laughed a minute. It weighs the rest. <br /> <br /> Several notable faces appear in slums ... the sleepy Kevin Tighe is a long way. of their emergency days. Nick Mancuso appears in sleepwalking mode to get a check. There are no more rappers. Please? At this point, the action scenes and the plots are more predictable and recycled generically than ever before. It's an obsolete scene that Seagal needs to get out of or hang onto. He should have left some time ago.
