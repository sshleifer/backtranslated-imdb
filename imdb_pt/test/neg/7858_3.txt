Henry (Don Ameche) appears at the entrance to Hell and tells his life story to His Excellency (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life and in particular his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we cut Henry and His Excellency a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the movie because nothing happens. It's a sentimental story of a man's life and it's boring. I watched with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish despite the Lubitsch touch. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good whenever he is on the screen like Grandpa and there have been some funny moments of dialogue. The color made it a good spectacle, but it was not enough to save this player from entering the tailings pile. In the same mold as "Your A Wonderful World" and "You Can not Take With You", and so, not surprisingly, was nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of them interesting and without any plot of interest. Boring, sentimental and the biggest dampening of an end that I remember ...
