I've watched all three segments and am so disappointed with the story. Zahn spends so much time imitating Duvall that he does not do anything else on the show. And Tommy Lee Jones would never be as weak as a young man, yes, yes, but weak, never. We never see how or why they go back to the Lonesome Dove ... which is a dirt hole in the original ... why would they leave Austin where they are heroes ... for doing nothing all through the movie ... I was rooting for Blue Duck at the end of the movie and he was totally wrong. There is no warning about how many segments there are ... it just ends. This mini-series could have been "someone" ... tragic. It looked like it was headed by the parrot and the notch
