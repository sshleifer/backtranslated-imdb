Eugene O'Neill is acclaimed by some as America's leading playwright, but by things like The Iceman Cometh, Longtime Night Journey, Emperor Jones. Strange Interlude was a piece of experimentation he invented where the characters on stage, look sideways at the audience and say what they are really thinking and then resume the conversation. It was a nine-hour production with a Broadway dinner, so you can safely assume that much has been sacrificed here. <br /> <br /> For the screen, the voice over thoughts is used for all characters. It is probably a better technique for the screen. Sir Laurence Olivier did very well with this in his version of Hamlet. But Bill Shakespeare gave Olivier a much better story than O'Neill gave his players in this case. <br /> <br /> Players like Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Ralph Morgan, May Robson, etc. are much more animated than most of his films than in Strange Interlude. The story takes place over a period of 20 years. Norma Shearer is a young woman whose intention is dead in World War I. She begins to play a little, although that part is not shown in this version. She makes the acquaintance of Alexander Kirkland and his friend Clark Gable. She also has as a perennial suitor, Ralph Morgan, a friend of her father, Henry B. Walthall. <br /> <br /> She marries Kirkland, but is later warned by her mother May Robson and shows that insanity gallops into that family. to name another literary work. As Kirkland wants the kids and Shearer and Robson to think Kirkland's train will slip on the track if he does not get one, Gable is recruited for breeding purposes. Of course you can see all the complications this can cause and O'Neill explores them all. Gable is so terribly miscast in a production of O'Neill, but he was a rising player at MGM and did what they told him. Shearer does what he can to raise a very sad story, but she seems defeated at first. The best of the film is possibly Robson, who puts a real bite in his dialogue. Foreign Interlude ran for 426 appearances on Broadway in 1928-1929 and starred Glenn Anders and Lynn Fontanne in the Gable and Shearer parts. Perhaps no one could really have saved the film because, two years earlier, Groucho Marx had ridiculed the fillings in Animal Crackers. After seeing what he did, I do not think the movie going public took very seriously. <br /> <br /> And since it's not the best of O'Neill, nor me.
