I can not believe some of the scores that this movie is receiving on the IMDb site! Did I get the naff version of the Special Edition? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be kept in Battersea. I'm sorry for all references centered in the UK but if you're somewhere else and you do not have nails to cut or you do not have a beer mat collection to catalog then this movie may be worth 90 minutes of your rest shelf life (as long as you do not have ink to watch drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and edition are surprisingly stuck. What the hell are Irons doing in this movie?
