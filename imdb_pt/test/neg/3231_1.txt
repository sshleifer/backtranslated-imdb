I could not agree more. The book is one of the best novels by Dean Koontz and this movie is a total sham. I watched about half and threw the tape in the trash in disgust! I have no idea what the jerk director was thinking about doing that crap, but I'd rather rip my eyes off with a sharp stick than watch this useless movie again! Everything about this movie is wrong. First, the main character is moved from an ex-Marine to a high school KID. BECAUSE??? According to the love of his life in the book becomes his mother in the movie! I bet Freud would have something to say about it! I LAUGHED A LOT. The dog is cute enough and the best thing in the movie and completely banned everyone! Also a main character who helps them in the book betrays them in the movie. There really is nothing good to say about the movie except that at least it's relatively short at an hour and a half more or less. If someone has not seen the movie yet, do yourself a favor! READ THE BOOK! It's so much better than this useless waste of time!
