After Loomis makes a quick recap of Micheal Myers, we went back to the flashback in 1989, where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the blazing police station explodes. Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once more to find Jamie and her baby. In this version, the character Loomis gains more scenes and seems much more proactive than in the final cut. The score is much better, more according to parts 4 and 5, none of the electric guitars BS. And the ending makes a little more sense. For these reasons along with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense, and reduces the gore factor (Halloween, unlike the Franschise "Friday the 13th", was never over flagrant) that's why I prefer the cut by producer Bootleg. Not to say that the cut magically turns a poo into gold, it just polishes the shit a bit and makes it more understandable. The whole cult plot is still very stupid, just as Micheal is the father of a child. <br /> <br /> My Producer Cut Grade: C- <br /> <br /> My Theatrical Cutting Style: D -
