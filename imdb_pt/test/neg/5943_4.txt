"Midnight Clear" has a great premise. A group of overworked and over-educated soldiers is sent by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol a secluded farmhouse on the eve of the Battle of the Bulge. The soldier finds a group of German soldiers tired of the battle, and it is clear that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> Therein lies the problem. It's very simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do it and that's the end of the movie. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and that's also the end of the movie. So instead of having the GI and the Germans play with each other, even throwing snowballs at one point. Interesting for one or two scenes but soon becomes very annoying. After all, these are the Germans. The enemy. Nothing in this movie makes me think they should not be made prisoners or dead. The film makes a point of making them more human. In fact, much of what the German characters did wanted me to shoot them, including a scene where the German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or surrender to a mere enlisted man! Why should I care about these characters? Just shoot them and go to the Battle of the Bulge. It's much more interesting, anyway. A good scene: the soldiers are returning from a reconnaissance of the German position, where they had the Germans in their sights, but did not shoot. When crossing a clearing, they realize that a group of Germans have their Mausers pointed at them. The Germans are about 100 yards away. The soldiers then do something I've never seen any soldier do in any Sillywood movie. They throw their rifles and raise their hands! As unusual as that might be in the movies, it's a totally sensible reaction to have an rifle pointed at you from that distance. Although it seems distant, in fact, it is a white weapon for these rifles. I'll put the chances that someone working on this movie was a cruffler!
