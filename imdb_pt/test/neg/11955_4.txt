First of all, this has nothing to do with the top 18 Kung Fu weapons, starring Gordon Liu. I mention this as my Kung Fu Theater DVD presents a totally misleading picture on the cover, the wrong storyline in the back and goes on to mention (I do not know why) The Young Hero, starring Hwang Jang Lee. In addition to an introduction to the story of the style of the 18 guns counted by a monk to some children during the opening and mysterious manual that everyone looks for, the guns never appear again and the fights are all boxing. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa, whom I have never heard of before or any of the other actors. The film mentions another director, Wu Yuen Ling, as well as the IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Fei Chen Fei, Wang Ki San, King Suen Kai and Hwa Yue Suen, who seem to have sunk without traces after this movie. The fights are reasonable and frequent, but not great and the 'star' does not have much charisma. The turnaround at the end is simply stupid and the movie seems to end abruptly as if bored with it. The scenery and the training sessions on the river are a bit different from the usual. Unfortunately the beautiful sister drowns not the very annoying (though acrobatic) boy.
