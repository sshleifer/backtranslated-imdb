I bought this movie for a couple of dollars in a "warehouse liquidation" one day when just looking around. The cover looked very good, but the film is in black and white, (I wish they did not try to hook us up with colored covers in black and white movies, but that's a common thing to look at!). <BR> <BR> When I watched it I was pleasantly surprised. Turned out to be better than I expected. I was disappointed it was a B & B, but the effects are very good, certainly better than, say, "Mars Invaders," which has bad effects, and it's great to see John Banner in something other than Hogan's Heroes. /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not so bad for a B note, and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite science fiction, but it's not my worst either. That's right.
