We chose this as part of a Brentwood ensemble, under the title "The Broken Skull". Filmed directly on video, with very varied sound and lighting quality, this movie ends with an overactive quality that can inspire the viewer with feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, "Evil Dead" way. <br /> <br /> Without getting into spoilers, what seems, at first, to be a simple story of revenge, becomes increasingly complicated and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect will probably make you scratch your head and say "hunh?" <br /> <br /> This is a very, very bloody movie. The bloody effects range from blood-filled appliances to a silly effect of the Video Toaster that has to be frozen to be (un) credited. The "Fangoria" level of gross effects in this film is really incredible and should please fierce dogs, while anyone with a weak constitution feels a bit on the quiet side. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull is also an extremely noisy movie. It features not just ambient noises (captured by microphones and not replaced in the post), but there are lots of screams. No, no, I mean a lot. Very very! Characters scream, moan, howl and scream, laugh and laugh maniacally. Turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves! But you can not blame the cast for your enthusiasm, they really eat the scenery and sometimes the effect is quite fun. In particular, the actress who plays a certain Vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> Actually, very few actors were made of wood. Some of them may have exaggerated a bit (oh, just a little bit!), But most of them are certainly fun to watch. The cast is ethnically diverse and commends the filmmakers for that. The two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most rancorous and exasperated characters since the trader of the classic MST3k "The Gross Man." Just watch them sizzle with all the other characters, it's fun! In closing, Headcrusher may not become a terror icon on the same level as Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even Leprechaun), but we can definitely say that ... this was film.
