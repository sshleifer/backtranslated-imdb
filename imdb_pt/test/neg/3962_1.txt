If you're like me and watched the original phenomenon "Benji" from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you might be shocked to find out how truly horrible and more mystified than ever about its popularity in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective, as I tend to favor children's films and, for that reason, reduce them considerably. On the other hand, I've always hated this particular dog, a feature of the last two seasons of "Petticoat Junction." Never a great show, the initial episodes without dog were at least a good showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the cut dog in their screen time. <br /> <br /> Benji is a 86-minute mega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of McKinney, Texas. If that sounds boring, you would be advised to give Benji a broad birth and never let your remote control fall into the hands of a Benji fan (if there is any out there). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Because of Winn-Dixie", the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. Peter Breck of Big Valley plays the standard stern stepfather and seems embarrassed at the thought of appearing in something so stupid. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) seems to be finding Benji entertained, you should consider reducing your medication. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? ? I'm just a kid.
