I did this in the middle of the movie, and at that moment I realized that I absolutely did not care how that would end. It's basically a bland comedy that I just watched because I like Helen Mirren, who is in fact very good as an incredibly cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​the movie (or let's say in the first half of the movie, since I do not know - or care about - how the second half was) before, most notably 9 to 5, and one comparison between the two shows how completely Tingle errs. You need to feel that things are getting out of control in a way that makes you feel that events are inevitable, and you need well defined and interesting characters with whom you care, and you do not have that. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never caught me for a second.
