This movie made me upset! When I think of a cat in a hat. I'm thinking of cat in the books of hat. You know, the one from a few years ago that parents read to their children. Well, I thought this movie would be a lot like that! But much to my surprise it was nothing like the books! Insted is more like young adult humor movie. On one piece the cat is talking with a gardening tool (hoe) the cat speaks to this like this is his hoe (agin adult mood). the naming of his car I all so much though it was a little not yummy for a children's movie. under the classification you will find: moderate mood and some double. I think, in short, that means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! Wal-Mart said no because the movie was opened. If you are thinking of buying this, I suggest maybe renting it before you buy.
