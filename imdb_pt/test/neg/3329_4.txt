Some movies are just ?? unlucky. These are the films that obviously thrived with a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas but simply did not have the budget and / or casting staff and staff at their disposal to make it happen. "The Strangeness" definitely belongs in this category. You really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and unscrupulous horror fanatics of the '80s will have to admit that the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity because of its low-cost atmosphere, awkward stop motion effects and obscenely impenetrable cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a rather original storyline and scenario (okay, it's similar to "The Boogens" but I honestly doubt that director David Michael Hillman has intentionally stolen an insignificant B-movie from the 1980s) and the players perform even enthusiastically all wrong. An assemblage of amateur speleologists makes an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago, several miners mysteriously died there and the site was abandoned since then, but it is assumed that there is much gold hidden there to remain closed forever. Shortly after descending into the mine, the group members, one by one, meet the viscous ruler of the Golden Peak mine; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly extravagant way forward. For most of its runtime, "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess that is hard to follow due to complete lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting and the mine remains a mystery because the only illumination effects come from the cavaliers' helmets. There is very little action or horror to experience in the first hour, but director Hillman cleverly draws the attention of viewers by showing pieces of the monster at regular intervals. As soon as you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle, you're bound to keep watching until the end. The creature is performed with stop-motion effects, which I usually love and worship, but here in this case they seem extremely weak and unfortunate. The person responsible for the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen. The death sequences occur largely off-screen and there is very little suspense throughout the entire film. A horror film with such a backdrop should benefit from the claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" does not have it all. The greatest asset of the film is unquestionably the beautiful appearance of blonde actress Terri Berland. She resembles a speleologist as much as I look like Mother Teresa, but she certainly looks good in her tight white top and beige pants.
