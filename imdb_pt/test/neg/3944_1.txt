I could say that this would be bad from the trailer, but the pull of the DVD box made me rent it anyway. I was right ... <br /> <br /> Also for some reason the DVD version is very confusing and sometimes unclear (in terms of video quality). It looks like they filmed the entire movie with a 20-year-old camcorder, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie I was very disappointed. I will not say no spoiler, but tell yourself that the end was so bad that I laughed, this has already been done so many times before. <br /> <br /> The whole story looks like something out of an English high school paper. If I had to put a movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, this might just be it. I can not believe they actually released this movie. It really is not worth the rent, or a penny of anyone's money, unless you want a good laugh at the expense of the movie.
