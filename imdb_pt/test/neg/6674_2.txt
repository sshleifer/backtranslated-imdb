Ok so maybe the acting was not bad but I'm typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else from happening after the intriguing start of this telefilm of throwing away two hours of your life waiting for some plot development that never Come on. The chief investigator has an intuition that wiped out the missing Marine Officer (Guy), and few people, in addition to uninvolved viewers and the accused, seem to dispute it. So what's the point of staying with this drama? Knock it out of me. I kept thinking (or hoping) that there would be some kind of twist in the story or new revelation, but none was to come. In summary, I can not think of a single reason to sit and watch this nonsense TV movie, based on a real story or not.
