I've heard a lot about this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia for the past three years. Apparently, it is on the verge of becoming very contagious and millions and millions of people will be eliminated in a global pandemic. I just thought I'd mention that in case you have not been able to write your will yet. <br /> <br /> I also thought of mentioning it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight that was not about naval warfare but opens with a scene that is a cross between the "Surcoz" and a episode of "The X Files" that I saw many years ago. I thought I would be watching something with additional resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the unimpressive opening CARRIERS descends into a cheap and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM you will see the main characters are from female, one of whom is a figure of courageous authority, while the other main woman is the mother of young children. Needless to say, there is also a sick child subframe. <br /> <br /> What's annoying about the TVM format is that it overloads the potential of what could have been a pretty good movie if it was made for the movies. There is a pretty bloody scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurse's face and a striking walker being run over, but those chunks are quickly forgotten when the mood descends into familiar feeling since this - and almost all other programs already done - has been made for an essentially female audience
