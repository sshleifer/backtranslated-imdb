Okay, this movie was the worst show I've seen in years. The actors were not to bad (I realized it was a b movie, so they were doing a performance in movie b). Anyway, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO science fiction movie. WRONG. It was only an excuse for radical Christians to send a message to people. The last scene was extremely confusing. This is a horrible thing to do to make a person believe something. What one believes is a matter of opinion. This movie shows how religion is corrupted, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie b, this is not true. If you want to watch a movie you are trying to brainwash the masses. Well, this is the litter's choice. go right to it. If you are going to convey a message, do not force it. Ridiculous, people would abuse the media to such an extent. Especially Christians.
