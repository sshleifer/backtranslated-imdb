This movie is too long. I lost interest for an hour in history. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, who is the daughter of a prominent New Orleans man and his mistress. After his mother dies in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scandalize his father's "legitimate" family and blackmail them. She meets Gary Cooper, who is also seeking revenge against the railroad magnates who tricked his father out of his Texas land. She draws him to her plans, and the movie climaxes at a Saratoga resort. Long and boring, but worth seeing if you are a fan of Bergman or Cooper. The dwarf cupidon provides the only bright spot in this winding story.
