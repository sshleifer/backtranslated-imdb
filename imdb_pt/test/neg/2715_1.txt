Yeah, it was a horrible movie, but there was a song near the beginning of the movie, I think, called "I have a Woody" or something. I would love to find a soundtrack of that, if there is one available. I saw this song in the MST 3K, and as horrible as it is, there are moments, and this song was one of them. <br /> <br /> If you like bikini babies, this is the movie for you, but if you do not, do not bother. It was great material for the MST 3K, I have to admit. I'd really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack. Not just this song, but a few more were really funny, and they're classic as far as I'm concerned.
