Jack Frost returns with an army of Styrofoam balls that can only be frustrated when being shot with super-saturated laden daisies. How's this for a plot? The film depends on such a ridiculous premise that it hardly raises the eyebrow when characters are killed with barbecue catchers and are impaled by carrots. You can even say that the whole movie is skating on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some unique examples, including a commentary on the Murderous Coconut Shark. Just enough, times are tough, but that does not excuse the actors' willingness to engage in total bullshit. <br /> <br /> For those fans who expect to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept it. as merely a phallic carrot climbing the beach with fussy comments.
