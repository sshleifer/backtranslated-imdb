Do not be fooled by the off-line plot as described on the cover (at least the Swedish version). The story about this seems rather interesting, with speculative suggestions. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the saddest movie experience I have ever had ... It's obvious and should not be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the plot sounds intriguing, think about it: phones can move, run and kill people, as well as any other electrical device. He can throw things at you, haunt you, and run after you. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, it's a shame for the horror genre ...
