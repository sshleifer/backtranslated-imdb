To this day, Malcolm McLaren is telling anyone how foolish he was enough to believe the Sex Pistols were his idea and that the band members were his dolls to be used to make money. There is good reason for him to do this, namely that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * McLaren was approached by the band to be manager, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> * The Pistols were an appropriate organic band and not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious came back a long way too. This is something that has led to unfair criticism of the Pistols over the years as they were compared to boy bands manufactured. <br /> <br /> The band and no one else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created the publicity and gave the interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not instigate the Bill Grundy incident. The Pistols only appeared on the show because Queen had left. According to the band, McLaren was shrinking in the back if the arrests were made. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not fired. <br /> <br /> * Far from fooling the Sex Pistols, John Lydon (Rotten) successfully sued him in the 1980s for control and a sizable sum of money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers came from McLaren bragging about 'The Great Rock & Roll Swindle'. That would suggest that McLaren is not very smart, despite his affectations. <br /> <br /> * The withdrawals and subsequent payments from A & M and EMI were not again designed, it was just the way things turned out. <br /> <br /> * McLaren boasts of the money he earned from the band. If he was competent, he could have done more. It seems he could not even organize the shows properly. <br /> <br /> McLaren's claim at the beginning of the film that he invented punk rock can be refuted in about ten seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, only the highest profile. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. The only parts that are worth watching are the band's genuine images, later used much better in 'The Filth And The Fury'.
