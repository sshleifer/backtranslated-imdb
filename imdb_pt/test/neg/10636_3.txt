I just saw this in TCM today and I was shocked by Jean Arthur's over-performance. His eyes in surprise and generally doing everything else were not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in his restraint and timing comic. She's the best thing in this movie. Wilder's jokes were frankly and frankly more like something a college freshman would write trying to "get away" from being wicked, witty, and dirty, but it sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed that humor was being forced too much to be funny. The end was fully planned. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: Never, for a moment, did I believe that Art Lund suddenly fell out of love with Dietrich and suddenly was madly in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy Be real! 3 out of 10.
