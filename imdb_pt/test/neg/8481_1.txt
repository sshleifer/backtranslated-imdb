(Contains really bad spoilers) So what can I say about it ... It's a really HORRIBLE and HORRIBLE movie !! Too much CGI and special effects ... you could tell how ridiculous the baby is fake! at least go watch "Dungeons and Dragons" which is another terrible stack of TRASH.Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons much better !!! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this crap !! I'd also like to say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably as stupid as "Son of the Mask". "BabyGeniuses 2 was as fake as" Son of the Mask "and also contains a lot of CGI path !! <br /> <br /> Either way ... this was a bad movie VERY BAD REALLY .... just by please avoid it .... DO NOT recommend this to anyone ... please, its very ridiculous ... it does not make sense and plot too bad. The baby peeing on his father was just lame!
