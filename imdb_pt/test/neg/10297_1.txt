This must be the worst thriller I've seen in a long time. The direction, acting and adaptation of the story leaves what could have been a good plot at a pointless waste of time. After a few minutes watching the movie, it was easy to figure out the whole plot, and then there are more obvious clues early on, leaving no mystery at all. I guessed it in the first few minutes and kept hoping it was wrong and to my amazement I was not. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two FBI agents heading to a remote town to investigate a murder. a spree that left three witnesses, a young woman, a drug addict and a police officer. They are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each one counts their account of the day. Each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds when counting their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this movie better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends with FBI agents being the real killers and the young girl is the only one who imagined <br /> <br /> Why do they go through the whole fake of interviewing three witnesses and relate to the young woman if their idea was to kill them in the first place? How did they manage to pretend to be FBI agents (when you find out that real FBI agents were killed and their badges found on them)? How did they know how to assemble and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from start to finish. Maybe the idea is to develop your characters for revelation in the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and nothing sinister. The young woman's character is also a wasted potential. There is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to relate in her ordeal. She does not seem distressed, but detached, which is not explained again. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie on the whole.
