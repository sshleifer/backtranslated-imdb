... but I would be lying. A relative was a member of staff and we went to watch the production of that movie for a few days (and I was an extra). I'm going to die and have a second of time on the screen, not that I plan to move to Hollywood anytime soon. I just find it amazing how movies are made and part of it. Also, I received a copy of the movie as soon as it was finally released. They did not have a studio stand while making this movie so he was truly independent. Why the writing and acting are so terrible is beyond me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister so that could be part of that. But the cinematography was good. :)
