First, I want to clarify a common misconception: it is not unrealistic that the school where Zoey goes gives the students laptops. At my school, those in 7th grade or more must have Apple MacBooks (this is paid at the entrance fee). Moving. This show is very annoying. It has boring and predictable plots and bad acting. Often, on the show, "girl power" gets louder, with girls hitting guys in whatever they try. But that's not the worst. What's worse is that the girls are portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances and shouting whenever they are happy. Except for the clever girl, who is portrayed as a freak obsessed by ugly boys and science. However, this show is very addictive. I do not know why, but it is. Although, the latest season has been SO terrible, bringing stereotypes, boring scenarios and bad acting to extremes that I never thought were achievable, so I'm no longer addicted, fortunately.
