On the scale of 1 to 10, I gave a 4. I thought the film was not very good, with a lot of violence and not a character to like. <br /> <br /> On an erotic scale, I give it. 6. Many of the sex scenes have been dyed with an underlying ugliness. I always like nudity, and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant appear, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
