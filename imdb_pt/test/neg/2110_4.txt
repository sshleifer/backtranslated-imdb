So I was energized during my weekend of Snakes on a Plane, after the movie we most craved. Why do not you snake on a train? How bad it could be, their snakes probably killing people on trains. The snakes should be rattlesnakes. First off me and my friends thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheese rattle sound clip. We actually sat through the whole thing completely ready to turn it off (we're too lazy to walk and hit eject). The next thing we knew we did not know what the hell was going on, but something incredibly funny happens in the end. It's one of those endings that you're going to rewind a couple of times just to take your laughs because you've suffered for so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 min to "8", rest of the movie to 2.
