This movie tries to rip Predator, but this movie is much better. This film has truly terrible special effects and a foolish plot. The team that enters the forest to discover the cause of the disappearances of military men and scientists is a combination of deltas and rude male commandos and pretty, but tough-guy patrolmen. None of them is very bright. All the characters seem to be more than willing to run into the forest alone and head on a spear or sword and their death. Some of the pyrotechnics are very large and must have cost a package. But the creature's close-ups are laughable like most death scenes. Every clich√© that writers could think was used. If you are looking for a meaningless cull festival, this can fill the bill. The night I watched this was very slow, so I sat through the whole thing. I have to admit it's been a while since I've seen something so bad. There is very little to redeem this movie. I'm surprised what rubbish like this is produced.
