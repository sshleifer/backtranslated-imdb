technically, this movie would have it all: decent actors, a nice landscape, no obvious view of the lack of budget, a celebrity like Richard Attenborough. the plot summary also sounded promising, suggesting a satire to the foolish bureaucracy and ordinary people who defy it. <br /> <br /> However, this never happens. the plot is simply too illogical. Throughout the movie, not a single person does a sensible thing. crazy politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain dead villagers - all just run from one incredible situation to another. what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene. <br /> <br /> Of course this kind of film has to be absurd and exaggerated. however, it is also supposed to have at least one instance to point to the madness behind the division of a city in between. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who does not seem to have a clue as to what is happening to him, and the "writer" who occasionally makes jokes of what can be considered funny by an audience composed only of 12-year-olds. <br /> <br /> What I find most impressive is that the movie tries to be funny all the time, but it did not make me laugh once. I've seen lots of "funny" bad movies, but so far each of them had at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in that sense, "puckoon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie with a comparable storyline, check out "Brazil". do not waste your time on "puckoon".
