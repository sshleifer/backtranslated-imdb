I just watched this movie, and for me ... it takes centuries to finish because it's very annoying ... and the plot is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> Now ... where should I start .... The .... the movie is called "sinking of japan" .... yes yes ... it shows that Japan is really sinking, but the action part is really bad. I compared the movie "the day after tomorrow" I would have rated at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> The "wreck of Japan" does not show much about the disaster that is really happening right in front of our eyes. there is not much emotion at all ... boring ... all I can say ... <br /> <br /> one more point ... I would recommend this movie to have a better title ... maybe something like "the Japanese wreck novel" because this movie has many conversations (waste of time ... absurd talk) and the love story is extremely boring and has dragged on for a long time ... honestly .. I can almost get frustrated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... this movie does not show enough details of the disasters, for example many people running like hell to avoid death ... the part of the love story was extremely not touching enough to me. <br /> <br /> but hey ... there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though ... & it has good songs!
