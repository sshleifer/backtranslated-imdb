Me being one was probably having a fart when it came to renting it. Whoever really buys, will like to use this as a roller coaster. Maybe a frisbee? This is a DVD that I actually found at the front where the kids could get to it. Since dvd's do not seem to be in a position to be put into that tale back room with all the big boxes of vhs are, I think it's quite annoying they stuck this next to a Disney movie. Yes, going from dinosaur to erotic ghost showed what we all think of Disney right? I still have not lowered so low yet. There is no performance here. The only interesting thing is the old 1973 movie trailer for old erotic old movies that I'm amazed to have been burned to hell. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (if imdb allowed zero to be 0/10)
