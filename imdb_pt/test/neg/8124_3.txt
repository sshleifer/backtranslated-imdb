I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. In a strange and surreal way, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that I think every kid that grows in America gets involved. I shudder now to think of how I burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time. for some reason. Growing up in the 1980s, we all knew "drug addicts." These were the children who wore Iron Maiden T-shirts for school, had long hair, had immature mustaches, and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had been disapproved to a degree or two. We laughed at them because they were so stupid even when they were not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were them. To the extent that GenXers like myself would despise the excess of the '80s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a kind of postmodern anthem foreign to us. Strange because, like Beavis & Co, we do not care if we had a hymn. It was just an inner joke we all had right away, even if it was horrible.
