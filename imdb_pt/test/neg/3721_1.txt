Although I do not recommend this movie, I also do not recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Although I have not given the finale, or most of the twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It is difficult to identify the main problem of the film Donnie Darko, because there are many to deal with. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of teenage fury, early morning diatribes, arrogant justifications, and banal and harmless philosophy to inspire twenty teen angst dramas; Then he smashed them into a single two-hour package with a touch of science fiction. The result is deeply distressing - for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the public along tortuous paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all expect them to ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, hiding it under a CGI effects varnish and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends and made hostile and unsatisfied with his suburban life. We are meant to feel that he is smarter than his schoolmates, though sometimes this is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends presents an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie opposes a theory of his own, his friend complains that Donnie acts "all smart." Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than his friend's - just more annoyed. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his director's description of his standardized test scores as "intimidating"; but given the director's inclination against the simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for the development of character. Donnie takes prescription drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the whole drug issue is underestimated, and one of the first chances that the director has to rescue the movie is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100% science fiction. That would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind "fiction" is very unstable. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best, sounding like disinterested and uninformed ramblings. We get the idea that the movie writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can not remember how it worked but was sure it was really interesting and wanted to work on the film. The scientific part, as a result, depends more on expensive animations than on the actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a professor discussing time travel claims that if he continues to talk about the subject, he will be dismissed. ). Donnie's relationships with a visitor to the future lead him to commit various vicious actions. The justification for such actions is a complicated business. He ruins the school, but that's okay, because his school does not treat him like a person. His punishment for a scary defender of self-esteem (something similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the public humiliation of the man. But should the public believe that Donnie is some kind of avenging angel, fighting ignorance and debauchery? He even seems to ignore the effects of these actions until after the fact. In addition to these flaws, the film is replete with flat and uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story takes place in 1988, shortly before the Bush / Dukakis election, and the director addresses that point during the film. The focus, however, extends exactly so far: Donnie's rude father is voting in Bush, while his rebellious, free-spirited daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even remotely like a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good movie, but the latter should be left out. In the same way, Donnie's sincere discourse about not being able to group all human emotions into the bland categories of "fear and love"; this does not prompt the public to make great leaps of understanding. Everyone Knows There Are More Than Two Humans Mr. Kelly pays homage to various 80s pop culture symbols in his movie: ET, Stephen King, The Smurfs, Back to the Future. a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, assertions and disenchantments, coarsely sewn by untrained hands. All the whole songs are played in musical video format for the actions of the characters, apparently because the director likes the music. Characters who have little or no connection to the plot (including the archetypal bully, the fat girl, and the right-thinking idiot) get an unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them somehow. The clumsy mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas in his head to make another movie, or if he has squandered all his creativity in a meaningless, messy and sinuous effort. My rating: 1/10.
