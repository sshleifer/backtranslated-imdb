I had heard that this movie was elegant and intriguing, but I found it annoying. It's been a while since I've seen (and I hope I do not discover all my memories are wrong and I'm unfairly condemning this movie), but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Leopold and Loeb as victims of an anti-gay society, and that this somehow caused his horrible crime. I totally disagree with this point of view, and I find it unjust for both homosexuals and Bobby Franks, the true victim of the story. I can not imagine why anyone would want to claim these two as martyrs. I also thought that L & L were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than they really were - after all, they were teenagers who lived at home. The film puts them in a kind of fantasy world that seems to have been marked by Morrissey. <br /> I just read an interview with one of the filmmakers who suggested the film's anachronisms, like the push button. The telephones that the characters used were destined to "add the Brechtian distance". They certainly do this, but I happen to find it very annoying. <br /> <br /> Apparently, a number of people found this film interesting, but I would have preferred a less "elegant" and more realistic examination of the role of homosexuality. may have played in the Leopold & Loeb case.
