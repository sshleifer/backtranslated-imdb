A long-awaited remake of a classic musical and a bitter pill that needed to be taken. Very, very difficult to swallow ... all of this. It did not have a gram of credibility anywhere. And when you do not have a Rose, you do not have a show. <br /> <br /> Bette Midler seemed to have been born to play this part. However, all she could produce was a cute, funny, flashy trademark, Bette Midler ... overloaded with all the familiar Midlerisms. Roz Russell has nothing to worry about. She can rest in her grave, knowing that she is still the definitive Mama Rose (of the movie, at least). <br /> <br /> I thought Midler would really put it through this time ... to play in what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time ... as she did in "The Rose." But no, she played it safe. She threw herself. She made Rose a dinner theater cartoon. Even his songs were not inspired. It was maddening to watch, knowing that Midler had the talent to rise above his whim to make money. She showed promise only once in this "gypsy" and that was with "Rose's Turn". But by then it was too late. <br /> <br /> Sincere Cynthia Gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only spark and when the role of Gypsy overtakes Rose, you know there are problems. in River City. <br /> <br /> A huge and huge disappointment.
