Well, I watched this movie hoping to be rolling in the aisles ... like I was wrong. The movie was moderately entertaining, at best, and annoying at worst (the slapstick comedy style of building an ark with archaic tools, laughing ... no, I did not). I am very disappointed, given Steve Carrel was the lead. I watch the US office religiously, criticize me immensely, I thought 40-year-old was good ... but Evan 'elp-us-why the hell did he accept this script. And, as for Morgan Freeman, he's old enough to know better. <br /> <br /> So the idea seemed reasonable, the actors I had all religions, but the execution was nothing to write and the end, well it looked like they had run out of money or ideas. This for me was one of the most planned finals I could have imagined. They took a biblical story and simplified it to a cautionary tale about localized environmental issues, not even global issues, but a local bill - yawn! <br /> <br /> In short, a reasonable start, gradually worsened and, by me, everything was washed away at the time the credit rolled.
