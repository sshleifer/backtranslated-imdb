This film is a shameful result of what happens when: A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) was rushed into production to quench the poker craze / Stu Ungar. <br /> <br /> The story of the beginning is uneven. Vidmer spends a lot of time in Ungar's childhood and not enough in some of the legendary tales - such as card counting, his blackjack escapades, the money roll as id. It also leaves aside the mentions of other big names in poker, such as reese chip, brunson etc. The movie is a complete mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read One of a Kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
