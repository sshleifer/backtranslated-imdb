I loved this movie when I was a teenager. Loved it. She did not grow up with me, though. Maybe it's because it's a melodramatic load of old junk, full of macho posture, tacky dialogue, slo-mo exaggerated and characters saying 'Damn' a lot. The ragged narrative grabs one character into another, from one plot to another, never bringing it all together, and it does not help that William Baldwin's expression of a performance is wet enough to put out all the shots in the film. overlong runtime. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth watching, but no one really is at the top of their game here, and women have a lot of fun. The only real impact comes from the striking fire-fighting sequences and the majestic soundtrack of Hans Zimmer, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
