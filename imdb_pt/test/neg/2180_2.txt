This is supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I will state that it is actually one of his weaker films. First of all, it's not funny. Nothing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump in a box that was a giggle, but that was desperate. The first - and only - talkie of The Tramp, where he talks (he sings in an earlier movie), but his dialogue shows us exactly why he was so fun to watch in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two movies that are at least ten times better than this movie. There is literally just a good scene in this movie, the one in which Hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball. That's it. <br /> <br /> Okay, so it's highly praised for being the first movie to go to war, even before we get into the war. No. It's not true. It simply is not true, so the compliment can be reduced a bit. The Three Stooges did this on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months before the October release of Chaplin's movie - and this movie was really funny! If you want to watch Chaplin's biggest movie, watch this for your reference. Then click on "Modern Times," "Gold Rush," "City Lights," "Limelight," "The Kid," or even "Tillie's Punctured Romance."
