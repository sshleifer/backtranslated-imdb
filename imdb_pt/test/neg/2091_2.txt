This train accident begins with Brujo and Alma crossing the Mexican border. Alma is suffering from a horrible curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes, just as she grits her teeth and mumbles nonsensical things. So, apparently, Alma has this guy in Los Angeles who knows of a cure for her. They embark on a train to get there and luckily a friend of them pays their way. Alma and Brujo are in the suitcase all the movie, since they can not buy seats of the upper class. Meanwhile, in the highest class, we see a lot of no one on the way to Los Angeles for whatever reason. A bald guy on a business trip, two girls, one of them carrying $ 5,000 and a pound of cocaine, three drug addicts and a few Mexicans. The Mexicans argue with Brujo and try to catch his "herb," ​​which is apparently a sedative for the Soul snakes sliding inside it. They realize that the snakes do not attack, they enter your body through your veins! Very twisted and B-Movie. Brujo saves the guy ripping out his heart (Temple of Doom style) and looking for the snake. For some reason he can not have the snakes hurt or it will hurt Soul. Meanwhile, a narcotics specialist tries to catch one of the girls and does a little topless action in return for not telling about the drug shipment. A mysterious guy appears and has a shootout with him. As a grand finale Soul transforms into a vampire, bites his man and then becomes a pathetic excuse giant for a CG-sized snake train, eats the train and is blown up in a whirlwind hurricane bomb and disappears. Everyone then goes to Los Angeles on foot. <br /> <br /> Credits really say in the end "Any resemblance to real people, living or dead, or real events is just a coincidence, and very strange. We suggest moving and / or getting on a plane." Strange since a line in the bald film is "Yes, I hate airplanes!" The credits continue to say "No snake was injured during the production of this script. Just a small child, but it's cool." In fact, there were a lot of real snakes used in the movie, and they were all very tame. In fact, there is no scene of CG snakes attacking anyone unless you tell the big one, but then it only eats the train and the other false snake is just the head and looks like a muppet. Snakes really do not attack anything, they're just ... there. One leaves the toilet paper in fact! <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, it's not scary (since there is no real snake attack), and it's just a 'quickie-in' that's when a low budget movie company hears about a big-budget Hollywood release, so they rush to release a similar movie, or even a parody, to release just before or simultaneously with the big-name movie. The effect of this is that many people will confuse one with the other, and will see the quickie instead of the biggie or, they will want to see both, for whatever reason ... like me. Avoid at all costs.
