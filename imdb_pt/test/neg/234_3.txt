The boy was born retarded. It pulls in half a dozen directions, dialogue and action features raised from much older and better known flops, and it can be funny - if only the writers knew what's funny. <br /> <br /> Disney things have gotten much better in the last two decades, but do not let that fool you. They should have given The Kid ample space, sung a lullaby, and then ran the train into a ravine. Merciful death.
