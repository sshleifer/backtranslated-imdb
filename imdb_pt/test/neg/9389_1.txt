This is the worst movie I've ever seen. At first I thought it would be good because I'm interested in the shorts triangle, but instead it was terrible. All he did was offer a bunch of explanations that made no sense (if time changes differently, how the woman does not age, and the child ages quickly), and it has a horrible ending. Next time the guys who made it go to Bermuda, they should take all copies of that movie with them. Please everyone vote on this movie so it can get on the worst list of movies.
