I caught it on HBO under its category of "guilty pleasures," and I agree that I felt guilty (and pleased) watching it. Um, it's really raunchy junk and rubbish. Two, the plot is slow and predictable, and once you learn "who did it," you think, "So what?" However, I must admit that being enough of a chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if not for another reason, other than watching Peta Wilson get completely naked several times. Do I feel dirty for watching? Yes. I'm sorry, did I watch this? No. Then there's the contradiction between being a good movie lover and a female anatomy lover, even when you're in a bad movie. Sigh!
