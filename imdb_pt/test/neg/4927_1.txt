waste of 1h45 this nasty little movie is one to avoid, it's like a cheaply misread cross between saw and some other recent movies about kidnapping because the writer wrote this is obvious .. he has no soul and did it to try and me some money. The twists were obvious, when those in danger could escape, did the obvious and did not. Only one good thing about it is that I have discovered a new actress that is worth watching. There are many better movies to watch, instead of making you feel miserable and thinking less of the world. Spend your time wiser, watch good movies, get some exercise, cook a good meal ... anything, but waste your time with junk like this
