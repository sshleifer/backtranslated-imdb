Quentin, in my opinion, wrote and directed just one good movie and that was the award-winning Pulp Fiction. However, most movies, especially the recent ones, have been real turkeys. People still rate him and his stuff today and I really can not see why. There are many other directors and writers who today produce much better entertainment in every aspect of their films. From this point on, I will not believe the hype that is a Tarantino movie. <br /> <br /> Inglorious was too long and worse yet you felt. The humor was, well, minimal and not so humorous. The violence was not new (except the final scene). The dialogue was sometimes VERY extensive. <br /> <br /> For some, they will love this movie; and for others they hate it. <br /> <br /> I thought that the theme of the Nazis was finally put to sleep with the incredible German film Der Untergang of 2004.
