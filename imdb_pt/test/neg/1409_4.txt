I was aware of the critical features of Man of the Year and coarse size, but I was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because I know good pictures can fall on the radar during the crowded fall times of the fall months. <br /> <br /> What I discovered was that the film is surprisingly uninspired. Surprising is a euphemism considering Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog) and the obvious comic gifts of Robin Williams. Robin Williams, in fact, is mysteriously underused. On the "Making Of" feature that accompanies the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how he sometimes let Robin Williams improvise the script, as if it was a spoiled secret of his. Are you really stupid, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use it for your comic skills (basically, in every movie where it has not been Insomnia or One Hour Photo), do not wrap it in a script. Let him improvise whatever he wants because he is the funniest anyone can write to him and his countless comic comments can instantly raise the standard in any mediocre movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I found even more disconcerting in his failure to use Robin Williams was in 1987, Levinson used that exact formula to perfection in Good Morning Vietnam, injecting Robin Williams' comic bursts into a war image to make a loud political speech. piece. <br /> <br /> So the film is not so much a festival of laughter as it can be and feels awkwardly lost in its tone. If the movie had the potential to work like anything, it could have made one of those mid-'90s thrillers in the style of The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive, or one of those Jack Ryan movies. His plot revolves around an employee of a Silicon Valley company uncovering a flaw in a system that reveals that the country has elected the wrong president and the CEOs' efforts to eliminate it before the secret comes out, so if you replaced Robin Williams by Harrison The Fior type actor, or perhaps even Harrison Ford himself, added a few more blasts, and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go. I'll never really know and it's not worth trying to find out.
