The Variety reviewer said that this was "overlong and overlong," and I kind of agree with that. It has some events that seem forced and unlikely, as when Cal (Crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and boring' man) and Julianne Moore find a US map in an unbelievable place. The story is one of those 1970s stories that "the guy must find meaning in his life," and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his prime playing the role of Cal. The whole "taking the road to find meaning in life" theme is still interesting though. Does it all really get you back into the family? I was not so sure. The acting is fine, I particularly enjoyed Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. I would give a 'five'.
