Very disappointing chapter 7 of this series dying slowly. Quite obviously the budget was extremely low. This movie was made for one reason and one reason only. To sell puppet master toys! Fans, like me in the series, have decided, from what I read and heard, that the only one in the series worse than that is Curse of the Puppetmaster. In turn, moving us away from the series. <br /> <br /> Choosing to make it a PG-13 movie, for whatever reason, did not work in the favor movies. The plot seemed almost to be there, but was easily lost in the constant stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only movie worthy of the Watch, also directed by Decoteau, is part 3 - The Revenge of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Granted, I'm for the scenario in the movie. <br /> <br /> Eca!
