This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Can anyone explain the plot of this movie for me? Yes, I know the bus ran out of gas in the middle of the desert, after the driver never noticed that his compass was not working, but then? And how did it end? Maybe I'm stupid to understand this movie, but to me it was an absolute waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendation? Do not bother, there are much better movies to be seen. This film ranks with my other all-time low-low (going to the sea - Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
