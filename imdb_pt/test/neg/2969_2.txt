It seems like some of the previous reviewers have seen another movie than I saw earlier tonight ... Actually, this movie is the reason I registered for IMDb. Of course Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and for this I give this film a 2, but the rest of this film is just sheer crap ... The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. Of course the actors are in good physical shape, but they can not act! Sometimes I like to watch bad movies for laughter but this movie had no charm and after I saw this movie I was full of regrets about seeing it. Of course, if you'd like to see a mediocre fight without anything else then this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for any spelling mistakes ... I'm just tired as cause of this movie!
