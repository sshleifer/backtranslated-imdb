I really wanted to like this movie, especially after all the buzz I heard spinning around it. But, unfortunately, that simply did not work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same illusion that Lost In Translation did - If you use too little dialogue, be heavy with slow-motion close-ups and focus on pieces of fabric on the stage, then your story will seem magically deep and thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot, if you can find a plot, of this movie is invented. I was not impressed with the confessional 'write everything' being the way the protagonist deals with the accident - So what should we believe? He grew happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences, so was he justified by that horrible incident? <br /> <br /> What, I suspect, should be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is unchallenged and faced with an impossible moral dilemma, instead creating a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection to anyone around him and, at the end of the movie, has no real notion of right or wrong. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit who simply walks through life while walking the skateboard. I do not feel anything for him, and honestly I wish he had been caught. The whole movie does not necessarily focus on your feelings of guilt, but on how it will avoid punishment and / or responsibility for a bad decision. He not only goes unpunished, but also finds a way to rationalize it subtly. A rather frightening and negative message, the suggestion is that so many of our young people are so disconnected from right and double that they simply create the rules as they go, serving good or evil. I think it's an insulting treat for today's youth, and the filmmaker's arrogance is full of strides, over-thinking, and mute eyes. <br /> <br /> (He killed the guard, but if you blinked If it was an act of mercy or not, it's hard to say - it could be that he was so mortified that he attacked with his skateboard When he runs to the car security guard, one of your skate wheels is stained with blood.)
