How do I sit back after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time? more specifically, the reissue and re-release of 2008 with the word 'Redux' at the end of the title? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie just did not work out. I wonder why the movie failed to score any important points in my book. In particular, what about the movie that dragged him down, and made him the director's worst movie of his career? <br /> <br /> Well, it's not very difficult to really find out. Let me just say that it is really a shame that Kar-wai has abruptly gone through this hole of mediocrity and poverty in furniture, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released Chungking Express, one of his lasting legacies and a film absolutely sublime. Like this ?? What went wrong? It would be appropriate to consider Ashes of Time as an experimental film. Our director essentially puts his own inimitable style of making movies and puts it in a totally different environment, mood and atmosphere; What results is a catastrophic film that is all over the place and just does not work. So it would be even more sensible to call Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Bold, audacious and innovative, but a failure, however. <br /> <br /> Let me work out. Those who watched the films of Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born filmmaker who has made his mark in the art world since its debut in the late 1980's, will know that there is a dominant aesthetic that links all of his films together; Essentially and frankly speaking, they are all colorful, suggestive, loving, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love, and loss. The same formula is transposed to the ashes of time; however, Hong Kong's regular environment is busy and instead we are placed on the backdrop of ancient China and the land of legendary martial arts warriors and clan members. Entwined in this quasi-adventure / story is Kar-wai's typical love story, this time involving an elegiac killer who moved into the middle of the desert and is committing contract killings. However, I must stop there; Character description is a useless thing to do. Because? Because not a single character in Ashes of Time is worth mentioning or anything. What a soft cast, and what a waste of talent (the Ashes of Time case contains almost all Karwai regular contributors). <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the film is essentially incessant and ceaseless narrative structure horrendous, almost nonexistent. One of the main reasons why Ashes of Time detractors reprimand is because it seems to have no plot, let alone an appearance or an indication of one. You can definitely see what they are getting even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the movie. Perhaps it is just the atypical scenario of ancient China, which is neither customary nor appropriate for Kar-wai's typical movie-making style. I like to think, as regrettable as it is, that Mr. Kar-wai just did a great job here. <br /> <br /> One thing a critic can actually compliment on Ashes of Time, although the praise is clear. isolated, is another trademark of the director? wonderful, colorful and happy aesthetic. What a cheerful color is composed on the screen, which glorious textures are painted for us and what breathtaking landscapes and images are captured for us throughout the film. We can at least consider this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still there at heart, and it is just the movie that is so atypical, and buries his usual nuances. While the visuals are not enough to fully acquit Kar-wai for this disastrous undertaking, are they enough to make the film worth it ?? and at least we do not leave the movie completely and totally moody, now that there is something we can think about well. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a "wuxia art" film, which follows the style of, say, legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. However, one thing differentiates Kar-wai's film from Kurosawa's best, and that's what in the Japanese director's films all come together and it just works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to make a genuinely deep wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative film in general terms, is a futile endeavor. Kar-wai claims that making Ashes of Time has exhausted him, and that he needed time to clear his head. It must have certainly been a stressful effort on your behalf, how your efforts are incorporated into the film and transferred to us directly? I mean, just watching the movie is a painstaking effort, and now I need time to clear my head of this nasty filming experience.
