As some of you have given more than 2 stars surprise me. I made a IMDb account just to comment on this movie cr @ p. The acting is cr @ p and the plot is cr @ p. He would not deserve any star if it were not for the soundtrack of descent (and there are still some scandalously scoundrel tracks there as well, most notably those with the oboe and sound as background music comedy black and white cartoons and adjust to mood intended from the scenes they haunt) and quality cinematography. The dialogue and plot are as complex as a book by Dr. Sues. These actors are horrible. I'm actually watching this movie now and, with every word, I'm stunned you all swallowed this shitte. The only reason I did not turn off the movie was because I got involved in creating a IMDb account and posting this review. I dig conventional movies, I dig stupid movies, I dig retro indie movies, and almost any other kind / genre if done well. My brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard that it was good and that he usually has good taste in movies; from the moment he told me the title, I looked at him like he was crazy. I'm having trouble finishing this speech because there's so much evil to speak. The only way I can rationalize the good ratings here is that you were paid to give high ratings to this movie. It is so poorly done and does not come close to dramatic, artistic, complex, well written, well preformed, or even bearable. If this were the end product of my hard-working board, I'd be embarrassed to make it public, so I do not even feel sorry for the director if he reads this - what the hell were you thinking?
