The plot for Black Mama White Mama revolves around two female prisoners in a female prison in the Philippines. One black and one white. These two women are thrown together in prison. Pam Grier is Lee Daniels Lee is imprisoned in the infernal prison of women for dancing like a harem girl. <br /> <br /> Lee's boyfriend owes her some of his profits from his drug-trafficking activities. Lee is mainly interested in getting out of jail to get hold of her boyfriend drug money, so she can leave the Philippines and have a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman from a privileged background who is also revolutionary. Karen joined a group of revolutionaries determined to change the corrupt Philippine political system. She is captured by Phillipino's authorities and held as a political prisoner. <br /> <br /> The story begins when Karen and Lee leave the prison where they were together. The two of them were also chained to the wrist. As they flee, they also fight with each other because they have different goals to pursue. Of course, they hate being caught together. But they also realize that they must let go of their differences, to help each other survive while avoiding capture. <br /> <br /> If this movie looks very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it's because a lot of the cast two movies are the same as their location in the Philippines. In addition to Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees and William Smith, were also among the many actors who were often cast in Corman's AIP films. <br /> <br /> Like the big bird cage, Black Mama White Mama, relies on too much bloody violence to be palatable. Pam Grier conveys her toughest persona ever in this movie and shows her competence as a female action heroine. Margaret Markov has less effect in her interpretation of the revolutionary Karen. She just looks frail and well-groomed, being a dedicated political guerrilla. With the exception of Sid Haig, like the colorful Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable. <br /> <br /> This movie has little entertainment value, unless heinous acts of violence are yours. Only the performances of Pam Grier and Sig Haig make this movie worth watching.
