Very poor script and acting. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. Everything is in the clich√© of the "mentor" and the "talented immature student". The characters are neither interesting nor friendly. Artistically it is so empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be attractive. Al Pacino goes to great lengths to give depth to his character without success. Too bad because sports betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. But I can not have a complete comment about this movie anyway when I left the theater 20 minutes before I finished. Everything was so predictable that it was a period of time ...
