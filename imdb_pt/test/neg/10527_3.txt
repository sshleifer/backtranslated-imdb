This movie was disappointing. After 15 years, when I was brought back the idea of ​​reviewing some information about Mariel Hemingway, all the regrets I felt about the film were reversed. Although I remember Peter O'Toole, I was totally oblivious to the fact that the female "leadership" (well, she was little more than an object for discussion in the plot) was Mrs. Hemingway. I saw this movie on the days when I wrote movie reviews and warned people about it, since the stories just did not work, and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out still did not understand the flow of ideas. <br /> <br /> Part of this may have to do with the fact that it seemed that after the original movie (whatever it was) was filmed, a publisher came in and tried to put something together. I do not know if this was a project by a previous studio boss, so I was sabotaged to discredit him for his successor, or it was a disaster from the original script that attempts to save were unsuccessful. The theatrical version simply did not work.
