This film tries to slash the age of the studio in Hollywood and the morale of the 1950s. Guy Stone claims to be a Rock Hudson type, but both scriptwriter and actor Matt Letscher channeled a sarcastic, noisy and sonic version of George Hamilton, which contributes to an unpleasant character. Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the public has a hard time liking this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is an obnoxious person who consciously uses and then throws away the sweet and handsome young men who share their bed every few hours. Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, a celibate lesbian from Stone. Manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director does not know what to do with her. The flaw is in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers from it. Sally by Carrie Preston owes more to Ellen Greene in "The Little Shop of Horrors." As it is written, Sally of Preston is good to laugh, but little else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this movie. He can not act, and seems to have been chosen for his warm body and good looks. Like many recent films, "Straight-Jacket" is a "dramatic comedy" - a comedy movie that shifts to a two-thirds drama of the way through the movie. And, like almost all dramedies, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Despite the expensive services of Skywalker Sound, the film's sound quality leaves much to be desired. Excessive use of the music soundtrack also creates a distraction of clues. The film really failed to satirize anything about the 50's. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain," it perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound as well as studio mentality about formula movies, "Straight-Jacket" can not portray Hollywood in the 1950's at all well. The dialogue, ensembles and behavior of the key characters are indefinite, and not dead, stereotypes of Hollywood from the 1950s. The same can be said for satirising the general customs, social trends and fashions of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy's house with the 1950s house satire in "Little Shop of Horrors." There is no comparison; "Little Shop" hits the nail on the head, while "Straight-Jacket" does not even know there's a nail. <br /> <br /> Motivations also seem random. Rick Foster must be a liberal of principles, but he falls almost immediately by a materialistic idiot like Guy Stone. Rick is fine with Guy's status closed for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, he becomes conflicted for reasons that are not clear. And although Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this point simply disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick comes out as a gay man of the 1990s, not a gay author of the 1950s. In fact, modern morality pervades this movie - which it should not, if it were really a satirical look at homophobia in the 1950s Hollywood. /> <br /> The plot holes in this disorganized movie are also plentiful. Saul repeatedly says he will turn Freddie Stevens into the Feds, but he never does - allowing Freddie to leave Guy. Jerry and Saul's plot to "in" Guy never makes sense, nor Sally's sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy has admitted that he is homosexual, apparently it does not matter and he ends up being a famous star and playwright anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​can save this movie. Michael Pinkey's cinematography is pedestrian. Sometimes the film almost looks like a filmed play instead of a movie (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is restricted to medium shots, and the film has an incredibly static. The Chris Conlee issue also does not help the movie. Long scenes that would benefit from the insertion of close-ups or point-of-view changes remain uncut. Whether this is due to lack of coverage or poor editing is unclear, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The film depends heavily on the CGI effects of Guy's house created by the visual effect. designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks clumsy and mushy, and is very remarkably amateurish. <br /> <br /> My overall impression about this movie is that jokes are cheap and easy, the plot messy, the characterizations uncontrollably inconsistent and out of the ordinary. brand, non-existent satire, performances above and outside the mark, and the comic timing off. It's almost an amateur movie. It's like someone doing a high school production and throwing $ 10 million.
