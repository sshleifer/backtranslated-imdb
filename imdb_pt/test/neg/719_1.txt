I read all of Shakespeare's plays, I saw productions of most of them and even acted and directed some. I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare should be done in the "traditional" way, but I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> There is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary. There is a grotesque that is far beyond what I believe Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogues are incomprehensible, and there are those elements, such as singing and dancing that do not give meaning to the film, but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that I lost a lot of money to buy the DVD of this movie.
