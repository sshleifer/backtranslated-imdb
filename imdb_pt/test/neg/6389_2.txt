This puddle of stealthy derivative stole all the Soviet films and failed miserably. I was left with an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the particular shortcomings of the Russian Orthodox Church (note that this comment comes from a person of faith). Even the great cinematography left me uninspired. I spent her most beautiful moments very aware of the masterpieces I was imitating evilly. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of communism and saints of the seventies. It's a meaningless film of (and over) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me.
