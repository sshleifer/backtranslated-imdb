George Zucco was an excellent actor, often playing villains with devious eyes with lewd intensity. However, even he could not save this boring movie. Zucco plays the mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that werewolf blood, injected into humans, can create an invincible. army of wolves that can win World War II (go ahead!) Experiencing Pedro, the handyman (Glenn Strange), Zucco creates a werewolf that looks a lot like what Dave Allen used to do in his comedy drawings! Peter is obviously based on Lennie's Of Mice And Men, and you almost expect him to say "Duh, okay, George!" There is an amazing moment when the werewolf kills a child by entering through the window and grabbing it, but mostly it is a routine and pedestrian - very pedestrian - 77 minutes run through all the old cliches that are made much better in others We also have the revenge motif of the worked Devil Bat, in itself a loan of Son Of Frankenstein! <br /> <br /> Zucco is a waste, and you just have to see it in films like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault's Secret to see how much is wasted. Some atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer, really. And the scene in which Zucco demonstrates his werewolf technique to those who doubted him (again tones of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) is unintentionally hilarious. <br /> <br /> It's not one of the best B movies of the 1940s.
