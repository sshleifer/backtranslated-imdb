Apparently re-cut episodes of the TV show Gangbusters on the big screen. While this was often done in the 1950s and 1960s, because people did not have color TV or TV, and producers wanted a bigger return on their investment (ticket sales on big screens or if they were for the resale of a series that did not is in the investigation), the results were generally smaller than the sum of its parts. The only time I saw the work was where the stories from various parts were put together (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or in the case of the horror anthology (The Veil and 13 Demon Street). Here the effect is to have stories of American criminals in the 1920s and 1930s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) interspersed with each other while a narrator talks about how the FBI hunted them. It's a strange mixture that does not work much because it's clear that there are things here that do not belong together. More than once I looked at the TV strangely because things did not look right. To be fair, I will not describe the low price of production, since that was how the TV (and the series) was. Not bad, but not good either. To be perfectly honest, the episodes in the series I've seen work best in single episodes, which we do not expect so much. Given the choice I would rent DVDs from the show instead of that movie.
