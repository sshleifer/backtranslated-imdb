It's tempting to see this movie as a daring avant-garde experiment. I like to think the director was trying to see if it was possible to get all the conventions of the comedy movie and produce something that was completely, utterly, bland. <br /> <br /> The answer, judging by "De Venus", is a resounding "Yes." This may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed the memory of others. This horrible movie hangs on the edge: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not so much that my internal censors have taken it from my conscience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine what The Director and the cast thought they were doing when they did it, or why they went ahead and released it as soon as they got it. I doubt anyone involved with it has gained much, but surely among them they could have put together enough money to buy all the prints and have them burned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that has nothing to recommend this. It's not even pleasantly bad. It's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens. I seriously thought to go back and demand my money back, which is not something I've done before. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about renting (let alone buying!) This horrible movie!
