I've been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 1970s and have always liked the character who is far removed from the common hero and his many and varied enemies. There have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second have done justice to the character. So I was hopeful that this new version would be good. Boy was I wrong! The art of the DVD is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie. Art and animation are well designed and writing and dialogue are generally good, though with notable exceptions. The voices of the characters are very well selected and each character is distinct and well represented. Now for evil ... Unfortunately the writers have chosen to totally ruin the origin of Iron Man and especially of the Mandarin. In addition, they decided to make Iron Man and their opponents in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes them stand out almost as much as live actors in a cartoon. CG work is often repetitive and blatant shortcuts are taken sometimes. CG battles are awkward as well, further increasing the fact that CG and line animation do not mix well. The film certainly would have been better if they had chosen to actually DRAW all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and gold costume for a single battle! And it's not even the big fight in the end. All this drags the film down and it never captures. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) CAN FOLLOW *********** * The movie begins with a string of machinery credit, welding and gears interesting and unusual. Then we are introduced to what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of restoration, and highlight is a statue of what fans will recognize as the Mandarin. Things go strangely, hampering progress in temple restoration. Supervision is by James Rhodes, long time friend of Tony Stark. It seems that they actually plan to raise the temple from the earth, despite opposition from a group insisting that raising the temple will bring a terrible disaster. Rhodes is captured in an attack. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed of the problems and leaves to personally supervise the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father handles board executives who are pushing for Tony to be removed. Tony arrives just to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces. Tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. He is saved only by quick action from Rhodes and a scientist. Eventually, Stark must build the prototype of gray iron armor and make a good escape, but only after some loss of life. While with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named Li Mei, and they fall in love. The Temple is erected and four elemental beings (all made in GC) appear and begin to collect hidden rings of power. Stark and Rhody encounter problems at home, but they can face the elementals without success in actually stopping them, first using the Water Armor, then the more classic Red and Gold Armor, and finally everything back to the temple and Stark is back in the heavy armor gray for a final showdown and a race with what can be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG). Here the story gives a major twist as it turns out that Mandarin needs a host body to manifest. This leads to a rather tragic final battle, marked by the fact that Mandarin is little more than a ghost and is not seen until the last 5 minutes of the film. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you are an Iron Man fan, you probably will not like this tour. And even non-fans can find the film a little without or not.
