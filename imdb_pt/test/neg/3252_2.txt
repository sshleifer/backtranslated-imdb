This movie should never have been made! It stinks, it's horrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Starting to see a pattern here? Jackie Mason is certainly not a Rodney Dangerfield. Gone were Ted Knight and Bill Murray, who, along with Dangerfield, were essential to the first film. It seems that the three (the stars) all knew a stench of script when they saw one. The one who did not have the good sense to give it up was Chevy Chase, who stayed close, but it was strange to both movies in my opinion. This movie is simply NOT FUNNY. Nor has other captivating qualities. This thing relies heavily on anti-Semitism to work and works to the detriment. I hated this thing. A waste of everyone's time.
