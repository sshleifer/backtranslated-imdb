The story is disjointed and poorly written. We get topics and a possible hook in the first act, just to see it disappear. If the writer had bothered to read his work carefully, it would be clear that Madsden's initial problem with the encounter with the "bad girl" suggests that there will be a problematic alliance between them as they try to solve his problem. <br /> The problem is nothing. The relationship does not get you anywhere. And there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody digs nobody and no one is attractive. The writing and the direction are laughable. You can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the focus of the story to try to extract some emotion. There is none. The writer / director is simply a beginner whose confused efforts somehow became a movie. From simple mistakes like '... they took polaroids ...' - in Japan in 2007? To insult mistakes like the nudity of eroticism, this movie is an insult. You can not make them much worse. <br /> <br /> And by putting 'Madsden' on the talent list, the producers thought they would have some success. He is hardly acting. Asia certainly is ... and the result is a heroine-chic panto. <br /> <br /> It makes a big mistake.
