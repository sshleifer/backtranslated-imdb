This film is a real shame, not only because of the plot, the empty performance of the characters, it is the lack of creativity of the director and the whole team, it is perhaps one of the worst films of all time, and it is difficult to believe that it is the sequence of one of the most famous films of the 90s. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of The Mask, when I went to see this movie that I was waiting for a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with a acceptable plot, instead I saw a very bad copy of the drawings of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, the film was not funny nor for my sister of 7 years, so I ask myself: What was wrong? Was he trying to repeat the success of the first film, or was he trying to create another masterpiece like The Lord of the Rings? Because if they did, they were completely out of their minds.
