There are a lot of movies, especially from the 80's that are so terrible that you can not help but love them. The Last Slumber Party is one of those. I hate this movie a lot, but it's still one of the most watched movies in my collection. I've been watching it countless times and I have a big laugh about it every time. It is the main example of how in the 80's, ANY film could be released. <br /> <br /> The name of our killer is Maniac Randles. (Scary, huh?) Randles is a runaway psychopathic killer running with a doctor's robe and a doctor's jacket cutting people off with a scalpel as he goes along. He ends up coming across a house of girls who are having a pajama party. One of the girls is the daughter of the doctor who tried to operate at Randle's, and Randle ended up pulling him down in some sort of sexual position. (lol just watch the movie to know what I'm talking about.) Now I know what you should be thinking at this point: This should be another tacky low budget cut and slash like Slumber Party Massacre, or Valentine's Day Massacre, right ? NOT! This movie is HORRIBLE! Firstly, the quality of the film changes throughout the film. Sometimes it looks like it could have been filmed this year, but other times it's so grainy and foggy that it's not even watchable. The funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves they did not care about anything. The director played the killer (as if that was not funny enough), but because of the fact that he was not talented enough to act and drive at the same time, he just shot a photo of him walking toward the camera with his scalpel, and then I just replayed that clip repeatedly every time someone is killed. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unpleasant, and these people who must be between the ages of 16 and 18 look more like 25-45 I know horror movies often use adults as teenagers, but I've never seen a movie where that was obvious. My guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they all died of old age ... Or maybe it was because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and that's one thing good because I very much doubt they could have gone into more movies even if they tried. All I can do is hope Tyler one day does the LAST MATERIAL FACTOR 2: THE FINAL CONFLICT and get all the original actors back. I'm sure everyone would love that. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by Stephen Tyler, (not the singer) who never directed it, and was released by B & S (which I'm sure defends bull and ****) Productions. Bull & S has just released yet another movie, "Forever Evil," which was pretty awful, but not as bad as the Last Slumber Party. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie, horrible and horrible ... Highly recommended.
