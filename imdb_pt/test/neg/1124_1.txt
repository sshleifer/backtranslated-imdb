** WARNING ** MISERABLE MOVIE ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas Eve, some cases of sow decided that he would send us this movie as "entertainment" on TV. What in the name of God was he thinking? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of horrible humor, despicable acting, bad jokes and a mess of a plot. Randy Quaid plays the idiotic role of cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a brain-dead person, incapable of simple tasks. He was fired because he was dumb as a brick, but the company he worked for regretted, so they sent him and his family on vacation. But being as stupid as he is, he managed to make the vacation into a disaster. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I still have nightmares about miserable acting and the even more miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad that you ALMOST have to see this ... But do not do it. The nightmares I have are far worse than any other nightmare you may have. Trust me ... I hate this film so bad because of its acting, humor, "jokes" and history. The only good thing was the beautiful scenery. <br /> <br /> Well, it's my opinion, and I hope everyone agrees with me ...
