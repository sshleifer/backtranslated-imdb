I've already commented on this movie (under the name TheLegendaryWD). But I see that there are others who have commented since. All I can say is: WHAT THE F ** K!? "I can not believe that a total of 16 people commented on this movie or even saw this movie. Add to that the fact that a couple give great reviews (probably the movie producers who went to one of these places in a shopping mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review - since there is no way to pay or pay for your own internet provider ... just look at their movie Although I still admit that I have a crush on this movie, I I thought some of the other people who wrote about this book might confuse it with another one ... until I read the reviews ... especially the person who identified the movie. tagline in front of the box: "The Ultimate Frontal Lobotomy" of ** k what should it mean anyway? "frontal lobotomy?) ... I completely forgot about this until I read it on People, we are a select group ... I say we meet once a year to see this movie ... ere, does anyone still have it? If anyone has please contact me ... I'm dying to get drunk.
