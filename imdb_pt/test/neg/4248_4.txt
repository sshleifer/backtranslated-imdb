Although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas, watching this movie has left me a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> It was promising, the characters and relationships could have been explored much more deeply than they did, but the story did not seem to understand the direction he wanted to take. <br /> <br /> Comparisons and parallels within history, especially the three generations of women in the family, had much potential, but somehow did not extend completely. It could have made the film a lot easier to relate to and attach to what is the purpose of any movie about lost love and life reconquered. IMHO, I think the film suffered from the lack of direction in the writing, although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock tried desperately to have a little life in sketches of simple characters. <br /> <br /> It's not that this is a bad movie, some parts leave you understanding the reasons for various things. plot developments, it's just that this movie is badly spent and a bit flat overall.
