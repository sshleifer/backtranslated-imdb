I've seen three other films that are worse than this, "Plan 9 from Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project". There are so many technical errors in this film that regardless of a decent storyline, the film is not over believable <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between the cars. The killer walks behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a murderer sneaks into a woman's apartment. He wants to peek at the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He turns on the stereo! If I heard my stereo suddenly get louder, I'd be worried. He kills women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cable could be thrown ten feet and stay connected. In addition, the apartment looked modern enough to have earth faults in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the most well-known commercial aircraft on the planet, so that part really surprised me. First the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it was not upstairs. I watched in complete astonishment when the pilot and co-pilot (Where was the flight engineer?) He drove straight up the spiral staircase and headed toward the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also amazed by the bullets. did not penetrate an aluminum serving trolley (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors, but penetrated the ceiling causing a fuel leak to escape through a small hole in the fuselage. There is? Watching three guys stretching a track for 100 yards in less than a week was also amazing. <br /> <br /> I did not check, was this a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.
