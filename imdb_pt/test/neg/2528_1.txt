Dude, are you serious? Did you read the book or watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's fake. Mark Furhman has been looking for a job since losing his job with the Los Angeles police. You remember him, do not you? He was the guy who lied at the booth and gave the OJ Simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. Well, he wrote three books ever since. I read all three. No, I'm not a fan, they've been given to me. However, I will tell you a similarity in all three, they grossly distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He blatantly exaggerates his stature in all three. In "Murder in Spokane," he pretends it had something to do with catching the killer, when he had nothing to do with it. In all books, he takes great pleasure in running over local law enforcement efforts. More or less how their efforts were carried out in the OJ trial. In this movie, there are many slow-motion scenes of girls staring at Furhman and coveting him. Many other shots put him in the limelight, when, in fact, I'm sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was "hey, is not it the racist that caused OJ to leave?" This was an interesting real-life story, but not a good movie about it.
