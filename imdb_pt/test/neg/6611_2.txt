With only a few days to go before the movie opens, the screenwriter steps away from the project and demands that his name be removed from the credits, you know that's not a good omen. <br /> <br /> The books, on which "Wiedzmin" is based, have great potential for a lively fantasy film ?? "Geralt de Rivia is a wizard, his only goal is to destroy the monsters that plague the world, but not everything that looks monstrous is evil, and everything is not fair?" But all this did not matter, when a Polish film crew, with a low budget and little or no appreciation for Sapkowski's work, decided to make a 13-part miniseries. The two-hour film is a byproduct of their actions, to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to point out in this case what makes people label this film as bad. Plot (incoherent, thanks to this with many stories), acting (below average, with the exception of Zebrowski), dialogues (bland), editing (choppy), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (bad), add to overall bad movie experience. Only the soundtrack, made by Grzegorz Ciechowski, brings the beauty of the world of "Wiedzmin", which was never brought to the screen. Even the grandiose flora and fauna of Poland (where part of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" were filmed), a crucial element in almost ANY fantasy film, were not harnessed throughout its potential. The more I think about this dead loss, the more I'm running out of words. At least, it is a comfort to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has directed only one film ever since (in addition, in Germany). <br /> <br /> For now, we get high-level fantasy stories and a fantastic computer RPG (released in 2007) referring to Wiedzmin's books. But I am sure that someday, justice will be done for the Wiedzmin saga, and we will be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon.
