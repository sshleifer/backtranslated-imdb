There were only two reasons for me to see this movie. First, Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were there (both are good actors) and I had nothing better to do. While watching the movie, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This movie is a complete waste of time. It's a standard ex-cop movie. The former copper is the best that ever existed but was fired. He keeps doing things on his own to the chagrin of his ex-friends and he saves the day. All the great surprises (NO !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
