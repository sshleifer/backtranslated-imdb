"The Apartment Complex" is a comedy full of kookie characters created instead of a true story telling a young psychology student (Lowe) who takes a job managing an apartment complex and engages in a murder mystery ... um, if you can call it. This cheap watch does not contain suspense, emotion, drama, action, precious funny moments, a hint of nudity and almost no romance. "The Complex of Apartments" is junk food passable and forgettable only for the most needy sofa potatoes.
