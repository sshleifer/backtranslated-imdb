Stripes, a comedy from the army training camp, starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is one of my favorites. Meatballs, a summer camp joke starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a complete waste of time. It takes considerable effort for four screenwriters to make a film (the word 'comedy' infers a job with premeditated joy) as silly, anemic and boring as that. <br /> <br /> Murray evidently came to the same conclusion during filming. , but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him, and his attempts to inject life into the proceedings only add to the embarrassment - the singing scene "That really does not matter" is excruciating. It does not help that the supporting cast is devoid of talent - the funniest thing about them is hair, but Meatballs was made in 1979. ("And featuring Chris Makepeace as Rudy" announces the initial credits.) No, not Chris Makepeace ?!). Fortunately, Reitman corrected his mistake two years later by Stripes. Murray's chatter is a lot funnier when he's playing with John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Stop it and watch it.
