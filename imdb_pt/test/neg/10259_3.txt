I just finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Lurking Fear," which was filmed in Louisiana. Out of a few changes (names, setting) this follows the tale point by point during the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own final "twist" that you could see coming from a mile away. Either way, it is a far better adaptation than the Lunar Fear of Full Moon. Too bad it's a terrible movie. Director David McCormick films the thing with all the talent of an industrial shorts. I swear I counted maybe two camera moves. The design of the creature is cheap (we're talking about buying masks here), but shot in a dark way (intentional or not) where they're a bit scary. The most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion, but McCormick does not exploit it either. File this one with good adaptation, poor execution.
