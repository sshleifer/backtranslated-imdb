I had high hopes for this until they changed the name to 'The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the worst movie name of all time, which was wrong with' The Shepherd '. This is an action movie of numbers that shows your hat in many classic films of Van Damme. There is a nice piece of action in a bar that reminded me of hard target and universal soldier, but directed with no intensity or talent that is a shame. There is a great phrase about "being drunk and carrying a rabbit" and some OK action scenes are reduced by the low price of it all. Often the dialogue does not match the mouths of the characters and the stunts fall dead a fraction of a second before they are even shot. The final fight is one of Van Damme's best fights except the director tries to go a little John Woo and fails too by introducing flashbacks that no one really cares just gets in the way of the action that is the whole point of a van Damme movie. <br /> <br /> It's not good, it's not bad, just average generic action.
