Ristamente horrible. One might think that all the big names involved in this movie at least make it believable but they do not - this is a stinky one. <br /> <br /> Characters run around without a good reason to know where they are going, or they go around grimacing when they should run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your highest brain functions at the door if you plan to watch this movie. Or join a bunch of your smarter friends and give it the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. That's what I was doing during the second half of this turkey. <br /> <br /> And do not confuse this with the excellent film "The Day of the Jackal," a 30-year-old thriller.
