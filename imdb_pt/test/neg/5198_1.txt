Yes, idiot is the word for this actress. I know that many have mentioned her beauty, but this viewer found her empty and boring to watch with her discolored hair, lip gloss and not so perfect body. Watch her pull away in those jeans, showing off a big ass. Her ass spreads beyond her shoulders. What does that tell you? As for the protagonist, played by the beautiful Mark Humphrey, he was perfectly chosen. A lovely. However, he and Lancaster did not match. She was out of place in front of this handsome guy. Good acting by Susan Glover as the sister. Angela Galuppo had a small role and was fine. But the director of the film, Philippe Gagnon, lost many scenes in Lancaster. After a while, you got tired of looking at her and watching her acting ability. And what a woman bitch she was. Spying on her husband, being nasty to him and just a spoiled brat. He was glad to see her hit with the dart gun. I thought it might be the end of it. But, unfortunately, the script tells us otherwise. After torturing me and seeing this loser again, I still had the same criticisms. Lancaster is boring to watch. This time around your hair, folks. His hair constantly on his face, constantly throwing back, became annoying. I question the writer, the reason Alexandra Komisaruk why a rich and handsome man like Philippe would bother with the likes of a silly like Allison. When there were so many smart, attractive, classy women to choose from. He takes this nothing. Is that the Rochester / Jane Eyre thing? Oh, well, it's all about taste, I guess. This Sarah Lancaster is not my cup of tea, people.
