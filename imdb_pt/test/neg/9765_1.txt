What an absolute disappointment. Forget this abysmal movie and get the TV series. What the hell were they doing, making the American president relatively sane? ALL politicians should have been clumsy buffoons (Peter Cook is good as British PM). It lacks the biting satire of the original, instead of the "less common denominator". 1 out of 10 if I'm being generous! This is, unfortunately, another example of a remake that leaves completely out of the original point, the difference being that both were written by the same people.
