It really is not worth a review, but I suppose it is my duty to warn you all - especially as there are some good comments about this Canadian bomb floating around ... Bad acting and a slow, utterly horribly boring move A tale in which three live boys turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at his club in the woods. In firs, the boys do well with the intruder and at one point even see it as a kind of model ... However, all that changes ... and you still do not care. You will recognize Chris Penn, whose greatest cinematic impact is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa, whose career peaked at "Casper". I was hoping for a '12 and Holding ',' The War ', or' Lie 'and all I got was a waste of time. This film strives to keep the audience's attention and never makes an impact or keeps a note of anything remotely interesting.
