The United States built the atomic bomb to show its superior military power and to close World War II. The film Fat Man and Little Boy is a picture of the efforts of American physicists to invent the technology needed to create the bomb, and the tension that existed between scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb, and even the acceptability of its bomb. creation. Scientists thought the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war from wasting the least possible life. Fist, they saw themselves as in a race with German scientists, who were trying to build nuclear weapons themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop the bomb project because they knew the Japanese did not have the technology to build a nuclear weapon and therefore did not pose a threat of massive loss of life. Those favoring the continuation of the Manhattan Project hoped the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the Japanese head of state to see its deployment on some small, deserted island. This enormous display of strength, they felt, would be enough to win the war - it would not be necessary to kill. The US military, led by General Leslie Groves, all the while expected to use the bomb as a real weapon to be launched against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Because of the persistence of Japanese soldiers on the small Japanese islands, the US decided to abandon the bomb in populous cities to end the war, first in Hiroshima and then in Nagasaki. The display of this enormous amount of force also served the rest of the world that the United States was the dominant military power, a message aimed especially at Russia, whose increasing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our prominent world position. Fat Man and Little Boy were a movie that had good intentions in mind, but confused them enough with the choice of actors, scripts and cinematography. One of the main points of the film was the struggle between the military vision of science to kill and the scientific vision of science for knowledge. The cornerstone of this conflict is the continuing divergence between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his work on the General's part, steep, with massive anger and radiating his dependence on the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never offers much resistance to General's demands, always looking rather weak, deflated, and phlegmatic in his audiences. John Cusack features an incredibly unsympathetic character in a role as flat as I've ever seen - it looks like he's just reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to be suffering from the same disease. None of the characters is aided by the script, which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way he tries to explain scientific concepts in a non-scientific way, offers the most unrealistic relationship between Mr. Cusack and Ms. Dern imaginable, does not even give us the cheap The thrill of watching the army drop nuclear bombs in Japan, and depends a lot on a technique that is evil at any time, even when explaining the characters' innermost thoughts, or for the narration of something that can not be shown in the film. , but is used here to read some absolutely mundane Cusack diary selections. The director of photography offers us several pictures of the sinister shadow of the two bombs, which can be impressive if it did not appear to be cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, the false atomic fire really seems false - and why use it when stock the images in the hand are so genuinely striking and realistic - and the diffused brown tone does not seem to be thematically appropriate. Besides, it's not a bad movie.
