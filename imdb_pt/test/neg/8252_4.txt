What about the mathematical geniuses that make critics flow? A BEAUTIFUL MIND did not live up to much in my opinion (THE BIBLE OF THE RING was awarded the Oscar that year), while GOOD WILL HUNT had several awards handed down on her unworthily. <br /> <br /> First is the script. When I went to film school, they told me that GOOD WILL HUNTING is a good example of how not to start a script and the tutor was right. This movie does not have any kind of opening hook and for the most part is very slow. If you wrote an unsolicited script like this, the script reader would have given it up on page 15. <br /> <br /> Structure aside the idea of ​​a member of the American lower class being some kind of intellectual god does not touch truth. Ask yourself: If he's the smart character in the movie, how did he go through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Not a single teacher of your childhood noticed your gift? Highly improbable, as is the fact that he has read much in mind, expanding the literature. And if Will is so smart, how come he's so forgetful of what happens to good-looking young boys in American prisons? <br /> <br /> But it's the cast that has left much of the film down. Do you want some actors to act as tough members of the Irish gang? Let's get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, which is like making Russell Crowe play a pacifist or Charles Bronson, who plays a liberal, do good. I could not convince myself with the dirty mouth of Damon and Affleck as they babbled about beating people and could not help thinking that although they had written the script, the parts should have been given to different actors, after all Billy Bob Thornton scripts written for films that he has not been cast and the same criteria should have been applied here. <br /> <br /> There are some positives to the film. Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard, who is simply one of the greatest actors in the character to step outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is a movement A piece dialogue in the park as the character Williams explains to Will what he saw in life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are less positives than negatives for this movie and I have to agree with people who said that GOOD WILL is boring and unconvincing
