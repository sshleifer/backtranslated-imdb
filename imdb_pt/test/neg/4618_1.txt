** It could be considered some light spoilers, but no more than in anyone's assessment of this movie. ** I knew that nothing could live up to the absolute brilliance of the original "Carrie". which was more of a film about social criticism than about putting fire in the gym. Carrie White was summarized "victim," and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel. Who conceived the character "Rachel" for "The Rage" must have completely lost the subtleties of "Carrie" For the audience to genuinely share the rage of the victim, he / she must be a sympathetic character - a true pariah who is more a victim of circumstances than of his own vices. Rachel is totally unpleasant enough to convey any kind of emotional depth and connection to Sissy Spacek's "Carrie." And she looks and acts as if she should be standing next to the 'popular and attractive brigade' that she ends up burning. She, like the rest of them, has a soul that is as corrupt as Carrie was completely innocent. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. There is no satisfaction in seeing the beautiful children - not even the "House of Improvement" kid - taken from the climactic scene of the film. And it's so unnecessarily bloody! There was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym! <br /> <br /> And there is one person in particular that this movie should NOT have had the audacity to kill ... but I will not say who it is. If you saw the original "Carrie", it's the kind of character that dies unfairly. At least they created the connection with Carrie properly; is explained as it should have been. But that, and the arm tattoo, which was done very well, is just the only thing this movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> Another horrible "Scream" type immitation, and that harms the reputation. of one of the most attractive films of all time. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10. I was not expecting much, but I was still terribly disappointed. An unsympathetic character, a series of annoying pop culture references for no good reason, and a final scene that pales in comparison to Carrie's headstone clash.
