This was the worst movie that my wife and I have ever seen. The only awards are that we do not pay to see in the movies how we rent it on video store DVD. Simply - no storyline worthy of mention (I only watched 5 minutes ago and I've forgotten), annoying characters misinterpreted by two-bit actors and if this was a comedy I'm still waiting to laugh. In fact, the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was really awful. <br /> <br /> Put simply, this movie was completely pathetic and I warned others not to waste their movie. Time. A farce of the name National Lampoon, Rating 0/10.
