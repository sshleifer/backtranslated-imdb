I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was horrible; was useless and simply stupid. the supposed plot was about a future groom too involved in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in a no less tuxedo) and connects with a variety of freaks. <br /> <br /> We saw this with a load of people buses en route to Atlantic City and everyone agreed. which was a terrible movie. He was trying to be deep, but he was not; was stupid and offensive. If I had not been on a bus I would have left the movie. Anyone thinking of watching the movie or renting or buying the video was advised in advance.
