Bought this movie for a dollar and realized it could never go wrong, my big mistake was watching it. He enjoyed the performance of Ice-T and rap that gave much class to this movie about Los Angeles and the world of pimps. There is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a training ring and who has a career but because of mental problems since childhood and the death of this other boxer he retires. He is hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls who work for him in his craft and ensure that they are not beaten. This boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all sorts of problems begin. This is fun and then it becomes a great comedy of laughter.
