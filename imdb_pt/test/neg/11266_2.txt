I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his heyday in the 80s as a young and talented actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the internet-related plot and to see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I do not remember seeing him in any movie since the 80's. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: what a big disappointment. I give a few low budget movies a chance, but this started to be bad. In the first 15 minutes of the movie, this indescribable woman is talking to an Asian guy in a chat room. They basically stimulate themselves for their own chat, so she insists on finding the participant in person. She knows him, has sex, ties him up and then kills him in cold blood. The plot then deteriorates further. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin and fragile and the acting is very hard. Do not bother renting it, let alone buying it, even if it's in the $ 1 DVD box. I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am truly amazed that any of the previous reviewers here gave this movie a poor rating.
