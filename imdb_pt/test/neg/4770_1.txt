My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: 1. Plants that eat people have been made hundreds of times. It has been used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It has been used in many low budget movies of the 50s, along with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And this leads to another level of cheese with plants that speak. I do not know anyone who has left but I know many people who absolutely started laughing hysterically during parts of this movie. I was one of them. Does not the horror genre deserve something a little better than this lousy pile of crap? <br /> <br /> 2. The characters could easily have been copied / pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or any other movie with children gluing randomly. Is it still called "characterization" when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clich√©s that hundreds of characters had before? Did you ever wish that a movie had characters that were not just forgotten pieces of leg meat? <br /> <br /> 3. This was not bloody. A guy cuts off his skin. Oh my! (No.) A guy's legs are broken. Oh my! Sigh! (No.) I've shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said, "I've seen PG movies worse than that! So why was it rated R? <br /> <br /> 4. Here is the only storyline that the movie / book has: collage kids drink, have sex, get naked, pee, bleed, and end up dying. This is possibly the most typical example of a cheap and thoughtless horror film, but do people call it "mature"? What . . .? <br /> <br /> 5. I do not think I've ever seen anything less original than I've seen A Beautiful Mind. <br /> <br /> You never sat there and wished that the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre, would do something. . . quite diverse? Something truly original? <br /> <br /> I just wanted more horror movies to have real horror, not just cheap glue parties put on film with a few fake blood spills thrown around. <br /> <br /> 1/10
