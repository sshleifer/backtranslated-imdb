If you and your friends find both humor and fun as horrible performances, jokes, props and movies like me and my friends, you need to rent it. <br /> <br /> Simply reading the slogan and seeing how funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, hilarious great content through out. It is a tale of some of the kids who defy all laws of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern big screen TV to a world of dinosaurs that eventually become their friends. Not to mention a hilarious and serious scene in which the T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the children. Yes ... <br /> <br /> Should be in the comedy section, but you will find it with children's films if you find it at all. So call your friends, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You'll be quoting the ridiculously horrible linings in this movie for weeks. "What's with all the fuss ?!"
