Leatherheads is a suitable title, however, a leather wristband would be more useful for self-flagellating yourself after buying a ticket to watch this noxious attempt at entertainment. Clooney's attempt at self-deprecating humor comes up against a thud, since his behavior implies that he is anything but. Perhaps with another actor playing the role of Clooney, the film may be slightly palatable. I'm sorry, George, I doubt any Oscar nominations will happen this time. George Clooney is definitely a fish out of the water when it comes to comedy (unless you're referencing his policy). Anyway, only the most ardent of Clooney fans will enjoy watching Leatherheads, all the others will yearn for the days of the silent image.
