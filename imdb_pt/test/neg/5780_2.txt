Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and attractive woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies I've seen her, she looks exactly the same character to me. Whether in DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDEN DER LIEBE and now WO IST FRED! She always is (jokes?) The young woman with a good heart, who is a little naive and does not know how to deal with things that happen to her. She has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions with which she works with abundance. I personally find it difficult to believe that she could play a mysterious and slightly unpleasant character because she simply is not here. So she is typecast as the good girl next door, which she is, but again, she does not want snuff when it comes to acting. Til Schweiger: Same thing! The movie: completely stupid. As it was an American movie, it would have been a great role for Adam Sandler, which I do not like either. I was not offended by the fact that this is a film with people with disabilities, I just thought the jokes that resulted from it were not funny at all. I laughed two or three times, but when I was halfway through, I was bored and upset and wanted this movie to end.
