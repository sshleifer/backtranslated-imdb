This movie began with some promise: great cast, good-looking, but then collapsed. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you can not tell if it's a serious movie or a comedy. One minute they are talking about how there is no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene with funny songs and funny jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are pretty bad, especially from Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also gets some phrases like "When I get married, it's about love." Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's boring. There is enough action, insufficient humor, plot is not enough, there is not much really. Just a lot of cliches and extravagant moments. <br /> <br /> In addition, a movie with "Dragon" in the title should contain far more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that have appeared in this movie. The SciFi channel can not display * any * good movie?
