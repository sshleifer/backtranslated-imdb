The director infuses this film with false depth, repeating a trick throughout the film. EVERY single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be. You could easily cut out 1.5 hours of that movie agonizingly long for 2.5 hours without eliminating: a word of dialogue, an image, an event or a bit of movement. <br /> <br /> This was one of the most gratuitous film wastes I've ever seen. Other users have called it pretentious, which is a euphemism. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual garbage designed to be anti-Hollywood, so that the jurors of Cannes can affirm their independence of Oscar. The critic of the IMDb states, "Unlike Hollywood movies - which usually force the public into overdrive - this forces the public to slow down and look at some of the tiniest, mundane features of life in great detail." You would have to be catatonic to face some of these images for so long and move slowly in these characters. This is not real life unless you are heavily medicated. I finally felt that Schott's portrait was a sad excuse for Peter Sellers' masterful "Chauncy Gardner." He uses the same facial expressions and postures. It's even gardens! In many respects, there are parallels between these two films. The main difference is that "Being There" goes on and does not depend on shock and tricks to create a meaningful experience while questioning several things we take for granted in life.
