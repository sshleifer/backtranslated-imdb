I have no further respect for IMDb ratings. I think many Mormons invaded the site and voted for it. This is not an art film, it's Mormon propaganda. Nothing wrong with that, but the outline of the plot and the way it is described is totally misleading. If you are a Christian Christian or a Mormon, watch this movie, you will love it and think it is truly amazing. For anyone else, do not bother, the story is so artificial, random things happen that really do not follow consistently. This guy tries to commit suicide because he sleeps with his neighbor. Are you kidding me? What a pussy! Anyway, this is a horrible movie.
