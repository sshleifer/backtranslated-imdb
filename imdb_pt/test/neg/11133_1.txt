Whoa, this is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen! The packaging of the film is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it last weekend, and we just kept watching it in the hope that it would get better ... that did not happen ... <br /> <br /> Image quality is bad; it looks like it was filmed on video and transferred to film. The lighting is not great, which makes it difficult to read the facial expressions of the actors. The acting itself was tacky, but I think it's acceptable for "one more" teen horror film. The sound was a huge problem: sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is not clear and / or muffled. <br /> <br /> He has no real merit; Trying to walk in the coattails of "Sleepy Hollow". Do not bother with that.
