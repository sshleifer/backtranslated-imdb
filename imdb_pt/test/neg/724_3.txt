This is one of Lane Slate's four seventies films about sensationalist murders in small towns. They feature friendly TV personalities such as police chiefs and quirky characters as city goers, including mild love interests. The others are: they only kill their masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977). <br /> <br /> Alda's is close to Vermont ("Mount Angel" next to "Horse Creek"); the others in California, Garner is on the waterfront ("Eden Landing") and Griffith in the mountains ("Jasper Lake"). Everyone tries to capture the feel of a small town, move in a relaxed pace between comfortable characters and tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. At that level, they are a little fun (they were often re-run suggests that they have some appeal). But they suffer from stories and fine dialogues, slow pacing, bland configurations, flat or exaggerated characters, and forced (often juvenile or coarse) attempts of color or humor. <br /> <br /> Alda and Garner are the most serious about history, characters, rhythm and tone. They have the best supporting casts, although the Alda is best worn; Griffith is pale in comparison. Alda has the best director. <br /> <br /> "Shocking" has some surprise and drama. The killer method is inventive. The tone is more uniform and the dialogue more natural than Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer, like the others, from big city transplants stuck in the city or exaggerated local characters, both of whom appear as inventors of a Hollywood scriptwriter, not so genuine (the worst offender is the bogeyman of Griffith movies), grouchy idiot "Whit" who we are told has tried to hitch a jeep and run away with a trailer serving as a temporary bank agency, dragged the dock to the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them and filled in $ 11 on the receipt of "Spiro T. Babylis" only to be discovered by the cashier. Mercifully absent is the cumbersome and repetitive style dialogue of the Griffith films ("Are you going to have lunch?" "I'm going to take the boat." "Are you going to take the boat for lunch?" "I'm not going to have lunch." " "There's no fish in this lake Why are you fishing here?" "It's illegal in Horse Mountain." "It's posted here as well, you're breaking the law." "Some law. lake. "" Then why are you fishing here? "" I told you, it's illegal at Horse Mountain. "" Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. "" Okay, Lloyd ... " Call me Lloyd, that's my name, my name is Lloyd. ") <br /> <br /> But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small police chief certainly not a law-abiding man by a rival city. Slate has the character admit this, when he arrives late to the scene of an obvious lane as a result of a rec accidental cognition. Instead of detecting or investigating, Barnes blindly attacks emotional negation. His secretary Lasser gives him an important clue ("Why did not I think about it," he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, another plot device, leads to another clue of the present. Worse, Barnes is more interested in ridiculing the military-style county police helmets sent to help him (the deadly game also suggests The Blackboard has something against the military) than to lead them or their own men effectively. It allows for late murder by incompetently protecting a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer who escapes from a crime scene without drawing his gun or trying to take control. Again, he is ineffective, and almost dead, in the climactic scenario, which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected, by accident. The erratic Northeast accent, which Alda affects, does not help to believe. <br /> <br /> There are holes in the plot. Why would the killer strike after all these years? And to commit the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to the later ones - a couple, a shopkeeper in his shop during business hours, a fully dressed deputy sitting in his office and, incredibly, his dog! <br /> <br /> Alda's film also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes first appears in the bed of a motel clerk. He then treats her rudely every moment and insults and tries to avoid her children. That, and talk about the medical, with a gross and stingy standard (Garner's film was described as "sloppy", including a scene where he and a police officer laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car crashes into the road had part of her anatomy bitten by a guy in the car with her, Griffith's characteristic and a surrogate Ropers routine, in which the woman embarrassingly tries to persuade the man to enter the "supply closet"; discussing the death of a young woman's car accident ("Did you take her out?" "I took her once"), a reference to "Bernice" as "swollen in places" and "stick a pin" and "hate" and dismiss Maude's secretary because she was "too hairy," a description of the doctor's practice as "two stirrup tables and a flashlight," a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan proposes Griffith, offering "a few cultivated at home ", and an insulting subplot in which a woman, chased by a vice play like a clown, seems to "sleep around". <br /> <br /> Finally, Alda's film has a dark, discolored, colorless, lifeless appearance. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had some spirit, scenery and nice music; Griffith left for the mountainside, the lake, and even the big city. You feel more like review Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.
