The problem with this film, like so many other films that fail, is the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so out of focus that it goes on all sides. What's the story here? OK, it's a biopic, but I think everyone will agree that there's no way a whole life can be condensed into 100 minutes or so. Some selection and editing is required, but this script simply did not select or edit enough. This did not lead Hoffman's life to one or two definable crucial moments or themes with which the public could identify and through them to "get" the larger picture of every man. <br /> <br /> The movie wanders from being a straightforward 'genius upset' biographical film, to semi-docu / mocu-mentary (using fake new outlets to match archive images), sub for life story film True Life Under the stories of the week (the whole I'm talking about a son who does not know that I'm his father "shtick", for the movie conspiracy political theory etc. etc. He simply never makes up his mind what he wants to be, and the indifferent Citizen Kane as narrative structure (reporter) interviewing people of Hoffman's past) is soon abandoned, which leaves the film even more unstructured and flaccid than it begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to history and could very well have been cut to make room for something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio hits the window shouting "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman!" ("I'm acting! I'm acting! I'm acting!") Could easily have been cut. All that happens is that the psychiatrist says, "You have bipolar disorder, here's some lithium," and the two women in your life say, "We could see you on weekends more often." and bang! That's it. There are no more mental health problems. It's a ridiculously useless tokenistic scene that could easily, and should, have been dumped before it was fired. The scene where everyone gets stoned and watch Vietnam news footage and Hoffman calling God? Meaningless. It tells us nothing about anything. However, when it comes to a crucial moment like the failure of drugs, the cinema is so rushed that the situation only leaves the left field and does not make sense to the public. Suddenly he's dealing with heroin? Where did that come from? Because? What's going on here? <br /> <br /> I, being a middle-aged lefty, think I'm well within the target audience for this movie, but I even got tired of the picture of 'The Man', 'The Pigs',' The Fuzz ' etc. like brutal, proper, irrational and hateful hippies. It may have been like this in sixties America, I do not know, I was not there, but in cinematographic terms it was a cheap and awkward polemics. <br /> <br /> Said all that Vincent D'Onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the youngest Hoffman and I could watch Janeane Garofalo at anything, even reading a bus schedule, though she was not right for this part.
