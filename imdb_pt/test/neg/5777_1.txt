A group of rowdy teenagers goes to an old mining town hoping to find gold nuggets. The only problem with the hair-brain scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner to whom gold belongs does not want to be so easily separated from his treasure, and thus begins to dispatch the intruders accordingly. <br /> <br /> Literally clich√©-budding dialogue, horrible acting, some insanely terrible 'southern dialect' and an imperceptible killer that resembles Jeepers Creepers (without the predilection of boys mentioned above naturally) combine to make this stink unassisted. Even the cult legend, actress Karen Black, in a small role, can not save this freak. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (dimly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> Where I saw: TMCX
