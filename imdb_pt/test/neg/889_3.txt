I do not know why producers needed to negotiate the name of a movie franchise a little bit of success because the title suggests it's a continuation of the first three films - which it is not. Although Marques Houston appeared on "HP3," he played a totally different character (he was eight years older) in this movie. Okay ... so Reid and Martin were not the most talented and could not carry a movie by themselves ... but negotiating on the HP franchise seems to me that it could have made some sort of (albeit minor) reference to the previous films. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see him was "cheated" - thinking they were seeing a sequel - not a totally different movie with a household name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley is not funny, and can not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the previous films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual deviation ... I have to give a LITTLE DOWN !! Just naming the movie "Down to the Last Minute" would have been OK. In addition, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three films) were not involved in the production of this film.
