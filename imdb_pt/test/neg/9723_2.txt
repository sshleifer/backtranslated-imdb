Most of the reviews in this movie have been pretty accurate. It's an hour and a half waste of time, following a lot of pretty girls complaining and crying about life. There are about twenty minutes of magic and absolutely no scary or exciting time. Our actress is treated like butt pieces and seems perfectly happy with her position. The main characters, these children of ipsmith, are walking with ad boys for any pop culture clothing store. You can not relate to them, hell you can barely understand them. The story steps on its own and when it finally reaches the final battle, it is no more than a volleyball match that does not last long enough to make up for this destroyed O.C.
