Nickelodeon came down from the bathroom. They have kids saying things like "Oh my God!" and "We're screwed" <br /> <br /> This program promotes hate for people who are not beautiful or are not in the crowd. Sexual promiscuity is said to be good, for having girls drooling over shirtless boys. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. The main characters basically avoid someone out of the ordinary. Carly's friend Sam, who may be a lesbian, knocks on the mouth of someone who crosses her path, who says it's okay to be a b ** ch. This show has so much negativity that nobody should watch it! I give a 0 out of 10 !!!
