I tried to watch this adaptation, but it was so horrible that I could not torture myself like that. The performances were quite insignificant, with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was right at the top in a role that should be treated with some subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw many adaptations, and this is by far the worst I have ever seen. I have to ask why on earth someone made this movie. Shakespeare can, and has been, wonderfully adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you need to watch this movie, can I suggest a drink game? Have a drink every time they leave the book of the original idea and two drinks every time Fonda excels. You must be pretty drunk in a very short time.
