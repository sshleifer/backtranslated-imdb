I'm sorry for this. But if you have seen this "epic", you will obviously know of the absolute disrespect for the current text of the Bible. Now, I'm not exactly the next in line for holiness, but I know the basics. And the basics was that. God wanted to cleanse everyone from the face of the earth because he believed they were corrupted to the point of no return. He chose Noah, the brute diamond and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted manners. Noah builds an ark as instructed by God to house him, his family and two of each creature as he floods the rest of the planet. These are the basics. In this movie, you have other people roaming the seas, such as hawkers and pirates. But I thought ALL were eliminated. I think NBC executives never went to church. There are other inaccuracies, I was told, but being the average Joe, I have no idea what they are. Excuse. Back in the movie, it was inaccurate, as said before, the stunk action, but some of the effects were good, I'll give you this. But as a whole, I've seen a better and tastier version of the story made as a little scene in The Simpsons. God help NBC executives on the day of judgment. 3/10
