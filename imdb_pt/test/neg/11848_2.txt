Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park was heartbroken. As usual, the plot is thin, of 1-foot-tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave traces larger than they are, the inexplicable science that uses lasers to keep dinosaurs under control and trucks of birds that have loose chickens in cages big enough for Dogs (I've seen chicken trucks they're all in shoebox-sized cages). And all this in the first 15 minutes of a movie disaster. All male actors are imbeciles (thinking a bear may be loose in the desert, constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors seem to have come out of a modeling session for Fredrick's Hollywood. The raptor itself is the worst thing since the Hobgoblins (of the film of the same name), it seems that they had a version of hand puppets and a plastic model for the "movement" shots. If you want a good movie to sit and mess up the MST3K style, this is gold. If you want to do competent filmmaking and good acting ... do not watch a Roger Corman movie. Acting gets a 4 to 10, some of the players at this stage have tried. The story gets 2 out of 10, it looks like a drunk storytelling session went wrong. Special effects gets a 2 out of 10, I saw worse, but not many.
