This movie was a mess that I actually reimbursed my friends I dragged to see it. The only reason I went to see this was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the set. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie was meant to be overdone, but the approach was so heavy and self-reflexive it got really flat. Judd Nelson stars as an obsequious junkyard who is a side comedian. His life is a hell and aggravated by his obnoxious and arrogant companion Bill Paxton (which I feel ashamed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). A weird accident alters Nelson's career and the chaos ensues. Attempts of humor were cheesy, predictable, and often basic and tasteless. Wayne Newton in casting as a talent agent is a novelty, but he does not add anything - comedically or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes by like a lead balloon. At least you could laugh at AT Plan 9 From Outer Space. This just makes you wonder whoever thought this was a good enough idea to fund and film. One of the worst bombs you've ever witnessed.
