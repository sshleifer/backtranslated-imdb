Someone called this movie "fable horror," and I think that fits in pretty well. That is the concept, at least. A group of teenagers, each with their own addiction, catch the eye of a cheerleader. He decides to teach the teenagers a lesson by making them part of the freak show. A cool idea, but it could have been better executed. The fate of some teenagers is pushed into their face as well, of course, while other characters might have been more filled. Also, the ending was a serious disappointment. No resolution or great twist or anything. <br /> <br /> But like a low budget horror movie, it's a lot of fun to watch. If you like cheesy spookfests, you should give a laugh by watching this one. I think one of your faults is ... that takes itself very seriously. It's a silly movie, and if it was a little more self-conscious when it comes to that, I think it would have been better. But at least there are enough carnivalesque themes and make-up movie monsters to keep you watching.
