The main character is an irresponsible study of how to feast a feast. She loses it in her hat, acts pathetically, is schizophrenic and leaves me wondering why on Earth she does not understand why these "friends" of her have not called her for three years. (Get a clue, sister - you're a juvenile mess!) I could not stand her or her friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the whole movie even more unbearable, someone went out of the way to put the world's most hideous collection of crochet hats and knitwear in existence for eternity (this alone justifies someone being paroled for a decade! ) <br /> <br /> The acting was not horrible, but also not really believable, and in the end the only thing that I cared for was the two hours I will never go back. Do not waste your time - go after an appointment with the dentist!
