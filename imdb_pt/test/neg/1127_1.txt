To quote Clark Griswold (on the original Christmas vacation): "Worse, how could things get worse?" Take a look here, Ellen, we're on the brink of hell. " Little Chevy Chase knew he was describing the "sequel" of one of his best movies. Christmas Holiday II sets a new record (or maybe it should be LOW) on bad movies. My wife bought this DVD thinking it would really be a sequel to the original, but we were severely disappointed. This movie is LAME. It bears no resemblance to the original, it is an absolute waste of films and an embarrassment to the good actors who have had the misfortune to be part of it. He must have set a record on IMDb for the bad reviews. I really think we have a good case for winning a class action to get the money that we consumers waste on that movie.
