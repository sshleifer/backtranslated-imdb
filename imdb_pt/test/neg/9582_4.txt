I can not believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. I'm a million miles away from being an expert and I'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the basic knowledge gained from reading Into Thin Air and Everest Beyond The Limit and a few other Everest documentaries meant that this film became increasingly ridiculous as it went on. There are good climbing scenes in the beginning; and when the billionaire mission leader asks at the beginning of the movie "How much do you have over 8,000 feet of experience?" I was encouraged to expect this to be a brave and accurate odyssey between men and women. Instead, you have a lot of climbers climbing a mountain without acclimatization; climbing with glasses outside in full sun, and they are almost never out of breath performing miraculous feats of resistance. Just near the summit is suggested a little fatigue, to dramatically accentuate the physical prowess of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost like a belated reflection. If you are not aware of mountaineering, take a look: be prepared for some heroes cliches (though no more cliché than a hundred other passable films), and a cliché result. I have developed a minor fascination with high mountains and was eager to watch K2; but beyond some incredibly beautiful scenery, it was a disappointment because it was so far from reality. I can imagine some experts being employed in the production of this film but then being conveniently ignored in the quest for the heroic and sadly fantastic plot. Plus, you'd sound like an idiot if you said "welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
