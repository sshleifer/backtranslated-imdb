I love low budget movies. Including those that are intentionally or unintentionally funny, false blood excess, violence etc. <br /> <br /> This, however, is beyond stupid. Once you see the ending, you'll say, what the heck was the point of all killing scenes with no one around (except in a couple) to witness them. And how did the ending actually happen? The whole story away for those idiots enough to actually watch this) Grandma is like a psychic Jason. First she is out of the window with a body and 15 seconds later she is in the room of knitting. The whole thing is a setup for a newcomer. They take graphic scenes, the knitting needles in the eyes, that only Chris Angel Mind Freak could do. And again, the end was pre-posterior. 56 min waste of time. I saw one of the directors of other movies and it was almost so bad. Give me 20 grand and I could do better. That really deserves a big fat one.
