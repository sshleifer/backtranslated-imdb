The use of "astral projection" (errant soul), to exist outside the body, with the result inflicting a horrible death (crushing the interior of victims that lead to broken spine and breaking organs) in those close to that with such ability, is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, giving Karen Black (as Janus) another "unique" character to play with a woman who influences a commercial director, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert) tired of his waning marriage and monotonous career. In fact, she is dying and needs her body, her spirit potentially harmful to her wife and child (her son has a "special friend" who talks about things, even poisoning himself at one point). A detective, Kauffman (John Novak) investigating the unusual homicides on the dead by the benevolent spirit, binds Paulo to the deaths and through him discovers Janus. Soon both realize that Janus must be stopped or she will simply move to another human host. What Paul does not know is that his new secretary is Janus's lover, both of whom were actually older intellectuals in his astral projection documentary called WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) certainly creates a strange atmosphere with this film that contains a rather bizarre premise. It seems that Paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the form of a "blue man", manipulating the child into a disorderly demeanor. Black, despite the star treatment, is rarely thrown close by taking advantage of her face, which can produce the kind of evil malevolent your character deserves. Instead, she is shot from a distance, her voice nicknamed, and she never sets up with the very threat that is a missed opportunity, in my opinion. For some reason, despite the intriguing (... if eccentric) idea of ​​astral projection causing a spirit to kill people from within, the movie simply never takes off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (..and sound), although sometimes moody and effective, is often quite obscure. Rhythm is also a problem as history progresses. The cast is pretty flaccid, especially Rekert in the lead, his erratic performance at best. It does not help that there are few characters (except Paul's wife) that we could care less about, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not exactly the loveliest person in the world ... he can be very difficult and temperamental , his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior. Black should have been a more prominent figure in the film, but remains mostly in the background, spoken in dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely does she have a chance to amuse herself with her histrionics, which is a shame.
