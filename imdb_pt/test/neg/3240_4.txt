So many bad reviewers, it made me wonder, what are people thinking while watching a simple move made by a really bad director ??? Did you all expect a flawless super-hit movie? No way, you can already see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starrer movies ... All his previous work where multi-starrers, but no one was flawless. Take the first Jaani Dushman, for example, so many glitches, but still good fun. Anyway joining the film, the film Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake, which can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) who takes revenge on the suicide of his lover (Manisha Koirala) in the people who caused it . It's very good, with a large cast of stars. But I think it could have been so much better. For example, take the script, I can not say that it is perfect. For example, take the ages: <br /> <br /> Make 40-48 year old still studying at university ?? <br /> <br /> There are many more, I will not list more, but there are more than ten. A solid 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> **.
