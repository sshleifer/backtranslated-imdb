I went to see this movie in the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least slightly fun. The only thing I liked was when Robin Williams hit the car at the bottom of the hill and at the end when he seems to be dead. Glenn Close was unpleasant and obviously did not seem old enough to be Garp's mother. A mother like Garp would have her children taken by the Department of Children and Families. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams and his appearance of benign kindness are too sweet for me. He has two roles that he can play: funny or sad person, tragic, good victim. See the Fisher King, Good Morning Vietnam, and all his so-called "dramatic" roles. It's always the same performance. Put them all together in one long miniseries. Glenn Close is always a cold fish. Remember the Fatal Attraction? Would you have an affair with her, even on her worst day, and if you were single? Did you feel any spark between her and Michael Douglas? Have you seen Glenn Close warm up any screen? John Lithgow had the only interesting role. This was the day he used to play serial killers and thugs, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. Garp is made for all those people who like to watch movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it's beautiful and deep.
