This movie has changed very slowly for my taste. The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on the screen. Each character was fully developed within the scene of its first appearance, then had to endure the feeling that each character was stepping on the water the rest of the way. That is, each character struggled awkwardly in their interpersonal relationship. relationships with others in the film, which I discovered to be a form of emotional and social retardation. I suppose this has artistic merit, given the irony that the story revolves around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by friends and family of above-average intelligence. The acting, however, was well done without exception. I agree with other reviewers that cinematography was beautiful. In summary, I think the film has strong artistic merit because of cting and cinematography, but fails on an emotional level due to described.
