AfterLife is about a reasonably arrogant and reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself caring for his sister who has Down's Syndrome. He can not be bothered with her, and basically just wants to get her out of his hands; he has better things to do. At one point he thinks he has to take her, by car (she does not like to fly) across the country. <br /> <br /> If this sounds familiar to you, it's probably because you've seen `Rainman, 'a film far superior to your copycat,' AfterLife '. Copying the basic premise (pricking, cutting some characters and even scenes as well) is not the fundamental problem of the film. The fundamental problem is that I do not care about these characters. <br /> <br /> Brother Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a bit of a womanizer. He has a girlfriend who walks in and out of the story and learns to like the sister of Down Syndrome (again, this is taken from "Rainman"). He is a journalist, trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal. When he ends up taking care of Roberta, his sister, he does not have much time for her, and sometimes leaves her alone for too long. When she walks away, he gets even angrier with her. Am I ruining everything by saying that he becomes a kinder and more loving person at the end of the movie? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not determined to be 'normal'; she is "normal" and wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Down Syndrome, and her performance is easily the best thing about the movie; why the writer did not explore his character anymore? Well, probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of history. When we certainly know the story, the filmmakers did not see the problem they were creating? <br /> <br /> For a movie about a dying mother and her disabled daughter (the father is absent; I think he's dead, but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little impact the movie has on the emotions of the viewer. The scenes are performed in such a standardized and bland way, with a standard and predictable dialogue, that I saw myself roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in the movies, but it only works if you care about the characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I really do not think there's much to worry about. 'Rain Man' has an emotional climax, but it thrilled me because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climax, this movie smells bad. There is sequence at the end of the movie that begins as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory; an unpardonably cruel trick is thrown into the audience. The sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the viewer's intelligence. The audience is not dumb and knows when the movie is cheating. What a cheap shot. <br /> <br /> There is not a scene in this movie that has the impact it should. There are some sequences that are funny, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, I can practically see the script in front of me, moving in a predictable and uninteresting way, never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart. There are those fake arguments that are reserved especially for movies, where the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Why are supposedly "unrealistic" movies not realizing that in real life, anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can not express their emotions, and can say things that do not make sense or can not say anything at all? All the actors in this movie deserve better material. This movie is not based on facts, but I think a documentary about a family with a Down Syndrome member would be much more interesting. That way, we could have had truth and emotion. For some reason, the characters in this movie think that an emotion involves just saying something out loud and making a proper facial expression. <br /> <br /> (of 5)
