This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that the jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, they're not funny and cliches either. In the first episode, Father said something like, 'I wish women would not go out and get jobs and have the same rights as blah blah blah men'. Does it really help attitudes huh? So he was mocking his son saying that he was strange. Which father says your son is strange? So overall, this show is boring, not original, offencive, clich√© and, above all, NOT FUNNY. Yes, the American father is offense. But this also makes you laugh and is obviously taking the micky. That's the difference.
