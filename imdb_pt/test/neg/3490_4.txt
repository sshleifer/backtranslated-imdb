I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. I remember that he terrified me and stayed with me all those years. I spent a few years trying to find it online ... I can not remember the title, just the plot. After researching and researching, I came across a VHS that was being sold on E-Bay. I was excited and when it finally came, I stuck it in the VCR and could not help but feel a bit nostalgic. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. This was not the movie I remember watching as a kid. It was annoying at times and I found Beryl Reid's incessant annoyance extremely irritating. Both Reid and Flora Robson's performances were good overall, but the film was not scary. I think any movie worth seeing to form your own opinion, but sometimes, well ......
