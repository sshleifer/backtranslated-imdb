Sorry for any spoilers this may contain. But if you want to read it anyway: I really wonder why so many people are so famous with Kevin Williamson. Let's take a quick look at your work as a screenwriter, right? There are Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next), which I find very funny, but very overrated. In addition, by turning Scream into a franchise, he ceased to become a parody of horror films and simply became another. So, I know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. He co-wrote Halloween: H20, but even he had the good sense not to take credit for what he did with this monstrosity. Then comes the College, which I can only say was awful. (Lots of fun to make fun of, though). Do not even make me get into the ridiculous, soap-operative Dawson's Creek, I could tell how bad this is for hours. Then we came to teach Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are tons of small implausibilities in this. For example, in most high schools I know, the speaker is not the only one who can go to college! This idea that Katie Holmes's character would never go anywhere unless she was a class member was absurd. You've never heard of financial assistance, damn it! Also, I do not think you get kicked out of high school or do not go into college because of cheating on a test. There are a lot of others, but I will jump into the big now. The ending really bothered me: they committed a crime, but that's okay because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers I could kidnap based on this logic? I'm sure the police never made any statement to find out the whole story. That certainly would not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added a nice touch to a character who (as a previous commenter noted) had no reason for anything she did. And has anyone else noticed that Katie Holmes absolutely can not act? His self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail." "Blah blah blah." Her last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I do not regret losing $ 8.25 in this disaster is because she was beaten up a bit. No, wait, I regret losing the money: it was not real, and it survived. Mr. Williamson, if you're reading this, you did the same movie (a bit of violence and / or scary things made up for by clever kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) just a few times now (I'm telling you 6, not including Scream 3 and what follows), and I'd really appreciate it if you would stop. Otherwise, I might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a beast. OK? (I.e.
