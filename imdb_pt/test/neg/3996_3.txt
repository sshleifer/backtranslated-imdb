I was initially interested in this movie after reading a synopsis and seeing some stunning images, and the promise was there for an exciting horror film of the Dario Argento style. True, I must say that Argento films have been occasionally incoherent, and some feel like a handful of visually striking pieces loosely tied with a vague connection plot. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is credited as a writer for this, I have to say, I'm not really surprised. Even his masterpiece Suspiria, when examined, exhibits the same tendency to chain scenes sometimes unrelated purely by aesthetic impact. However, Suspiria also had the benefit of a main character singular and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that ultimately contributed to the eventual resolution. <br /> <br /> The Church, on the other hand, has none of these things. There is no main character, no protagonist; Besides, there is no real plot to speak and no crescendo, no climax, no outcome, no resolution. It's a completely hollow, incoherent work that shows how Argento sat and thought, "Hey, that would make an interesting scene visually ... let's do it!" The film is a series of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Initially, it may be interesting, and Soavi's direction is excellent, I must say. Soavi can not be criticized for the material as it is as attractive as possible. However, this good direction draws attention to the horrible flaws of the script, and there is absolutely no sense in it. The attempt at a unifying central plot is nothing more than the plagiarism of Carpenter's film, Prince of Darkness. Events happen only because the script desires them, and the reactions to those events are completely implausible. The narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point, simply because there is no capacity to suspend disbelief; It's very ridiculous. Added to this are numerous factual errors that are shown so clearly that they become embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If it had been more outright artistic and edited in a different job, it could have been scary or tense. If it had been drawn into a real cohesive narrative, it could have been exciting. But it was nothing like that. The best he could do was confusing and sometimes infuriating. Batches are introduced, but never followed. Characters are forgotten and changed arbitrarily. No logic is applied to any situation. It may have been scary or interesting, but provoking this kind of feeling requires more effort on the part of a screenwriter ... much more. <br /> <br /> In short, the Church is not worth seeing for anyone. but total enthusiasts of the Italian horror that is more style than substance. This is Argento's worst style, and is a strong justification for the usual criticism.
