This is not even alive enough to be fun. Something is out there, ripping people off the screen after a spaceship crash (off-screen) while government executives investigate (off-screen) and bad actors say stupid (on-screen) lines, including a face that looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover. The "monster", when it's finally shown, looks like an extra "Robot Monster", but there are not enough monster fu. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's very short. Jump, unless you want to get bored of your skull
