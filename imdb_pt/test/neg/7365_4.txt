Much can be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to remember important historical events and spice them up with enough loving interest to keep the story going. BATTLE OF BRAVO addresses the eighteenth-century struggle for control of Quebec (a whole of Canada) between the British and French with side bars of the New America. It is the result of a sweeping epic of fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of the writer Pierre Billon (whose screenplay deserves a Razzie award for the worst of the season) and Jean Beaudin's scattered, unfocused and confused direction, this film is a failure - A tedious mess of a two-and-a-quarter-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Even a cast of fine actors - matching Noémie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur, adding the lovely Bianca Gervais as Acoona, the venerable Gérard Depardieu as the healed Thomas Blondeau and the likes of Irene Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in wigs), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as General James Wolfe - does not help. Veteran actors like these must have cowered in the raw lines written for their characters! Cover up the whole mess on a soundtrack by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long movie to be avoided. It's sad to say such bad things about an expensive project, but be warned ... Grady Harp
