I have to be honest and admit that this movie basically did nothing for me except to disconcert me completely. It is overwhelmed with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women, which then binds to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never seems to make much sense, especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) begins to have his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really figured it out). Jones was fine in his role, though I did. He was really starting to show his age here. Horribly miscast was John Goodman as Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni, which I think is supposed to be some kind of local mafia figure. I just did not think Goodman would work in that role, although I admit it could only be because I'm not much of a fan of John Goodman. Somewhere in the mix appeared Justina Machado as an FBI agent, although I never really understood what the FBI was involved in, which could simply mean that my attention kept wandering around the screen. If it was explained, however, I completely lost it. Fortunately, this is a rather short movie so you will not waste much of your life on it. 2/10
