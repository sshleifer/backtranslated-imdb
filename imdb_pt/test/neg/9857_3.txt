Kasparov Vs. Deep Blue is undoubtedly a fascinating story, but I do not think you know watching it. I think it focuses a lot on the conspiracy theory that IBM betrayed ... and what does this theory depend on? The idea that at one point the computer made a movement that "looked human." I'm not a great chess master or a computer scientist. And while I do not doubt that the movement seemed human, it does not seem to me to be outside the scope of the possibility that the most powerful chess computer ever created could make an amazing move ... or that such a machine could defeat even a genius like Kasparov. The film takes full advantage of this theory, not enough of the personalities of the people involved ... that could have made a story much more interesting. The direction also depends heavily on the concepts of a useless and whispered narration, and the images of an eighteenth-century chess-playing machine that looks like one of those gypsy animatronics fortune tellers you see at the carnival. Also the story was delayed by many empty shots of Kasparov revisiting "the scene of the crime". I do not doubt that Kasparov and the chess community have found IBM's behavior vexing, but I do not think it is unlike any other large corporation. At the end of the movie, you get the feeling that Kasparov is a huge whiner and Deep Blue programmers are victims or cheaters. I think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe in the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented much more evidence. In fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. The whole thing left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.
