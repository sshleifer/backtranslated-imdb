I'm still waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone coming from such a talented family, it's a mystery to me because Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And that's the good news in this disappointing dog from an adaptation of The Tempest. A series of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the great Bard's piece is what we are served. The setting is the Civil War and Prospero's evil brother (here Guideon) looks like a villain of the melodrama of 1890, complete with the Snidely Whiplash mustache. I kept waiting for him to go "Uh ha hah!" which would have been a highlight in this sad presentation. None of the supporting cast was memorable, and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and body movements made the story indifferent drag on indefinitely. <br /> <br /> The Storm is the Bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of man. The only credible character was Gator's man, Caliban's counterpart. The transfer to the swamp had possibilities, but the Civil War scenario simply did not. All in all, a very disappointing production. I've seen it on video and I advise, if you want a correction from Willy Shakespeare, save your money on this. Rent something else, such as Much Ado About Nothing, by Branagh, or Kevin Kline, in Midsummer Night's Dream.
