Wow, I only have one watching this. <br /> <br /> How CRAPPY's post-production is in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not joking, I literally could have done a better job myself. <br /> <br /> ALL post-production is flawed, all of it. Whoever has cut this movie should be banned from the film industry. <br /> <br /> That aside, the script was a train disaster. Absolute Rubish. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in Spongebob. WTF is your character doing there? But for me, the biggest flaw of all was the development of characters, interactions, dynamics, dialogues. WOW. I can not believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I give this film a 2 out of 10. 1 for Samantha, who is a great actress, sorry that the production made everyone look amateurs out there. /> <br /> the other 1 goes to cinematography, which was really good. <br /> <br /> Others then my friend, this is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know. I even feel like doing an elaborate post about it, it was a horrible production. Poor actors, they did not know what they were getting into ...
