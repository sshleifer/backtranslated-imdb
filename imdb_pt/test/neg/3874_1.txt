This movie had potential. The script was not bad, and it had an interesting somber atmosphere with suicide themes, patriotism, regrets, and - as Chris says - "10 years going nowhere." It is a stark contrast to the original MAG7, which was bright, good-humored, and even the bad guy was kind. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting tone change, and if they had developed the characters over, maybe I liked it. <br /> <br /> But instead they waste a lot of time on free (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited together. At one point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But many people would not notice this, since there are already two dozen horseback trips (I'm not exaggerating), and then we doze off. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the title of my Reveja. This movie was largely cut because of cruelty to animals, so chances are (if you decide to watch it), you will have the children's version. There is a bullfight where the killer stabs the bull and suddenly, when the crowd explodes, there is no bull, only the killer in an empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I do not know. More likely, the scene was cut off. <br /> <br /> Later, there is a cockfight scene where, in the original version, one of the birds is beaten horribly in front of a crowd of Mexicans applauding. That was cut off. But we still see enough to get angry. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are the horse throws. One after another, you see the horses' legs ripped off, sending thousands of pounds of horsepower on their head. In one scene, a horse is thrown and, while it is writhing on the ground in paralyzing convulsions, an explosive passes directly below the neck. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1966, when Hollywood was beginning to regulate animal brutality in the film. This is probably one of the last movies where you can see this happen. So if that kind of thing floats on your boat, check it out and you'll have a light thrill. But if not, you will be annoyed or annoyed.
