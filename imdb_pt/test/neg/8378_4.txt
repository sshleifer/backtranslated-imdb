A bad Quentin Tarantino rips off, at least I hope that's why they were going because at least I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. A scene that a "singing" scene with Rose McGowan is very well made and great for this movie and could only have been stumbled by mistake by this director. So, in addition to his inspiration in Quinton and Rose McGowan and his good scene, this movie sucked. Some of the baddest dialogues I've heard, I'm willing to bet McGowan does not talk too much because of how insignificant her dialogue would have been. It tries to be funny, it is never, it tries to be dark and it is not, it tries to be elegant and it is just bland. Whoever distributes the money to make movies like this, I hope all the directors have worked so that no one else's money was wasted. If it was not for McGowan, the whole cast is horrible and when McGowan is his best hmmm, I have to ask myself.
