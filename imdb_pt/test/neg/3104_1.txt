the worst movie I've ever seen, I did not watch it all, I just forwarded it to the bits of Burt and then to the end !!! he's the only reason to watch it !! I have to admit to owning a copy as I am a big fan of Burt (stop laughing) and needed for my collection I would not mind when this movie came out I had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and Os fans of all the stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when I sat down and watched this movie !! THERE IS NO JUST QUALITY OF RESCUE ON THIS MOVIE !!! Absolutely NOTHING WHAT YOU MAY LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE !!! this movie has become a joke between me and the worst of partner Burt !! The worst hour of Rob Lowe and half of my life
