The summary was promising, but watching the movie was a big disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. The plot is linear and unsurprising. Normal characters remain normal until the end of the movie, weird characters are strangers by the end of the movie. There is not even a single attempt to stop the viewer from thinking that the villain is someone who is not the most obvious candidate. On the plus side, the actors play very well, and there is a bit of atmosphere in the film, but very little to be significant. <br /> <br /> People who vote 10 for this movie also did not attend. see, or be a member of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
