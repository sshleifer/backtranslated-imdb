This film has strayed far from Straub's novel for me to enjoy. He barely made it to the middle of the movie. In addition to changing Don Wanderly from Edwards' nephew to his son, most of the main scenes were removed and a number of characters brought the novel to life. What was left was crap. The Straub version was far superior to this poorly executed movie. I do not think the cast has done so much work in choosing the members of the Chowder Society. I hope someone comes and actually redoes this movie correctly in my life. I hate it when Hollywood butchers the works of talented authors because they think their version is so much better. Makes me sick.
