I must be honest, I like romantic comedies, but that was not what I expected. I thought Ellen Degeneres was having the most, which should have been, because I did not like the two bed partners fighting. It was terrible. Poor Tom Selleck !! He had to deal with someone who was both in the picture, while it should have been him and Ellen for most of the film. They were the only believers. And the only really funny parts starred them, not Kate Capshaw and that Everett guy .. Nice that Mom is coming out of the closet, I thought it was a good surprise. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw him on the cable and paid no money to rent him.
