The only reason I'm giving a second star is for the first half of the movie. This was a good interpretation of the story. I like to see some fictional characters added to add a bit of color to a well-known story. But the second half was awful !!! Yes, there were violent aspects of this story. But the writers of this film chose to include only violence and forget the good things that God did for the Israelites. At the end of the movie, Scott seemed to be getting messages from the big giant head instead of speaking and hearing from God. This version had some huge problems with deviance from the scriptures. And big surprise, there are no favorable deviations! His portrait of Moses as this lunatic and howling who did all this against his will is utterly false. He showed a Moses who had to shout for God to speak to him. WRONG The scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time and not just after a tantrum. They made people complain correctly but failed to show that God spoke to Moses at Sinai with an audible voice that followers could hear and believe (Chapter 19). They also forgot the pillar of fire and cloud that guided them during the day and night. <br /> <br /> What was Joshua's whole thing? The righteous Jew who loves peace and who would not fight until Moses threatened him? WRONG (He was known as a great warrior) What about the great discourse that Moses gave to the army telling them that God had helped them greatly and now they were alone? WRONG (They only conquered through the help of God as shown in their own scenes with Moses lifting their staff) And what was that Ark of the Covenant looking sad? Instead of covering it for gold, this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold chips to it! Oh, yes, it was a "melted calf," not a straw, with small chips stuck. Someone forgot that they left Egypt with a huge amount of gold from the Egyptians. You would not know that because of this sad band. <br /> <br /> By the way, the part about them killing the Israelites after the incident of the golden calf says "men" and does not mention women and children that the movie delights in showing the viewers. Oh yes - Manna was not the only thing sent from heaven - do not forget the birds of flesh. In addition, the Bible mentions Jethro bringing Moses his wife and children and then says that Jethro has returned to his own land. It does not say that Moses gave up his family. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, if you do not know anything about the real story, read Exodus to yourself. If you know the real story, you'll hate this version.
