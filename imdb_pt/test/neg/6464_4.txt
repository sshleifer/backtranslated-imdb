Not long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape entitled "Just Rambling Along," supposedly with Laurel and Hardy. Being somewhat familiar with his production and not recognizing this title, I made the painful decision to separate an entire dollar and buy it. When I touched it, I identified the film as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product incredibly misleading. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like he was fooled from an 8mm film source. He had a somewhat appropriate musical score. In fact, in all seriousness, the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of ​​what the movie looks like. In my opinion, it's a decent short, but nothing outstanding. The IMDb should add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as an alternate title for this movie, which in fact was the name of a 1918 Stan Laurel movie!
