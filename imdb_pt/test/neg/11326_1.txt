Years ago, I used to watch bad movies deliberately. Somehow I missed this one. No gesture sounds true. No facial expression fits the scene or the action. I've never heard this song inappropriate for a movie. In the final scene, I was hoping the car would hit that ridiculous kid - one of the worst children's actors of all time. <br /> <br /> Just a name I've heard of - Wilford Brimley. He must have been too hungry to take on that role. <br /> <br /> DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS MOVIE !!! YOU WERE NOTICED !!!
