What a horrible adaptation. The worst part was the music. Muzak and saxophone synths playing in a story set in the early 1800's ?????? The only character who did not take me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this, and I love Jane Austen movies normally. I did not even rent it, borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to get it. I do not understand how Catherine and Henry got a passionate kiss at the end, when throughout the film they had no chemistry or indication that they cared for each other. Isabella and her brother were very exaggerated; it was no secret to me at once that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen's films is the discovery that whoever you think good is not. This is probably my list of the ten worst movies I have ever seen.
