Not even original in the storyline. Ho hum. There were some angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies. I do not really "understand" the performance of Samuel Jackson most of the time in his other films, but he was very good in that film. He rarely screamed and went far beyond his character, instead of turning to "a face of rage." I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and although she is great for the eyes, she proves to be much more than that as an actress. Luis Guzman was really good too, except that I did not like the change of his character to Samuel Jackson at the end of the movie. How can the character center around an antipathy for a former police officer and then turn into lollipop in a fraction of a second? Is there no original thinking left in Hollywood?
