Well done, yes. Very well, I must say, though I do not speak of Chezck. Beautiful cinematography. But the script is lame, really lame. A predictable novel, in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen. OK, maybe the ending is not as predictable, but is it good? It's one of those movies that you have the feeling you've seen, and forget the next day. <br /> <br /> I just received a note from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough. This is very sad, because I have no idea what else to say about this movie, which really says a lot about it, do not you think? The thing is ... It has no soul or originality. Compare this movie with Barrio, or Riff Raff, filmed over ten years ago (or the extraordinary shot recently The Child). It's sad to see that this is a much worse movie.
