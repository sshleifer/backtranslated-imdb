This movie made me think ... about how I could write something about it without dissecting the director and all the actors personally, who, as an Australian, I'm proud to actually go out and make a movie. <Br /> <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story ... <br /> <br /> I found this DVD at my local rental store yesterday and had vague memories of the reviews at the time of the release of the movies here, so I thought I'd give one For some reason, I I decided to watch 'special features' before watching the movie, not something I usually do. It left the 'making of' aside, as if I had shrunk enough in the 'are not we so wonderful to put together a film so difficult with such a crude writing? <br /> <br /> The movie? Ugh Full of clich√©s and pathetic development. The actors? Well done guys, you guys are Australians and I applaud you guys. And just as a football team is as good as the coach who runs them, you unfortunately did not have a great road map to work with. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film really trivialized many of the subjects. which he seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. Awake. <br /> <br /> Finally (and forgive me if I do not say it correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there was no optimistic tone. Yes, we all know that life is full of difficult things, and yes, we know things like incest happen, but I really find it hard to applaud a movie that does not have a single joy in it. I believe a director has a responsibility to put him there somewhere. Otherwise, the film is about them and their feelings, they have created for themselves, not for an audience. <br /> <br /> Which one I think is the basis of why this movie is not so good. Special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36-hour session, the day after he tried to end his own life. Well, it may have been cathartic for him to do that, however, the movie smells of self-indulgence when you know the story behind the reason it was written. "I feel horrible, I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrible." (Note: I read the interview with Andrew Urban, and I understood why Thalluri needed to write something to help him in his own problems, but I believe there is a line in the film that can not be surpassed - the line of making a movie purely by his own emotional needs, and I feel that this is what happened unintentionally here) <br /> <br /> By his own admission, the director had no technical experience and unfortunately this makes the film look like Nothing more than a year, twelve media projects. As for any recommendation that this film should be studied in school, or that all teenagers should watch it - I'm not sure about that either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line in the end. I've also been to a place where I thought that someone who does not have to face life anymore is "lucky", but as an adult, I worry that this line could influence a young viewer who was vulnerable. State of mind. It may be there to promote the discussion, but again, it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, this almost indicates that there is more sadness to come. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Elephant, but I can find it, given all the comparisons here. <br /> <br /> Nothing personal here, I hope you can do another movie someday, and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I've been too hard. I am glad that you are proud of what you have created, that in the end is what life is. Not a movie I would recommend, though. <br /> <br /> Oh, I liked the way the time frames often collided, I thought it was an interesting way to shoot. <br /> <br /> But the whole "It's the quietest you have to watch" - we already know that.
