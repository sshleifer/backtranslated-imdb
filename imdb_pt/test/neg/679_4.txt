Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once more while their itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. Fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage. Already angry at her father for her frequent relocations, her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a tuberculosis sanatorium. His mother's absence causes Tamara to attack her father and seek solace in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead adolescent who lived in her rented house. <br /> <br /> History is modest to failure. It is curiously rhythmic, and even during the emotional scenes, there is no tension. The actors who play the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the guilty mother of the dead teenager. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is very amateur to take the film. The dialog box is very natural and Boland can not do that. She has her moments and when she hits them she may be good, but there were many times when she left strangely. You can see her thinking 'ok, this is what my line is and this is the face I should do' rather than actually react to the other actors. She is not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as her sister Brenda also suffer from the affected delivery, but at least they are in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done correctly, the script could have done it. an affecting film. And it has moments but a lot of it is bogged down with an amateur lead performance and flat steering.
