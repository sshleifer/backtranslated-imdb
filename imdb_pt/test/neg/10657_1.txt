... with nothing to go away. This film begins with scenes in China with the discovery of a newborn. While this is not a new concept, I would not give up there. So there is a breakthrough for adolescence. The man's wife and biological son are fed up with the father who neglected them. While this did not seem culturally correct, and the film made no move to develop such characters or the purpose of the adoptive parent's devotion, I continued. <br /> <br /> Next, we are in Malibu, where we are bombed. by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low budget (fill in the blank: acting / camera work / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will not give any more of the plot, because I suppose the synopsis is accurate: the film aims to show how a Malibu girl who (though it seems to have compassion and interest in helping others when she immediately asks the teacher about the trip to China) is spoiled and without consideration, she is a healer and a helper of body and spirit. <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. <br /> <br /> Now I, admittedly, am a stern critic, so maybe take one of those LAME's though and you'll be on the mark.
