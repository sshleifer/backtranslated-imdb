I must say that I found this film very disappointing. Yes, I know that Maltin gave 3 1/2 and others think it very well. But, well, the opera sequences were horrible. I think Jeannet MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences I've seen with Nelson Eddy, she's immensely preferable to him. But alone ... God, I do not like opera and I despise operetta, and it's basically intolerable. At one point I had to cover my ears. Gable is fine, and Tracy is thrown out. The plot is boring in JM never simply says Gable does she love him and opera and why can not she do both? Instead, she suffers silently (or not) with the commitments she makes. The support cast is clearly untouchable. In addition to star three and Jack Holt (and I suppose his mother), they are all just background and forgettable. The EQ sequence is the only thing that saves the movie. And just. Yes, it is quite spectacular and moving. But the "oh God is great" seems very artificial. I prefer immensely "in Old Chicago" as the old time disaster shows go. Save yourself this time.
