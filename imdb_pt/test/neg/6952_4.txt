Not every movie with lesbian girls and vampires playing our favorite trash / cult genre is cool. Unfortunately, this film has an originality and the performances do not bring the garbage standards. It seems that the intention of the creator to do it cult failed. Garbage films are junk films because this happens. You can not create this kind of movies on purpose. I do not know if Mr. Creepo is a legend (the first time I heard his name), but if he is, I wonder the reason ... horrible. Even the lesbian scenes are pathetic, so any fan of erotic x-ploitation movies will not be pleased, as there are thousands of movies better than the lesbian vampires Barely Legal.
