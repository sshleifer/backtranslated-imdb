While the dog was cute, the film was not. It was not the premise or the theme that was a problem. The premise had great possibilities of humor and emotion. The theme is dignified. Helping others is more important than hoarding a fortune. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the adorable dog, the unique premise and theme were undermined by bad acting, flamboyant dialogue and amateur filming. <br /> <Even my youngest son who will sit down with almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway there. How many times can this dog go up and down the same corridor? I can not ruin everything for you, because I never saw the end. It just was not worth watching all the way to the end.
