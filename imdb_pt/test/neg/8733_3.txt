After his career as a romantic leader ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson starred in several different projects including TV shows and smaller films. However, I believe that "Embryo" is his only time as a mad scientist, and that is probably a good thing. I think he needed the job. Driving on a dark and stormy night, the brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) hits and injures a Doberman, which he brings back to his laboratory (which looks like a humid basement from the Midwest ). He then manages to raise the puppy by being born outside the womb, so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being. He creates Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) from a fetus in the same way. Victoria grows at an amazing pace, and soon blossoms into a beautiful young woman. <br /> <br /> Predictably, things go very badly. After a quiet start, Martha (Diane Ladd), Holliston's sister-in-law, begins to wonder where the young lady came from, and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is a long direct car chase from "Smokey and the Bandit," after which Victoria - who has aged shockingly in just a few minutes - is beaten by a frenetic Holliston, who tries in vain to destroy her malformed creation. along with your fetus. All this is accompanied by strident tires, noisy engines, a car lit and many sirens. The flabby end - a bunch of paramedics working frantically in Victoria while Holliston squirms in regret - is more laborious than scary. <br /> <br /> Although just released in 1976, this film is very old-fashioned. The only difference between this and the many crazy scientist films of the 1940s is that Hudson plays the lead role instead of Boris Karloff. The sets are pretty cheap and very old-fashioned for today's audiences, as far as the Hudson Roller Recorder is the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action occurs in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson dreams of his sordid role, giving the impression that he is a true movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are far more believable. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> The Passport Video download is far below standard, appearing to have been made from a poor VHS copy using home appliances. If you're nostalgic in 1976, watch this one time just to say yes. Otherwise, watch a football game or novel.
