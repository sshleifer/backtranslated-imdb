I got into this movie waiting / waiting for a sleazy drive-in slice of exploration style from the seventies, but what I got was another bizarre pseudo-western with lots of talk and insufficient action. Of course this movie was made on a budget; the venues are monotonous and poorly filmed, while acting leaves much to be desired as well. The plot focuses on a trio of thieves (a father and two children) who steal a load of gold after killing some miners. They are faced with a hut inhabited by a young woman and her stepmother ... and all this is counted in flashbacks by the young woman, currently residing in an asylum. Of course, directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; but despite their best efforts, South of Hell Mountain is simply too annoying to shock the viewer. The film appears for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters that leave the boring and boring dialogue. The only good thing I have to say about the movie is in relation to the song; which is good in some places. The ending is the only other good thing about the movie; and that's just because it's the last thing that happens. I would not recommend anyone bother to track this ... there was much better garbage made in the seventies.
