Reading the other two comments, I had to wonder if I had seen the same movie! <br /> <br /> Maybe life will be drastically different in Australia, but, wow - call it science fiction or fantasy, but people just do not I can not pass this comment without commenting on it itself .. it gets better after the first half hour, but I doubt most would get that far. <br /> Yikes.
