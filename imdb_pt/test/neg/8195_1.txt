I remember watching this movie on TV a few years ago. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that made me die of laughter. The only plot summary I can give you (without spoilers) is to imagine a home movie made by college kids who were stoned. <br /> <br /> (The spoiler alert starts here ...) When the movie starts, a guy running, being chased by "Demon Officer", when in fact, the man was actually being chased by a suit of Wrong Halloween. A car appears out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. It sends you flying overhead, and what does the driver do? Watch the man as he falls, goes back to the car, and leaves. What kind of idiot with hair brains would do that? I would have at least asked if the guy was okay. <br /> <br /> So a black guy stares the demon straight in the face, then tells the reporters, "I did not take a good look at him." My sisters and I, at the time, almost choked to death with laughter. <br /> <br /> So there's a scene in an alley where this Afro girl uses a machine gun out of her teens. small purse Could not have FIT !! I can barely remember certain scenes. Maybe it's because they were so bad. <br /> <br /> Cops in the movie can not even jump over a fence, and the acting is so wooden it makes wood planks look like better actors. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie brings shame to Hollywood, much more than any other failure. You have to see it to believe in your kitschy plot, which it has not, as far as I know.
