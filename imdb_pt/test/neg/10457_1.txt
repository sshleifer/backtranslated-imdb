If you're like me and occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies (think it's like slowing down in a car accident), you can not do better than that! The plot is insane, special effects are hilarious and acting is one of the worst you've ever seen! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how the director and the "actors" can sleep at night! It's painful, and yet hysterically funny, watch and I recommend it to those who want to punish themselves for something. If you can watch this crap without shuddering, you're a better man than I'll ever be! I wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was doing (and his money)!
