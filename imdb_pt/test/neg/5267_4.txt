I was really looking forward to watching this movie. He had all the ingredients of a great tongue on his cheek, but simply did not come together at all. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable, except that sometimes he forgot to use it and I preferred not to have to listen to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. She and Helen Baxendale were utterly lacking in charm and personality, fortunately their screen boys had a lot, so you could find at least a few members of their two lovely families. You could have stretched spaghetti with the plot and I'm sure the script was written by some teenager in a high school English competition. That being said, when I was not shrinking, I was smiling so I was not totally wasted 90 minutes. I found the overlap of Kevin's face in the painting very clever and rather funny. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but I was expecting a bit of preview quality and this never came.
