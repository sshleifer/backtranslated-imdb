As much as I love trains, I could not stand this movie. The premise that someone could steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train along the way has to be right there on the chart of success of the Impossible Plot lines. Imagine two dissatisfied NASA employees stealing the "tracker" that takes the buses from one place to another and heading to New York and you have the idea. <br /> <br /> That said, it's a good try. Wilford Brimely is in his Quaker Oats best, and Levon Helm does a good job as his grumpy, but well-meaning helper. Bob Balaban is properly drunk as the Corporate Guy, and the story of the "little guy takes Goliath" wins another showing.
