This movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very bad sitcom. How many vague humorous misunderstandings do you get in just one movie? The notes are lost, the bags changed, the conversations malicious, people get confused, situations are misinterpreted and, at some point, people should laugh at something. The writers are really struggling to keep everything running, which makes the dialogues seem really forced. If someone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be solved in about two minutes and everyone could get back into their lives but they have to keep misunderstandings going. Sometimes this movie also tries to make some teenage laughs, but it all reminds you of how "American Pie" was funny. The scene with the nerd telling the prostitute (who he thinks is an exchange student) to "eat his sausage" goes on forever, not even a second of it is funny. I have to give some credit to this movie: because of the subplot of stolen money, it's not as annoying as it could have been. He also has a chuckle here and there, but unfortunately, back to another type of misunderstanding. Overall, this movie is really bad.
