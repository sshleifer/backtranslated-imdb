I'm a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Good vs. Python" and I'm working to build my collection for titles as big as "Troll 2" and "What's up Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to get to the list of wonderfully awful movies. It's just lame. The guy who said he has a better dialogue with his pot plants is right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot guy gets into the car, it looks like he knew it was going to explode, there was no reason for him to run that way. "Judge, Jury, and Executor," "The perfect cop ... but they went too far," I mean, why do people bother more about making these movies? ROTOR. does it because it's hysterically awful but Storm Trooper is just a waste of film because it's not bad enough to be so bad it's worth watching. This belongs to someone's collection of home movies, something they can be proud of, but that's all. I'm p * ssed off I was on an HBO channel (with only 1 star, that's why I watched it) because it does not belong there. Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie. It's shameful.
