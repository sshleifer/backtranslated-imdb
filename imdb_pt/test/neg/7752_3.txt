Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and it is such a sight full of claustrophobic scenarios, strange costumes and noisy little characters, "strangers" that one thing is certain: you want to get out of there as soon as possible (unfortunately, it will take you about 80 minutes). Alice's story in Wonderland is twisty and uninteresting, and there probably was no actress in the world who could have turned it into a good movie, although Kathy Ireland made a compelling attempt (annoying voice and all).
