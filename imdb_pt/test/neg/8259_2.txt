What a great cast and what a pathetic attempt on a movie. The script is full of holes from beginning to end. Inconsistent, not cohesive ... totally ridiculous. One of the most talented and beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) does not have a single memorable line here. Worse, she supposedly dyes her hair in the middle of the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costumes store. The best moments are given to an actor and his dog in the building where actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is badly photographed for starters. She looks like an overweight freshman who is full of many student cafeterias. I was so looking forward to this movie. I wanted to like it, but I think I'd rather see Nastassja read the phone book, with his own hair.
