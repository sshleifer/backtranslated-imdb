Famous as the British film so bad it had to be given away with a newspaper, the quality of this sub-film of the Children's Film Foundation "thriller" can be guessed from the abnormal number of 10/10 votes and receives the large number of praise for posters with no posting history and no further comments on your name. The regulars know what this means, the naive can be deceived. If they dive into the waters of this, they will not last long before they are dragged down. Technically inept with the boom microphone being fired or the crew reflections visible, it continues forever on a forgotten sub-DAVINCI CODE for $ 5 a day. The ending is just an insult, but do not worry. It's not like you've come this far!
