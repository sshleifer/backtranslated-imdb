Ron Hall makes a triple threat while writing, directing and starring in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is his clich√© cop on a mission that lies to the neck in some nasty vampire action. Throwing off his badge, he searches for the ultimate vampire killer (no, not Buffy!) To take the streets back and defeat the leeches back to the grave. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible movie. He rips so many other movies (can you tell Blade?) That never tries to establish his own identity. The script is non-existent. The action is horrible. Who says a micro-budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing even remotely interesting here. You will get nothing beyond that, except for a headache. Stay away at all costs.
