I usually do not appreciate light attempts to create funny stories, which means "Anita no perd el Tren" can not be too loud for me. The story is good: a middle-aged woman, but still beautiful, finds a new love. But attempts to make this film as a romantic comedy have only sometimes been somewhat comical. Rosa María Sardà has shown that she can be a serious actress in such productions as "Amic / Amat" (qv), "All About My Mother" (qv), "The Bitter Tears of Petra". but the powers that have over the years revealed a lot of trivial things, for the cinema and for the TV.A similar thing could be said of Jose Coronado (qv) and "El Embrujo de Shanghai" (qv). : perfectly capable of producing serious performances, María Barranco belongs safely in this grouping. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I felt that I would be really satisfied to see a new montage of this film, in a which would allow the actors to really show off their performance skills, and the curious thing is that this must be done exactly with the same main actors, the wasted talent in a silly movie that could have been very promising.
