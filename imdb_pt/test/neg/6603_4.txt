I grabbed La Bandara because it reunited Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a masterpiece noir. I'll give you some points because Gabin is at it, but the clumsy plot, the cheap sets and the ridiculous Annabella doing like an Arab princess put the film on the 'selling' shelf. If you observe, you will wonder why the idiots did not build the fort around the pit, instead of a mortal just a few feet away from it. And why use zinc roofs in the middle of the desert? But then the sheer perversity of the artifice that makes up the script must hinder it from any other contemplation.
