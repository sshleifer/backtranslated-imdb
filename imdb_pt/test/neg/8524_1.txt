I'm sorry, but I can not agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I must say the story sucked. How in the world have they managed to eliminate some of these plot holes beyond the critics? Best story and I would have given a higher vote but I was impossible to do this and still be able to live with myself. I've always been a fan of horror movies, and the previews really fooled me. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why is the family that was killed to haunt the house? Why did the father come back again? Why did he decide to kill in the first place? Why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first? For many questions, there are not enough answers. If I could have given a zero, I would have.
