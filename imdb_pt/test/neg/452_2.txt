Rose ?? Did something really happen in this episode? It introduces our two protagonists, a smiling idiot of slow thinking to a doctor and a totally uninteresting companion. There is no plot to speak, childish humor, mixed with some extremely bad rhythm and incidental music. What else is there to say, really? <br /> <br /> The end of the world? A marginal improvement, in which we see our first scenario of outer space. Subsequently overthrown by poor contemporary humor, fine paper logic, very poor pace and tired SF cliches. <br /> <br /> The Restless Dead ?? Best episode so far, showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write dialogues of interesting characters and integrate an intriguing plot. Disappointment only by Doctor and Rosa. <br /> <br /> Londoners / Third World War - Doctor who degenerates into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the process a little gravity, trying her best in terrible circumstances. Some badly written and out-of-place novelty elements come to light in these two episodes, and a return to bad timing, bad plot and the charm of humor / worthy satire. <br /> <br /> Dalek ?? Not great, however, still far above the RTD rate to date. The pace and script are all well (though Doctor and Rose are still annoyed). The effects and threats of Dalek are well introduced. The ending, however, took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most notorious foe into a cute mess, and turning an unprecedented threat into a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy. <br /> <br /> The Long Game - RTD's first screenplay to show any plot, even if it was a cliche style of the 80s. Still, it was marked by his usual excessive reliance on juvenile jokes, putting it away too much in the future to make logical sense, and again a weak rhythm. Not as bad as his previous efforts, but instantly forgettable. Father's Day ?? The initial premise might have been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic have abandoned this episode from the start. In addition, we are treated with an entire episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking that this is all about characterization, remember, there is a big difference between Soap Opera and the lame characterization. On the plus side, this proves that RTD is not the worst writer yet. <br /> <br /> The Empty Child / The Doctor Dance - This started in a mediocre way, with some moments worthy of some illogical mistakes that not even a primary school student would make (well-lit windows in a blackout, anyone? ). After that, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister course. Florence Hoath actually steals these episodes, showing us how an interesting companion could have been. She could also act. Instead, we received the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new mate. The conclusion was a bit hasty but sufficient. The pace and script improved with a reasonably good plot, making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I was so disillusioned with the current series that when I saw the trailer for another episode of 'Slitheen', I gave up and could not. subject to torture. <br /> <br /> Bad Wolf - Reality TV, arguably the worst facet of modern media, is basically used as a premise. There is no subtlety at all. Do we have any interesting social commentary, like in The Running Man or Truman Show? No of course not. That's in an RTD episode, so they're basically here to cynically try to attract audiences to such shows. Once again, the logic goes out the window, since we are positioned 200,000 years in the future. The RTD tries unsuccessfully to give a shoe touch on some "super-conceited" story here, with no relevance beyond its very existence and when the villains are revealed at the end ... They make empty threats, and the Doctor smiles once more like an idiot for the climax! Faster than most other RTD efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another installment without dimming. <br /> <br /> The division of modes - the grand finale. More of a moist squid, literally. The whole Dalek threat created in 'Dalek' is knocked over as they become pathetic. So many plot holes enigmem this episode, with typically poor inventions. Do the Daleks want to harvest humans like Daleks, but then vaporize whole continents? Dalek can vaporize the said continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis are now indestructible and can land anywhere, even on people, so they can be saved in it? Can not this ability be used to easily destroy the 'god' Dalek? Daleks can vaporize whole continents, but not just bombard satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and let him play? Is the doctor a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, after eradicating all his kind to try to eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes apart, we are treated with the most difficult solution that machina ever conceived, along with an almost meaningless history arc. <br /> <br /> So, what can we say about the new series, all-in all? <br /> <br /> Would that win a second series if it were something other than Doctor Who, with the RTD behind it? Most of the episodes would have been seen as anything other than original and forgettable if they were something other than Doctor Who, and the name of the RTD was attached? I think not. <br /> <br /> Some people make us think we can not say anything against RTD, since we owe it to him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I'd rather not have a badly designed, ill-conceived product produced at that price. I'd rather wait until someone can come and make a genuine effort. For the most part, this is the kind of childish garbage that gives a bad name to SF, spoiling what is otherwise the most creative genre.
