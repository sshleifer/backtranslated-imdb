this fourth edition of the series is the last to have a theatrical release, although it looks like a straightforward movie for the video. Okay, I guess, but nothing special. The acting is the worst view in the series up to this point. and like the third film, there is not much in the way of imagination. In addition, the phrase "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. Smithee is the pseudonym that the directors use when they do not want to have anything to do with the film. , is an acceptable film in the Hellraiser series, but not much more than that.It is a slight decline in the quality of number three, and a huge drop in the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is a 4.5 / 10
