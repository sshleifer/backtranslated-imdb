First of all I do not know if I should use my imagination in this movie or the director was trying to save money or with little budget! Here we go ... <br /> <br /> Basically, there were so many years and gaps that I do not understand, it's like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so many gaps that make you ask questions How the hell did that happen? it's because? I think this is a big flow. Forget the reviews that keep complaining about the story, this film not only has problems with historical facts, but also has so many flaws. So, most people continue to say that watching in the movies will lose all the cinematography, like rivers, deserts, etc. this is true that they are beautiful that's why I expected BluRay to release 1080p. IT'S OK! Beautiful scenes, but what's the point of it? I turned off the movie after 1 hour and a half, I just lost interest. The movie continued to do exactly the same things jumping in years (at least Mr. Director put it, for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) I mean, I could not watch the movie I lost understanding of what is going on ! Anyway I wish I could include spoilers, but when you decide to watch this movie, ask yourself how did this happen? You'll know what I mean! Do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
