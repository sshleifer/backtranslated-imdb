Slurred recordings, poorly edited, awkward dialogues, flat characters, unsuccessful adaptation of a novel. It does not get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for an hour and a half - over three hours - of boredom. Good occasional headlines. <br /> <br /> David is a stupid young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a mumbo-jumbo video of Chinese philosophy, although this does not seem to help much in real life. David is a member of a gang of debt collectors, where each member has an IQ below sea level. A missing script, along with uncreative footage and even worse editions, do what could have been funny incidents of failed debt collection looking like a home-grown amateur reality show. <br /> <br /> David rents an apartment from a primary school. Professor Haraldur, who in uttering a few sentences about his own importance convinces David that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A severely flawed script offers nothing to David to substantiate his opinion. Some scenes showing Haraldur doing something David could have misinterpreted would have done the job. The potentials of the film as media, as opposed to the text of the book on which this film is based, are not explored. At first, David's connection with Haraldur elevates his status within the gang of debt collectors. but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is good, but it is based on the book. This could have been a much better movie. A good screenwriter could have done some of that stuff. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The acting is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson does not have much to work with, but he does his best with the little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) manage well. General opinion: What could have been a rather funny and entertaining film about a stupid anti-hero in a gang of debt collectors, becomes a boring and ill-made film made after a poor manuscript. Looking at the toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.
