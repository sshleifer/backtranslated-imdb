Decent action scenes, but the film is overloaded with a slow and complicated storyline, an almost non-existent dialogue that leads to the character's minimal development and a seriously horrible plot ... <br /> <br /> I mentioned that the plot did not do sense? But in their defense, the action scenes were impressive enough, even if they left you scratching your head of why they happened. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say about the movie. It's a meaningless action adventure that does not make any sense. It's like watching a worse version of the Matrix and ignoring all the plot and dialogue.
