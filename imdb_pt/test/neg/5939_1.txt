If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror. This is the most pretentious movie ever made anywhere in the world, I'm convinced. A son, without a name, takes care of his mother, without a name. They love each other, I think. No, they do not, I'm sure. These are not characters. They are not even actors interpreting characters. At least it could be beautiful, but even nature seems ridiculously retouched and altered wherever necessary with a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have invented such a banal technique as a distorted-looking ration? You should have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10
