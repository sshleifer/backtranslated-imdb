Of all the children's films I have seen over the years, this was probably the worst. I took four children between the ages of 7 and 11 and none of them liked it. <br /> <br /> The script seemed to be based on a Willy Wonka story, but it had nothing to do with it. <Br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie do not waste your time, it is bad. <br /> <br /> They are making a sequel so it's worth watching to see if they can even get worse. movie, but I do not think it's possible.
