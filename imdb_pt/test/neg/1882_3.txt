Unlike the terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolia, I left the cinema feeling very disappointed. I started to get into the characters and their complex mother / daughter and father / daughter relationships in the beginning. I even cried. But I had no sympathy for the characters with the ending. The final act did not seem in line with the character of the mother. So although the acting was very good, I found the film disappointing.
