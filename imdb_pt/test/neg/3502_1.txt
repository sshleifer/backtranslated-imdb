What a disappointment. The plot is so simple - "good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things" - dressed in a racial setting to make it look smart, sophisticated and meaningful. It is not. It has no subtlety at all. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is cabled and then passed on again in case you missed the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a film like this to convince and move the audience, it has to represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivations and actions; not simply presenting it as a series of 180-degree changes in the actions of each character. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the way, I really did not want to waste any more time on this, but I thought I would stick with it in case it improves; Big mistake I should have stopped then - it just got worse.
