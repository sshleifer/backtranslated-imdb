This movie is an almost complete waste of time. I'm studying the book for my level of English A, and the film only contributes one way, and this is realizing that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. The acting is made of wood, the filmography is laughable, and the so-called dramatic scenes in the film made the majority of my class (myself included) scratch their texts. The book, though not my favorite literary choice, is far better than the movie, and the soundtrack is simply annoying. Do not watch this movie unless you are looking for a timeless, quality storyline that has become an irrational and media waste.
