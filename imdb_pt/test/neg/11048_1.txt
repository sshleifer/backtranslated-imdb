I'm sorry to rain at everyone's parade. Just a little bit of history about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. It's true that I'm a beginner when it comes to South Korean cinema, but if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I'm not narrow-minded when it comes to enjoying foreign films and I do not fit into the stereotype of the "idiot American." . . well, not perfectly. <br /> <br /> I can not believe in the high compliment that this piece of nothing is bestowed. This is a disgusting movie * and * ridiculous. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and exaggerated, like begging for the uninstructed viewer's attention. Horrible camera work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the aesthetics of MTV. <br /> <br /> The plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and because of the entertainment I would be happy to close my eyes to tiny infectious details. But, excuse me, what is happening here that can hold up to a summary of the scrutiny? This story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story you can read in a supermarket line. (I do not want to ruin your "pleasure," if that's the word, so we will not go into details of the plot.) The fight scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" takes dozens and dozens). of the opponents at the same time, after he trained only while he was stuck, hitting the wall!) The truly "striking" features of this movie are two: sinister and incestuous sex (brother in sister and father in daughter, well, we evolved from Oedipus, was not it?) And graphic violence. The cut parts of the body - hands, teeth, tongues - along with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this film to be made?) Have no aesthetic function / motivation. <br /> <br /> A party for the S & M inclines, admittedly, but even for those, a party without merit or subtlety. Hell, even Mel Gibson's much-discussed recent work on a nearly similar theme was not all that bad. The invariably good press of this pretentious, exaggerated and excessive piece coming from the Korean shores I wonder what is happening. I do not think of myself as being the ultimate paradigm of taste and many times I'm ready to accept that a movie I did not like may be better than I was able to realize. However, I have no scruples in calling this as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming quality. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time.
