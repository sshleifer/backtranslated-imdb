I was only fourteen when I first saw the Alien movies and immediately I started liking it. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero's character and she deserved a statuette for her act. In 1979, something eternal was born of what the immortal series continued with a film no less legendary than the first. Alien3 was a different point of view, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favorite. Unfortunately, the latter was a failure in many respects. It was tense, illogical, full of senseless massacres. I did not like it at all, but I never thought a worse part would be made in the future. Well as it turned out in 2004 I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad opportunity, and should have been directed by a more talented director or should never have been done. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem I was totally shocked in addition to devastated. As I sat down and decided to watch it full of doubt, even though I had never thought that such a bad movie could be made. Without a script, without a director and without actors, I do not understand how you can make a movie. Because this movie misses these three terms. What you get is a good massacre show without a story, but with many annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time. This film is a little reckless, than honor for fans on both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
