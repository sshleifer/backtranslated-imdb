I was not expecting a classic movie, but at least funny. There were only a few scenes that made you laugh, but nothing more. You do not get scared, it is full of American cliches of teenage slasher and you can guess what will happen with ease. <br /> <br /> But that speaks volumes about a senior student at a Turkish high school. Student Screening Test (OSS) pressure that the 3 hour exam determines which university you go to and considering the exam when a ghost is behind you is no exaggeration. The movie is bad. Do not waste your time to watch.
