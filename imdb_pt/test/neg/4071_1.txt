Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A perfectly good piece like Antonio Sabato Jr and nothing more than embarrassing embarrassment coming out of his mouth. I shrunk to 95% of Dialog! It would have been better to have left the character mute! As Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare could speak these lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me! If Michale's character Pare precedes or ends just one more sentence with the word 'Men', I think I would have thrown the iron through the TV set (I love doing multitasking - especially for bad movies). It must have been a difficult year for both of you to sign up for this movie. Washing cars for life would probably be good for them now. And the bad guy ...... if he was so bad why he just did not shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising breaks to the toilet. Even the title was a misnomer. A Crash Landing means that the plane actually crashes and does not land without even a symbolic fire or someone being injured. Instead of landing safely, the plane should have fallen and burned just like the script. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS A STRIPPER!
