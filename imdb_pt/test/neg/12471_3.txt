"Tart" is a good illustration of old Yogi Berra saying "If you do not know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else." Writer / director Christina Waye (in her first feature) managed to make a $ 3 million movie that ends up elsewhere. "Tart" is a maturing story devoid of characters with which a rational person can connect, a black comedy without any humor or a sexploitation film without anything that is particularly sexy. <br /> <br /> Unlike the standard Swain film, "Tart" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to provide two extremely nice shots: the Swain and Barton scene taking a bubble bath together and the Swain scene in the park - featuring a beautiful montage of the "Alice in Wonderland" sculpture. The symbolism embedded in these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unit of tone) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations to make a quality film. It is even possible that Waye was attempting a merger of the expressionist something "Metropolitan" and the classic "Cruel Intentions" field, which also deals with upper-class Manhattan. There are many pictures of cameras framed by windows and doors, but with few photos of faces and eyes. The first technique insinuating the symbolism and the second in the intentional detachment of the characters and their motivations. "Tart" seemed on the verge of entering camp territory at least twice and would have been advised to continue in that direction. First, there was the scene in which they tried to dump Swain, apparently deceased, into the garbage pit. Then there is every part about his father being Jewish (he played the same extreme as Joel Gray dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in "Cabaret"). In her other films, Swain's acting technique is to outplay every scene in which she appears (insert chewing scene here), but in "Tart" she shows an ability to restrain herself. This is the best performance of your career. He also provides some clues about his physical decay from super cute and slender in "Girl" to a thick and awkward face in "Pumpkin". This transformation was almost incomplete when she did "Tart"; So go the devastation of time. <br /> <br /> Mischa Barton ("Sixth Sense's" I feel better girl) and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles. The rest of the cast is simply awful, though some of the culprits for this must follow Waye's script and direction.
