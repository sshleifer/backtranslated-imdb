Kidman and Law do not have the chemistry to make this work of misdirected and poorly written novel / melodrama at any level other than grandeur. Kidman pats and wistles melancholically for his absent lover Law. She just knew him when he was taken to the battle in the South in the Civil War, and they only exchanged about 5 sentences and a kiss, but they are totally in love. The main direction of the law in general seems to be "look empty and in a state of shock, but sensitive." Rene Zellweger is the only spark in this dubious script, but she is very wide and exaggerated, as if she were starring in "Annie Get Your Gun." Yee-hah boy, please! Something about his character seemed more like an outline of Monty Python - that of the "Holy Grail," where peasants spend all their time in dumps, making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is an actress smart enough to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden within a Victorian Age novel. <br /> <br /> Whenever action becomes a total boredom, which is often all writers cry out! 'and Teague (Ray Winstone) gallops out of nowhere to do his indescribably cowardly acts, such as killing and torturing innocent God-fearing people in the name of loyalty to a rapidly fading Confederacy. All other times, he is missing in action, which is absurd even in this cornball script. There are a multitude of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as he makes his journey from Johnny Appleseed to the front lines, where he is deserted, to Kidman's hopefully loving embrace in Cold Mountain. Ultimately, however, none of these characters matter. The law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is gol-durn heck, and turns decent Christian people into rabid animals. <br /> <br /> And the script is very predictable, very heavy. . Also, the pace of the story is terribly slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for the inevitable meeting of Romeo and Juliet, with Kidman wringing his hands and sighing, Law overcoming the incredible odds and dodging the bullets. And when it finally comes you just do not care anymore. You will be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this applause you have to endure. <br /> <br /> I give him a five star for the battle scenes. There is a powerful anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern about the loss of lives of the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful. But it's only about 15 minutes of that 150-minute dog.
