I thought this movie was a bad effort on the advice of British cinema - fell flat, hey, come on, Tim Robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who also falls in love with him. As lost in translation, it is really difficult to suspend disbelief in this context. It's a beautiful movie, but it sucks. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, it looks like he has a little migraine. He seems uncomfortable and life less. The part in which he is examining suspicious officials in the Sphinx is laughable. If an investigator comes to my factory, the last thing I would do is tell you about my freckles fetish. It is obviously overly intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a convenient setting. They obviously chose the more futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a backdrop, but the city never comes out and affects the characters such as the blade runner where the characters of the city often cross the story. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic highs, so much plot.
