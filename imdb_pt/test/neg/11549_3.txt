Of course, I tuned this in the hope of seeing some shots of James Brolin. Unfortunately, there was only one at the beginning, and the rest of the film was very tame and ultimately made little sense. <br /> <br /> The story, what about her, is about Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage for many years is starting to age. Nick, a successful businessman, is focused on work to the point of neglecting Julie, who tries to fill the void by returning to school. Julie's desire for the passion she and Nick had for the beginning of their marriage begins to take shape in the form of powerful sexual fantasies that block reality for minutes on end, causing her to do things like burn breakfast and put the roles of the husband in practice. At first she fantasizes about her husband, but as the film progresses, she begins to fantasize about other men and about encounters with random strangers she knows. This culminates in the performance of her fantasies with disastrous consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband rebuild their relationship? Is it worth saving? <br /> <br /> This could have been an interesting premise, but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they bothered. Characters are not developed. Reasons are not explained. Basic information is not provided. No exploitation is made of how Julie got to the point where she could not control herself, and no explanation is offered about how she will do so in the future. The end product is a messy mess that is as confusing as Julie's fantasies, which are surprisingly underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Acting is a mixed bag. Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material that is given, although her continuous self-pity becomes strident after some time. James Brolin acts as if he is reading his talk cards tips, and even his anger over his wife's infidelity is hard to accept, he shows so little passion on the whole issue. The supporting roles are largely forgettable. <br /> <br /> A disappointing treatment of what could have been an interesting story. More is worth it, since it does not even offer the promised eye candy.
