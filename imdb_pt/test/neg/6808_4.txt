Attention, spoilers ahead (even if I doubt anyone has yet seen it) <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, but in the middle it collapses and becomes a corny sweet, sugary, predictable and unrealistic mess of ' romantic harmony '. I mean, it's pretty obvious that there are serious problems in the marriage of the main characters, but these issues are never solved but just forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically, as soon as she decides to have a baby on her back (without even asking) all her problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation. Given what had happened so far, it would have been far more logical if the marriage had collapsed, instead of becoming the banal and cliche "having a baby will change everything" will end. The two main characters' families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional, and do not seem to really serve any purpose, so as not to irritate the viewer, and also disappear mysteriously from the film as the moments of 'harmony' begin. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I'm ripping this movie, but given the beginning, I would have expected something more. 4/10 for me.
