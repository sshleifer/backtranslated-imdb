I was a 22 year old hippie in 1965, I saw the play 5 times, I had two versions of the song and I read the script several times. Perhaps taken as a separate thing, the film is OK, but as an adoption of the play, it is terrible. First, the good. The songs are well sung and the production values ​​are very good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys are cute. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes are inherent as long as the basic spirit is maintained. <br /> <br /> But the basic spirit was very distorted. It seemed that every producer wanted to sing certain songs, and fit the story for them, no matter what that did with the original intention of the play. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila and Hud were introduced. like a selfish brat who could care less about someone outside his tribe. She destroyed Sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe she smiled while her parents were being injured), and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert, where he would surely burn a lot, probably be lined up, and probably could die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud thought it was great to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not how hippies were, not what the piece described, and is directly opposed to a generation of love. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The goal was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not to beg for it. <br /> <br /> After Berger is arrested for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers help, Berger insists on being rescued. , without a better plan to rescue the rest of Sheila's parents, and then hit his own mother. <br /> <br /> "Be In" has always been a very spiritual point, but here is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if it's part of your journey, it ruins a beautiful song. I know they are contrasting "Floating in Space" with the Army. But again, this completely spoils a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude are skinny, Berger steals his clothes, laughing "it was fun face" even after seeing that both were very angry. So, a little later, Berger does something that no hippie does. He beats Claude. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in a beautiful SF location with the stars glistening, perhaps working on an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings in the scorching sun, speeding on the road in a convertible (stolen, of course). <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed in the film in 1979, and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to make a reasonably close adoption of the show, but that's not it.
