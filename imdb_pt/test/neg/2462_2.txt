"JB" (Jack Black) runs away from home after being beaten by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally arrives in Hollywood and meets the greatest guitarist he ever heard, "KG" (Kyle Glass). After a bit of a fight, the two decide to join forces and perform a night of open mic on what appears to be a less popular bar. To their shock, they do not do it well. Back at his less-than-spectacular apartment, the two are trying to figure out what the rock legends have that they do not do while watching old magazines. It's only then that they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar pick. While searching for a similar choice, an employee of the music store (Ben Stiller, who is also the director of the film). Executive Producer) tells the old story of the "Choice of Destiny" from which they seek. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the pick, which was made from the tooth of Satan, is in a history of the rock museum. <br /> <br /> Now the two marijuana smoking losers with delusions of grandeur go on an adventure filled with music to steal the pickaxe. <br /> <br /> Let me say this up front, if you're not a fan of Tenacious D, who gave us the comedy actor Jack Black, then you should skip this one. I'm not a fan of these two, and I just watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com. <br /> <br /> Jokes, for the most part, produce more silence than anything. I laughed at maybe three of the jokes and laughed at a few others. Tenacious D is just for a certain audience, of which I am not. <br /> <br /> This movie is in several places, and that is where the worst jokes appear. And let me tell you that when Black and Glass are not working with each other, they are completely lost on the screen. <br /> <br /> All the songs in this film are played by Tenacious D. Many of the songs perfectly pitch the plot, describing their adventures at the time of the movie. However, I felt that the songs sounded too alike to be counted separately. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that language will turn many people off. There are many four letter words in this movie. There are also some references to medicines. I would not recommend this to kids. Part of Tenacious D's skepticism is that black is in his face, and Glass stays in his shadows most of the time. That's how they are in this movie, and it really does not work. Now that may have been part of the act, but I felt that Glass simply did not want to be there. In one scene, he makes his lyrics (background) at a party and he just can not work alone. <br /> <br /> Tenacious D are supposed to be rock fans in real life, and maybe have two rock legends in the movie. I lost count because I was so bored with this movie. Personally, I wish I had seen more legends and rock icons in the movie. However, we do not understand this. <br /> <br /> What we have is a movie full of completely stupid jokes, lots of foul language, a dull script. You also have a horrible performance and a story with no originality. However, you get some really good songs that pretty much sound the same. <br /> <br /> The story might have been promising, but many of the scenes seemed to have been added to the film at the last second. This is a bit like The Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had much bigger followers - and two songs on the Billboard charts. Tenacious D has only a small following, with some HBO specials on its resume. And, unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not well thought out. <br /> <br /> If you are an unconditional fan of Tenacious D, then I suggest you take a look. However, like most of the movie's audience, when this movie was released in theaters, I would say avoid this one. Save your money on that, folks.
