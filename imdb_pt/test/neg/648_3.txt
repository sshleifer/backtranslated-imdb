"I assume you're here for damage to your mental circuit." - VAL. Mike Nelson made me watch this ... he mentioned in his book, "Movie Megacheese". I wondered, "Why did Mike Nelson lead me wrong?" Now I know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson. <br /> <br /> The song is by John Williams, who is probably part of his pay to the Devil. In fact, I'm sure anyone who has worked on that movie is probably connected to old Slewfoot, or now he's cursed, from the CEO to the guy who drove the catering truck out of the studio. Do not watch ... for God's sake ... do not watch !!! Not even make a copy and show someone else will curse you ... I'm doomed now, I understand that. I accept that. But save yourself ...
