I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70's and early 80's and John Candy was the main reason. He was given very funny off the wall characters and was simply hilarious. Unfortunately, he did not get these roles to play in the movies. Time after time I was disappointed with the mediocre movies in which he was almost playing the role of "straight" instead of the funny guy. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely tries to use John's comic skills, or Harold Ramis's, for that matter. It is simply a kind of film of cops and thieves very predictable. If you are a fan of John Candy or Harold Ramis, the film is watchable, just do not expect to laugh too much.
