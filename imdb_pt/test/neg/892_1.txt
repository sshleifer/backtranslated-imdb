I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them, but this was not funny at all. First, it can not be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play, right? This sucks and was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a House Party movie. According to who the hell is John-John? These new characters can not even compare to the other three films. I know why they put it directly into the video. He has horrible music, weak plot, untalented actors, and there are no hilarious jokes at all. My advice, watch this movie at night only if you can not sleep. after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play split after that. I hate this. I'm glad my studio did not have this movie and I never want to buy it or want to see it on Comedy Central either. Chris Strokes has talent for managing a promising R & B group, does not it mean he has direction and talent production, am I right or not? Finally, the female characters were all dressed up as cheap two-dollar prostitutes for most of the movie. The IMX broke up a year after this movie was probably released due to the failure of this film and is largely forgotten these days. In simple terms, this movie just sucks!
