So annoying that you go to sleep after the first 20 minutes. Sorry Mr. Boutonnat, I admire your work (all those beautiful "movies" that you directed like "Tristana", "Sans logique" etc ...) but here, the plot is extremely ... in vain! Except for the magnificent photograph, everything seems mute and there is no envy to know what will happen to these "average" actors. In addition, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "where are the children" is repeated so many times that it sounds like a farce. Believe me, it's a sheer waste of time (on the plot), and 3 hours is a long time. Certainly the real reason for this total box office mess!
