Being a completely bankrupt movie buff with a house to provide, I am a big fan of IKEA. My entire home, practically, is filled to the brim with the cheap material of aglomerado. And you know how all those fancy household items from IKEA have such funny names - a bookcase called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called "Grundtal" - well, that only adds to the charm of the Euro. <br /> <br /> Like those interesting (but horribly translated) name items on the IKEA shelves, I'd like to provide some translation for some of the reviews I read about Kraftverk 3714 made in Sweden. "For a low-budget movie, this is really cool. It would be great to see what these guys could do with a Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br /> Translation: The movie sucks, the lighting is pedestrian, the cinematography is uninteresting, the sound recording is hollow. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "David Lynchesque science fiction drama set in a strange forest town with equally strange characters!" <br /> <br /> Translation: These "actors" are acting for free, the plot is circular and tiresome, the ideas behind the film desperately try to be existential, but they are simply mundane, and the settings (especially the interiors) are dull and full of ugly wallpaper. <br /> <br /> "The editing is well done, and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that captivating effects do not have to leave a Hollywood studio!" start, when you have an inaccurate cinematography, hide the imperfections by scanning everything on a Mac and blending it vigorously for three minutes. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I risked this DVD because I'm a sucker for independent films, especially those who try to deal with the genre of science fiction often expensive and imposing. I mean, some of the best science fiction films of all time were made with little or no budget, spfx and illusory actors. Take Peter Fonda's eco-travel film, "Idaho Transfer," for example! One classic. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" does not fit into the category of "discreet, thought-dependent, carefully crafted sci-fi." He focuses relentlessly on characters who do not do much and do not say interesting things. It spins and spins in circles. It's very long (this coming from a big Tarkovsky fan). Worse, his concept of "reality-changing aliens" is the food of the Twilight Zone 40 years ago. It's not just a well-made movie - and I really wanted it to be, dammit! <br /> <br /> However, being the fan of IKEA, I made an observation that shook the floor. Firstly, whoever bought it at IKEA knows how their shopping carts work - the four wheels are multidirectional. The trolleys can rotate 360 ​​degrees perfect, and you need to have some familiarity to deal with them as a pro, as any avid IKEA buyer knows. Well, I'll be damned, but one of the leading actresses in "Kraftverk 3714" goes to a grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is she pushing? A multi-way shopping cart! So, this is not an invention of IKEA, but it's more a wonderful invention (let's call it "Tacklebee" to hell) from hei-doo's land!
