********** POSSIBLE SPOILER ********** Madonna plays an ex-convict who needs to recover some valuable information that can clear her of the murder she was put in prison for four years behind. Griffin Dunne is a tax lawyer who is marrying his boss's daughter. Together, the two must unite in a world where chaos prevents you from getting on the bus ... <br /> <br /> When you get there, this is a stupid movie. Without trying to give the plot **** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****, the movie thugs are trying to protect their boss by retrieving information that would incriminate them for the murder that Madonna was sent to. What kind of thugs did not commit murder trying to hide the original murder?!?!? <br /> <br /> Then there are the cops who stand behind Madonna following the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! And let's not forget those same brides who fought from the front gate to the front door, all tied together! And I hate to say that, but that patagonal feline certainly looks like a cougar! There may be only four of them in the New York area, so they may be in danger there, but I know there are many of them in the Rocky Mountains (see "Charlie the Lonesome Puma" if you really want to see a big "cat") . "in the movie.) And let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet ... NAW! <br /> <br /> The plot is there, but that's all there is for this movie.I was out of my teens when the film originally came out and I was a fan of Madonna, but that was the only reason I liked the movie, but since then, it has dropped popularity with me, and I've faced the fact that she's just a terrible actress ( good thing that she has to sing in the singer's career back.) He rated maybe a "5" at that time, but fell to "barely making a 2" over the years.
