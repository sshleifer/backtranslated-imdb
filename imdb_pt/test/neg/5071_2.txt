I would love to write a short summary of the plot of this movie, but ... there simply is not one! If you take a look at the plot keywords for this title, you pretty much know the whole content of the movie: sex, breasts, exploration, female frontal nudity and female prison! 80 minutes of pure impurity and nothing more. "Escape of the Island Women" (an alternate title that is not even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial classic of woman in prison, but it totally misses the brutality of one. WIP-flicks are made to mix graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced by more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich certainly can not compete with such experts as Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he should have been doing ordinary soft-core movies. The only aspects that look like cult cinema are the similarity of the tyrant-president with Fidel Castro and the gang rape of a girl (minor?) By soldiers. The girls are sweeping, and the Ibiza shooting location looks very charming.
