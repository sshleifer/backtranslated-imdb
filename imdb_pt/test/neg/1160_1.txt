PLEASE, people! DO NOT bother with this misdirected joke. The direction was totally wrong from the start. Where is the story of your mother's emotional interference and general madness in the original family? Why is ED portrayed as this imposing, authoritarian figure filled with anger and hatred? What is this crap? The writer and director obviously did not do any research on the story and just wanted to profit from the infamous name Gein. The fools who made this film have taken so many freedoms with the truth, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant film by Gein. go back to the smaller classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There is humor in this film, and Ed is portrayed as the saddest and loneliest man he was, according to HISTORY. Where's the background story here? There are only badly adjusted shocks (which are not shocking) that we saw before, and more shocks too. Take the worst draft of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and add it to the list. Had to give one out of ten because the rating would not accept ZERO. I want my money back. If anyone considers this movie as "stunning," it is possibly receiving a financial reward to do so.
