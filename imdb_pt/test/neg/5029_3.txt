The film is nothing more than an exhibition of nudity. Did anyone notice that all three main female characters appear naked? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of the nudity of the local stars, along with slang words that otherwise, in today's Portuguese society, are repelled by horror. If you watch Portuguese movie ads on Portuguese TVs, they all included a "hot" scene from the movie. I am not saying, in any way, that Portuguese society is alienated; But the film industry does not seem to be able to find other forms of success. Going back to the film ... There is nothing more of the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been good if it had been emphasized the actual idea of ​​the book (indeed at any moment) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was awful ...
