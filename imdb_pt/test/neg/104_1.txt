This movie had a very special effect on me: it prevented me from realizing that this movie really sucks! He is disguised as "thinker movie" in the tastes of Memento and other jewelry like that, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize that this is nothing more than a pretentious cromp. Probably written by some collage student with friends to pity to tell you that your writing sucks. The whole idea is ?? I do not even know if you tried to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak, by the way) with stupid "puzzles", the kind you learn in elementary school playground, you suddenly come to the "one truth" about everything, so you have to kill someone and confess? !!! What? How, why, why? Is it like saying that to make a cake, just throw a lot of ingredients and add water? forgot to cook it? I think these guys forgot, they did not explain, but they have the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do this when you present a story that the normal day-to-day acts (solving the riddle of the riddle) begin to have an abnormal effect on people. Act was horrible, with that girl always trying to look cute to the camera, and the Highlanders guy, the show, acting like it was a heavy metal record store (yes, they're all real, albeit s-o-b). The "threatening" atmosphere with the "oh so clever" puzzles (enter the 60s series of Batman and Robin, featuring The Riddle) and the crazy ones who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smile on their faces ??? simply horrible, HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> I'm usually very partial to low-budget films, and I try to cheer the less favored by giving them more praise than they deserve, instead of their restrictions, you know, but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and in the end you'll just regret that you fell in love with it.
