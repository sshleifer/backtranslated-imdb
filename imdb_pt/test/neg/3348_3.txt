A guy named Karl Rhamarevich learns to live even after death by telekinesis. He is buried in a mausoleum. That same night, Julie (Meg Tilly) has to spend the night there to join a group called "The Sisters". And Karl's "power" is in full bloom. <br /> <br /> Silly movie. I saw in a theater when I was 21 and I was usually bored. The PG rating should have fired me - this is a horror movie for kids. A real stupid scene at the end has a corpse breaking through concrete to hit a young guy! To begin with, corpses are placed in the HEAD first, making it impossible for the corpse to use its arms and there is no way to break the concrete. When you're noticing such silly mistakes, the movie is not doing its job. <br /> <br /> He has two good scenes - two of "The Sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses that crowd. At one point, one of the sisters punches a corpse in the stomach - her hand enters the body and she can not pull it off! This scene has stayed with me ever since. And there's a little bit of cute stuff around a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which made my audience laugh). But the rest of the film is a faint, dull memory. Only for children - adults will be bored. I give a 3.
