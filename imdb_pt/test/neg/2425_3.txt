First let me say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is by far our biggest sport, and our national team, Springboks, has won the Rugby World Cup twice, so it's a big deal around here. . I've played all my life and am shocked at the lack of attention to detail in this movie! At first I thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin for the love of God, but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport. They basically mixed it up with their normal American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values ​​of rugby, but the discipline or I must say the total lack of them during the games are contradictory with this. In the final, it looks more like an NFL game, with Penning being knocked over several times in front of the referee ... which would immediately lead to a pair of red cards, because such a dirty game would never go unpunished. by a referee, that I can assure you! You also would not be able to find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over your team. Any coach would overthrow a player's head if he intentionally wields an opposing player or doubles with him as he did in the final ... red card and some suspension, period. <br /> <br /> Secondly, It is absurd for a coach to take a brand new player who has played wing all his life, I move him to a prostitute who is a highly skilled position and say that it is for the good of the TEAM?! What?! Hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to be able to scrum extremely well and preferably be able to throw the ball at the time of exit, which Penning NEVER does for some reason. By moving a wing to a prostitute without any extensive long-term training, it would lead first to the death of his team at the time of the scrum, and secondly, the poor child would probably break his neck! How good is that for the team that I ask you? Finally, the high emotional tone of the film is too much, because even though rugby is a great sport, and builds great friendships and team spirit, it rarely gets out of control. I've seen real-life football drama with less excitement than this movie and it looked great, but in this one Sean (Penning) acting skills is dragged too far and the film's attempts also force an emotional response from the audience, boring and difficult to watch at times. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has made some great sports movies over the years, but the next time they venture into a sport they have just won in the United States, they should try to do their homework and maybe get some experts in the fight. <br /> <br /> MAKE SURE OR DO NOT DO IT AT ALL!
