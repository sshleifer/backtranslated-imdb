I rarely give one or ten stars to any movie, but it was so horrible that I had to make an exception. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of science fiction and have seen some comic shots on SciFi that I genuinely like. There was simply nothing here to like. <br /> <br /> I know this was started on an extremely small budget by a film student. But even considering this, the sets and effects are bad. Cinematography is mediocre, but it may be the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. A sad state when the female voice to the computer is the best actor. The dialogue is bad. The script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor is not only subtle and sublime; There is nowhere to be found. As an example, a total of 20 minutes of the 80-minute movie is spent on a joke combined with the alien mascot and elevator. <br /> <br /> This should be a parody of everything from The 50's SciFi to 2001. What we have, however, is only a slightly updated version of an old C SciFi movie from the 50's. At least these movies were funny because they took themselves seriously.
