This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Independently or not, solid writing is a must. Same for driving and acting. I know these actors can act (I saw them in Sporanos and more ...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. Maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. Probably a bit of both ..... Probably much of both! Technically OK, Just Bad, Bad, Bad ... I have a theory that the supporters of this movie also own the Poker magazines, because I saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. "Hey, we did it, so it has to be good, right?" Not so fast Bucky. I know it takes a lot of work and money to make a movie, much less to be sold and distributed, so I congratulate these people. But the final product leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> Q. I won a free rental and chose this Blockbuster movie. Tomorrow I'm going to get my money back.
