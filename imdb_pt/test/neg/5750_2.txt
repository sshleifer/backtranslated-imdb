Well, now that all the friends and relatives of the board / producer posted their shills reviews after seeing this at various festivals, I think it's time to show written comments by people who actually paid $ 10 to see it. As the director "Dear Jesse" (the only other one of his films I have seen), "Loggerheads" suffers from lack of focus and many ideas heaped on an indie budget. I swear, this guy might have more luck making miniseries. I kept waiting for the various plot plots to come together, but they only intercepted at blatantly forged points in an obvious way for all but the most dense viewer. It was like watching a season of TV movies made for life in one, long (I said LOOONG) drawing on the old "Carol Burnett" show. Maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim, "Hey ... remember all the girls' movies we went to last year ... the one about the foster mother ... the one about the guy gay ... that about the Christian housewife.We went to THREE Chick Flicks last year so now we have to go see Terminator 4! "I think someone has to do anything to hire a family actor to get funding , but what, oh, Bonnie Hunt is doing in this movie? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this "performance" attempt will not be sending Oscar to her door. I mean (speaking of Lifetime Original Movies), Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett were not available? Ms. Hunt always felt so cold, maybe she should have played the other mother? I wish I had chosen "Capote" to fill my Indie Weekly Gay-themed Allowance..oh well, maybe next week. I think there's a good reason why Capote is playing in many theaters throughout the NYC area and this is playing in only one; Let the distributors believe this movie to run in the opposite direction if you do not trust this review!
