Okay, so I forgot to watch and just caught the last episode, thinking it was the first or the second. Honestly, I thought CM would have at least one more share to solve the plot points. The Rangers are stranded on the plains ("We're going to have to eat the horses"), on the one hand. Little Newt is devoid of another. What a bad ending! But my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the end, is that the episode had no suspense, no great climax, no dramatic confrontation. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was poorly staged. The whole episode had a terrible rhythm, which is what drives a western. Steve Zahn was watchable, Karl Urban (one of Johnny Knoxville's names) played Call as a man with a terminal case of trismus. All menacing stares, thorns and jutting chin. And what about the Rangers? They talked loudly, cleaned Texas, then walked aimlessly in the middle of the city, getting drunk. And how cool of Hal Holbrook to lend Val Kilmer his wig and Mark Twain's stache! Austin's set was like the faux Rock Ridge Blazing Saddles, every facade. I admit that I was drawn to the plot, but this is mainly because there were many things that I did not get, thanks to the end of the story. If I had watched from the beginning, I might not have made it to episode three. Now I have to go watch Silverado to clear my palette.
