This is a bit more stylish than the ordinary erotic thriller and Peta Wilson is a very sexy presence but it seems like they missed some pages of the script somewhere. Subplots come in and out of nowhere, the connections between some of the characters are obscure and the killer's motivation is not clear, to say the least. Maybe they could get away with it in a porn version, but more clarification is needed here.
