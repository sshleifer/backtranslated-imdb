I do not even know where to start. I did not like that. It did not behave like a story and a lot was injected into the movie (the brownies, the son was gay (?) The murder was justified, what possible motive could there be in the script for Linda aka Penelope to exist) that was never explained. It was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping from the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor. <br /> <br /> Why did Vanessa Redgrave make a small five-second participation? Why did Diane Wiest use her character Bullets Over Broadway without the fun of the camp? Why was Jane Birkin on the plot to begin with? The list has no end. The movie is over and we all looked at each other - like - did you understand any of this? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you one thing, if I watched my lost dad be murdered I certainly would not do it t embrace the killer. Tell him something else, if "Bob" ended with "Bob" what purpose to hide the son in the closet have? Was Bob going to have sex with Bob in front of his son? How did the killer contact his son so easily? <br /> <br /> If this criticism seems confusing, it is because it was a waste of film, talent and time. What the hell does the dead shrink have to do with anything !! <br /> <br /> Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen because it should / could have been better, stronger and should have made some kind of sense. Any sense. Instead, we are given a dilute "Diva" (the 70's movie complete with a murder) and tired performances reading boring words from a script that is completely insane. By pass it folks. Or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this movie are too stupid to understand everything - after all, it's a French movie.
