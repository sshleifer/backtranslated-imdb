I'm right to think I went to see the same movie as everyone else .. this movie was terrible. I am a fan of all 3 series of the gentlemen's league and have always respected the originality of the writers, even when the format changed in the series 3. This film, however, was a saucy half effort, the plot was extremely poor having the characters going to the real world made this movie see more as the ultimate action hero. There were about 5 moments in the movie that had a light laugh but the rest of the time I was wishing it would end. That would have been better as a short 10 minute on the DVD .. was more of an explanation of what they planned to do, and it seemed that some of the writers disagreed over the fate of the characters and made a joke of it by killing it in the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan of the gentlemen's league then you will hate this movie. If you watch just because there was nothing better on the TV then you will love it. <br /> <br /> Someone support me !!
