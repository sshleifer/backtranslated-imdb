Let me start by saying that you know that a movie is poorly executed when extras make the cover. With that being said, anyone who says this is the worst movie of all time is being dramatic, and anyone who says the movie is great is completely delusional. The movie "is what it is". And what is this ... A modest budget ($ 4 million, I estimate) studio sequel. The movie is not terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that leads me to problem one, just like Dirty Dancing would not be what it was without Swayze, Road House is not the same without it. The lead lacks depth, character and sympathy to carry the film. I feel the lead was badly launched and the producers should have worked hard to get Patrick to do it if they were to make a sequel. The other cast was patchy with prominent actors like Will Patton alongside players of the day who could not act out there from a paper bag. Busey, who I've seen make great characters, looked like he'd just sent them off. Ellen was well interpreted, except for not being as believable as a maid. Sherri, the DEA agent in the first bar, was a hottie and a good actress, but her part was strangely small and undeveloped. The writer has totally missed every opportunity to add depth and interest to the story and the characters. Instead, opting for a base of a dimensional film. Which brings me to the biggest problem, the script ... I had a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three writers separated by an "e" and a "&". He seemed very amateur. And that's what the writing was. I heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was made and began hard core suction. Some cute parts of the movie to watch are ... During the first secret meeting, the obvious drug trafficking under the table. "Hey, let's meet in a crowded bar, I'll pull a piece of cocaine out of my coat and you pull the money out so we'll put them under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!" Second, I love it when someone is shot in the chest and you see him sitting happily as a lark 10 minutes later. There are some nasty editing cuts at the end of the movie, especially during fight scenes and when the main character is running after doors and runs to an employer. Which brings me to the realism of the DEA training, I'm not so much going to be technical ... But jumping through the doors is not standard training ... Neither the typical female agents, who blow their butts to do it on a man field-oriented, act like weak characters ... Boring! Thanks for the chauvinistic vision Heir Director. There are other things I could teach a course in a school about it ... The accelerated fight, the idiot dialogue, the recycled history ... etc ... But beyond all that you simply can not like the former Mr. Applegate, he does not have the humble coldness of Zen that made Mr. Patrick Swayze so mean. He just looks like one of those five-foot actors who think they're a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit he comes across a very mean guy (Chuck Zito in Van In Case) and he gives him a lesson on "badassdom". So what I feel is the main axis of the movie, if you're a villain, you're an idiot, you do not have to try. Example: Swayze! If you're a handsome kid trying to prove that you're an idiot among other things ... So, well ... You're the reason of your audience, the Average Joe ... Do not rent this movie, and if they do they will write comments like this.
