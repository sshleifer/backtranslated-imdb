Ben Affleck, about to get married, is shaken by a plane crash and engages with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to go insane). Who is to blame for this ugly, inept swamp? It's so poorly edited when I looked in the credits that it was not to read the publisher's name - it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Filled with clich√©s, controversies and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye makeup, the film does not even bother to create chemistry between the two main characters. Laughs are nonexistent: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck could have given a great laugh if it was not so stupid (the bar patrons - a big and loud bunch of them!) Yell for Affleck to undress and start digging. your money). It's not supposed to have any meaning other than to get Ben to loosen up a bit, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong, and the result is not seen because the idiot editor cuts ... or was it all the movie he had? It's a small moment, but it's typical of this movie, an amateur piece of pop stuff that wants to be a modern and daring comedy, but it does not have the guts. It's tailor-made for the bottom shelf in your rental store. * in ****
