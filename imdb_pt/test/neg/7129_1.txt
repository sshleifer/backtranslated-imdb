Do not waste your time or money going to see or even rent it. It is by far the worst move I have ever seen. Your two hours (long time) of your life will never come back. If you are looking to be afraid, go see something else. We went with someone who still has nightmares about the Gremlins and she was not scared. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt to make money. Now, before you begin, let me tell you that I loved the first Grudge! However, the second is a different story. The plot is very deep and intricate. However, in the end you're wondering "what the heck was this or that." The acting would be considered poor in a B-list porn movie. I could put several examples, but I do not want to ruin this for those who are gluttons for punishment, but I can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words ... spreading out.
