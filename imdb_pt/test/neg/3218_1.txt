What is the deal with all these ethnic groups copying movies related to the Italian mafia? We all know the godfather as in Don Vito Corleone, we now have this Mexican that is just a narrow out copy. I can not see why other ethnic groups have to imitate and imitate the Italian mobsters, but they sure look ridiculous. They sure look like Italians wanabee. I would much rather have the Mexicans realize their own ideas and enjoy seeing their culture and the way they do, rather than copying ideas from the Godfather trilogy. Also, the film was disappointing, seeing Mexicans acting and trying to be Italian is not my thing. After watching this, I now watch the "Real" Godfather so this movie can be erased from my memory.
