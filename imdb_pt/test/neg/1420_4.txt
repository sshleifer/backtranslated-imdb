Interesting and short film describes some of the machinations around Jay Leno replacing Carson as host of the Tonight Show. Currently the film is very current considering the public drama around Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of arousing viewers' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of stakeholders, particularly NBC executives. Ovitz's portrait was particularly attractive and interesting, I thought. <br /> <br /> Even so, many of the characters were only briefly quoted or touched, and some of the performances seemed superficial. However, an interesting story.
