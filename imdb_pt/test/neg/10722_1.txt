Part of the film's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. While this is good for drama, in comedy, we know that pain does not need to be emphasized. As a result, Fun with Dick and Jane is not an appropriate title and I was just disappointed not to see any fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy of the movie of the same name, but failed to run and the title was not appropriate for the plot. <br /> <br /> However, if the film was renamed to be "The Art of the Steal" and the emphasis on slapstick comedy spoils more the robbery and plans to steal (stupidly, of course) would have given the film a great momentum. Although, at the same time, the movie must show the CEO, at least at the beginning, that he is a cheater, it will be easier to project the problems to someone responsible from the start and simply leave him like this. The film takes a point of view issue and with that in mind, a comedy can not work if the point of view is not done correctly. An intriguing husband character who is that of a Wile E. Coyote in the Road Runner would be funnier, including the slapstick comedy. But in this case, a robbery instead of catching the bird with complicated contraptions would be extremely funny here. I mean, you can do a lot of them and put them in the movie. But as the point of view was wrong, the part of the assault had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You'll enjoy the movie in the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's big rise), but to solve the problems you faced. <br /> <br /> To be more comical, since it's a comedy, this is the part that needs a major overhaul. It might be funnier if the issues were viewed more as John Travolta's Civil Action during the fall. This movie was serious, but the problems they faced were a bit comical.
