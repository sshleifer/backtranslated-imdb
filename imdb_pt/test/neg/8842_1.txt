I'm looking at all the good comments on this movie and start thinking to myself ... Am I going crazy ...? I can not see the beauty of a movie like this? Am I dumb enough not to understand the message this movie is trying to show? I do not know ... maybe one of those lizards has popped into my head and eaten my whole brain too. The idea of ​​the movie was not going anywhere ... I was sure it would have a nebulous ending, and of course ... it happened! Nothing exceptional ... Not even the scenery (I jumped it being placed in a mountain village at least the scenery would be nice .. but no). Just a stupid story about a crazy teacher and, of course, her crazy pupils ... now all grown up, each one of them ... with their own fixed ideas. And boy some of those ideas were stupid .. like the lizard story for example. At one point I thought I was watching x files ... with the lizard coming in and everything. No ... from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if you pay the ticket) The only part that I liked was the performance of the young blue-eyed "German" boy ... He played a lot well and convincing for his age ... The rest ... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the screenwriter and director were both stoned when they came up with these ideas. Well, considering there are a lot of people who enjoyed this movie ... I think to myself again ... Maybe I'm the crazy one. Advice..Don't waste your time on this!
