A complete zero of four. A worse summarizes Ajooba: horrible. In fact, more words come to mind: ridiculous, third-rate and terrible. This is one of Amitabh's worst movies of all time, he's in his pajamas wearing a cheap leather jacket and an equally cheap Zorro-style mask with what appears to be wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in antiquity. Persia or Arabia and is characteristically not historical for an Indian film. As stated above, a K-Mart leather jacket with velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago, unless all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also does his patented cross-dressing in this movie. Far from being funny, it's very embarrassing to watch. What could have the son of the legendary Raj Kapoor to skin the memory of his house as it is on the screen? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if you want a real laugh, go ahead and watch this movie. The glaring inconsistencies in the plot and costumes are no match for the terrible dialogues and poor acting.
