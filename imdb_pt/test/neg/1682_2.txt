I give the show a six because of the fact that the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans as the Cosby Show went to Bill Cosby, he dealt with a lot of problems with humor and felt that actually tailored to get one laughing instead of letting the jokes come from the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a smart person. He's phenomenal in the movies, but on the show he was there because of the joke and despite loving it, I felt that laughter was more important than plausibility. Jay Kyle I've loved her since House Party and we liked her at School Daze and Martin, this was a big part for her and she made a great choice in choosing this comedy to co-star. I also feel that Jay and Michael were more like equals on the show, but Jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands with the lines and followed her path of unorthodox discipline because she may have found it worked. <br /> <br /> Just stupid, your character should have been well developed and yet he has his moments of greatness, we are returned to stupidity as if he did not learn anything, which drives me crazy !!!!! !!! Not to mention that most of the situations (in episodes I've seen) seem to center around him <br /> <br /> Clair The attractive sister who dated a Christian, I found her boyfriend's character more interesting than she would rather stay in the movies, writers should have done more to show their intelligence, but it's not stereotyped enough) <br /> <br /> Lovely Kady and the youngest daughter. I think the writers established her character more in the show, in addition to the parents and Franklin. <br /> <br /> Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they derived from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry), which lasted only one season. They did a great job of scaling for this little genius (the effort would have been made if Jr were the smartest, but show the bad sides too) <br /> <br /> All in all, this sitcom is a marvel. thing and is a tribute to the Cosby Show is well done, I love the show and wish it had stayed longer than that. I can not wait to see the end of the series
