When a loser teenager is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero Dragonfly ... Superhero Movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. Unfortunately, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with the films Airplane !, Top Secret and The Naked Gun), he still suffers from the flaw that the latest fakes have ... especially, it's dumber than fun! The fault lies mainly in jokes. It just is not funny enough. Some of the jokes work, like the scene of the nail guns, but other parts simply fall suddenly. The parody of the X-men, for example, or the whole sequence of farts. Saddles on fire it is not! One of the main things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane, is that while the dialogue is extremely funny, the cast for most of the game is completely straightforward. This makes it even more fun. Even when there is simple dialogue in the foreground, there may be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other fundamental thing is that they all have a kind of plot, to hang the jokes. <br /> <br /> The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various films, THEN try and imitate them. As a result, the so-called plot of these films rarely exists. Another flaw that these movies have is that some of the scenes were really funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoofing scene! The cast tries to get into the necessary spirit, but with a lot of dialogues and dull scenes, it's hard to get carried away with it. <br /> <br /> As recent spoof movies happen, it's not as bad as the epic movie. , Date Movie, or the horrible Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good and funny movies in the past, it's far from good enough.
