1 Bun Yeung is in the movie for ten minutes, including when he is serving iced drinks to his boss. Many street thugs who look like junkyard owners are instantly dominated by the Asian superhero, who speaks like an illegal alien in the back of a dung truck. 3 (villain) leave it to me -shirt off, gay model like heee-haaw muscles! hee-heeew! hap hap! - he is dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or broken balls - 4 cheap semi-sexual scenes, in which the white wide comes out of nowhere and digs the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (ex-action-movie star C) does nothing more than act out an eccentric gun smuggler who picks up white pick-and-shooted white girls in a nightclub where they follow an idiot posing as a millionaire taking pictures (you reap what you sow) 6 Yes, the local police captain is involved, and yes, the first massacred policeman is the super-patrol companion of the superhero (yaawn!). 7 action scenes are fake, like A) hee-haw! Chinese tries some kicking kick B) Chinese thin leg to black thug's throat C) ending death move to his head as much as Walker Texas ranger fake final action 8 titles finally total junk. These people are good enough just to be standing or doubles in other C movies and be credited collectively as "stunts provided by the county jail".
