Very strange. But he meant to be. This director is his own man. Even if there are tensions if Polanski, Bergman and Kafka, at least in episode 6, the pio-tom. What made it all so strange, and reminiscent of the three artists above, was that it ran all over the place, you never knew where you were going, and it could have ended anywhere, and finally, when it ended, it could have continued. The end is hardly a purpose, no one could say what these two characters would be doing in the next frame. One other thing to say about the director: no wonder Kubrick found him fascinating. There are many Eyes Closed in this episode in some way, in the direct approach to the character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick placement of the camera without any of the strong effects, much more washed, and rushed, not so exaggerated. That said, back to the beginning, still this guy has his own things to say and tells them well. However, for some reason, there is not a single scene I want to see again. But he definitely did not feel cheated at least watching her once. But I still felt the sensation of three or four other ghost directors going through the parade, obscuring everything. The caveat is that it was only the sixth episode: the other nine could give me completely different views. But as this episode revolved around spying, looking, absolute mastery of the cinema, I would say that, he did not take any of the usual routes, definitely went his own way while carrying with him the baggage of many good directors.
