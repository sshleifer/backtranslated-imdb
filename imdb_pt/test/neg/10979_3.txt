This movie starts at A and never reaches B. Its title promises much more than the movie delivers. It is superficial and full of the usual clich√©s of a story in which a subject questions his sexuality. The people are nice, even the mandatory flamboyant type. The protagonist (Kevin McKidd) acts to the extent that there is a reason for him to act. Simon Callow, playing a straight with horny, is always worth watching, and he is by far the only reason to stick with the film. However, rubbish about the group of your men's "meditations" or whatever, it becomes extremely tiring in no time. They seem to have been thrown into the light film mix in a misguided effort to vary the scene and uninterrupted inaction. The same comment applies to a really strange and unconvincing camping trip. Do not worry about pausing the tape so you can have a snack. Let the thing run; you will not miss a thing. The character of Hugo Weaving is superfluous. It appears in a sequence with one of the minor derivations and does not even find the rest. The outcome of this sequence is not explained, and Hugo's real estate transactions have nothing to do with history. The film is a total disappointment in the end because there is no resolution. The thing just disappears and we are sent to the final credits. This is a structureless interlude.
