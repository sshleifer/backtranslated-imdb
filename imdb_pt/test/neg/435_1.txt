I just do not understand. Why call it a sequel to the movie "American Werewolf," when you have absolutely no connection to it? The first film was funny * and * scary with innovative special effects. (If memory serves, the Oscar category for special makeup effects was * created * for this movie). "Paris" is nothing like that. Terrible effects and not much else. I do not see this movie. Rent the original "Werewolf in London" instead. You will be much happier.
