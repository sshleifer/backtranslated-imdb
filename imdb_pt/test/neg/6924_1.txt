Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a moderately successful magazine writer, while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Fortunately for her, Chloe gets a great role in a sitcom and moves temporarily to Hollywood. Losing her, Owen booked a flight to LaLa Land as a surprise. When he arrives in his trailer, however, the "house" is shaking, while Chloe and her co-star are having a little romantic date. The writer and the actress are gone. Wounded and mad as a hatter, Owen returns to New York. Friendly friends decide to put him on a blind date with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his bad mood. But, it goes badly, as the duo mixes like oil and water, mainly due to each having a strong personality and huge chip of Owen's shoulder. However, in the coming months, surprisingly, Nadine and Owen become friends, who trust each other and go out together. Can it become something else? Well, who the hell cares! This movie is so STUPID that most people will take it off the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, somber and stupid as well. Then again, Krumholtz also gives a very nasty and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who could get along with the lines she has to let go? William Baldwin, too, reaches a low career with his raw role and crazy sex as Owen's brother. The only cast member who is good is Richards, but she must shrink when she looks at this one. Okay, the costumes and production values ​​are adequate. Then there is also an intelligent element in which the characters occasionally speak their lines, but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are really thinking. This does not save the movie from the "bomb" status. Do not be stupid, dear movie and romcom lovers. Do not rent, buy or borrow this gigantic turkey. I am the stupidest person in the world today, to watch this THING until the bitter end.
