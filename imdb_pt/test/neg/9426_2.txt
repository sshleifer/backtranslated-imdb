This is a low-grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a novel. It may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of the 1950s thought of the USA, but there is little else to compliment on the tasteless plot, the acting of wood and the grater style. There are some interesting photos of long-vanished aircraft, but that was not enough for even airplane enthusiasts to leave it on the screen for the entire length.
