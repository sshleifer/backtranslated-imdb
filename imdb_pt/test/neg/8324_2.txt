(This review is based on the English version.) <br /> <br /> Orson Welles' legendary unfinished epic was just that - unfinished. It should have been left as such, not thrown together in this awkward and boring compilation of any available material. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure it was done with the best of intentions, the filmmakers not only have failed to do justice to Welles's vision, they have also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version on the public. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impresses the viewer is the amateur quality of the audio. The newly dubbed voices are not only bad performances, they are also inconsistent - Welles's original recordings (using his own voice, as he used to do) were retained in a handful of scenes, and they do not go well with anything. There was no attempt at consistency. Add to that an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimum of sound effects and atmos - a long sequence during a huge festival (including the execution of the bulls) sounds as if it were recorded on a deserted suburban street with about three people doing the sound of a crowd that should be in the thousands. <br /> <br /> However, the real problem is the unavoidable fact that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete, and it is clearly obvious to see this. The film consists of a handful of scenes stitched together and dragged to ridiculous lengths just to compensate for the runtime. Case in point - the sequence in which Sancho looks for Don Quixote in the city continues forever. It is only Sancho approaching the people in the crowd, asking the same questions over and over - there is no way Welles intended to use each shot in its entirety, but that is what appears here. It lasts for over twelve minutes, when, in fact, it would probably have lasted about two minutes at most in one final film version. <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the film is relatively complete and fairly well done, the rest have huge holes that simply can not be filled with an endless overlap of the Spanish countryside and even more pictures of Don Quixote and Sancho. back and forth. There is no end either. No resolution, no conclusion, no joke, no point. <br /> <br /> Although there was material in private collections that was not available to the filmmakers, this could not explain what it would take to turn it into a movie. complete and coherent work. Welles simply did not complete the filming, largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before they could finish. <br /> <br /> However, leaving aside the fact that it was not complete, and could never be, one would think that just seeing a collection of images of this masterpiece that could have been would suffice. Unfortunately, putting everything together in such a sloppy way, you get a very negative impression of the film in general. In particular, what was clearly a great performance of Akim Tamiroff, since Sancho is completely ruined with the new voice and with long drawn scenes that end up making him simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles's vision for this film was something much more ambitious and complex than a simple recount of the story of Don Quixote, but it has been tried here and as such, the point is lost . The only person who could have collected all the material on anything worthwhile would have been Welles, and he did not. <br /> <br /> The filming could have been used much better in a documentary about the entire saga. of Welles trying to make the movie. Welles himself came up with the perfect title for a document such as "When are you going to finish Don Quixote?"
