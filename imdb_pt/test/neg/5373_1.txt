For a while I was addicted to shows like Ghost Hunters and Destination Truth and other things, even though I thought they were full of crap, I found them interesting and fun, which is why we watched entertainment TV. It's fun to turn off the brain and believe that every shadow captured on camera is not just a shadow, but the tormented spirit of a madhouse or something, as long as you can return to the real world later. Having said that, enjoying paranormal state requires more than simply turning off the brain, it requires you to consume lead in large doses regularly during your childhood, then suffer a repeated head injury, then take a little paint in adolescence. So you have to get high / drunk and watch. The Paranormal State is beyond pseudoscience (which I can appreciate with a degree of critical thinking) that you'll find in Ghost Hunters (which I still find to be a reasonably interesting and entertaining program), it's pseudo ... all. <br /> <br /> The show follows the adventures of a group of Penn State University students (not to be confused with the University of Pennsylvania) led by Ryan Buell as they are charged with exorcising demons and spirits using ceremonies of any religion seems to be more dramatic at the time (ranging from Catholic exorcisms performed by college students to Wiccan spells cast by socially awkward Goths, Native American cleansing rituals). credit, these are performed by Native Americans). If you believe in Wicca or are a Catholic or a follower of traditional Native American religions, I think you'd like your cleaning rituals to be performed by someone who ... is not a misfit college student with some free time. I do not remember the exorcist scene where the priests raised their hands and said, "It's no good! Call a club after state college." This is too much for us, they probably read the Wikipedia article on exorcisms. " The show is downright insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. The sequel to the opening title of the show has Ryan talking about PRS (The Paranormal Research Society), saying that when he came to Penn State (note that you do not see any show where the host says the same thing, but instead of Penn State says "When I got to MIT" or "After I started my degree in theoretical physics ...") he met other people with similar interest in the paranormal. He says they are sometimes "warriors." I remember when I used to pretend I was a warrior and I fought ghosts. I was six years old. Then Ryan without emotion brings the extravagant and obnoxious Chip Coffey, who pretends to go into a trance and get possessed by cursing the cast. Impressive. I thought people had learned some sense about how ridiculous the idea of ​​mediums and mediums is after "Crossing Over" went out of thin air. The show takes itself very seriously, as this small group of society misfits pretend that they are struggling against some ancient and cosmic evil. Production figures are low, stories are boring, and unlike Ghost Hunters, who occasionally capture something anomalous (though probably explainable, but interesting anyway) in their equipment, PS demands that you believe the noises and creaks that they hear are evidence of demons, ghouls and possibly leprechauns. The scary thing about this show is that there are people out there who take this seriously. The only paranormal thing about this is that people are able to do each episode while keeping a serious face. <br /> <br /> Call me tired but I feel that the great mysteries of the universe and the afterlife are too great to be solved in a half hour TV program by a journalism student at a school state. <br /> <br /> All this being said, I recommend that everyone watch this show at least once, if for no other reason than the entertainment derived from watching a truly terrible movie or TV show. Or you can make a drink game with it. I think the second would be preferable.
