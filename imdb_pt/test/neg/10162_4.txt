There were a lot of "scary" westerns made in the 1930s and early 1940s, and although this has a strong beginning, it is not one of them. Randy Bowers (John Wayne) stopping at a 'Halfway House' saloon, is full of corpses, the barman's corpse hanging over the bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy behind holes cut through eyes in a photo, and a player piano playing "the most beautiful night of the year." It was the result of a Marvin Black gang robbery to get $ 30,000 from Ed Rogers. Randy is a self-employed investigator who spends little time being arrested, escaped (with the help of Ed's daughter Sally) and literally landing in the middle of the Black gang hiding behind a waterfall. Everything moves quickly. Just too much chase after Randy slowed down. <br /> <br /> We even got George Hayes, well shaved and playing two parts - Marvin Black, the villain villain, as well as the Good Citizen, Matt the Mute. , which communicates via handwritten messages. Getting him to play two opposing roles was a good idea, but the message board goes too fast even for him when he finally gives up doing it almost at the end telling Sally, "Oh, I'm sick of it!" You can find George playing a vile, vile villain who crosses twice in the series "The Lost City" (1934). <br /> <br /> I think this is the only 'Lone Star' movie in which the title relates to or is mentioned in the movie! Sally offers her hand to Randy and says, "He's not alone anymore!" Then cut your arms around each other as they look out, facing a pond. Sally is running away with Randy seems very abrupt and is not prepared enough for that. Long time spent on horseback escaping the sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad considering everything, but it's not great either. I would really give it a 4 and a half.
