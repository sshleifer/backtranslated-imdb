I think this is in the public domain like yours on DVD. Firstly, this is a propaganda film that feels good to be showing to an Australian audience in wartime, so it should not be considered a serious retelling of Tobruk. The first half to 3/4 is very dry in Australia, I think like so many American war movies where the recruits are joining, oh man, it's sooo long. Then we came to Africa and Tobruk, very bad things and low budget. The battle scenes on the DVD copy that I watched were almost completely black. See if you should but be prepared to use the rapid advance as I doubt you can take it after a few minutes. I really enjoyed the tacky "Battle of El Alamien" Italian lot more, also Richard Burton made an African theater war movie that was good "The Desert Rats", this movie is just a real time piece and should have stayed in that time , does not hold up well today (I doubt it was highly regarded at the time). I say the same thing about my American war films, so do not take it to the personal side of Australia (I love Australia, I've been there twice!).
