When I first saw this show I thought to myself "What is it !!!!!?" It's one of those shows where there's a perfect middle school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge." Then there is Sadie. This complete mismatch for your friends and well your family. She is completely obsessed with nature not that this is a bad thing, but she compares high school students to animals! like what is it? they also made her another clone of Lizzie Miguire (because the world definitely needs another!) she's also very perfect like most TV girls, which makes me sick! So, please, this is a stupid show, it does not make sense to just ignore it, unless you like Lizzie McGuire or any other program like that.
