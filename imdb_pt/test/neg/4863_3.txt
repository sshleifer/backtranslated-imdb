Would you be surprised if I told you that this movie deals with a conspiracy? Not? What if I told you the leader was a shadow puppet? What? You do not believe me? ... IT'S OK. Yeah, I made that up. It's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. I understand Charlie Sheen doing that at the time - another movie equaled more money - as for Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Do not even tell me about Stephen Lang. He was a lot of fun as the Crasher Party in 'The Hard Way' and now this crap. <br /> <br /> Oh, never mind. Everyone involved should feel ashamed. If you plan to make a bad movie and succeed - it's fuzzy - but I seriously doubt that's what they were wanting here. Outside, the story smells bad and we should take this yak seriously. Makes you wonder if this movie still had a glimmer of hope. Seriously, I doubt it and in such a tight industry with the purse strings as this got green firing first is beyond me. Perhaps even more frightening how this pile of dogs was successful in theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, how nice you are in Law & Order. Why are you here? Demoting himself for the role of the President of the United States, which I could add, he will be shot by a remote control biplane controlled by the killer gonzo. So again, this is a masterpiece of the work of George P. Cosmatos, who is "driving" credits include Rambo: First Blood Part II, among other gems. Hmm .... case in question?
