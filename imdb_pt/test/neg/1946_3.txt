The film had an interesting surprise. A little psychologically exciting. And the makers could have finished nicely without making it just another series of Hollywood-launched films promoting homosexuality and / or other sexual misconduct. This could have ended with a "pay-off," but there were other reasons behind the pen. What pisses me off is that the mud was thrown on your face AFTER you've seen the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Yes, of course, I'm just another Puritan. This gay content tainted the entire film. I would not judge positively a movie by artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose were to promote further political motivation, more so for that.
