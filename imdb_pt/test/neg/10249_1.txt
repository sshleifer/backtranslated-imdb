... what would a porn movie look like if you took out sex and ended up in bad dialogue, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have Galaxina. <br /> <br /> This movie came out when Original Star Wars proved that there was a market for Science Fiction. This, in turn, leads to some gems like Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, this also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say obviously because I had not even heard of this movie until a few days ago. I missed it when it came out in 1980.) Here's the underlying problem. Dorothy Stratton could not act, so for most of the movie, they would not even let her try. I understand that his tragic death gave this film undeserved cult status, but for my life I can not understand why. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the movie tried Spoof Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but they clearly do not understand that when you spoof something, it has to be FUNNY! This movie was not, or at least, the comic timing of jokes that could have been funny, no. Science fiction is ripe for parody, as Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest have proven. This movie, however, did it wrong.
