"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Chan's worst film since "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know that no one watches their films for their stories, but the plot of this is unusually lame, even by their standards, and while the fight choreography It's up to their standards, the fight scenes (the whole two) are ruined, as others have already mentioned, by frantic and distracted camera work. Even Jackie Chan's more serious fans should not bother with this offensively random, stunt-filled junk. Anita Yuen's beautiful and cheerful performance is one of the few redemptive virtues. For a good movie "Serious Jackie", I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
