I got this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents consciously take their daughter. My first thoughts were that I was never ashamed to be an Indian as well as a Hindu. I found this movie down terrible right. Please do not waste your time. As for music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the movie used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope I've shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. Yes, it can highlight how bad people in power, especially when it comes to religion may be, but to sit and watch almost two hours of this movie can make almost no one gag. If you go to a good Indian movie watch something by director Mira Nair.
