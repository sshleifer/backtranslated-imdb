This is more than just an adaptation of Bond: it's a simple theft! With sketches of mediocre characters that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this movie falls like the worst film 007. An old (even dejected) Connery tries to relive his last 12 years later. The result is a tacky and bland version of the classic hero. Give me Roger Moore any day!
