OMG what Disney has been doing lately ... most of their new shows really suck. Life in Zach and Cody's suite is very good, but other shows like Cory in the house, Wizards of Waverly Place are a drug and are unacceptable. <br /> <br /> Of course Sadie is a bit beyond stupid and stupid. It's about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows and goes through her everyday life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her boring older brother Hal. There is everything annoying and stupid. Especially Margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's very pretty ... it's a bit beyond horrible. I hate all seasons of this show, it's just terrible in every way (the first season was better). <br /> <br /> If you value your life, you do not watch that crap, it's painful and stupid
