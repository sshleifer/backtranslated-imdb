I was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of Lone Dove but this was total crap. The cinematography was terrible. Very tight shot. I was almost seeing the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. Editing was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. I do not know if McMurtry did the screen, but the dialogue was terrible. Really like Val Kilmer's portrait of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp, but what the hell was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. It even looked like it was filmed on a sonic stage using the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove have gone so badly at this? Where was your head .............. I can not say much for the acting either. It's a shame to have spoiled a western so beautiful it could have been, but more like they ran this just to get it in the can. Have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way. Not even curious to watch the next nights because it would just be a waste of time as the first night was over. <br /> <br /> (2nd post) .............. .... OK, since nothing else was on TV, I must be honest and admit that I watched both last nights of Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to say that I have not gotten to the end of the last two episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I was watching the two main characters very closely and I could choose some mannerisms that Steve Zahn did when portraying the character that Duval did such an excellent job. So I must give Zahn credit for that. As for Karl Urban's portrait ... simple dead meat. I can only say again that I was very disappointed just because I cared so much about the original LD ​​and with the others ....... I defended my feelings for a true western.
