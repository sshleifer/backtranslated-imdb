"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you only needed to revisit in the late 1950s when I was a kid: a spectacular biblical epic with well-known artists, unusual costumes, lots of extras and sequences of battles. So I went to see it; but I remember that at that time "Solomon and Sheba" did not impress me, which was a strange thing, since I had really liked "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helena of Troy" and others. The point is, when you are a kid, you disregard things in pictures that adults do not do (poor performance, for example) and you are easier to please with warriors in your armor, battles, sword duels, and action, so if you are not impressed then something is wrong with a product of this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie, although it has some of these characteristics, is definitely standard and medium. Yul Brynner's wooden performance as the Hebrew king does not even light when he has voluptuous and semi-naked Lolita Gina dancing around him provocatively. She is better and does an acceptable performance. George Sanders does not seem interested in what he's doing, and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) adds nothing like a kind of Brynner consciousness. <br /> <br /> The final duel between Brynner and Brynner. Sanders is just for the plot and lack interest and intensity (had to film, that's all). <br /> <br /> Not a goodbye to director King Vidor, Solomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as the last unfinished Ty Power. scenario.
