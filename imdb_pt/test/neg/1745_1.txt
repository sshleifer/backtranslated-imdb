If this is what's best in Finnish cinema right now, I would say that those big taxes spent on supporting "culture" were wasted here in a horrible way. Paha Maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a Finnish "European film" for large audiences. I'm sure they wanted everything to be cutting edge, smart and touching at the same time. The result sucks. <br /> <br /> To summarize: - The story is pretentious, naive and not credible. The same goes for the characters. I can imagine them thinking about how to make a movie in which "everything would turn to shit and people would get hurt and feel, you know, very bad inside, because the Finns are so notoriously depressed too, and themselves- so bad, "which leads us to the fact that ... <br /> <br /> - The film is full of clichés, especially about" the Finnish mentality ". The way you deal with people's problems and their causes can be drawn directly from a regular women's magazine or from an inexpensive self-help psychology book. ("We felt so bad inside!") I'm sure they also watched some Kaurismäki to find out what it is about their movies that people like, they understood him completely and they came up with a boring and depressing story about people through of all sorts of things for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. It's a shame they played in Tolstoy here. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And of not being. <br /> <br /> I think the worst flaw, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. The film is highly non-original. It is also frustrating to see suffering and boredom without any real revelation brought to it. I can go through this kind of thinking if the movie is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in, and. von Trier is breaking the waves. There were none of these in Paha maa. In fact, I started laughing at some point, because the turn of events was again very predictable, exaggerated and incredible. <br /> <br /> Who does this crap? And who likes that? I hope they're faking it.
