I'm tormenting my brain, but I can not seem to think of another movie like The Valley of the Gwangi. A westerner with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You must ask yourself why John Ford and / or John Wayne have never tried! <br /> <br /> The plot? While searching for a miniature mythical horse for his circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the cast / characters enter a strange lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse but also other more frightening creatures. Dinosaurs dominate this place. Now would not it be an attraction in the TJ circus? a caged T-Rex? <br /> <br /> It's not that I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie, I do not seem to have liked it as much as many others who posted comments on the film. There are some parts that I find almost inaccessible. In the first half of the movie, it seems like there's not much going on. I was not necessarily bored, but wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective I would use. Moreover, the film presents a very artificial love story. He feels forced as if the writers decided that male and female leaders just needed to unite. But the Gwangi Valley is not a total waste. There are moments that I really enjoyed. Who does not enjoy the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to make a T-Rex. You just do not see things like that every day. The creatures of Ray Harryhausen are impressive. There are some really cool photos of the Harryhausen miniatures interacting with people and horses. It may not represent the best of your work, but the effects are very good. Yet, at least in my mind, these good times are not enough to overcome the negatives. As much as I hate doing this, I have to evaluate the Gwangi Valley to 4/10.
