Television schedules (in England at least) are now packed with home improvement programs, bargain hunting, house hunting and cooking during the afternoon, the chances of any land station digging a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple . hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are thin, to say the least. But in the 1980s, the BBC did just that and guess what, I watched. And it is a testament to the overwhelming strangeness of this Hungarian-American co-production that I still remember large parts of it, more than twenty years later. To begin with, the homonymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles, only to disappear again for at least half an hour. (Imagine an American TAIL reissued so that Feivel is not seen anywhere, and you'll appreciate how confusing this is.) There's a bit of extremely bizarre animation in which one of the characters makes his elaborately waxed mustache be adjusted and stretched, bulky sound effect that makes him look wide-eyed. Probably hilarious if you're stoned, but for a child, quite disturbing. Speaking of which, the infamous hippopotamus scene is depicted in an abstract way - clouds in vague hippopotamus shapes are struck by lightning - but it's still pretty unpleasant. In fact, this film is very cold and uninviting, a sad state of affairs hardly aided by the odd-looking design, all the muddy colors, wobbly lines, swollen shapes and that singularly European desolation reminds of Jan Svankmajer, not so convincing. So to top it all off, we have Osmonds songs! It's not so much a horrible movie as a deeply misguided film, not so ghostly as a rather bad trip.
