According to "Lucien Rebatet" in his "History of Music" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS, 1973, page 338), Beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. He had a large number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "Viennese aristocracy", to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". But the musicians, even the composers, did not qualify for the husbands of "Fine Ladies." Haydn was a "servant" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died of drink or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman says Beethoven contracted syphilis before he was 40. That he was deaf because of this is possible, but it is not true. The Ninth Symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824. The Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, along with the Consecration of the Opening of the House and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. This was the first appearance on the composer's stage in twelve years; the hallway was crowded. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf, the theater's Kapellmeister, Beethoven shared the stage with him in silence. <br /> <br /> So what's left of this "female fantasy." The interpretation and characterization of Ed Harris are very good, but very linear, based on the painting of Fernin and Waldmüller, dated 1823. I have this in front of me. It shows a man who despises (perhaps hates) the world. With good reason.
