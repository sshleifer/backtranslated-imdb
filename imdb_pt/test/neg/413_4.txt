Review: Angels and Demons <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Ron Howard. He also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code and Cinderella Men. He also directed the famous TV series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (The Da Vinci Code, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Threat In the beginning, I was shocked because they changed the beginning of the film so great because they changed Vittoria Vettra's father into another person, Silvano Bentivoglio. never goes to CERN.It was cool that they could shoot on location at CERN. <br /> <br /> So the film goes on, they're spectacular races in Rome.And I also really like the part in the Chirstian Archives when they destroy the work It was also funny that they locked up the files the second time they came in, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the files and when they burst, the electricity went on ?? I thought it was stupid that Robert Langdon was not in the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) enters alone, another detail is that in the film the Camerlengo is a adopted son of the Pope. In the book He is the true Son of the pope. <br /> <br /> When I should give the best performance, then I would say Pierfrancesco Favino, who plays Inspector Olivetti. The worst performance was from the killer, which was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was performing poorly, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie is underpriced because director Ron Howard has made a lot of stupid changes. I would rate the movie by 4/10.
