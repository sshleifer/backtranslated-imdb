All professional comments about this movie claim that the film is balanced. This is the main justification for giving a high rate to the film. But a film is not balanced when the main criminal analyzed receives the last world in each subject. The director herself admitted it at the first San Francisco film festival. She justified saying that she could not miss the chance to have access to Fujimori. This may be true, but showing much of Fujimori's opinion on the issues makes the film clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare any of the other commentators to prove that this is wrong. Tips 1: Claiming that Harvard professors, intellectuals, and Latin American diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (use logic). Tip 2: Disagree with the director also does not help your argument (The director says that she thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriot and therefore portrayed it that way)
