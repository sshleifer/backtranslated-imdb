It is a shame Barry Humphries infamous character Sir Les Patterson had his movie debut in this boozy / comedy spy. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of Beatty / Hoffman stinker, Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned from the mistakes the movie made - if you're going to change the subject with a concept, DO NOT USE SPIES! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes offer a promise of something different. It would have been great to see Patterson anachronistic and rude roaming the world of Australian politics. One of the characters even points out that Patterson agrees with the current times - do you think Humphires could have had a field day commenting on Hawke's government (I can only imagine a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinks contest) . But instead of a movie that may have been clever and even a penetrating look at that world, we have Patterson running around the world as James Bond trying to save the world from biochemical weapons that lose their strength before halfway. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
