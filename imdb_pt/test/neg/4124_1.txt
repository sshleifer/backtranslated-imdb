In a nutshell, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed. Because they do bad things, they are not popular so to speak. A new chief executive comes to clarify things and ensure that the company's reputation is improved. She does this by leaking company confidential information to the press ... Do you believe that? In addition, she starts firing people she has never seen. Incredible uh? A pacifist group tries to destroy the mainframe of the company, because there is the localized plan of these secret weapons. This mainframe is located at the bottom of the building, hidden in a kind of vault. Of course the movie would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot that is the last killer machine, which resembles an Alien movie from the Alien films. The mad scientist likes the female CEO. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist instructs the robot to kill everyone, and so protects his work, climbs the chain of command and makes the film interesting. Pacifists join the CEO and another person on the board of directors to escape the robot. Further down the line, they agree to blow up this evil mainframe while avoiding the robot. They also find out that the factory was developing a man part, part machine soldier. They can erase a person's memory and replace it with that of a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists is transformed into such a soldier and will hunt down the killer robot. I think the mad scientist also wrote the script for this movie. This super soldier looks and acts the same way as Robocop, though not as funny. <br /> <br /> It all boils down to that. People are running, being chased by a killer robot, they are harmed by this, but they do not seem to bother about it, as well as limp a bit, and of course the female CEO is the main character in this movie, not can be killed. that is, survives every attack, explosion, his name. I will not bother you by chase, let's jump to the end. They have many weapons, yes the pacifist too and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, they empty all the weapons of the murderous robot. They go into an elevator that is used to clean external windows. And then the female CEO knows some magic too, on the roof she was complaining about being without bullets, and how magical the weapon is recharged. In this way, it can fire the cables and let the elevator drop 70 floors or more, and let it stop well above the surface of the ground by pulling the brake. And to complete, the police are waiting for them. The robot jumps behind them and kills the cops. Not Hilary? The robot chases them through the safe where the mainframe is, and when the robot is finally so close to it that it can touch / kill it, it stops. Because the mad scientist did not want her killed. A better name for this guy would be the dumb scientist. Although he is the one who made this film watchable. At this point, I was already pulling for the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie would end. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this movie is so loud, and that's why I wrote this review. Avoid this movie like the plague. It's a monster and I'm not talking about the Death Machine.
