For some unknown reason, seven years ago, I watched this movie with my mother and my sister. I do not think I've ever laughed so much at them before. This movie was soooo bad. How the sequels were produced is beyond me. It's been a while since I've seen this "movie," but the only impression I've had over the years has been, "They must have found the script in a trash can in the studio of a cheap movie theater, "movie," and decided it was not enough, and made it worse.I'm sure they spent the entire budget on camera work and so-called "special effects," and then had 13 cents left for the movie And to pay the "actors".
