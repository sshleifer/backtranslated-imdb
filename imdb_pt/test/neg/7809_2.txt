Young dreamer Ashton Kutcher (as Tom Stansfield) wants a date with sexy blonde Tara Reid (as Lisa Taylor). Reid thinks Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, a retentive anal Terence Stamp (as Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees on "houseit" for the boss, believing he will get closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has a pet owl called "O.J.," which becomes a toilet poop. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to get your restricted to pre-teens "G-rated" ready to rate "R-rated" raunchier. It will help if they have not seen the plot before, and especially like the idiot humor. Remember, people are paid to act like this. <br /> <br /> Daughter of my boss (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
