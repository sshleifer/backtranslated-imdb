Talk about misleading advertising! I spent an hour and twenty-five minutes watching this crap and there was no leisure suit, no platform shoe, no pointed-finger dance, not a single disco ball. I watched it on a Saturday night, and I ended up with a horrible fever, but it had nothing to do with the song. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this movie sucked. From the opening scene, you're wondering, "Where did this rope come from, and please, will it hang me too?" From his blatant prejudice against the Pennsylvania Dutchman's driving ability, to blatantly promoting the seemingly endless capabilities of Alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects taken directly from Japanese cinema, this is the worst movie to hit theaters since The Grudge.
