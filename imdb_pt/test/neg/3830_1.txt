I was invited to an initial screening of the film about four months before it was released. I had to watch the movie and then fill a package in my thoughts. It was the hardest thing to sit on earth. The show just crawls, and you quickly begin to wish it were dead. The thing is that there are two types of Mormon movies. The good with good real stories, and the bad ones who just smell bad. Saints and soldiers, now there's a good movie. But with these comedies, writers and actors just try too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they are not. No wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films; They are full of 'inside jokes' that are not funny to start with, and they just try to have fun with everyday things. It is the story that makes the film and the stories of these films are weak. I bet you can guess what my package was like when I was told to fill it in after the movie. ;)
