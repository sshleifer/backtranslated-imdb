Now infamous Western that was (at the time) the largest debacle budgeted in Hollywood's history. I was lucky enough to see the full version of 220 minutes in a movie theater in 1990. It was really amazing how bad the movie was! <br /> <br /> They had a great cast, a story based on a true incident. (a struggle between foreigners and Americans in the nineteenth century), magnificent landscapes ... so, what went wrong? Three words - director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after "The Deer Hunter" he left and made this horrible Western God. He is not totally guilty. His previous film "The Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him the freedom to do anything. They left him alone ... and everything went wrong. Cost went out of control, and Cimino insisted on repeating sequences repeatedly until they were perfect. <br /> <br /> First, the sound is horrible. Entire sequences pass and you can not understand a word the characters are saying. For example, the character of Jeff Bridges is presented during a dance sequence, but I still have no idea who he was! The dialogue in your introductory scene is incomprehensible! This is the director's fault - he should make sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are filmed with so much flying dust that you can barely understand what's going on. The story does not make much sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts - in real history, only one person was killed - Cimino turns it into a massacre. There are some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by the lack of history and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theater - all the impressions sound that way. <br /> <br /> This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. An example of a director's textbook so full of himself that he does not realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges said that this is the worst film he has ever done. This is from a guy who made "Tron"! It is a definitive imperative. <br /> <br /> There is a good book called "The Final Cut" that details the whole disaster. This has a 1. I wish the IMDb had negative numbers - it deserves it!
