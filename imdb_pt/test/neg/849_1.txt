Italian rip off of Mandingo and The Drum is a very dubbed Italian life on the wire planting. Many people who do not seem to belong to the southern United States wear poorly made costumes and wander through places that look nothing like the southern United States. The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that follows and the tragedy that follows. The movie promises hot steamy sex and lots of distorted violence, but nothing ever comes from any of it, it's all provocative. It's all probably racially insensitive, I have not been able to notice since his artistic failure. The final twist is, at best, laughable. A great turkey.
