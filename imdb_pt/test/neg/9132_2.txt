I was very disappointed with this movie. The director showed some talent in his other endeavors, but this seemed to be just a fill. There may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing more than a director who has access to some toys. <br /> <br /> I recommend your other jobs to people, but certainly not 1. While I watched, I kept thinking I would pick up after an initial slow period, but this never happened. By the end of the movie I was neither entertained nor moved or thought of things in a new way. I could only say to myself, "What was that?" <br /> <br /> There were some really striking parts of the movie, but not enough to ensure sitting through it again.
