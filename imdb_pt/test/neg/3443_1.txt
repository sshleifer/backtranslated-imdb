Honestly, I do not know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well, humor is subjective eh? but yes, this show is incredibly bland, if you ask me. Tim Allen is annoying. Jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. Al is annoying. the neighbor is boring. It's more annoying than funny. the plots are all the same, Tim leaves Jill crazy and has to fix things up again. and the last seasons? least said about them the best, who the hell things cancer would be good for a fucking comedy? yes, great idiots. so yes, home improvement is not a very good sitcom. I recommend you go watch News Radio or Seinfeld. if I had to give this show a note I would give it a 1/10 since it never made me laugh once. ever. so yeah, it's still better than The nanny though.
