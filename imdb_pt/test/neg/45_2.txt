This was a decent movie for the first half. Too cheap BOO! moments, but the tension builds up, the bad guys are scary and everything seems to be adjusting well. Children are not particularly deep, but hey, this works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> So it looks ridiculous and tries very hard - the "why the world would do that?" moments overwhelm one's ability to suspend disbelief, the turnaround involves many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from a belated attempt to philosophize some meaning in the film that leads to nothing and is quickly discarded. There were laughter in the theater at times that should not be funny. <br /> <br /> Great premise, but just badly written and not held together. Some cool pics, but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes.
