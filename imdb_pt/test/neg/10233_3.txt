I think my resume says it all. This MTV-ish response to the classic TV show Candid Camera features a Gen X type (or is that Gen Y) putting on fake and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and putting people in rather strange situations, though often not very interesting . Example: Kennedy has a guy who invites his parents to his "marriage". Kennedy is the bride, dressed in a wedding dress and a long wig. The "joke" is that parents immediately understand that their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "pieces." The problem is that this schtick continues for a long time, obviously, to fill the time. And Kennedy is as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get past this, running around, constantly asking "Do I look fat?" I recognize that the show was not meant for me. It was made for 12-year-olds who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today. Then let them laugh. Thank goodness the show was short lived.
