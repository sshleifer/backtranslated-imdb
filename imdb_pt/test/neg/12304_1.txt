An absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Gross and inadequate humor, some scary parts, and a paralyzing story about her mother's boyfriend wanting to send the boy to military school to get him out of the way makes it totally inappropriate for children who are likely to want to see him because of book (3-8) years old. Do not waste your money, your time or your common sense.
