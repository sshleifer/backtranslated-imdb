This is a weak comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's why: A comedy of man and woman. Okay. <br /> <br /> Husband is an idiot. The wife is Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is it? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is just the same guy in Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> The jokes are thighs. No spirited one-liners. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop it now. <br /> <br /> The last word: stupid. The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He simply is not here. Leah Remini is a great eyewash, but it is hardly appreciable. Wasted talent is the word. Bad comedy.
