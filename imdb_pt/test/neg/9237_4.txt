This for one has nothing to do with the first absolutely fantastic film. And of course we Americans just have to redo everything that is successful in English, because reading subtitles is SOOOOO Hard, is not it? From what I've seen in the new trailers with the lovely pregnant Jessica Alba (which certainly spoils all the fantasy of teenage boys everywhere, it's not!) It looks EXACTLY the same, but probably double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery movies I've seen in any language for a long time. I would recommend watching this and jumping this all together, there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason for this even called "The Eye 2" except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first film. Do yourself a favor by watching "The Eye" with the volume shown and get ready for some likely jumps. I watched it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised at the excellence that was the direction of the Pang brothers. If the remake of "The Eye" goes well, what I hope is for the sake of Pang Brothers film careers, but at the same time it seems a shame that people do not see / can not see the original because often / almost always the remake is not as good as the original. Watch this if someone wants to be slightly boring but the original is not a comparison to this sequel, just in the flick.
