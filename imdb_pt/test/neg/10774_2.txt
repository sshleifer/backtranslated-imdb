I tried watching this movie, but I could not get past the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but I can not help but see the fact that the dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indians are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Considering that India alone has 1/6 of the world's population and one of the largest film industries, I do not think it was difficult for the filmmakers to have found an excellent Indian actress to play the role. And I do not say this because of some blind patriotism, but because it is absolutely and utterly absurd for a non-Indian to play the role of an Indian / Pakistani. Now, some people say "as long as she convinces who cares?" but my point is exactly that she is NOT convincing and can never be - not because of her acting skills but because of her ethnicity. For example, no matter how good the actor Tom Hanks is, he will never be able to play an Australian Aboriginal! <br /> <br /> But this is still minor for the biggest misstep that filmmakers have done: dialogue in English. It totally destroys the mood as well as any appearance of authenticity. If the same film had been made in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, this may have been an excellent film. Unfortunately, as things stand, I would not recommend it to anyone other than film students who want to study "What Not to Do" in the movies.
