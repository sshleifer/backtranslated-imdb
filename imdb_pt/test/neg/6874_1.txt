This movie wasted my time. I saw only part of it and I was crying about the lost time I could spend doing something productive and useful for this land. For all who have watched this movie more than once, I am blaming them for global warming, since the amount of black balloons that entered Earth because of this crap was not necessary and if they came from a different film, I Forgiven. robin Williams lowered his standards to actually participate for more than 10 seconds in this film and Tim Robbins as he went from this film to shawhsank redemption, I have no idea. please do not watch this movie for earth safety. stop releasing black balloons into the ground of a movie that they should never have financed or released. please burn all the copies before anyone has to watch this crap.
