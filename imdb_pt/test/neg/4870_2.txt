This movie is full of so many idiotic moments, you wonder how it was done. For example, they enter the Capitol sewers and while they are in the sewers you can see signs pointing to several government buildings, and then they appear in the middle of the street! I highly doubt that government buildings provide public access through the city's sewer system. Anyway, I gave a 2 instead of 1 just because of its comic value. I laughed the whole way at the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie.
