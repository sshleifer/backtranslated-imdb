An inexpensive, cheap rental thriller that is kept bearable by some humorous plays, good chemistry between the two tracks, and especially the satisfying turnaround of James Remar as a psychopathic (and, of course, indestructible) narcissistic villain. Obviously, an image of poor quality, both visually and dramatically, with a rather resigned but not unattainable Burt. (**)
