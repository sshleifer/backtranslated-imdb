Recently, I saw Shame, directed by Ingmar Bergman. The movie was interesting and very original. I liked what it was like in Swedish with English subtitles and it was also in black and white. These features allowed me to relate better to the characters, the time frame, and their stories. I did not like how slow the film was at first and how you did not know what was really going on. At first it was mostly a story of the relationship between Eva and Jan. The film also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came of all the conflicts and changes during the film. I probably would not see Shame again, but it was a very cultured experience.
