Of course, for this film, they wanted the story to be guided by the characters. But immediately the story line makes you dislike the new main characters. The overflights of the island and the dinosaurs below did not make any impact and almost looked like a cartoon. The entry of all the action to the island is merely a repeat of parts of JP 1 and 2. The plot is predictable to the point of annoyance and it's totally unsatisfactory finale left me feeling cheated. This gave me no option but to reward the 3/10 movie!
