Bloody Birthday is a horror movie from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I found the acting very good considering the genre of the movie and its obvious low budget. I do not know what was going on with the cinematography, but it looked ghastly. Too much saturated. Maybe this is a bad download for the DVD or maybe it's always been like this, I do not know. <br /> <br /> There really are no redeeming qualities to talk about. There are some deaths, but they are not really bloody. I would not bother if I were you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15-minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very funny and honest. He had nothing good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the film was a failure, but he would like to redo the work as he believes he has a decent storyline. However, he died in 2004, so I think it's up to someone else to take on that challenge. With the way things are going in the last few years, it would not surprise me, there is at least one review per week in the movies nowadays. It could not be worse than the original, I suppose, but I do not care if it has been redone or not.
