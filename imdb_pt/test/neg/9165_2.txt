I got into this movie with almost high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and it almost destroyed that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the movie, is horrifying. I understand that it can not be easy to act with CGI characters that are not really there, but I actually found their atrocious performance along with all the other non-animated characters. The squirrels were adorable, but sometimes blatantly obvious in moving the plot of the story, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for more than half an hour in the film. If you think you should see this movie, rent it at the most. It's not worth eight dollars to see it in theaters unless you'd like a good laugh with the horrible acting.
