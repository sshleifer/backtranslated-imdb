I do not know why all the previous reviews are the approval of this movie. It's, well, not from far, but ..., THE FILM SUCKIEST I've seen, full of clich√©s, bad acting, not really ... really bad acting and has a silly storyline ... If I had seen in one cinema I would have left after the first 20 minutes. If you hate someone, make him watch this movie ... that's how bad it is. A girl who has an imaginary boy / friend who gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous ... but I think that ... she takes care of her parents who also have some mental problems ... plus the character that is supposed to be I think his laugh, the thing that should make you laugh, lime roommate is a crazy case and only makes me feel sorry for him ... and the whole movie
