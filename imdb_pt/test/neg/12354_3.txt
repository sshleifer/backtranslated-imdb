Charlie Chaplin responds to open hearings at Lodestone Studios. The rival Ben Turpin comes to the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to trigger the action of Chaplin after the studio director shouts, "Next!" Chaplin manages to enter Turpin, though. Charlie amusedly ruin jobs as an actor and carpenter. In the end, he gets a great chance, but will a star be born? <br /> <br /> There are many jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving the slapstick of Chaplin and Turpin is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is the typist in the background left on the screen at the opening of the film. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> Your new job (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
