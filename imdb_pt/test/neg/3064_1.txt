Like Michigander, I got the Michigan jokes. Very funny - make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all those lame suburbs of Detroit. Yeah, yeah, I heard those jokes a million times. I will give you credit for accurately portraying Grosse Pointe's lameness. Could not stay whiter. Did you hear those lovely nasal accents from Michigan? Where the girls talk so fast you can not understand a word that comes out of the mouth (nose) ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I've never met a Grosse Pointe person that I liked. Listen to that horrible band and that annoying and horrible background music! What is it? One from your Gross Pointe homeboy's band? Probably. Wow, what a great "Detroit scene" you have there. Funny how the Grosse Pointe people always say they're from Detroit. They are so white and rich, they would like them to have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie explodes. All the way from the thigh jokes about girls on belts to the development of terrible character. Oh, wait a minute, you mean that the whole basis for a character is that he says a lot of the word-f? What a deep personality. Great work, Grosse Pointers! And I love all sexist language, as the narrator calls the first dead girl we've ever heard of "naive b * tch." That's really lovely. <br /> <br /> And those homemade masks with Marilyn Manson's contact lenses are great. And I love how it made perfect sense why motorcyclists came and killed people. And how did your master narrator play such an obvious role in the movie ...? The main guy boyfriend was so annoying that I fell asleep looking at him. The three stupid guys (or were they two or four?), I mean, they all look and act the same!) They were so desperately trying to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead made my humor laugh in 1994. And what with gay jokes? No wonder this movie was a drug - everyone involved should have some minor issues with their manhood, eh boys? <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie was the lead girl. Despite what the other people here said, she really was a good actress. Teen girls talk the way she said it. They really act the way she did. His acting was very natural and believable. I actually thought she was an employee of the Grosse Pointe convenience store. .. maybe she is! And yes, she had big boobs, most of the women here do. Michigan is the union's fattest state, you know. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> So, those of you who think this is a Detroit representation, is not it. They are the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of teenage anguish aimlessly. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is from one of our suburbs) and $ 75 baggy khaki pants all the way! Rich kids and thighs who are crazy because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about. And they also make bad movies. <br /> <br />
