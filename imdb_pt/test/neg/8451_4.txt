** SPOILERS ** With the title of the movie taking the name of the killer fish twice, not once would you expect to see them in action biting biting ripping and eating almost everyone in the cast of characters. Instead, you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get a view of the Pirans. Even so, all you see is water bubbling and stirring while a poor individual disappears, assuming that he is being eaten, whole and alive, by fish. <br /> <br /> The movie "Piranha Piranha" begins with this. Scary Piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling, but **** SPOILER **** this is the only time in the movie you've ever seen the killer fish or fish you can never see a Piranha is the movie again. What you see is a travel diary from Venezuela and its people and the Venezuelan jungle along the Amazon River basin. Along with many pictures of pleasant and breathtaking landscapes as well as people and wildlife, but that's all. <br /> <br /> There is some kind of history that has to do with this great White Hunter Caribbean, William Smith, who ironically means Piranha in the native language spoken there, that's what the title of the movie "Piranha Piranha" really meant ? "Caribbean Caribe"! The person from the Caribbean is played by the legendary Hollywood motorcyclist, Hell's Angles, and all tough guy, William Smith. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, this trio of American tourists Jim Pendrake and his sister Terry, Peter Bown & Ahna Capri and their American guide Art Green, Tom Simcox, are on their way to the Venezuelan jungles to go visit with Terry taking pictures to send back home. Terry is terrified of guns when we find out that when he was young he saw his father being plucked by a gun. Even when Art saves her life using one when the attack of seeing by a rattlesnake of almost two meters in length, Terry almost girds him for having a weapon; that he promised her that he would not take him on the trip. <br /> <br /> At a jungle or bar rest stop, the three of them rush to the Caribbean that we saw for the first time catching monkeys in the jungle at the beginning of the movie. The Caribbean becomes more than welcome by the three, with their knowledge of the jungle and their haunting philosophy about life and death, as well as their ability to take them to the diamond mines of the Amazon region. <BR> <BR> <BR> Despite a little strange at first, the guy is so introverted that he does not seem to notice that there are people around him, the Caribbean is a nice and nice guy who gets involved in a long and motorcycle race friendly through the marshes and jungle with art. Caribbean even shows Terry, who at one point the movie almost clawed his teeth, the fine hunting and shooting wild points that he believes do not really die, but become part of it after he kills them! A little crazy, but you have to admit that this guy has imagination. <br /> <br /> It is much later in the movie that, for some strange reason, it was perhaps the cheap drink he was drinking, suddenly the Caribbean went mad and became homicidal, attacking and raping Terry and then murdering his brother enraged and feeding. he to the deadly Piranha. Trying to escape the furious lunatic and then being forced to fight him, Art is so savagely beaten by the Caribbean that he almost knocked him out. Exactly when the Caribbean is about to kill Art, he is shot dead by Terry, who after experiencing that crap is insane finally decided that guns are really necessary and should be used to kill on very rare occasions, but that saves lives. Worth watching, if worth watching, just for the scenery and nothing else. It's a shame that the movie has advertised as a killer fish, or Piranha, horror film, when you were honest about yourself, it could have been a jungle adventure movie more or less common with Smith, he has the compilation for this , playing Tarzan of the Venezuelan, not African, Jungle
