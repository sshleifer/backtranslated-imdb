Wow, what a racist and profane piece of celluloid rubbish and what an insult to the great Western genre. <br /> <br /> Exploitable? Sex scenes abound, profanity abounds, violence and gore abounds ..... all that gives modern films as a good name, especially among those who prefer movies of the classic era. This is the kind of problem that gives ammunition to the old against the movies of today. <br /> <br /> Somehow I can not imagine naked male scenes in Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey. I can not even imagine hearing "motherf --- er!" exclaimed here and there. I sincerely doubt that word has existed for over 100 years. However, the word f is so prevalent here that you would think you were watching a story centered on today's urban areas, not the old west of the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Prejudice? Well, what if all the white characters were good and all blacks were the nasty, brutal villain? Do you think anyone can complain about a racist movie? Home come we did not hear a clamor when the reverse - as demonstrated in this movie - is shown in hundreds of cinemas across the country? <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peeples wrote, directed and starred in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently he is the "Ed Wood" of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee would not be so racist. You can not get much worse than this movie.
