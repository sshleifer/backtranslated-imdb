I went to this movie full of hope. With so many capable and humorous actors led by Sir Ben, I thought it would be a little pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh, how I felt like tearing out my eyes when the credits rolled. That I had wasted 93min of my life this movie that was clearly DOA. There are some real issues with this movie and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I'm not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not a laugh in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Sir Ben mutters through each line whether he should be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to begin, much less to develop the relationship between love interests in it. 2 people banging each other randomly on the street would instantly have more rapport. <br /> <br /> 4. All the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted. Do not be fooled by looking at it because of the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold butt, he rubbed more people into Gandhi than this flabby time wasted (by the way, the dyed beards look really scary) I was hoping it was a slow burner, but it was not. final the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - for this is Frank pulling off his 9 and starting the whole cast starting with Tea and ending with himself - sorry, it was so bad.
