It was only the second year of the Academy, but they were already voting politically - Jeanne Eagels' brilliant performance on this talkie had to settle for an Oscar and the statuette was for the worst performance ever - Mary Pickford's in COQUETTE. The only existing impression was a print job without music or final editing, but wherever it is shown, Eagels stuns and captivates with its seductive and powerful performance. She is so convincing on the witness stand that, although we know she's lying (we saw after she killed the man), we, in the audience, find ourselves, like the jurors, believing in their innocence, before we suddenly pick up. ourselves. That's great to act. The film needs to be made available on video so the world can take advantage of this great performance again. (A silent Jeanne's exists in archive - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so this is the only document we have of her. ) of the files to be shown in New York in the early 1970s, the Village Voice published a full-page review, worshiping the Eagels' performance.
