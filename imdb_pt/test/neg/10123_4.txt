I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical, it kills it by bringing it to the screen. My first thought to see Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were starring that I would be seeing something from MGM that made the best musicals at the time. Boy was I wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> A Touch of Venus, starring Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, competed for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway. play the roles that Martin, Baker and Boles did on stage. Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash's musical with book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a return vehicle for Mary Martin, who re-established herself as the Queen of Broadway after a disappointing venture in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> See the names that entered this show. Given who was responsible for the book, I expected to see some brilliant intelligence in this production. Instead, I got quite a road map for pedestrians, it was as if all intelligence had been drained. Doing her best to make up for it is Eve Arden playing her usual role on Friday with Tom Conway, but it's too much for Eve. The story is about the showcase of a Robert Walker department store who kisses a very valuable statue of Venus that comes to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue disappears, Conway shouts at the law and suspects Walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Walker dealing with Gardner and what will happen to the two. For reasons I do not understand, Ava was, of course, dubbed Eileen Wilson and Walker sings just a few lines. The singing is carried by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan, who play Walker's friends and co-workers. Of course in Broadway the songs were made by the singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. You kind of think Haymes would be in the role of Walker at least. It was strange to say the least. <br /> <br /> Only three songs survived the score, Do not Look Now, But My Heart Is Showing, It's Him, and the incomparable Speak Low. Haymes' silk baritone is shown to a greater extent in Speak Low, which was sung as a duet by Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason, the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse last century, Ogden Nash, were made by Ann Ronnell. I suspect the infamous Code was in action here. In Ava Gardner's biography, Lee mentions a brief affair that Ava had with Robert Walker when she had a quarrel with her current man, Howard Duff. . When Duff and Gardner got together, Walker got sick and did not say anything to Gardner off the camera. I'm sure that the fact that the two were not in their best work did not help either. <br /> <br /> I hope some repertoire company does One Touch Of Venus and you can see Way, Weill, Nash and Perelman wrote.
