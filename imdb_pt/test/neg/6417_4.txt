This is the worst work ever Daniel Day Lewis ..... I can not believe that in the same year he made this horrible movie and my left foot ..... Please stay away from this movie .... this is a film only for the Argentine people as a curiosity ... The plot is impossible to understand ...... The writer thinks that in Argentina all the people speak in English ... Of course the Patagonia brings a very good picture for the shooting of the film, but that is not enough reason to see this movie .... I repeat, only if you are very fan of Daniel Day Lewis, or if you want to see the south of Argentina, part of Patagonia, and you do not have enough money to travel alone .......
