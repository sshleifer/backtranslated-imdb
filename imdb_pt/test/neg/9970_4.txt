It seems to me as routine as TV movies. I can believe it's based on a true story because the plot seems very clumsy to have been written by someone with storytelling skills. For example, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded villain) poisons his wife enough to make her sick, then accuses her of being psychosomatic and stops marrying another young woman immediately. Fourteen years pass before the story is resumed. For fourteen years? I would say that although the narrative does not demand, history does. <br /> <br /> Some of the particular scenes, however, are so cinematic that almost certainly were invented by a writer. Picking up her attic, Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, comes across an old appliance and has one of those black-and-white flashbacks stung on the board - she suddenly remembers when, 14 years ago, she discovered selenium filings scraping Ritter from a rectifier, carefully collecting them, and placing them in your shampoo and your eyelash liner (or whatever it is called). He later developed what he was putting in his coffee as well. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I do not believe it. I also do not believe she had that particular epiphany in the attic, or that Ritter has put selenium chips in her shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the film as a "toxic metal" and I suppose it is in sufficient quantity but it is also an anti-oxidant that is sold over the counter in drugstores and swallowed. Someone will have to demonstrate - as no one else does in this movie - that it is a topical poison. Many people tried the nicotine patch and failed. So how does some selenium in your shampoo give Marg Helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? And does her eyes become as sore as boils when she applies makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple-minded idea "sympathetic magic," but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> More je divage. Anyway, Ritter evidently tries the same feat with his second wife fourteen years later, though no evidence of tricks is produced when she becomes ill with the same symptoms. Wife Number Two is taken to Mexico and apparently healed, but suddenly falls dead shortly after her return. Circumstantial evidence accumulates against Ritter, who plays the villain with all the stops - when his first trial is tried, he SMIRKS at Helgenberger, who led the investigation. See, Helgenberger was good friends with Ritter's second wife and was terribly disturbed by his death and manners. (I bet.) And she wants to prevent the same thing from happening to the rich young woman who seems to be in third place on Ritter's marriage calendar. (Of course.) The best performance is given by the guy who plays Detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? Everyone acts by numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with the subtlety of a warning at a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. "I've been told that you want to report a murder." (Long pause as he sits down and waits), then abruptly pushes his face toward Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice, "So who was murdered? the bones of historical events, nothing prevented the characters or their deeds were drawn differently than they were in real life, I mean, what the heck, Ritter is still imprisoned convicted of murder and Helgenberger's character is dead, so who is I wish the forensic material had become clearer. Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals - let me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine, and maybe something else - which I was confused with is not that I was rooting for Ritter, here's a mathematician with Ph.D. who insists on calling him "doctor." He even corrects people who address him just as "teacher." Most Ph.Ds have this narcissistic problem. behind them very quickly. "Jes' calls me Whitey, though I know how to get a standard deviation and you do not." Average TV rate.
