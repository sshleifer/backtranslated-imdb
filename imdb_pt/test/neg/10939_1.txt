You may not believe it, but when the credits in this movie rolled around, I looked for the director's name. When I saw, I burned in my memory and never forgot. This movie is beyond terrible. Make Ed Wood movies look like Orsen Welles. At least the B movies are fun, this was a soul-damping experience. The quality was so bad that I began to wonder who allowed that to happen. <br /> I hear Uwe Boll running 14 miles a day. That's because, wherever your movies are seen, people are to drive you out of the city with flames and forks. The script was terrible, the lighting was like a high school football game and the film was a little above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The acting was performed by people too shameful of production to say their lines with some credibility. In the end, it was a movie that Alan Smithee would not have put his name on. I learned that day to avoid any movie from that man despite the circumstances. From what I've heard, this is not a bad thing to do.
