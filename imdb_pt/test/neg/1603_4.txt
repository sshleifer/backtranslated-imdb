Yes, there is a "sleeper" watching Sleeper Cell and it was me. After reading the comparisons with "24" (as on the DVD cover), I expected a quick-action joke. But no ... this series just ends. In my half-sleepy, groggy state, I'd think, "He's going to ..." and, poof, that would happen ... "I think the van will get out of ..." and there it goes. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why would Darwyn, in extra-deep cover, chase after a baby? Could it be, perhaps, provide some T & A? Hey, this works for me, hence four stars instead of three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I watched "24". Sleeper Cell, you do not have "24".
