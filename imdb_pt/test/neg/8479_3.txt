This movie is not worth going to the theaters to watch, I did and I did not like it, the effects in the movie are very well done, and you get a laugh here and there, but the story is very bad, it looked like they had stayed no ideas, and what is it about loki and odin getting along? this totally destroys Norse mythology, and I think they forgot that the powers of the loki only worked during the NIGHT !! If you really NEED to see this movie rent it out when you leave, do not go to the movies for it! <br /> <br /> They could have done a lot more with it than they did, it looked like they just wanted to make a movie to show animation and legal effects
