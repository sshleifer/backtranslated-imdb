Of course, you get to see some boobs, but if that's all you're looking for in a movie, you get more mileage from youtube. I just paid a dollar from redbox because I saw the name of Val Kilmer. Bad move. The plot did not thicken, the dialogue was poor quality, the characters underdeveloped at best. Someone said cinematography was fine, but do not expect too much. This movie moved very slowly and ended up bland. Black list. I spent most of the film wondering if any event or color scheme was symbolic. I never thought about it again because nothing was explained in the end. No twisting. He also left many questions that, as it turns out, I did not want to hear the answer. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
