I'm not prone to complain and my expectations were low to begin with, but how did that sound like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some ugly friends for actors and talent delusions, does not mean you should go out and make a movie. This should have been the cinematographic equivalent of singing in the shower, meaning I should never have seen the light of day. However, somehow this garbage found a distributor to help you escape the boundaries of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. It goes from bad to worse. Talking about low budget, a torture scene consists of a guy picking up a mug of coffee thrown over him while he's tied to a chair. Of course this is very painful because the big baby starts screaming in agony ... maybe he's asked for decaf! The acting is worse than wood (I could watch a tree for 30 seconds before getting completely bored if you can look at this litter for so long that you're a better man than me!) And the fight scenes they would be home a yard of kindergarten games. Do not touch this movie unless you like pain (in which case you should try pouring lukewarm coffee on yourself). I'd like to say it's so bad that it's good, but actually that's awful.
