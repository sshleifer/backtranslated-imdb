This initial film by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas") did not really pump my nads as I expected. In fact, it bothered me. It's about a theater troupe that sails to a funeral island, made up of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure up some evil forces and resurrect some corpses ... The leader of his group, an enthusiast of black magic and possible homosexual, tries to summon the help of Satan with the resuscitation of an exhumed body that fails, then they take the corpse to the house of a caretaker near and deserted and play with it ... Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes when the undead finally their graves and go after the prophet. The make-up effects are fine, the gore is VERY low (PG rating), and the extremely annoying characters are focused on a lot, which really got me on the nerves. I think having a bunch of terrible actors fighting for an hour should be like some "comedy" status, but I did not find any humor in it, whatever. The whole concept is simply ridiculous - how these children are willing to dig up and play with a dead body for as long as they do. The characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just boring ... Do not waste your time on this ...
