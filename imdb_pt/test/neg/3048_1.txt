From time to time I go to watch a movie that completely surprises me. One that comes from nowhere to be a bit of exciting entertainment. One that is pure fun from beginning to end. Well folks, when a stranger calls it's not that movie. It's an unbelievable stupid remake of the much better classic horror camp of 1979. Our main heroine, Jill, is forced to take care of her cell phone minutes and is besieged by phone calls from a mysterious interlocutor. All the cliches of the world are used here, from the stupid cat jumping from a hidden place to the car, that the killer can not get anywhere and anytime. This movie is bad ... not even bad in a "so bad is good way" more in a "so bad is boring" way. Skip this movie and save your movie for something else. You'll thank me later, trust me on this. Grade: D-
