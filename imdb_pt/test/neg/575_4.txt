First of all, Blythe Danner seems nowhere close enough to be Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she is not - only ten years apart). <br /> <br /> I understand that this is supposed to be Moonstuck, magical, supernatural novels, but this is beyond the pale. Very, very weak in terms of acting, script and direction. <br /> <br /> The only one that really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film watchable - if it's not really believable, since it's escalated into a kind of heterosexual dog. But captivating, though. In fact, DeGeneres and the skin photos of the young guy Capshaw are having fun together making it happen. But no one can really tell whether Capshaw is really in love with the young or not; neither her screenplay nor her performance unite us and we wonder how she really feels.
