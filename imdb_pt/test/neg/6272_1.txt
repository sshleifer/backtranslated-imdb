It's hard to imagine someone making a Tom Cruise movie looking good; very difficult, but this makes it look good. Very good. In fact, it makes him look like Sir John Gielgud celebrating the Very Good Day of Action with a brave performance. <br /> <br /> The performance of the whole group struggled to get over the laughable and failed. The blame was, in part, fair, that the plot resembled both the original HG Wells and the slaughtered carcasses of the human victims of the film to their living predecessors: they were both bled and ravished reminiscent of more attractive predecessors. . But to describe a plot like this to be somewhat sacred is to say of the Coador: "Mine, this kitchen utensil has a lot of remarkable holes," unless they are holes; in which case this movie will be recommended to you. <br /> <br /> The guilt, on the other hand, was that they were unmotivated, unemployed, DVD actors who knew very well, it is supposed, that this was their showing. end up on the $ 5 DVD shelf. And too expensive for that. <br /> <br /> So, should you watch it? Why yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.
