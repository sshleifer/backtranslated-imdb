The story: Alain, a French police officer, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body was found in Nice. Investigating the murder, he discovers that he was in possession of a list detailing the actions of the Russian mafia. Aided by his brother's girlfriend, Alain dodges Russian thugs and corrupt FBI agents while trying to find the list. <br /> <br /> "Maximum Risk" is another of the long list of action movies featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme. . As far as things are concerned, it is strictly stereotyped. The script adheres to the clichés and the acting is mediocre. There are some well-done action sequences, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a burning building, a rooftop getaway, a brutal fight in an elevator, and JCVD ​​fleeing from their enemies by an elevated train line. Director Ringo Lam keeps everything at a reasonable pace.
