This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is situated in a superb bizarrely depopulated Midlands called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It has a bar with no employees or visible customers, a university without students, a police station without criminals and a surgery of doctors with more doctors than patients. The stories are terrible - each episode revolves around a bizarre medical problem represented by a variety of extras that can never really act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up at home solving their problem. So much fun for its sheer comedy value, but I can not believe this thing really disguises itself as a serious drama. Bonkers
