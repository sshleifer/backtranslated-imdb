The bra actresses in a locker room - well, I think they are preparing the kids for the changeover time? (Boys, you should close your eyes to that scene A huge bra (34C that's definitely not the size of the actresses) swinging and supposedly talking - oh do not worry if your son takes his bra, then Taking Boys (a girl knocks the boys down ) pants to reveal their boxers - children try this at home and at school Hitting a girl in men's underwear - nothing wrong The show likes to show underwear - following panties Actress - at an age under 18 in a revealing bikini - mother Can you buy me one when I get to puberty? So many sexual insinuations to learn: for example: "Do not doubt my ball skills." <br /> <br /> "I like to dance. With my shirt." Wet and sticky is very disgusting. I just want to stick my face in this pie and go bbbbbbuuuub. '"<br /> <br />" I have my best ideas when I'm wet. "<br /> <br />" He cut my banana! <br /> <br /> "Come on boy, let's do it" <br /> <br /> you'll never guess where I found this fish "<br /> <br />" I'll leave you two to do .. "<br/> <br />" Carl y (about Sam): Did she just drop iCarly to go play with Jonah ?! "<br /> <br />" You will not have respect if your back is not erect. "<br /> <br />" How's it hanging "<br /> <br />" What can I say, I'm a great ball manipulator "<br /> <br />" Watch me beat your dad! "<br /> <br /> Spencer: That's great. Freddie's mother: Thank you <br /> <br />" Hey! Could you keep your hands away from my gear? "<br /> <br /> Freddie: Oh, and last night, I slept with my socks.Sanny or Carly: So? <br /> Freddie: JUST my socks <br /> "They did not want to be part of me or my candy." <br /> <br /> "Freddie, you know how I feel about you handling tools!" <br /> <br /> "You do not even want to know where the batteries go "<br /> <br />" It's like she puts waffle cones in her bra! "<br /> <br /> Spencer:" Well, it's spread ... to places. "Freddie: Where? "* Spencer asks Freddie to approach, then whispers in his ear. * Freddie:" Ugh! "" Wow, it's just that you always seemed ... so willing. " <br /> "I have to bring my daughter to a special doctor" <br /> <br /> "I send many guys, many places" <br /> <br /> "Yes, you have had all kinds of fun this morning. "<br /> <br />" I'm looking for some 'cheap entertainment' ... "<br /> <br /> (mother I learn how to say **** indirectly today !!)
