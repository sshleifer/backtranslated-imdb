It would be wrong and objectionable on my part to advise you to watch Killjoy 2, you must have better things to do, wash the car, throw stones at a stream, but at the same time it is not nearly as horrible as you probably think it is . . It is almost a suitable film, which much more than most of the DVD cans can manage. Killjoy 2 is greatly aided by Trent Haaga's craze as the clown of the same name, he throws himself into the role with so much feverish abandon that he almost drops the balance in favor of the film but of course it takes more than a man's shoes big ones. Tammi Sutton plays the most entertaining director since Roger Corman in Creature from the Haunted Sea and the whole thing is almost destroyed by the hurried and sugary ending. All around the place and almost good fun.
