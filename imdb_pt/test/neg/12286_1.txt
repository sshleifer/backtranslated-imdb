Adventures in Dinosaur City, although it was a creative idea, was a nauseatingly atrocious attempt at making movies. Being sucked into a TV and into a new world is interesting. Three teenagers obsessively enthralled with half-animated dinosaurs are not. Do not waste your time or brain energy to see this loser right. I would not even let my kids watch.
