The subject was good, the direction was good. Mohanlal was efficient in his role as major. The acting of the supporting actors was, at best, amateur. The director and casting director must be responsible for this disaster. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. He did not look the part or move like a soldier. There was a scene in which a satellite feed was needed for the skirmish with the militants and they were showing off a camera angle. The satellite is located hundreds of miles in the sky, so the only angle is from above. It was a very embarrassing moment. Audience these days are matured and they recognize when someone is trying to pull wool over their eyes. The director is a major, so the story may be out of your personal experiences. No problem, but the movie is as good as its actors and director. So if Major Ravi is going on any other project, he should pay more attention to the cast.
