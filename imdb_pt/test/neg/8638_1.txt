The film begins with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes that occur throughout the city and then we learn that the hero is a police officer who is suspended or probably retired. I did not have the patience or interest to check the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for the storytellers to have a deep, sleep-inducing voice, it's time to end it. I fell asleep seriously and did not bother turning off the movie either. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie was and why there were no outdoor shootings. A third-rate TV show will have more sets compared to this crap out of a movie and I still pity the actors and producers involved in that huge nonsense of a movie. It should have been produced as a normal TV sitcom or perhaps even as a local theater drama instead of putting it on the big screen. Total loss of time and money. The film should have been in production for a long time and it would have been better to have it left that way. With redundant sleep inducing dialogues and scenarios, this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
