According to this film script masterpiece (pun intended), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his theory of evolution, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. For you to see, the aliens have sent the Chupacabras to Earth and form the missing link in the theory of evolution. However, the rest of the film clearly seems to emphasize that the Chupacabras is a typically Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I really do not know where that fits. Are they saying that all Puerto Ricans are aliens? Anyway, it's all very irrelevant anyway. The only thing you need to memorize is that "El Chupacabre" is an amateur B movie totally cheap and imbecilic, without tension, character development and any form of style. Several duos of people are chasing this goat-busting monster (remotely resembling the dwarf version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly town. We have an untalented dogcatcher and an annoying novel, a pair of obnoxious cops, and the supposedly bad scientist with his idiotic accomplice. Since everyone is extremely incompetent at what they do, the monster can continue to devour all the Latino immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster itself seems to be fine and the makeup effects on the remains of its victims are acceptable, coarse and bloody. Performance performances are hopelessly terrible and cause a headache. Particularly Eric Alegria is pitiful in his first and only leadership role as the overly ambitious Animal Control employee. Yes, it's an incredibly stupid movie, but you sure have struggled with worse, less-fun, low-budget junk.
