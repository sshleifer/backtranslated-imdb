This movie had a rather interesting storyline about clones and organ use, but failed as the lead actor is so annoying and tearful that you want him dead. Not that someone is very good either, but when you hate the character who is supposed to be gaining your sympathy, the movie simply does not work. Funny, it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that reflects this with more action and a better cast, although I am not able to think of anything else but this movie if I were to watch. This movie has a super stupid clone who is somehow clever enough to find out that something is wrong in their camp, where people ride their bikes a mile an hour and fight for no reason. The advisors say that when they are ready they go to America, but our "hero" has their doubts, so he scours and learns the terrible truth that sends him to flee from the thieves who shoot and hit him repeatedly. He keeps an eye on the man he was cloned from. Peter Graves is in it and he is also Dick Seargent, but they do not add anything to this movie that looks like something that was made for television. On the plus side, when "The Island" leaves, the producers of this film can proudly say "we think about it first".
