I believe that a whole book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood started talking about such a venture, the reaction was always negative because there were many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid set that made the original unforgettable, and that's where things start to sour here, with the selection . of actresses who otherwise could do a remarkable job but who are not fit for the plays, and unfortunately were directed with the heavy hand of a director who does not understand or appreciate the original material. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction that was taken was to obliterate anything good about the original movie. This is called updating, as in draining the history of humor, grumpy dialogue and any other interesting premise. Above all, let's prove that women have come a long way except that the problem is that we really can not (at least watching this movie) where women are really going. <br /> <br /> Meg Ryan's choice in the central role is almost fatal to the film because somehow she seems to have locked herself in some sort of limbo where women do not change their appearance even after 20 years working in the movies. Her Mary, who proved to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow grew out of her interaction with other stereotypes such as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz," learning, observing and realizing she had a choice in the subject . It may not have been a choice that women would celebrate today, but it was fun fun, and part of the fun was the silly, silly routines that sometimes elevated that movie to the realm of the sublime. Here, we are grounded with a thump. By changing Sylvia's nature, the film lost much of its spark, and it's not Annette Bening's fault. I could not help but wonder how she tried to save this sinking ship and had a feeling of sinking as she struggled with the horrible lines she was manipulated. Luckily I kept looking at some of her great clothes and kept reminding myself how this lady was really talented. His Sylvia is wise, but fails, and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately, Mrs. English was not paying attention to her own work and loses control of the character who could have turned the film in a new direction. <br /> <br /> However, this was not the greatest blasphemy of all of them. . In the original, we have Joan Crawford probably doing one of the best performances of a woman. Its crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, double maneuvers and some very sexy poses. She was the link between man and woman, and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was. It provided tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the best femme fatale. A woman of intelligence we feared and admired and, most important, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as beautiful as she is, is two-dimensional in this output because of weak writing, and again, some bad cast. <br /> <br /> There are more atrocities in the movie, such as the addition of a terrible role to Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives to have babies, and Pinkett's rather boring lesbian back. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the film, as Bette Middler, who is somewhat unrecognizable in her makeup, shows the spark of what might have been. His sour delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film might have taken. Her words revive and place a great and much-needed evil in the film, and it's exciting to see that she can really fly, so she's gone. She's in the movie every six minutes, and she disappears in the middle of the mess. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that has increased our level of anticipation and really disappointed us, a movie that could have joined the film. "Sex in the City" success, which made an incredible transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and did not compromise. This gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. He really updated what had been successful before. "The Women" in her current reincarnation needs to come back and redo, just like "The Hulk" did this year, find more suitable performers, a very good writer and, above all, someone who really values ​​good movies. about.
