The perfect double bill for the horribly tacky "Beverly Hillbillies" is this equally outrageous "comedy", "undeniable", "Son in Law". The country girl, Rebecca, goes to California wild to attend college, only to be battered by the lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' "Crawl" helps you solve, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to bring the wacky "Crawl" to Thanksgiving with obvious results of "fish out of water". The only other comic angle that Steve Rash (aptly named) reaches here is the sexual angle. This he beat us but without success. Both comic aspects fail, and you know the movie is groping when "Crawl" kidnaps the combine and writes its name on the corn field. <br /> <br /> Dramatically, the film is also short, with several family attempts. and personal advice of "Crawl" ignition failure. Among them, Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino are able to raise a few smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast is merely forage. The problem is that it's almost impossible to really like Crawl, and you'll find yourself spending the whole movie wondering why Rebecca would want to spend a moment with him. However, if you are a fan of non-intelligent comedies, "Son in Law" is right. <br /> <br /> Sunday, November 10, 1996 - T.V.
