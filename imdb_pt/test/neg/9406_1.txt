Another entry in the sub-genre Pacino-As-Mentor. You know what to do: smart kids with an arrogant flaw (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, trying to start a decadent career by taking Pacino's clothes - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, right?) Is discovered by glamorous father figure and deliciously corrupt (Pacino, natch). Young Hotshot learns from the Father Figure all the ins and outs of a lucrative yet demeaning career (this time it's the handicap of football). The figure of the father represents Young Hotshot with money, prostitutes and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair. . . that is, until Young Hotshot finds its moral center by rejecting the paternal figure and all, or almost all, that it represents. (Clearly, Stone * Wall Street * pretty much laid out the ground rules for the sub-genre Pacino-As-Mentor.) We also plan to take these Pacino movies of the last days as a parallel reality. Once again, you know what to do: the Living-Legend actor demonstrates his undisputed superiority compared to a young lower actor. The latter can withstand and smile through the process but he must recognize that he will not get any of the good lines, much less have the chance to chew large landscapes before the outcome. Now, it must be said that there are two good films in the canon Pacino-As-Mentor: * Perfume of a woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, it was a one-man show, anyway; in the latter case, Pacino found his departure as a scene thief in the person of Johnny Depp. However, these two movies were serious in spirit, not just an exercise in showboating because of the showboating. Pacino has made very certain that his younger co-stars in the films since * Brasco * are far from charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well about the living legend actor. Like his contemporary De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. * Two for the Money * is the worst example so far, worse than * Devil's Advocate *, which at least had the virtues of presenting a nude Connie Nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie. Well, that's what happens when you're crowned as king too soon - just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I've seen a lot of Al Pacino movies with the same plot - and the same overcoming of the star - to be more charitable. I said "none of this speaks well"? In fact, it is humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying public. No one will accuse Matthew McConaughey of being a Shakespearean actor, but even he does not deserve the second violin to this intolerable old exhibitionist, with the additional implication that he, McConaughey, will never equal Greatness. This is Al. <br /> <br /> I did not waste space on the details of the plot. If you want a synopsis, IMDb provides a practical summary, though I think I've set out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Oftentimes. The particular medium in * Two for the Money * is the decadent world (the underworld, in fact) of the sports handicap. Pacino manages an office of "betting advisors" - that is, intermediaries between you and your betting agent - and even has a cable TV program co-organized with several of your top executives. One thing the movie hit was the sloppiness of this kind of show. . . but one detail they missed was the constant use of the words "gamble" and "gambling." If you have seen ProLine or other similar programs, you will NEVER hear Jim Feist and his companions say the word "gamble". They ask you to call 1-900 to get your choices. . . but if you were from, say, Mars, you would have no idea what you should do with those choices. "Gamble" is the F word about TV shows for sports - strictly prohibited. <br /> <br /> The game is against the law, you know. <br /> <br /> One star out of 10.
