OK, this movie seems to have been nicely covered by previous reviews, but there are some items that I wish to add. The mad scientist is producing a blood serum from a caged animal to turn a man into a werewolf. If we suspend our disbelief enough to buy this, that's fine. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would make a werecoyote. Did the public in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? They are easy to distinguish. This is weak. <br /> <br /> Second, this movie was covered in the third episode of MST3k (on Comedy Channel). Joel and the bots needed several episodes to get the most out of it, and they were not up there yet. They added enough for this sleep to keep him awake until the end, but it was not one of his better episodes. They did not even mention the blatant omission of a real wolf, and that joke was hanging in the air, waiting to be hit.
