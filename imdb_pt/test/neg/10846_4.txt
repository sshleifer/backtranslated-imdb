This film is impressive only in its banality and use of clich√©s. Unfortunately, it was obvious to the end. But do not be fooled into thinking that this is over. Just a bit unexpected, but nothing that was worth watching at all. From the taciturn and wronged hero, to the malefic Germanic, to the expendable team, the characters were entirely wooden and obvious. The two FBI agents, Smith and Wesson (gedit?), Gave some hope of humor, but this came to nothing. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of science fiction, but it's hard to find any redeeming quality in this movie. . A turkey! <br /> <br />
