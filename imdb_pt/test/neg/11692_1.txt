Oh, how horribly this movie is! I do not know if it's a horror movie or a drama, because the story and the two genres are not very well established! The story is not moving, it's slow, boring and sleepy from beginning to end. This movie really bores me! But I really enjoyed the work of the camera, it's authentic, cool and clear, the acting is great too, the little boy was the great performer in this movie, but it did not make me jump from my place. But this movie makes me take a pillow, lie in bed and sleep until the credits roll ... <br /> <br /> Boring! Not worth watching! I tell you, this movie sucked! <br /> <br /> 1/10
