A couple is separated during the holidays. First scenes lead us to believe that Barney, the character of Jeff Bridges, kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated kidnapping. The film takes place a few years later where, despite a new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to solve his disappearance. <br /> <br /> The plot is definitely intriguing, but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this movie, culminating in a very bad job. <br /> <br /> OK, here we go. The scene of the kidnapping - with the exception of two major continuity errors, there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are forced to perform a little ritual of love with signed pets drowning in excessive sentimentality to the point of nausea. We know they are in love; the speech "I solemnly swear never leave you" just moments before was thank you. Jeff Bridges's robot accent is another example. What is it? Starman is back and it seems that after a decade on the planet, he has become nasty. The whole plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of an unnecessary character who, by a fortunate turn of fate, has miraculous powers of observation. The climatic sequence itself was essentially done before only much, much better. It is filled with more hassles and another blinding error of continuity. I could go on, but something positive needs to be said. In a nutshell, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one saving face with a pretty decent performance. <br /> <br /> The 1988 original of the same name (changed from the Dutch title 'Spoorloos' to the English speaking public) was recommended to me, only to an online rental company to send me this later version of Hollywood by mistake. I was surprised to find that both were directed by George Sluizer and would be interested in knowing his motivation for the remake. I am reliably and fortunately informed that it is of a much higher quality in all areas including the plot. Horah for this, but it really does not take much doing.
