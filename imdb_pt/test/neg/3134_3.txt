Bardem is great. Actresses are great. But Amenabar did not have to do so. It is all right for him to defend his position on euthanasia, an extremely delicate matter. But doing it makes him miss the point: the movie is fake, offensive to intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are propaganda material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this mind-sick man who wants to get someone to kill him without understanding the implications of it. He seems to care about no one and thank for his love, love and attention. I think Amenabar may have made people think about this in a different way, but the way he chose to do this I believe is not correct. He could have made his most powerful point by exposing the other side of the coin without mocking her.
