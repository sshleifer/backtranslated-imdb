Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 Minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was in it and Made In Canada was a great show once too. Talking to the Americans was such a fun special too. But as my friend said "Rick Mercer woke up one day and it was not funny anymore" I guess that day was when Rick Mercer Report aired. What is the purpose of this show? Rick Mercer reads fake and crazy headlines, shows pictures of bad sheds that people send and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and talking to people who want to say something witty or clever enough to appear on TV and maybe even make Someone somewhere laugh. We should be interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a fitness team and then try to do some of his moves, and then suck on purpose while desperately trying to be "funny." Rick Mercer got old or just lost interest or is not funnier. Even his classic clamor lost all his bite and humor. Can you say that about CBC comedy in general, because how many years have they nailed Air Farce on TV to offer the same kinds of useless jokes?
