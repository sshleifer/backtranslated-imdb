I do not understand why this movie was released, it looked like something you show to your friends after you loaned your moms by hand she bought in 1987. I am Australian and work for a video store in the UK and thought that if a movie Australian arrived at our store, can not be at all bad ... dude, I was wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone writes a good comment about this movie, they are lying or are the creators of the film. The picture was bad, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh, the acting, was the WORST acting in THE HISTORY OF THE MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed and offended that they use the word 'Aussie' in the title because I am proud to be Australian and this film is seen in other countries and can give people a wrong idea. <br /> <br /> Please, anyone who has read this and seen this movie, take the time to find other Australian movies to watch because you could choose any of them and it would be better than that. <br /> <br /> I could have made a better movie if I took a camera, filmed mine but for an hour, ate the movie I waited for it to pass through my body and then I played what went out on TV ... no offense. <Br/> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!
