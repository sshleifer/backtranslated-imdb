This is a below-average "whodunit" with the cliche everyone in the living room routine. Charlie Chan is a Secret Service agent who does government work, and he must find out who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat the German submarines in World War II. There is little to recommend with this film, since neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot. Fans of Charlie Chan are likely to find this movie disappointing. Who dunit? Who cares?
