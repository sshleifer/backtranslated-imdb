Well I got it and I saw this movie based on the high score here (7.1 now), and some of the good reviews. Typically, IMDb is a good guide when it comes to scoring, although in that case I have been very wrong. <br /> <br /> The film is a detective story today, with Vinnie Jones as investigative journalist investigating the death of a construction worker. Mixed in with this is an invented novel by Dickens (called The Riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. Both lines of the story are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript. <br /> <br /> Does it look interesting? It could have been, however this movie terribly failed in several areas: 1) Acting. Mediocre at best, but it's watchable. It's no worse than your average sitcom in the UK, although for a film expect a little better. Especially with a score of more than 7. 2) Music. The music used is simply awful, distracting and annoying. Especially the pub music and the music that plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) Plot. This is a big joke. There are plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unreal that it's almost funny. Moreover, without going into detail, I can safely say that the ending is absurd and one of the worst performances and plots of the year. 4) Camera work. Sometimes the positions and viewpoints of the cameras distract and serve no purpose at all for "history." <br /> <br /> I'm a bit fanatic about movies and I watch 1 to 2 movies a day on average, but this is easily the worst movie I've seen in months. Do not waste your money or your time on this crap.
