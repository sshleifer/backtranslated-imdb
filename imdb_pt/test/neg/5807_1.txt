Honestly, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw Spider Baby, not this land. I even saw 200 motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and being amazed at Linda Cardellini's acting ability I checked the reviews here and decided it was worth a try. This is the last time I'll rely on a IMDb review. I did not know that MORONS was writing IMDb reviews while waiting for their calls to be answered by AM radio. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that mere words can not express the misery of your vomiting state. Seriously. Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is actually very funny if you think Adam Sandler is a comedy genius. Watch this movie but PLEASE DO NOT CREATE!
