I go to a video store, so I try to watch the movies we're releasing every week. I have no problem with that; in fact, I feel it is a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero whimpering and growling through scene after scene, I was really wondering if they planned to get to the point. I felt I should be paid to watch this at home in my free time. And if I knew there was another time to be endured, I might have given up at that moment. I did not care about the characters, the filming was not remarkable, and Ford made the kiss seem like a chore. Even the punctuation was incongruous and shocking. What a waste.
