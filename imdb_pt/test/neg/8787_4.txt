I'm an entertainer and an avid enthusiast, so when I saw this movie in a $ 5 box, I thought it was worth adding to my collection. While I never regret having a new addition to my animation library, this movie was definitely disappointing. <br /> <br /> The premise has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring, but before he can give it to him, he is cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea. He then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home. This configuration is not good, but it is enough to configure what could be a fun adventure. Unfortunately the exploits of the pair never reach much and everything is very repetitive. Most of the situations in which they meet are really uninspired and uncreative ... and the connection between the two is tacky and forced. <br /> <br /> The animation is good, but not up to Don Bluth's usual. standards. This is the guy who gave us The Secret of Nimh, Land Before Time and an American Tale, all of which had an attention to detail that often surpassed Disney, the resourceful grandfather. This does not amount to much beyond the high-level TV show. <br /> <br /> The music is good but it is quite forgettable and the voice actors are all wasted talents ... Martin Short is particularly wasted here as the main character. who, despite being spoken like a bumbler, is practically a straight man throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is likely to appeal to very young children, but a good family film should please all ages and people. Unfortunately, it does not have what it takes.
