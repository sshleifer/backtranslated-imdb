What a cast ... and what a waste of it. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone, you expect some quality. The film is, however, a big mess with an unlikely story that does not seem to stop spinning and twisting. Yeah, I think they thought they were really being smart about all of this. <br /> <br /> History is not only confusing and improbable, it is not exactly very original either. It uses elements from earlier and much better movies based on poker games. But for me it was the many twists and turns in the movie that did it. This made the story so unlikely to be seen. In addition, the script remains full of many poker gaming mistakes and things that simply do not make much sense. Why does anyone, above all, want to play against a card player who is known as the best cheater in the game? This is what the film is about and builds on, but it just never made much sense to me. <br /> <br /> Although the film has a great cast, it still feels as if most of the actors were miscast in their roles. I do not know what it is about Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor, but in most of the roles he plays he always feels out of place. Maybe it's your looks, I do not know. This was basically also the reason why he was replaced in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". Thandie Newton is also not very good and really annoying in her "strong" female role. And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in that? Oh, I think I could continue on the cast of the movie and could complain even more about the very limited screen time that the character Jamie Foxx wins, but I think you understood what I said now. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is not much of an original writer / director and, moreover, he also does not handle very well with his own material. Scenes often feel disjointed, he tries to put many characters and everything about the film is superficial and somewhat predictable. Also, the movie has some bad editing sometimes, which also does not help make this movie look like a perfect whole. The film was also a big box-office bomb and it's no wonder that Damian Nieman has not made a movie since. <br /> <br /> A mess too big to make you like this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
