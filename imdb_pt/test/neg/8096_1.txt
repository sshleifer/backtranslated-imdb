I was expecting a teenage, coarse, sexual, direct comedy when I sat down to watch it ... it turned out to be pretty accurate ... except it was a lot sicker and disgusting than I thought. . I do not know if the director / writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply sexually messed up, but I doubt that a normal person could have made such a movie. I probably could have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was that it needed a hard stomach ... but it is not. The movie is also terribly stingy and disturbing ... every character who has more than a second of time on the screen is an extreme ... sexually, mentally or physically. I do not know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but I thought it was ... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written ... all of them. There is not a single nice character in the movie. Humor is disgusting and goes too far. The movie is so incredibly poorly done that I really do not think it's worth anyone's time. If you like rich comedy, with lots of sexual innuendo and graphic material, watch The Groomsmen or, better still, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But do not watch it. I can not describe to you how bad it is ... you would have to try it for yourself. However, this is one of those times when I say that you'd better ask yourself. That way, you can imagine that this movie goes very close to the bottom ... not knowing that it goes through this, and much smaller than that. This film, above all, it seems that a group of excited teenagers got together, set up a film crew, and each of them got an idea, filmed and later set up the whole thing. Lack of structure, consistency and good taste. I recommend this only to horny teenage boys who have seen all the other teen comedies rich and who do not care about the quality. All others ... do the sensible thing; Avoid this. Nor is it worth seeing the booty. Believe me. 1/10
