Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a Smurf. <br /> <br /> And the acting talent of a paddle full of calcite. If you do not believe me, check out: "Alien from L.A." it really depends on her to act in 9/10 of the movie! Sure, she ends up in a beautiful red bikini top and a wrap-around skirt near the end, but that's too little (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls in the center of the earth to find him. Along the way, she falls in love with a guy named Charmin (yes, like toilet paper - make her own jokes) and discovers how "Mad Max" rejects live. Did you know that people who live in the depths of the Earth have an Australian accent? Me neither. <br /> <br /> It's bad (after all, it was MST) and also a Golan-Globus production, but after all said and done, Ireland basically seems lost, as if trying to find where the photographers are so she can do a photo shoot. <br /> <br /> And I do not blame her. <br /> <br /> A star. And if you insist on seeing this, do it with the sound off - save your eardrums.
