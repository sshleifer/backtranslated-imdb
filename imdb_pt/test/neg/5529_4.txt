Victor Jory never became a big star. He is best known for roles of later characters than for his early connections. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> Your love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are thrilling. Your kisses seem very real. And very modern. <br /> <br /> Vivienne Osborne is a standout here as well. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The impression I saw was not clear. But what a joy that rare films like this are appearing! And they are, in some kind of watchable condition, still intact. This is nothing special. But if anyone is willing to rummage through movies of their day with equally intriguing titles, you'll probably find some movies suprtb.
