Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie in the movies. But I missed that, and then I forgot about it. Oh boy, I'm glad this movie has not ruined my teenage eyes? <br /> <br /> I saw yesterday, and seriously, this should be among the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about movies that had a lot of attention, like those wonderful TV trailers, and a lot of money spent on actors and the production of the movie. <br /> <br /> The script sucks and the acting sucks even worse, do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> Please, Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD !!
