There are spoilers, but believe me, I'm doing you a favor. <br /> <br /> My friends and I like to watch bad movies from time to time. Inspired by the Mystery Science Theater and our talent for on-site jokes; We set out to find movies that are worth watching, which are not really worth watching. However, the problem comes to paradise when these movies can only be found if you buy them. And I firmly believe in not giving a penny to a bunch of despicable untalented. So as another reviewer said, movies like this are one reason why downloading movies for free should be legalized. I prefer the idea of; instead of direct to VIDEO you have direct to the Internet. That way, the bags that made this farce will never make a profit. Which unfortunately you know they do. They hire a group of actors who can not act, special effects of a high school classroom, rubber snakes you can buy in the dollar store, constant vomiting of green jelly and the two main characters that seem to change border jumping Mexicans who only speak Spanish, for the Arabs being 100% fluent in English, random nudity, a guy being shot 10 times, including one next to the head and living and the most retarded end in film history, book, cave drawings and hustler magazine. The fact that I actually foresaw that the girl charges jell-vomiting would actually TRANSFORM on a half-way snake terrifies me ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is great for making fun, but you have to make sure that there are at least 4 of you and you are spitting jokes on fast fire because if there is 1 second watching that movie where you are not laughing, you will feel physically sick. I'm not kidding with you. My friends and I were eating chicken wings and now I can not even look at such a thing without being reminded of this piece of Sh! T. <br /> <br /> This movie is one about Alien Vs. Hunter, which is by far the second worst film ever made. And I've seen a lot of bad movies. Incidentally, it is the same production company that this film and this bald is in both also. I just thought you'd like to know this little fun fact. -100 out 0f 10.
