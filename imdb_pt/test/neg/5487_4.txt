I liked all of Lilo and Stitch's movies. The TV shows were not great, but I set aside my opinions about the show when I watched this movie. And I must say ... It was bad. <br /> <br /> One thing I found disappointing was the animation. Yes, you heard that. The animation. I found its quality very degraded since the first film. Its quality was as high as the TV series, something I did not expect. If you are looking for eye drops, do not expect anything much here. In addition, the animation failed to portray any serious mood. Even in the supposed sad scenes, I felt nothing for the character, another demotion of the first film. <br /> <br /> The following was the absolutely horrible dubbing. I found it very, very unconvincing, and wondered why, Disney, with all its riches and glory, could not afford voice actors with real talent. The ability of the voice actors was as annoying as that of the series. I tolerated the series because, hey, who would not be tired when made to perform in so many episodes? Heck, I do not even know how many episodes there are (Theoretically, there are 624, but I can not believe it). However, I thought the dubbing would improve in the movie, and I was put in the face for the truth, that what they could do in the series was already their best. <br /> <br /> Then it was the horrible script. It was extravagant beyond redemption, and the writers only tried very hard. They try to put some jokes, but I find them annoying. Maybe it was not the dubbing, but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section. (On the plus side, the soundtrack was not too bad, and matched nicely with the humor). <br /> <br /> Fourth was the problem with the plot. I predicted everything, and the plot was what made the characters so unprecedented and unpleasant all of a sudden. You have the aliens get new positions and responsibilities in space. After the initial hype, they realize that they really did not like it and lost their old life. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil villain is expelled from prison after a very action-packed action scene and invades Jumbaa's laboratory to steal his experience. The experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer Earth. When the main characters discover, they try to stop the evil hamster, but are confronted in some tacky final confrontation against the experiment and possess it in an extremely weak excuse to try to make the series appear legal. The characters then give up their new privileges and return to Earth to resume their lives. Seriously, how many other movies have ever used this ending? The plot was extremely short and stereotyped, so do not expect too much of it. <br /> <br /> So Disney failed in sound, graphics and plot. The only charm of the series were the original characters, and how they managed to keep the 'feel' of the characters, but even that was not able to save the movie. I tried to like it, I really did, but I give a 4/10 grade. Another flaw from Disney.
