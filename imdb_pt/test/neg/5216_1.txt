This is another of those fundamentalist Christian movies that hit her head with religion like a sledgehammer. You know you're in trouble when the story setting is completely ridiculous. Three men are flying to Mexico to deliver Bibles. This does not make sense, since the church is Protestant and most Mexicans are Catholic. Protestant and Catholic Bibles are not the same. The Catholic bible has books that are not in the Protestant bible. I also find it hard to believe that churches in Mexico would not distribute Bibles to them. I can understand if they were going to a place where Christianity is a minority. But Mexico is very unlikely. If you can not believe the configuration of a story, then you also do not know the rest of the story. A movie about religion can be fun, but not this movie.
