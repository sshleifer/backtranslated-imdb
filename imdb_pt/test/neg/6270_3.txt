Why C Thomas Howell makes these films? Cruise (Howell's co-star at one time) makes a huge blockbuster of WOTW and Howell goes ahead with this lame effort. <br /> <br /> Where do I start here? Production Values ​​- I'll start with the good things. The appearance of some of the scenes in this movie is not too bad to be honest. The set-ups are well on points and the direction is not so bad. <br /> <br /> Script - Terrible. A series of awkward scenes that could have been put in any order you want to permeate throughout the movie. The number of times the scene faded to black and resurfaced a second later in the same room was uncountable. Very poor plot (but also was the WOTW Cruise) takes some guilt, but an abysmal script kills it. <br /> <br /> Special FX - Okay, I do not want to be too harsh here as I imagine the budget was smaller than Cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the movie the effects are poorly made. Some shots are quite impressive - mostly away from shots of destruction of bridges, Washington, liner. But most of the time the "alien" machines and tentacles are terrible. In addition, the quality of the camera is confusing in some scenes and totally cuts off the others. Acting - I'm a fan of Howell, but as he's reduced himself to acting in these low-budget films - he's succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. Watch your performance on The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He exaggerates his facial expressions, his agitated arms and legs (where did he get this racing style?) And for one last glance of grasp at the scene in which he loses his family's photo. Hysterical. But after saying all this - he's still the best actor ever screened here. Busey is embarrassing to look at and Peter Green (Zed is truly dead now baby) murmurs incoherently through his single scene. I honestly could not understand a word he said - I even went as far as trying to enable subtitles in that scene - but the DVD had no subtitles. This seems to be a real case of keeping the family as well, as Howell's son, the director's wife, and the producer of the line, all in the film. None of them are good. <br /> <br /> Direction - not bad, but not good either. <br /> <br /> Score - Bleak. <br /> <br /> Overall, a lame duck effort that will not do anything for Howell in his attempt to get back to the big time. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he made it back to list A, but if he keeps doing things like that, he will not have a career soon. <br /> <br /> 3/10
