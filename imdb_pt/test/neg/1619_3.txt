This may not have been as horribly bad as it was if it had not been for Raymond Wallace's absolutely horrible acting job! This guy is so bad it was not even funny! Your character was needed in the movie, but why they chose this guy is beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some quality Chinese movies ... I can suggest "Raise the Red Lantern" .... "The History of Chi Ju" .... "Red Sorghum" .. ... <br /> <br /> Anything but this! I was amazed at how many people really rated it highly! Really ... the acting of this Wallace loser is so bad it overshadows the other good parts of this movie. This was woken up by all 6 of us watching this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay away from this piece of junk ........
