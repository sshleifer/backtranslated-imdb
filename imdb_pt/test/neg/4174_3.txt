The idea of ​​the film was not so bad: a horror film filmed in a corn maze on Halloween. The bad part was poor camera work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the one-and-a-half hour walk that this guy took in the maze. I'm sorry, the "corn." I got this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where I live, and I thought it was a great idea for a movie. But taking everything into consideration, it seems like your average Joe might have the same idea and run a lot further with that. Bill Cowell's performance was not so bad, in fact, I would say it was very good. But the lack of talent of his colleagues did not help in his efforts. Here's the hope that your next movie will be easier to swallow.
