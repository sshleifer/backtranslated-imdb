This series has a classic story and makes trash it. Robin is mystified by a moose man in the woods and is involved in all sorts of druidism and Satanic episodes. The story is more about him avoiding the sheriff of evil than helping the poor. That's just watchable. And to complete all the ridicule, they kill Robin at the end of the second season and replace it with another actor. Some people may like this show as a fantasy show, but it's not a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight in the name of King Richards against Prince John and the Sheriff and if you want Robin to feed the poor and the downtrodden, watch the classic or the latest BBC series.
