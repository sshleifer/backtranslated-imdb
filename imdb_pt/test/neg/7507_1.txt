Just when you think you've seen the worst that the zombie subgenre can offer, along comes another Romero and his team of untalented partners to prove you're wrong. I suffered the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, which lasted Death Valley: Bloody Bill's revenge, sat down semi-comatose through The Zombie Diaries, and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and genuinely thought that the production of amateur movies could not sink. However, having just watched Zombie Planet, a two-hour pile of thefts from screenwriter and director George Bonilla, I think I've found the best in horrible zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terribly amateur effort, which is part Mad Max and part Dawn of the Dead (but EVERYTHING bad), Frank Farhat star as TK Kane, a hard fighter who kicks zombie butt for a hobby, armed only with knives, a machete, some concussion grenades and what he obviously perceives to be a really evil look. <br /> <br /> After a desperately uninteresting opening sequence in which he faces a horde of dishonest-looking zombies, Kane joins a group of survivors who not only have to defend themselves from undead attacks, but it must also appease a gang of vicious criminals who have taken control of the area (looking for and delivering whatever valuables they find). <br /> <br /> Of course Kane is not the kind of man to take orders from a bunch of post-apocalyptic z-grade boys, and he starts teaching bandits a lesson (mostly facing them in a way threatening), stopping only to periodically rescue zombie friends. <br /> <br /> Featuring a horrible performance from almost everyone involved, a terrible script, laughable effects and poor production values, there is virtually nothing in this movie to make it worth watching. To be fair, I like the basic premise that zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular weight loss drug that blocks cravings for carbohydrates (we learn this when a character conveniently explains the background story to Kane, who strangely has no idea of what has happened), but this is the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I have a certain amount of respect for whoever gets to finance and make their own film, but when the results are poor, that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. I would have kept this a secret if I had.
