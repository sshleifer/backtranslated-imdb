The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove, the rainy street and the decaying garage to the fire that is the climax of the film. He also has a wonderful sense of time both in the 1950s (opening of the film) and in the 1960s. All performances are first class, especially Mathew MacFadyen as the psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terribly magnified by his son. What a pity, then, that the story is so ridiculous. To begin with, concentrating on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, he fails to show how he has managed to exert so much influence in the community. In church, we see five or six of the main characters at the front, and two or three at the back, but the rest of the congregation may well be mannequins: they show no sign of hearing, observing or disagreeing. his; in the cockfight, no one says yes or no when he interrupts the process, but no one applauds or condemns when Caroline throws a beer over him; a situation that results in a stone thrown out the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labor pains. Secondly, Middletown (which is not really a town but a small village) seems to lack some essential services such as police and firefighters: murder can only be treated by a family member with a crowbar; the villagers watch a hell that threatens to swallow the whole city as if they were in the movies. Incidentally, everyday things, such as telephones and newspapers, are notably absent, the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat fields, and most intriguing of all for a 'typical' northern Irish environment, there is only one community Christian. - not even a couple of Anglicans to season the mix. Even if you are willing to suspend disbelief, the story itself is quite threadbare, a pale imitation of an A.J. Cronin melodrama. And the music? Well, it's beautiful in the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated non-stop for 90 minutes, it's more than a little annoying. My advice: watch this with the sound off.
