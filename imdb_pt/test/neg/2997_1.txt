This is a good time to say how good I think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on all the frustration I've experienced for two hours, waiting for something to happen, something to be said, shown, subtly hinted, to a symbol, an idea, whatever it is. No, just long and endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. Tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. Boring is the long death of the mind, and this film is, from that point of view, a public enemy. How many thousands of hours of shows will still be stolen for thousands of innocent bystanders. I do not claim my money back, just for my time and for the time of people I invited to watch this thing ... oh God!
