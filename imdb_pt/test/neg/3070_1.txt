Any movie should have an idea; Simple or more complex, you need a ... The problem with Frigate, ..is again, that when he decides to make a movie, he is so eager to do "anything" that he forgets this main detail, and how result we have the characters doing whatever, without any justification, behaving without justified reasons ... they are simple puppets going throughout the film in the taste of the wind. It's boring and sad to see them popping up and disappearing like cards being discarded in a game. Frigate always seems to have talent in advertising is work itself ... and this leads you to see what he did ... but in the end there is always a big disappointment. It's not enough to have a movie full of stars from Portuguese pink magazines ... especially when half of them can not act ... they just pretend to be funny. Here my only positive point goes to the actor Helder Mendes ... one of the few non-stars: He makes the effort to establish some credibility, and in such a messy movie without any direction (of any kind) I give him credit . for trying hard. But this movie is worth checking out as a "how not to make a movie" manual ... and if the previous works of Frigate were bad ... this one is a "masterpiece" in the conquest of the title of AWFUL. In a nutshell, .. Just take a look! This will do you good, and if you marry your family movies ... and always feel bad about your work ... then spend 30 minutes looking at that professional job so "called" ... your home made things will look like Powerful Hollywood Flicks compare to Lucky Nope.
