I once had a conversation with my parents, who told me that British film goers in the 1940s and 1950s would check the country of origin of a film before coming to see it. No matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it was an American movie, people wanted to see it and, if it were the British people, would not want to see it. This may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing ASTONISHED HEART I can understand why people in those days preferred American cinema to the national variety. In the 1940s, British heritage was devoid of members of the working class and shows in this film. Everybody's talking about an English guy with a high-class accent that makes the British royal family sound like working class and what it does is alienate a lot of a potential British audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have, if not related, certainly sympathized with a violent gangster in cinematographic terms more than a high-class English shrink in 1949. This is entertainment, the reason people go to theaters. Even the names of the characters seem bizarre - Leonora! How many Britons were named Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "Stark." You get the impression that this was not marketed to a British audience in 1949. But why should most moviegoers be in theaters to watch much more fun American imports? Watching ATSONISHED HEART in 2005, I was amazed at how dated everything was, in fact, so dated that I thought it might be a parody of the HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What did not surprise me was the fact that this type of film came close to sinking the British film industry, an industry that did not answer until the American money invested in pleasing the public like the films ZULU, ALFIE and James Bond.
