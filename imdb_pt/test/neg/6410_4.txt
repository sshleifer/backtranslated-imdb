** of **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 is 23, which was my grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 minutes after the 23rd hour. Give the number the way you choose and ooh be very afraid. Be EXTREMELY scared when you play in a brain-dead Mutt to go with 23, and you have Schumacher's latest attempt at a dark suspense festival with the number 23. Ah yes, 23 is also my record in Raven Shots on my favorite 23rd street dive in the 23rd state of the union. <br /> <br /> Carrey takes the film halfway, then we lose sight of it, not caring much. Do not look for any crazy comedian expression Carrey, as you saw in The Mask and Me, Myself and Irene. No. And do not expect a personification of a character like he did with Andy Kaufman. This role is a sad and peculiar reversal for Jimbo. Where is the Riddler when you need it! I know, we do not need it. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underused as a supportive, speculative, and peculiar wife. Her talent, like Carrey's, is suppressed, and it's almost painful to see her try to rescue her undeveloped character from the near anonymity. <br /> <br /> To give credit credit, there are some interesting scenes in The Number 23 that show a very astute cinematography. They are holding enough on their own, without having to be confused with the incoherent narrative of this idiotic story. <br /> <br /> I do not know about you (and I realize this is a work of absolute fiction), but I do not know anyone who reads his novel in a dark, damp cellar, or spends his time in cemeteries regularly as Carrey does in this movie. Schumacher keeps his film dark and blood red and dingy and rainy and polluted and dingy and rainy and damp and so on from start to finish. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys had a little more light on them, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you feel like watching this movie, even if it is out of sheer curiosity ... be sure to do so while enjoying about 23 catnaps, this way you can kill 23 birds with a stone.
