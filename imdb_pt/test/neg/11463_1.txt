I realize that most people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the movie is released to a much larger audience. But then why bother to call it "Solomon Kane" first when the name has no marketable value? The characters certainly have nothing to do with the R.E. Character of Howard. Except he has a big hat. That's where the similarity ends. <br /> <br /> It's always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / science fiction movie flies over a story of origin, but when you make up a whole cloth like that for a character who does not I do not have one at all , you have already lost the point completely. Kane is no longer the fanatical Christian warrior of stories, but rather a villain who is trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic elements of the character changed or simply ignored, the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply disconcerting. Is it just so they can say "From Conan's Creator" and hope to break into a promising franchise if the new movie "Conan" comes off the role? Ignoring the full matchup of the stories, the film is competent if totally generic for the first half, but then turns into sheer stupidity on the climactic scene involving several super villains (think of three "boss levels" at the same time), none of which is the least interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I were not a fan of Kane who was disappointed to have completely ignored the source material, I would probably give the movie a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 Even for most viewers who will get into it without knowing anything about Kane, is a fine soup.
