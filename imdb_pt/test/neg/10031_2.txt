All the reviews in this movie are quite valid! It is very boring and full of all kinds of absurd and meaningless things. A couple exchanging nods with the "good grub". An average picture of a desk while a telephone rings until someone finally arrives, sits down and responds at a very calm pace. Quadruple leads or more when people look at things. Solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. Telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouth frog trying to learn what to feed his babies, with many big-mouth expressions (which are necessary for the weak punch line). The sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal, which for the most sensitive becomes inedible when talking about people burned in a fire. Lots of close-up photos of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the forest. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a forest fire, so at least a few decades later some people the same woods are killed by an ax. The killer was evidently not very pleased with the ax he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or with his own hands. <br /> <br /> If it is true that the film in the version available abroad The printed video tape is cut, perhaps if there are many scenes that were cut, it deserves another look on DVD. Otherwise it just is not very interesting, and would probably tempt the patience of even the most hardcore outdoor slasher fan.
