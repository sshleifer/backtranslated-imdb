I've watched a lot of TV over the years. So much so that when I start seeing new shows that basically sound like reruns of old shows, I feel insulted. Fortunately, I'm not overly sensitive because all the "hot properties" update the cast of "Designators" and leave them in New York City instead of Georgia. <br /> <br /> The jokes are more TV-14-ish, but this does not make the show better. The only thing this show has proved is that Nicole Sullivan is so good that she could have done a show like "My Mother the Car", a classic. Their comedic talents resemble one of the modern day Lucille Ball - just funnier. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy, which might be good for some brainless soaps, but they are not funny. <br /> Fred
