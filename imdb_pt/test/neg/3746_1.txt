I left the movie having suffered this movie after 30 minutes. I left two friends trapped by a big fat guy to stand the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the opening sequence of the film unfolded, I felt that something was wrong and it was not long before I stopped I hid under my seat shrinking with embarrassment. I'm not one to go out of movies as long as they have some redeeming feature, but this one suffered from a catalog of bad direction, bad acting (the character of the bar 'Bruno' and the impeccable Jean Rochefort - according to my friends), horrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and correlation of images that seemed to make an art put the wrong peace of song on the image and scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was his general and unbelievable insipidity (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). Why was it so horrible? I do not want to waste any more of my time explaining. I'd say go and see for yourself but I do not want to stuff the coffers of this project any more than necessary. Oh, the exhibit had a redeeming feature: my friend bending over the rows of silhouetted seats with his umbrella attached to his arm as he tried to stabilize - more pathos, tension, and entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 minutes of that sadly ghastly endeavor.
