I'm surprised at the number of people who rated this entry as their favorite "Chan" (they never saw "... at the Opera" or "... on Treasure Island?" Ironically written by John Larkin who dropped the ball on here). This plot is a train crash and overwhelmed with useless characters. First, viewers are forced to recall the sordid details of Steve McBirney (played by the venerable bandit and flattering HUAC, Marc Lawrence) in 1929. Let's not forget that he escaped a capital murder slap in court with a lone cop in his paste. There is also a victim who has been fished from a river 11 years before and no one seems to be concerned. Then there is the suspension of the required disbelief when all the characters are apparently trapped in the wax museum (although Inspector O'Matthews manages to wrap his wet, wet backside through a window). Why Joan Valerie (as Cream's assistant) in this movie? She can not even handle the pliers properly - I realize that Chan suffers the same insult, but you're 66 here - (and have less than 10 lines - and the motivation of your character is too weak to be adequately splained , when I'm in a speech that I write as Ricky Ricardo). The character of Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) is written as an eager, wide-eyed fool, apparently existing only for the insipid romantic interest of horndog Lawyer Tom Agnew (played by Ted Osborne, face-to-face) Why Willie Fern is a character Why McBirney's henchman could not make the trade at 8:20 (not a spoiler, okay?!). or because he has not stepped in front of a bus years ago, Toler takes a little more action than usual (a plus) and the actual accolades go to set designer Thomas Little and director of photography Virgil Miller, who created a genuine atmosphere scary ... but this entry is less logical than a Ritz Brothers movie. even bothered by how a toothpick can be used as a blow gun.
