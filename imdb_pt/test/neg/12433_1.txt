There is nothing to say except I want my time back that this movie took of me. I'm not racist against Latinos. Hell, I'm half Brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It does not make any sense. These kids just walk around and do nothing. They are not even good at skating. All the time, I'm just waiting for something, anything to happen! but this does not happen. NOTHING happens the whole movie. I mentioned they suck at skateboarding. I could make a movie called rockers, and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh * t of poser idiots punks like these kids. I'm not even going to get into it, this movie sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you get in touch with it so another poor soul will not make the same mistake.
