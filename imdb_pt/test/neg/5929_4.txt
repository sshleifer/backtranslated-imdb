Supposedly, this is the final film in the Left Behind series, which is the idea of ​​preacher and fundamentalist novelist Tim LaHaye about what we can expect in our future in the last days of Planet Earth. If this is the case, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year. The Fantastic Four of Apocalypse is back with a casting change, Arnold Pinnock who would know more as the mentor in Life With Derek, is now the minister taking the place of Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as the anti-Christ pilot by day and Christian at night is there as his daughter Janaya Stephens and investigative reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have guessed the true nature of UN Secretary General Nicolai Karpathy and once again are throwing sand at their machinery. <br /> <br /> This time they have as an ally the President of the United States that is played by Louis Gossett, Jr. He is having a hell of a hard time, especially the guerrillas launch in the RPG attack in a carreata presidential election that kills Vice President Charles Martin Smith. That's right, the frog is vice president. Someone really blew it up because everyone, including those who would harm them, knows that a president and a vice president never travel together. <br /> <br /> It takes the whole movie to convince Gossett who really is Karpathy. Again, the best of the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy. <br /> <br /> We can still see another movie from Left Behind, the door was left open, although people assure me that they were left without source material. by Tim LeHaye. I suppose, as long as they make money, these players can not get a job in the traditional film industry. And there are some unresolved issues involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble, who is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the Fantastic Four dies in this movie, so it will be the Fantastic Four or they will get another room. Stay tuned.
