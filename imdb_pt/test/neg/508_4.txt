The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the damned film's reputation. In addition, the original version, the "long version," was recently shown in the TCM exposing the film, in all likelihood, to its greatest audience of all time. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it first came out on a crowded show at a movie theater on 3rd Avenue across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and taken off the following Wednesday. Maybe it was not a fair release, but it was and is a terrible movie. Seeing the full version recently confirmed this trial and with over thirty years experience watching and writing about movies, I am better able to articulate why. <br /> <br /> First, there is the dreaded phrase "mise-en-scene". "whose definition is both so simple but so amorphous that it confuses even after being defined. Basically it is everything that happens in front of a camera.For example, an extra crowd will get an action, say just walking on the sidewalk and a point If there is another one, the extra will return to the starting point and go back to "action." All the extras do that, then say that a taxi heads up to the sidewalk and the star goes out and hugs another director while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing.That's mise-en-scene.In the theater they call it blocking, but the movie theater is much more multi-dimensional < The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when French critics developed their author theory, the opposite of an author was a mÃ©tier-en-scene, even more disparagingly referred to as a "police officer." of transit. " author was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work, a theme or discerned themes. The metier-en-scene was basically a company man portraying in the film what had been handed to him on paper. It's the difference between, say, John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, took the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence by directing the first one-million-dollar TV commercial. This showed a Chevrolet floating on the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any list of the greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable only because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three-year-old girl brought to the entertainment company who gets her biggest response when she tosses the dress over her head. Cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a child of thirty. So Cimino was praised from the outset for spending a huge amount of money for some exaggerated image and then he learned. His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene in which Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in the car of a lunatic who drives back and forth, back and forth, until he gets off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits that he pulls out to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, had not come on the scene, the scene would have lasted until all the rabbits had been killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the DOOR OF HEAVEN. I think if someone watches the movie on a DVD in excerpts as a miniseries, it can be impressive. This is because the scenes are directed with such a dense scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia, it is simply exhausting to go through almost four hours. It's like sex, at some point it just becomes a whip. There is the opening of 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed in Oxford, it's something of a non-sequitur. I am personally in favor of the artistic way of unfolding a story, as opposed to the more commercial - "Now I'll tell you what I'm going to tell you" from most movies. However, the entire preface adds only one line - Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now, twenty years later? All this time, money and effort, not to mention all the attention and energy of the public just to deliver this information almost useless. Then there is the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur that just continues and continues with a town populated with background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a little bit of expository information . It's so exhausting. There's only one scene after another like that. It's like trying to eat a 30-pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, foolish dialogues that continue and are exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course any stretch of a single scene looks brilliant. Overall, it is a rich piece to rotate laudable articles on. Seen in snippets with the ability to move quickly through the annoying bits or turn it off if you feel that the mise-en-scene is whipped, it's basically painless. But do not let anyone tell you it's a good movie. When I saw it in 1980, there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does it about six times. "This is symbolic," he said, "of not knowing where to go." This is basically at its core, the basis of all the criticisms of the Portal of Heaven. See if you need to, but be warned, this is not a movie whose time has come, this is a stinker that will smell all the time. <br /> <br /> THE DOOR OF HEAVEN is historically inaccurate to the extreme. I recommend Asa Mercer's book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS about Johnson County War.
