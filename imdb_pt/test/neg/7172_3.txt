This movie begins with the kids telling each other urban legends like the poodle in the microwave and getting something extra in a chicken place. Unfortunately, it then turns into his basic anthology film. The first is about a janitor with a little secret. This is fine at best. Then it gets worse when the next story about this boy obsessed with dead flies is on and on and on. It's a long and not so interesting way to start. After that, you get the typical shock scene and it ends. You need more than that in an anthology film. You need at least three stories and one should not be so long, it becomes terribly uninteresting, especially considering you can see how it will end up a mile away.
