After reading Fool For Love in a theater class, I was eager to see how wonderful Sam Shepard's piece would be translated to the screen. To my astonishment, it was not nearly as much fun as the play. The film seemed to drag on, the music was inadequate for the tone of the film, and all the raw energy of the piece seemed to have been sucked out of the film version. It's a shame to see it come out this way even with Shepard's involvement, playing Eddie. Do yourself a favor ... see the play the next time it's being done in your area or just read the book.
