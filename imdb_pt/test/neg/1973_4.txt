A fairly transparent attempt to rip off money from the thriving British club scene, Sorted is a movie that looks promising in certain departments but does little more than that. A superficial plan of suspense (which is only there to chain the sequences of the club), variable acting and a rather ridiculous script, everything so that it is classified as the showcase director Jovy obviously intended. <br /> <br /> However, although Jovy is sometimes indulgent (especially when using dance music often mis-adjusted) it shows potential, and the lack of an anti-drug message is extremely refreshing. Overall, however, the film is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain somewhere out there. Watchable however.
