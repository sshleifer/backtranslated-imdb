****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie stunk. Just let me say now that I totally agree with what carissaphillips had to say about it. What was Sam thinking? She was with a guy who told her that he loved her (3 times in all), was EXTREMELY HOT, and stuck with her despite her hard times (Josh Hartnett). But, she decided to break up with him, no, betray him with a snobby, ugly, spoiled, and wealthy idiot loser who never said he loved her all over the movie (wait, he wrote on the wall, not that count?), And she left in his time of need because he was afraid (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be with? The only reason I sat through the entire movie was because Josh Hartnett had him and hoping that she might die in the end. I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who really was worthy of him. The whole "your mother" thing was funny. I liked. I hate it when people around here say that, but I think Kelley deserved it. Jasper should have said that to Sam too, she needed a good slap. How the novel began is a mystery to me. They never said anything to each other anyway, so I do not understand how they got together. "I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me ... had mustard or mayonnaise or ....." Oh, come on. The supposedly romantic lines were so stupid. Also, he is sosoosoosososo UGLY! I must admit, I cried in this movie. For a long time, very difficult. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried in this movie so many times ... he tried to smile at her, but could not stop the tears. He cried when 1) He told her that he loved her 2) She got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and he saw how happy she was with him 4) she died. I cried when he cried because he had loved her all my life, and told her, and yet she was dumb enough not to care and love a guy who left her in her time of need, and who did not cry at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars just because I love JOSH HARTNETT! Oh, by the way, Chris Klein, your mother! Wiley's sister
