I agree that this movie is very pretentious, and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and I think this movie is one of the most rated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /> <br /> However, let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (Il mia madre smile) - a movie gem! <br /> <br /> He was trying to overcome Fellini's 81/2 here ???? Is the scene with the dogs, which has also been pointed out, absurd and excessive? just an example. Others would take up a lot of space, and some reviewers have noticed them. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very frustrating and boring experience!
