Unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it. Everything is wrong; too bad. From photography (many scenes without focus!) To acting (the young female is terrible). And what can we say about the helicopters made in Paint Brush ...? Really incredible B, I mean, film Z. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, clich√© and badly wrote. Basic conveniences for the script seems to work. I can not even think of a young film student doing this movie. Nothing justifies. <br /> <br /> I recommend you not even think about watching this movie. Sleeping or playing solitaire are the best choices. ;) <br /> xxx
