The audience was silent for most of the film, with only a few occasional chuckles. The character Maxwell Smart was so inconsistent that I felt whipped. When it's convenient for the plot, the Smart behaves like a master spy. At other times, he acts like an imbecile. They raise many classic lines from the television series, but they do not work in this version. The classic "lost by so much" is funny if it is spoken with an attempt at bragging by someone who is an obvious failure - but loses all the humor when spoken by someone who is qualified. To a somewhat lesser degree, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from incompetent skillful cartoonists. Siegfried, the main villain, seems intelligent, but makes decisions that make absolutely no sense. Still, none of the characters in the movie are as incompetent as the writers of this mess. I'm completely depressed that so many IMDb users think this was good.
