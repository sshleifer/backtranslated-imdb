After a secret mission in Bucharest to publicize an international gang of gun dealers, agent Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of a Romanian mafia accountant. However, the CIA's hideout is invaded by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information leaked from within the Agency. Alone, relying only on his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), Sonni struggles to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes' career is in decline. I just saw this movie, and it's another disappointing movie from this actor whose career is currently very similar to that of Steven Segal. The film has many explosions, shots and car chase associated with a horrible story and a horrible performance. First, the African-American Wesley Snipes is pursued by Bucharest police, but they never find an American Negro. I've never been to Romania, but I do not think there are many African Americans in this country. Your character does not like bathing, wearing the same clothes over many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and sexy Silvia Colloca, but she freely has sex, falls in love with him and shares her fortune with him. The boy who makes Nadia's son is horrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Detonator" ("The Detonator")
