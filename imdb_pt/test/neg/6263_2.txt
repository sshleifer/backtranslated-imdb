The Cheerleader Massacre was supposed to be the fourth part of the Assassin Party's Massacre series; if that's what they were doing (which is considering an actress of the original returns in a small turnout), they failed miserably and made by far the worst part of the "quadrilogy." Cheerleader Massacre perfectly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a stupid murderer, boring and boring deaths, a boring scenario and a ghastly camera job to make it one of the worst movies ever made. Did I mention how bad it was? Do not get me wrong: this tacky and retarded excuse for a horror movie is not nearly as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it's undeniably a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The Cheerleader Massacre is an exact polar opposite of the movie. Original massacre of the resting party. Stay away by all means! This movie sucks!
