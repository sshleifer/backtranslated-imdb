This movie spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. However, the plot and visuals are so insane that it looks more like the poster boy for LSD. Synopsis: Michael's heroic fight as he fights his drug addiction while undergoing humiliation brought <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, there is a good message but it is obscured by the fact that the writers got an idea of ​​PSA and tried to stretch it in 30 minutes. This includes a sequence of songs where you say there are millions of rational ways to say "No!" like "I can not smoke marijuana, I have homework!" <br /> <br /> Writers can not decide what to do with the characters they brought for free. At first we see that they all have to hide from the human characters, but in five minutes we see everyone running around without anyone noticing. Soon they begin to interact with the human cast, and the only one who is even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug users, it's the little sister who talks to her teddy bear (Pooh, by the way). Demon of drugs floating around. Because you know, traffickers do not give children drugs. He is also ambiguous - while he may be symbolic of Michael's addiction and therefore should not be seen by other people, he will and little haunts Corey to take her on drugs. So I guess he's ... uhhh ..... moving on! <br /> <br /> The whole plot finally culminates in some insane sequence in which Michael is in what appears to be the Saturday Morning Soul Carnival, also known as a hell theme park where the various cartoon characters beat and ignored him. For example, Miss Piggy eats it in a sandwich and spits it out. If the writers were not on the rise when writing this, I must recommend that they try to get stoned because they can not get crazier than that. Of course the film ignores the fact that Michael is taking hikes for two years at this point, so why this sequence of shots would scare him is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm completely rocking in this movie. , but in fact I just saw it again because I had the job of tracking it on eBay because of the infamy of being a cartoon BAD. The level of unintentional humor is brilliant. Take this scene for example - Michael's father is rooting for the fridge for a beer. He realizes that many of them are missing and mentions this to his wife. The always attentive Mom says to him: "Do not worry, you probably drank last night watching football." Although we should obviously be learning that Michael is drinking beer (besides pot and crack), instead we read more and realize - Hey, kids, it's okay to have chemical addictions as long as you're an adult. above! Scenes like this are worth the small price of this movie. Oh yeah, and the fact that you hear Simon the Squirrel saying "Marijuana."
