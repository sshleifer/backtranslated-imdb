That's what they invented for Carrot Top's first feature film, a propaganda comedian. <br /> <br /> A stupid surfer (carrot face) inherits an R & D venture from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things go less than swimming, but they get much worse when the company is threatened by an attempted hostile takeover by corrupt corporate invaders. The most implausible thing about this movie is that clever girl Courtney Thorne-Smith would find this fascinating red-haired step-boy (but he inherited millions). 'Classic' moments include the Larry Miller comic book drinking sweat from a plastic cup. Funny comedy? Try the funny UN bathroom humor, and that's exactly where it belongs - in the bathroom ... rinse twice.
