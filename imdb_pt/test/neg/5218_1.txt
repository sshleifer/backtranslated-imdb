When you watch the making of with this DVD - they tell you what is tempted here - they are recounting the biblical story of good versus evil and trying to nail it to a mainstream movie audience. In a modern society like ours, that's where the film fails. There are many sheep portrayed in this film. People are very empowered for this kind of preaching today. <br /> <br /> With regard to actuation functions, direction and techniques, they are done OK. Chuck Norris, in fact, is fine as an angel, since the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers was in the 1960s.
