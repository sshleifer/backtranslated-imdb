For some reason, my father-in-law gave me a copy of that tape. I think because my great-uncle, Buddy Baer, ​​was the giant in this movie and my father-in-law thought I'd like to see him. I had, years before, when I was a child, and I did not like it either. <br /> <br /> My son, then two, watched and got hooked. Every moment in front of the TV, this horrible video is played. I went to work with the empty songs stuck in my head. The two "leads" were worse than a junior internship review. The dancers looked rejected from a horror film by Ed Wood, and Abbot and Costello phoned their parts. Fortunately, I managed to distract my child long enough to lose this videotape. Frankly, I think it was the "The Ring" tape. To correct another critic, Buddy Baer is Jethro's Uncle (Max Baer, ​​Jr.) and not his father. 0 out of 10.
