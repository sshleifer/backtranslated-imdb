Margaret Mitchell spins on her grave every time someone watches this mess! Fine costumes and sets can not even begin to overburden lackluster performances of Joanne Whalley (as the title character) and the ever-less Timothy Dalton (as Rhett). Even worse than the acting - and perhaps in part explaining - is the script, which is surprisingly clich√© and predictable. Add to that infernally bad script a score that will make you cringe, and you will have a disaster that I would not wish on any spectator. The SCARLETT is incredibly bad, and I can not imagine how it was done, much less for the video.
