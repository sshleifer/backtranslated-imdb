A woman finds herself trapped in a seemingly inexplicable eruption of suicides. So again, are these really suicides? Looks like there's a ghost on the loose. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair that conceals his face, and moves with his head or arms twisted in one way or another, creating a very strange spectrum. Recurring theme music plays from unexpected places to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects - reminiscent of the sound of small branches being plucked - always accompany this unhappy spirit. Does this sound familiar? Well, if you've seen some Asian horror movies in the last 10 years, you should. Borrowing heavily and shamelessly from "The Ring," "One Last Call," and a few other recent horror hits, this movie tries to get an uninteresting, worn-out plot to a climax, but we've seen it all before. Avoid unless you are desperate or have not seen any other Asian horror movies in the last 10 years.
