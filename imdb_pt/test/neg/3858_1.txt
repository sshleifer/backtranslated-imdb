There is a famous tale about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans. It is very good, and has been made and redone in film and on TV many times. Some are remarkable, but this urbanized version, which injects the old and tired themes of racism, runs out. Leguizamo's clowning is almost as weak as the dull script. Chaplin, this guy is not. There must be people who find a dwarf who can not stop dancing funny, I mean, I suppose it's funny in a pathetic weird way, but it's not enough to carry a movie. You have the usual remnant Nazi or neo-Nazi, whatever we think, villain type, who's son, of course, gay, German accent ... imagine?
