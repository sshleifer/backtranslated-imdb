It may end up being the biggest disappointment I'll see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who did not like Park's Oldboy, but I think his "Lady Vengeance" and "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" are among the best movies which I saw in the 2000s. So I was really looking forward to seeing this, especially because it received positive reviews. Instead, I found the movie clich√©, and broke little if any new foundation for the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a bit of black humor in movies like this, I felt that Park did it at very inopportune times. <br /> <br /> Others compared / contrasted this with "Let the Right One In", and I have to say that "Let the Right One In" was far superior to this, and was a new approach to the vampire genre . Unfortunately, the taking of Park was tiring.
