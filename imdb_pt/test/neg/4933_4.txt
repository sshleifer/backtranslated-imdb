The beginning was decent; the end was good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie suffers from total and absolute superficiality of the characters, unreal confrontations / fight scenes, lack of intelligent someone outside the space shuttle. This adds to a horrible average script. <br /> <br /> Things to look for: Overly obvious foreshadowing, quick curing cuts, overly smoky fires, fun seat belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave a 4, not a 0, because the beginning of the movie had some good elements of happiness and basic character development. The relationship between the dark haired main girl and her fiancee is played briefly, and the placement of the blonde friend's impact on this relationship is present, albeit awkwardly. The business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done, however, as another commentator pointed out, not unexpected. Viper
