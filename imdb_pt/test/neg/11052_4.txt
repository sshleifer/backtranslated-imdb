Fortunately, I have not seen this movie in a movie, big screen, only on a small video screen. I doubt I would have been able to watch the movie at a movie theater and watch all the violence in the movie. After watching the first 30 minutes, I was disappointed and curious. Disappointed by the difficult plot, the hard-to-understand screens, the enormous aggression - I still do not know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) by tearing someone else's teeth, his bestiality in women, he cutting his tongue. And also curious, to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although the film was not boring, I received no response to all those cruelties that I had to watch from the beginning to the end. In my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there are Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can pick up any recent war movie, and if you want an oriental movie, there are much better titles out there . Subsequently, I will take the Cannes festival classifications with more caution, such as when Oldboy was highly praised by the jury, did not have much to say for me and was only 4/10 of my scale. <br /> <I'm hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
