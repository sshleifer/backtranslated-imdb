I rated this better than horrible because I liked to see Buffy's Jonathon in something new - even if it was the same part. <br /> <br /> First, the concept is kind of cute for a short, but not a whole movie. Writing was forced and invented. I have the feeling that the film suffered more during the editing. <br /> <br /> Second, Amanda Bynes always seems like her eyes are crossed - even when she's not trying to do it. She's not funny. She always plays some kind of misfit girl who triumphs in being herself - ironic, considering that Amanda always seems to be a caricature. I really would like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she's always climbed in these trivial roles, where she jerks and grimaces and somehow that's a good thing? <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole "I'm an idiot" segment was stolen from Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame, shame.
