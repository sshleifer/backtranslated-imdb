Would it be too trivial of me to create a review of just me saying the word "STUPID" over and over again? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when he was still in theaters. Even though it was really * with friends * and at one of his * birthday parties, * I had to leave. I really had to leave. I just apologized and left. Luckily, some of the parents were doing the same thing, so I did not look like a total idiot ... Anyway, this movie sucks. There is nothing to like about it. It is painfully (as actually causing physical pain) slowly and disgustingly (literally induces vomiting) without grace. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but you do not remember why he was in the movie. It's really painful even to think about it. <br /> <br /> I was on TV a few months ago, and I decided I had to watch it all the time, just once. I remembered then why I left first, and felt guilty for raising its audience even by a bystander. The jokes are not funny, the characters are not interesting. it's just a meaningless mess of pratfalls and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of eight-year-olds who watched the movie when it came out and considered it "brilliant." If you think having your face removed piece by pece with a scoop of ice cream is brilliant, then by all means, go rent it. But if you have any dignity, completely avoid this stupid big mess. Score: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.
