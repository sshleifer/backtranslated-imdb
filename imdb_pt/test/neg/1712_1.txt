First, I'd like to apologize for my rating of "1" ... The only reason I give this movie such a high rating is that I can not delve into negative whole numbers. All reflections "This is a parody" aside, and although I certainly tried to give due consideration, they left me with a certain notion, namely; "This is possibly the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement ... Seriously, I've tried, I'm like in any video-cult-indie film distribution as the next chandelier, but seriously, this movie sucked rhino balls ... <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had directed this "movie" I would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide.
