I think Downey might have been inspired by the new French wave. <br /> <br /> Who was not? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of the new crackhead- A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey seems to have lost a lot. <br /> <br /> Just say no, in fact. In more ways than one. Including watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not bear it after a while and began to move quickly through it. It would have been wiser to have simply ignored it.
