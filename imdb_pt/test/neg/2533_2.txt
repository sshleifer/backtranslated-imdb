Strange, with unnecessary songs and scenarios. Randomly, much of the action will take place onstage, giving the feel of an opera performance. None of this explains why this is such a bad movie. It is the impression that there was not enough rehearsal or that no experienced choreographer was available. The performance is flat. Even the brilliant Ziyi Zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next move or line. You can note the curiosities on this site stating that she spent half a month in Japan learning to sign and dance. Read this again in 2 weeks and things start to make sense.
