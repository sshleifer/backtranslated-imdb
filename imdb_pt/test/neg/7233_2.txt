I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is really bad. The plot is their ordinary monster movie where they kill some people, the mayor / boss does not believe, and they fight in the end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the quality of the film is very good, and the New York scenery is impressive for a budget movie - unlike a small coastal town. The acting is also reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects on the main stage of a monster movie are laughable and the addition of a random load of children in the middle of the path is strange. The ending is simply bad. <br /> <br /> In short, whenever you have a chance to see this, no - there will be something better. <br /> <br /> RTC "True horror movies do not have a PG rating"
