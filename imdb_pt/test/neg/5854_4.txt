ASTROESQUE (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the title is supposed to be ... even less of an idea of ​​what is supposed to be going on in this movie in half the time ... yet, still kept me interested. This is a low-budget, low-budget movie, modeled after "El Mariachi," filmed in 16mm ... and for what it's worth, the plans are nicely composed and visually elegant. Directed, written and starred by writer / comic artist Michael Allred ... I guess it's no surprise the movie looks good. Unfortunately, some of the performances are beyond evil ... and the rest is competent at best. Allred himself is the best ... but only because he does not talk much. He just walks around looking cool most of the time ... or running away from crazy crazies who are trying to kill him. The sound is also very bad ... almost as if it were unfinished in some places ... maybe they could not afford the music they planned to use? Strange, vaguely science fiction plot ... similar in tone to "The man who fell on the earth" ... but most of the film boils down to a bad guys race pattern and kill them before -They kill -You plot. Ultimately too oblique to be successful, but not without interest to the adventurous moviegoers.
