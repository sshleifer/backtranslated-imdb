Remember those old kung fu movies that we used to watch on Friday and Saturday night when our nannies THINK we were in charge? Well, this movie plays just like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's biggest claim to fame was the love interest in Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2," and this performance was one of the reasons she never succeeded: she's a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> "Lethal Weapon 2", I thought she was cute. Cute enough to check out some of the other films she's been in, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance," another big disappointment, which I, of course, was not impressed either. But as attractive as it may be to my eyes, my soul screamed at me to turn it off because it played another cheap and predictable role, and did very badly. In this film, Kensit stars as a comedian (not good either) who is working in the clubs of France (could not cut her in her own homeland, so she is making her ears bleed), which is at a disadvantage, but even worse, the French government wants to throw it out because of a expired visa (or maybe they just took it). But she marries this Casanova (Freiss), who is so lucky, and predictability begins ... terribly! Is there any way to give this movie a NEGATIVE rating? 1 out of 10 stars is above the standings!
