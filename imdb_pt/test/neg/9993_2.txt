As I read the script online, I thought "Capote" needed a cut. Having just seen him on PPV, I can tell he was not trimmed, he was massacred like that poor family! Example: In the script, Truman names Shawn "Adorable One"; here, he's Mr. Shawn. Just enough that the amateurs behind this movie unleash Capote and hit his circle (do we really believe they thought so little about Nelle, they mutilated his little opus as a nasty joke?), they make Perry Smith such a sensitive victim, even as he appears to be dispatching the Clutters. One thing is to fudge the facts, another is to drop the ball: the executions were held between 12: 45-1: 19, April 14; Truman is shown in prison 22 HOURS AFTER! <br /> <br /> I was totally disappointed with the "acting". Keener does not even try to sound like an Alabama native. The way Cooper kept screaming "Alvin!" I was waiting for the chimps to show up! Hoffman does not offer us the charming chatter, but a pathetic suck that sees a horrible act as passage to the great moment. When Hoffman complains of being "tortured" by endless appeals, I wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out!
