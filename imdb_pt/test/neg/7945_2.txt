Los Angeles, 1976. Indie newcomer John Carpenter, just released from film school and with a movie - the 2001 parody of his class project called the Dark Star - concludes an aggressive actor named Assault On Precinct 13. The story of an almost deserted police station under the siege of an invisible Los Angeles gang, was a small hit on the drive-in circuit and received little praise from the few critics who cared but barely burned the movie world apart from Carpenter's followers. until Halloween (1978). In Precinct, Carpenter was still learning to explore his almost non-existent budget using low-shelf actors, keeping the action in a hellishly small place, and moving the film at a tight pace with a combination editing, smart camera. work and gender related experience. <br /> <br /> No one wants or needs to be hungry any more in Hollywood, especially if the bill of the week in the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 is more than the full cost. of the original. This translates to a certain kind of laziness on the part of a filmmaker - you have a stupidly large syndicate team, a studio, and a marketing firm that are thinking about you. That's why, twenty years after watching the Carpenter movie, I can still see every moment glorious, from the little girl being slaughtered in cold blood while buying an ice cream, to the relentless sequence of synth. A week after Assault 2005, I remember the ping pong ball eyes and little more than Larry Fishburne. <br /> <br /> "Unforgettable popcorn action" fits neatly at the top of the poster. It is New Year's Eve in the 13th district, a season that closes with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours. On call is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), a former drug dealer now deeply disturbed and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners were frozen in the opening scene; Iris (Drea de Matteo, from the sopranos), a nymphomaniac with a joke for the criminals, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a grumpy veteran about to shy away from retirement. As in Carpenter's Assault ..., a bus with four heavy criminals is redirected to the Delegate. All drunken eyes are on the gangster boss Bishop (Fishburne, still reinforced by his time in The Matrix) who narrowly survived an assassination attempt on a disguised cop and plans to blow up endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (a tired-looking Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are off, the transmission lines are off, and both the police and the police are heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while they are at war against a task force of the corrupt Duvall police officers who carry balaclavas bullet vests, red bazookas, and more high-tech equipment than the Skywalker Ranch. We are expected to believe that when helicopters roar on top of the station by firing rockets at windows, it is a clandestine operation to cover Duvall's tracks. He may well have taken placards on Hollywood Boulevard. As with the recent 1970's genre rework, Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes the most basic foundations of John Carpenter's original and, to cite the seventies, "it's a thing of its own , face". The main question is - why bother? John Carpenter's 1976 is a cult favorite among genre fans, but hardly touched by the public's collective conscience. Carpenter himself was busy turning Howard Hawks' classic Rio Bravo into a claustrophobic urban thriller for just $ 20,000. French prodigy director and rap producer Jean-Fran√ßois Richet, a self-proclaimed fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less concerned about paying homage to Hawks or JC - though the script is filled with references to cowboys and guns - and it seems decided squeezing as much flash and firepower as the multimillion-dollar budget can bear. The result: a few tense moments with portable POV cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, some plot twists, but essentially a Grade B urban actioner with a very inflated price. As for the carpenter checking, it is pure presumption on the part of the filmmakers that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> For Monsieur Richet, I say bon voyage, and wish you luck in your musical career.
