I saw this movie because every review I read about it said it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really do not understand the reason for all this hype. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was ridiculously bad ("What if something strange is happening?" ... what ????). The performance did not blow my socks either. It could have been because the screenplay hardly gave the actors anything to work on ... the characters are purely two-dimensional for me and I did not give a shit about them. Another thing is that the film is extremely annoying. Extremely. Of course, there are some "bumps" here and there, but for the 112-minute length of the movie, he certainly did not use his time wisely. Most of the movie contains characters talking about things that barely had anything to do with the plot. What was the purpose of this? <br /> <br /> On top of that, the movie does not make sense. Yes, I believe I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how this fits into the events that actually occur in the film is beyond me. In addition, much of the film is featured in small vignettes, which makes the story difficult to follow at times. And do not even make me start with the ending. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give Kurosawa credit for putting some truly frightening images throughout the film. There are very scary pictures of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they reflected on these images and elaborated them, it would have made the film much stronger. But they did not, and instead drew up more social commentary, which was interesting, but again portrayed in an extremely somber manner. Yeah, it's a message movie. Okay, fun. I'm just getting the message from my outdoor review here: find a better way to spend your free time than by watching it.
