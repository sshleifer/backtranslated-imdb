The trailer is so misleading ... I thought this would be a good movie ... What was the point in bringing the women in Hong Kong to be killed? They could have done this in Paris. And the first half hour: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> No, I do not! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> No, I do not! -You love Me! <br /> <br /> - Not me! Repeat 100 times ... so ... Well, I do not love you ... Then I'll shoot you! : D So here is the reason why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine if I even had money for this torture! I'm sorry for the time I lost watching ... the filmmakers should pay me for the inconvenience ... Worst movie ever seen ...
