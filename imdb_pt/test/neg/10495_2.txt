I'm giving this Vampire Assassins movie a rating of "2", mainly because it had no sex or nudity. Other than that, I do not know why this was done. It was more like a training exercise on how to make a film with a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovak were the best actors. They were followed closely by the "biker-dude" with Pleather pants and the silver belt. He was fine too. Most of the film was filmed in some kind of distribution warehouse. If you get tired of watching the kung-fu kick boxing tricks, you can check out the Scott, Windex and other cleaning products. You'll have plenty of time to do this, trust me. I almost started to make a list. The dialogue and the kung-fu scenes were extremely slow. They spoke slowly, fought slowly, and so on. I do not know why. At least with the extra-slow delivery of the actor lines, you could hear everything very distinctly. I'm trying to find good things to say about this movie. We watched it all the way to the end to see if it got better, but it did not. We could never decide whether the actors really knew the martial arts or whether they were just acting as if they knew the martial arts. You can see and decide. My favorite phrase was something like (vampire talking :) "What are you looking at?" another man answering: "your bad dental work."
