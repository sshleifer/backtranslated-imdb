A modern scare movie? Yes, it is ... <br /> <br /> Hippies, pacifists and environmentalists came together to give us a movie of fear .. I did not recognize it when I watched it only 2 years ago that it was a movie of fear, but this is exactly what it is .. <br /> <br /> There is no difference between this movie and the movies that the Nazi made about us in ww2 and the same movies we made about them .. this is pure advertisement and speaks only for those who believe in aliens, 9/11 conspiracy plots, fake moon landings, oil spikes and great environmentalism. What I can say is that this movie tightens buttons, asks questions and ends up forgetting ... It's a scary movie. ... so if your scars go into their homes, lock their doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when Bush provokes the Chinese into nuclear war.
