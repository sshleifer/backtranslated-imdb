That's not saying much. This film Killjoy has better cinematography and is more professional than the previous one. That does not mean I'm more professional. That last horrible movie was about gangsters killing a child and then being haunted by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy at last was a bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I have ever seen in any movie, and I have seen many movies. In the last movie, the clown arrived in about 15 minutes, this is shorter and the clown is not even 40 minutes, and only 65 minutes! I give 2 because the performance of some characters is good.
