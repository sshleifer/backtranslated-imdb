I had seen this movie as a kid (before World War II) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. I saw it again after about sixty years and I forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not an "A" movie. No editing, poor script, poor performance and poor targeting. It should not even be as loud as a "B" I had a laugh as I became tired over the years. It seems to me that I thought it was good when I first saw it.
