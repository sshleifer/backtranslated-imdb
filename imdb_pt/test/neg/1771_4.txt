This is a species that is already being born in a beautiful model (Mathilda May). An overwhelming baby with a desire to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a strong launch and virus infected in half to the end. <br /> <br /> The weaker spot is the plot presentation / basic story. As you may have countered, Natasha Henstridge's Species won the same plot, but adds a very interesting side storyline and does not mention good deeds and a strong clickthrough. <br /> <br /> This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the business fleet in Star Trek Next Generation; he wanted to find more models in the glass cage, floating inside the Halley-Comet. <br /> <br /> A must for science fiction fans.
