Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The person who filmed this movie probably never learned not to shoot directly in a bright light. You can not see anything in this movie. It's the way to the dark. The parts where you can see something that the camera is directed directly to a light source so that you get great lens flares. So you still can not see. This movie should have been a radio game or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down by some sort of garbage effect. Low budget movies can be made much better than that. And low budget is no excuse for this. An editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you could not see anything. Maybe manufacturers should spend a little of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they were filming. The only good thing about this movie being so gloomy is that you can not see the horrible acting. It also covers low-quality sfx. People in early movie schools make better movies than that. Movies filmed with useful cameras look better than that.
