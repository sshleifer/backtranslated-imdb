This movie is sometimes called "The History of O-Pt.2," which tries to pass itself off as a sequence (or luck) of the French erotic thriller S & M "The Story Of O". Although I have never seen the original version, I have nevertheless been able to see this sad mix of social and sexual politics. I think the 'O' angle comes from occasional S & M tones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as those from 'Mistress.' Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French / Japanese production but speaks lines in English - at least in the version I've seen) The unnecessary use of surrealism can only make it such a boring example in even more pretentious pseudo porn (what are they trying to prove by portraying a piano floating in the water?) It's obvious that after all the "chic porn" trend in the movies was exhausted (ouch-sorry, bad pun!) By 1975, the producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the adult movie experts, not to mention foreigners. / Art Cinema, so movie goers had to fight 'The Last Woman', and others like him.
