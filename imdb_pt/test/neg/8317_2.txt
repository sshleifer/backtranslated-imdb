I do not know in which neighborhoods the people who wrote the great reviews for this movie live, but I'm glad I was not there if they did not comment on the cartoon aspect of this thing. Okay, we've learned to suspend our disbelief in movies like the "Hard To Kill" series, but seeing little Jodie knock down an entire street gang with a Glock, like NOVICE yet ... come on. All she needed was a bald head and a torn T-shirt and she would be Bruce Willis. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what would be a joke and waste of her money. Or she was living some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone is a black brunette, or Hispanic. Even the dog is black. Little Blondie is the only good one and (except for a black cop) everyone in town is a sordid minority to get her. Has your fear of your acting talent diminished so much that you think the only way to be noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) on camera in a dark, gloomy, gloomy neighborhood / movie / cast? Apparently, she thought she was in the wrong movie ... The Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous holes, chewing furniture, gratuitous violence ("Look girls, now you can do that too!"). .. Spend time with your family instead of watching this drek.
