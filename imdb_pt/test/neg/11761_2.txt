CHE! is a bad movie and deserves the reputation of being an unintentionally funny movie. It takes a serious subject and is presented as the Cliff Notes or Classic Comics version because there is not much emotion or a proper narrative - just episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid "stories" handed down by a variety of yutzes. /> <br /> This is a deservedly deserved movie, as it is poorly written and acted. However, what I find most interesting about the film is the apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro working for a Communist Cuba, they seem to be more of a gay couple - with Che's behavior being timid and indifferent and Fidel as the fiery suitor! Again and again, the film is full of great lines, as when Fidel begs Che "Cuba needs you ... I NEED YOU !!". I'm not sure if the studio intended this homosexual tendency, but it does not take a neurosurgeon to recognize it! I'm very surprised that the other reviewers do not point that out. However, if you remember that when watching the movie, it makes the viewing much more exciting and even funnier. <br /> <br /> One final note. In recent years, Che has been very fancy - even a fashion statement with thousands of brain-dead teenagers who have no idea who he was, wearing shirts printed with his face. Considering that he was a cold-blooded and nihilistic killer (a strange combination for a doctor), this new reverence for man is gross. What will they do next, put Hitler or Dr. Mengele on shirts and posters? !!? Even conscientious Communists should be shocked by the bloodshed for which Guevara was responsible and I find it ironic that people with computers are defending a man who would probably have killed them if they had a chance! Considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was, it does nothing to promote the message that Guevara was not a hero. I would love to see a realistic film made of your life - with the good and the bad, but also with dialogues and plotlines that apparently were not created by the chimpanzees!
