Completely agree with another review. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked up a comment on another site and found it was not even a real sequel. That was after I slowly pulled away from the TV with the remote in my hand, my jaw dropping lower and lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of filming is beyond the budget. It does not look like a crazy movie. If I were watching "home video" videos of a documentary, I would wait. <br /> <br /> In short: Avoid, avoid avoiding. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and hope to have saved other people from renting or owning.
