It's not a terrible movie - my 10 year old loved it, and he would be the target audience, so I guess they hit it right. Very annoying for an adult though. <br /> <br /> Difficult to relate to lego characters of animation, even high tech mod. <br /> <br /> I thought the choice of the three great virtues of the Bionicle the world was a bit strange - oneness, duty and fate. Am I the only one who thinks these sounds are a little fascist? Especially the destination. What about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? <br /> <br /> Well, it will sell Lego. Kind of annoying for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute ad. It could have been much worse.
