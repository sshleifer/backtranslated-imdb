Not as bad as "Billy Bathgate", but close. As hard as he tried, Warren Beatty simply could not be believed as Bugsy. Whenever he freaked out, instead of being shocked by the violence, I found it very embarrassing because it was so fake. The other actors do not do well either. Annette Bening simply does not have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better with safe characters. As many have noted, Joe Mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable George Raft. Only Harvey Keitel left unscathed, but again, this guy can make these movies while he sleeps. And Robert Beltran, with just one line, steals one of the great scenes of Beatty and Bening. With these films, I'm never sure if the director is intent on making gangsters look like normal businessmen or if that's the way it is. Anyway, I do not like that. These guys were murderers and no matter how much Vegas is owed to Bugsy Siegel, I do not think a movie should be done glorifying the guy, especially one with great studio support.
