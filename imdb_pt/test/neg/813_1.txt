I had this movie given to me, and I have to admit, I'm glad I did not pay any money for it. <br /> <br /> The back of the box makes it look like it's some sort of sexual triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce you. But the reality in this movie is far from it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape of the two other characters. There was absolutely nothing that I found interesting about. Even films like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare with this movie) were fascinating because of the unexpected turns. and suspense. <br /> <br /> But Jaded does not have any of that. It focuses on the rapists and the unhealthy relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the pursuit of a videotape that can prove that the story of the victims is true. <br /> <br /> Although it shows that same-sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> If possible, pass this movie at all costs.
