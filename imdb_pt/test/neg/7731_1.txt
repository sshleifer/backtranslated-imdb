I saw this movie in the movies when it was first released, I'm sorry to say, and it was one of the few movies I always wanted to get out early. I had no problem with drug content and I could see how this preventative tale could have been powerful. The problem was that the filmmaker, working with James Woods and Sean Young, drew two of the less lovable characters I've seen in movies. I hated this pair and could not have cared less if they sank straight into the inevitable bottom. Its not a surprise in this movie. Each turn of events was so painfully obvious that I felt I could have written the script myself; though I like to think I would have done a better job. I later heard nightmarish stories about the setbacks between Sean Young and James Woods along the lines of some kind of chase events. It made me wonder if the terrible acting out of some bad feelings and dysfunction. Anyway, I refer to The Boost as the worst movie I ever paid to see.
