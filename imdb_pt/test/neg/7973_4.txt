When Kristy Swanson gets an attack of the guilty about what she does, she wants out. Unfortunately, Madsen is his immediate superior in a company where "giving two weeks in advance is not an option". <br /> <br /> As a teenager killing vampires, Kristy did a great job. The image of the valley girl seemed to fit. But like a murderer running away ... well, keep running with Kristy. Run, run away! This movie is not a concept that was not made before, but was made better! <br /> <br /> I did not want to watch the rest of the movie, but I felt I should if I wanted to give a review of this movie. I always liked Madsen, and his character was a bit predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time to watch and do ... no wonder it has never been released in theaters!
