At Halloween, three friends search a funeral suburb for fun and pull a cross from a grave, where Jack-O was buried many years ago by farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed, kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family to take revenge. <br /> <br /> The tacky "Jack-O" is a combination of a terrible story with a horrible performance. I was curious about John Carradine's name in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorized the use of archive footage in such a bad movie, showing a total lack of respect for the name of this great actor. It's amazing how bad the acting is, switching the movie to a comedy rather than the proposed horror genre. This is the kind of movie that is good to see with a group of friends, drinking beer, making comments and laughing a lot. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jack-O Halloween Demon" ("Jack-O" Halloween Demon)
