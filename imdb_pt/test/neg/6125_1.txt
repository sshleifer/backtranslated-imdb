The French make pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with some among them. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the last of its kind. Of the opening credits telling the viewer what song is going to be played and by who was the one who made it, you know it will get shrouded in middle-class pretense. It's a movie of an old man with an excess of 40 and more people. He is also directed by an elderly man along with an old team that has nothing to say about life for the viewer. The plot is not just banal but absurd. How many movies reveal the plot through the dialogue just to repeat the same message via flashback five minutes later? Perhaps the director and the actors had a low retentive capacity? In fact, it's not a sustainable plot. It is a puzzle with holes like a good piece of French cheese. <br /> <br /> Intentionally or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious outburst adopted in each scene. I agree that it has some well framed pictures, although they could not have used a steady camera in this movie - it would have woken them all! In addition to being a meaningless story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade its values ​​and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location. One telling phrase from the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she does not need to lock her car while at the resort! Oh, my dear. On the DVD, Miss Huppert makes a comment about the shedding of a fake tear through a scene. Smiling she says, "Like they do at the American Actor's Studio!" I think Ms. Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well at Actor's Studio. <br /> <br /> If there is a statement that stands out in my mind, it is when Huppert notes that "we are having friends for the weekend". and all the servants are far off. ' No doubt everyone had slipped out of the mind, no longer associated with such a shocking movie. <br /> <br /> Medical Safety Note. In the film they show a scald of hot water being covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never be done. Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> At least 10 brands.
