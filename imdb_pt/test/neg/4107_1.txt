A THUNDER SOUND. One of the biggest short stories ever written. For one of the greatest Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story. <br /> <br /> But what a vomit movie! <br /> <br /> In Bradbury's science fiction tale, a company called Time Safari offers game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule number one is: stay in the way, a floating metal passage that guarantees no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man gets out of the way and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting team returns to the present - the world as they know has changed drastically. Although there are paradoxes in any time travel story, Bradbury's tale was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the cascading effect. <br /> <br /> A sound of thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most reissued science). story of all time), and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury's story, the marvel of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, which in turn was overshadowed by the mortal danger to the very existence of mankind. <br /> <br /> While in the movie, A THUNDER SOUND (directed by Peter Uneven) Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a handful of bad actors crosses the portal of time again and again to try correct your mistakes, like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The film has nothing to do with Bradbury's powerful tale except the initial jolt of time traveling to the prehistoric hunting party. Blatant liberties are taken from Bradbury's story - baboon-like reptiles, plants invading Chicago concrete, waves of time rippling through the city, CGI insects - for which Bradbury was to process the filmmakers' pants, briefs, and long hair. <br /> <br /> Writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency because they felt they could really add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve that. How do these guys walk straight with such big balls? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a wig so bad looking like a wig, Edward Burns is his main hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murran MacClannough in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts. <br /> <br /> I can not relate the hundreds and thousands of notorious stupidities and asinine dialogue pieces, but here is only one, spoken by David Oyelowo as a sort of "scientist": he refers to the Pleiades. cluster of stars, "The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, are not they? But each of them is a whole galaxy." No, stupid scientist, they are actually stars. Those three imbeciles who rewrote Bradbury's history forgot that they knew nothing about physics or astronomy. Or write. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick's chest struggling against the oversized blouses. <br /> <br /> - Revision: Poffy The Cucumber (by Poffy's Movie Mania).
