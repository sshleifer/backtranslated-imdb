This is another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm correct. <br /> <br /> The movie has great moments that will make you laugh out loud, which frankly only comes from Govinda, who has become a legend within Indian cinema and will always bring his A game in terms of comedies. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics "Don", an Indian movie icon. Lara Dutta is an advantage ... I know I look superficial, but it's mainly because I have a soft spot for her, she tries to be funny, but it seems to be forced. Her acting is weak ... but she still shines. Salman Khan is atrocious, he tries to bring down the legal and enchanting depths, but fails miserably, he overcomes the acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "This is not acting as a companion, this is called being mentally challenged" <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is simply bad ... not very good at anything. No charisma, no talent ... and I do not see why people consider her beautiful ... The plot was unlikely and I had a hard time believing that Katrina's character was remotely attracted to Govinda. The only good thing is the song ... 'You are my love' was the best of the soundtrack.
