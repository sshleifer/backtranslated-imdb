For simplicity, Mind of Mencia is Comedy Central's worst show, and possibly all television ... never. I love Comedy Central and I watch a lot of shows and movies there all the time, but every time the introduction of this show starts right after a good comedy, I can not find the control fast enough. <br /> <br /> Mencia's account used worn-out racial jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, so I'll show the ethnicity that he just spoke in the audience as if to say 'they liked it, so your whole race likes it, and by extension I also '. Give me some time, Mencia, I do not know if these people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and strip him five after one of his ridiculous jokes, does not mean he thinks you're funny, Means just that you put it on the spot and what else will it do, slap you on the TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are profound, meaningful and thought-provoking, which is evident in his commercials, but when you watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also states that only smart people get some of their jokes, but you do not have to be smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that you may need to finish Carlos's third grade. The guy goes on to say that he says what others are just thinking, but I think you will find that if someone was thinking what he says, they found out for themselves that it was ridiculous, which is why they never said that. First of all. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch 1 episode and end it if you have to, because after watching 1 episode, you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central continues to renew this horrible show that is far beyond me. If you're looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere because you'll find very little of it here.
