This movie was filmed and produced in 1987, but it only hit theaters in 1990. While watching this movie, I could see the good intentions I had, but I fear there is not much talent or experience behind the camera. to make it work. The story is set in California in the 1890s and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are told they need to leave their lands for a railroad to pass. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who offered money for the land, but was refused. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he is proud to go out and asks the other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their lands. Berrigan gets impatient and hires a band of bandits to force everyone out. These thugs are headed by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and he does not hesitate to kill anyone who gives him trouble. Andrews and his men kill Collogero one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) promises to take revenge and reclaim the land for all. Marco explodes the bridge that the railway would need and they also destroy a tunnel and this delays the project for several months and Berrigan now begins to receive heat from other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and, in addition to "The Trip To Bountiful", he has at most a remarkable career in the direction. He is a good actor, but here he seems to be on top of his head. This was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and it is easy to see that this did not occur. Roberts's hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but this is supposed to be 1890! The director of photography is Toyomichi Kurita who turned out to be a good cameraman, but this was only his fourth film and certainly did not learn everything at the time. It's not a film-looking sharp at all and I noticed in several scenes during the day that the sun would be looking out for something and the scenes just did not have the sharpness that would have helped the overall look. The script is just a story of revenge and there are no surprises throughout the film. We know that Giannini will succeed and it seemed only a matter of time. The cast is top notch and they do their best, but the whole movie seems uninspired. This was promoted as a film debut for Julia Roberts, but I'm not sure if that's correct. She may have appeared in a movie called "Firehouse" before that.
