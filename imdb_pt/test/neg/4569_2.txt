I'm usually not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on moody tastes and rarely shy away from clich√© story lines and characters and frankly boring dialogues. However, I had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school. To see the teacher's figures so recognizable that their asses kicked always encouraged me and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is instantly enjoyable, this was not the case with Cheats, especially the protagonist. Of course, it did not help that the actor at stake was one of the most annoying, untalented, arrogant kids I've ever seen in a comedy. <br /> <br /> To play in a comedy is not a joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be right or the stuff is wasted. In this case, there was not much good to begin with and the half-witty jokes were professionally spoiled by the cast. <br /> <br /> This movie lasted 3 hours, the director has never heard of rhythm. obviously. Stay away from this, there are many other nice teen comedies out there like the 10 things I hate about you, who your father is and Superbad.
