Miserable movie. Not even to be compared at once with "To Kill a Mockingbird," or "In the Heat of the Night." <br /> <br /> Yes, there is racial bias, but the film is at best ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Come now. Would you really have Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, guarding a prison to avoid lynching? Patterson, in her day, played everyone's mother and was the owner of "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. <br /> <br /> Imagine exhaling the body so that the black does not go out The man's gun killed a white man? <br /> <br /> Claude Jarman Jr., who was so fabulous in 1946, "The Yearling" appears in this mess. He still had those sad eyes. My eyes would also be sad if I showed up in this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> For me, this was nothing more than Faulkner's failure.
