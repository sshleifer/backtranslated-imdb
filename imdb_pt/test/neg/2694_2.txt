I saw this movie as a preview before the opening of Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to it will depend largely on your attitude in respecting Shakespeare's text. On the plus side: Pacino offers very good performance like Shylock; Lynn Collins is a great Portia; and the film has a sumptuous look. <br /> <br /> Negatives are predictable. "The Merchant of Venice" is arguably the most difficult of all Shakespeare plays to stage today, largely because we look at it through the distorted lens of twentieth-century history. The romantic plot with Bassanio and Portia presents no problem. Shylock's character does, because we lack the original referential of the Elizabethan audience. Shylock is simultaneously a human character with human qualities and motivations and an abstraction of the merciless quality of the Old Law. When he says "Hath not a Jewish eyes?" he is a character; when he proclaims "I will have my bond!" it is an abstraction. The long passage in music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut into tapes) is the key to the play, as it reestablishes universal harmony after the disruptive and malignant forces (the Shylock of the judgment scene) are ejected. It is possible to make a psychological sense of Shylock's character by showing that he gradually goes mad and becomes monomaniacal when the scene of the judgment unfolds - the key is that at some point he must cease to be understanding. <br /> <br /> Pacino's performance almost does it, but not quite. The film can not decide - on the one hand, there is the right move in Shylock's character, and on the other hand there are a lot of strange images of Jews being abused and Venetian prostitutes with painted nipples. (undoubtedly to show the decline of Antonio et al). Shakespeare was not writing a social drama like Ibsen; he was writing a comedy following the classic pattern of disruption of the social order and the restoration of social order, symbolized by marriage, with a theme of love versus law at the center of Shylock's plot. <br /> <br /> Sense, the film is a farce - Radford's surgery in the game and in the direction almost distances us from what the play really means. (Taking the beginning of the final scene, cutting the bulk and moving it before the experimental scene is the most extreme example.) There are some other significant difficulties. Jeremy Irons, a great actor, plays Antonio as if he had an overdose of sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is handsome, but shallow like Bassanio. Most of the actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino and the actor who plays the duke at the scene of the trial, murmur their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final verdict? A beautiful movie with some decent performances. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. Not really worth your time or money - although Lynn Collins, like Portia, almost the ransom.
