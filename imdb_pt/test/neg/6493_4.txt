This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie and one of its worst James Glickenhaus ruined!. All the characters are decent, I think, but the story is so, however Jackie Chan is still amazing even if he seems bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was pretty annoying many times, however, the end was above average and managed to be quite entertaining, and had some good stunts!. I have not yet seen the version of Hong Kong, however I'm sure that is better than this failure, plus the twist is very predictable!. It's really lifeless and bland, and I do not blame Jackie for not looking happy about it, and if he did not star it, it would have been unbearable and completely unacceptable. The opening must be memorable, but it's nothing I have not seen before and done better at it, and I thought the whole movie was a little lazy and it could have been a great movie if Jackie was in control of it! did not cheer for any of the characters. This is a very mediocre film by Jackie Chan, and one of his worst moments, James Glickenhaus, spoiled everything !, not recommended even for fans of Die hard Jackie Chan. The direction is terrible!. James Glickenhaus does a terrible job here with extremely dull camera work, bad angles and keeping the movie boring most of the time. The act is so. Jackie Chan is amazing as always, however, he is not his usual energetic self, and seems bored and Ps * ed off throughout the film, had zero chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I do not really blame him either! (Jackie Rules !!!!!) Danny Aiello is right here as Jackie's partner, but his character is a little dumb, and he had zero chemistry with Jackie, he did okay, I guess. Roy Chiao is decent as the main villain but was just going through the motions and was not so threatening, he's still pretty cool though. The rest of the cast are, at best, medium. Overall not worth your time or money. * 1/2 of 5
