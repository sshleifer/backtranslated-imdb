In fact, Son of the Mask made me laugh a few times ... mostly because of the cartoon jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. The CGI is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. Garfield, for example, is not in the same place as the CGI, but I would give the same vote. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which was not so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it's a KIDS movie ... and therefore should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good in his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and the overall performance is poor. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is not so bad. <br/> <br/> Basically, my 2 and 5 year olds watched the whole thing without complaining. At least I could get through it. <br /> <br /> There is no way this movie is worse than shaking Class of 1999 4/10 for the CGI and a few laughs
