TANDEM is a strange slice of the Japanese pink genre - since it has the required sex scenes and the misogynistic tone that are almost required for these types of movies - but it also launches a disjointed drama / comedy dark drama that seems to be D were more suitable for a different type of film. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with two lonely guys in a restaurant - every day dreaming of a previous sexual encounter. One is a mutual subway, the other is a typical semi-rape scenario (for this type of movie). The two perverts meet and start talking after one lends a cigarette to the other. They go out for a night and talk a little about their respective sex lives. The film is interspersed with flashback scenes of both men's interactions with women who are central to their lives. The two men fall out and the movie ends with a weird but predictable note ... <br /> <br /> I really do not know what to do with TANDEM. It's kind of an anticompetitive kind of movie, but it does not really exploit the subject to a satisfactory degree. Nor is there much of the typical extreme scorn so prevalent in these types of films - so I can not figure out the point. I also can not tell if the movie should be funny, depressing or both. I think TANDEM could have some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark comedy of humor - but as a soft-core sex movie that tries to be very smart for its own sake - it just does not work. I can not say that I hated this, but I can not say that there is anything remarkable about it either. 4/10
