Okay, hardly be brief. This movie was not only bad, it was very, very bad, with line4s like "if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh * t in your shoes" you know your territory from heinous movies. After watching this movie I wanted to kill myself and my whole family, it gave me such a great feeling of self-loathing that I wanted to do a murder. Do not watch this movie. I'm going to kill again. but when I do that it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and filmed stock to hire action sequences and bad shirts. <br /> <br /> Fortunately there is a flipside, it is the first action movie to present a three door saw. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it ends up in rubbish on your roof :( <br /> <br /> Ps: Worse Than the Shooter
