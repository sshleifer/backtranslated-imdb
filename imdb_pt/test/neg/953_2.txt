As an iconic show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic to the biggest drop in TV G4; is a show (and a season) that has fallen so much that it parades the sex to try to cover its glaring flaws. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a place to solve technology problems and discover the latest in technology. It was a cool show with friendly staff and it was fun to see some of the mods and other experiments that the staff could do together. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV by G4 has bothered some longtime fans of the season. , but the initial returns were indeed promising. The emphasis on the game was a nice addition and I really enjoyed the coverage of E3 and other major entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS now stands out like a shell from its old self. Those who oversee the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and games and anything that could provoke the drooling of young adult males. The result is that AOTS spends so much time parading Olivia Munn or promoting the adult film industry as cover games. It's so bad that it's practically unacceptable. <br /> <br /> While some may have childish joy with this kind of thing, those who genuinely love to play may wonder where the good coverage was. Equally troubling are the young players who can get in tune with the G4, thinking their game - that active group of games between 10 and 15 years old - is being fed with stuff aimed at a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like this are expected. In G4, it's tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another channel aimed at the male audience, has good programming like the CSI. AOTS, and G4, has very little good to offer. <br /> <br /> Too bad, actually.
