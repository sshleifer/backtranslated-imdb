not many people outside Poland had the opportunity to become acquainted with the brilliant writings of andrzej sapkowski. He is very popular in Poland for his fantasy tales (I believe none of them have ever been translated into English. To shorten the story, wiedzmin - the main character in sapkowski's books - is a traveling killer, a man of extraordinary strength and skill: he is practically his legal guy in the Tolkien style. unfortunately, no one would discover this after watching the movie. 'wiedzmin' the film is no more than a collection of random scenes, featuring wiedzmin and other characters from sapkowski's writings, but not remotely resembling the plot and dramatic rhythm of the original. The fact that some of the scenes in the movie show attractive nude women does not add any quality to them. the movie gets worse every minute, and does not even meet the requirements of the category 'so bad it's really good'. If you really like fantasies and want to learn something about wiedzmin, read the books.
