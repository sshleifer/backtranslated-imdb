I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The whole movie was useless. My wife and I regret that we did not get up and leave at the first indication of what the film really would be (which is still difficult to determine, since it was such a ridiculous plot ... blood, courage and violence seemed to be the only real issue ), but we hoped there was something redeemer just around the corner. Unfortunately, there was nothing because there was nothing that made sense! We, along with a lot of other people in the audience, came out of the cinema muttering "this was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "I should have left", "where was the comedy", "that was pathetic", etc. In fact, it made us, the audience, the voice of our disgust and the feeling that we've just been completely ripped out. The only thing of merit in the film was the costumes and acting skills of almost everyone in the film ... there simply was not a script worthy of their talents. I classify this as a 1 because there is a 0. I can not understand how anyone could rate this above 0!
