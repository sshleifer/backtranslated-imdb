Boring, ridiculous and stupid "Submerged" is a waste of time. The shootings were a joke, the real people do not stand out outdoors with any hood, hoping to get shot first! So many things wrong or bad, it's not worth the effort to list except a big flaw. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of LA and the water is 100 feet deep ??? Even so, none of the people would have survived the decompression because they had been subjected to 100 feet of water pressure for more than 20 hours when they were created. Just awful.
