. . . and never, never see it. Now, I've been watching science fiction movies for years. I love watching bad science fiction movies. I think that was the only reason I could watch this movie all the time. I was hardened by "Nukie", "Indian Superman" and that movie "Fantastic Four", just to name a few. Usually I have to bang my head against the wall after I've seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away. No, not with this one. With "TDB", I had to hit my head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. Provisional repair. I can not believe I wanted to see this. I cried. When it was over, I cried. It was horrible. It was worse than when I saw Wil Wheaton shimmy in "The Curse," which, by the way, had never witnessed anything. Besides the fact that Wesley Crusher is wearing his tight whiteys, it's so bad. But this review is about "TDB". The worst part is that someone wrote this movie and said, "It deserves to be filmed! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe and everyone else in the cast said, "Oh, that's what I want in my movie history!" I'm going to watch "Indian Superman" until the cows get home, but I'm never going to see that steaming pile again.
