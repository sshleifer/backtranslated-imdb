I can not believe that Isaiah Washington and Ice-T were in this mess! The plot (and I use this term very vaguely) revolves around an army of rats that terrorize a complex of urban apartments - at least I think that's what it's all about. The script made no sense at all, I could not have cared less about the characters and the work of the camera consisted in repeatedly showing dark images of rats standing on their hind legs or running. Running is what I should have done. As an African-American man, I often read requests from my brothers and sisters to "support African-American films." I try to help, but enough is enough. No one should see garbage like this for any reason. Please, brothers and sisters, do not produce anything more straightforward for rat rats like this. Please!
