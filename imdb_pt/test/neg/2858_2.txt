I was very disappointed after seeing the Revenge of Pinocchio the other night. I had a good inclination that would be bad, but I did not think it would be as bad as it happened. A wooden doll of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an eight-year-old daughter of a lawyer. From there, it's a killer way for anyone to stand in the way between the puppet and the little girl. We've seen movies like this before, namely the Child's Play series, which is by the way much better. However, it was nice to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. Both worked with Kevin Tenney before. Anyway, I encourage viewers to check out "Night Of The Demons" and the original "Witchboard." These are titles that tend to bring out the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
