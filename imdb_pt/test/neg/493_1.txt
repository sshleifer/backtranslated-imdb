This is the movie that is somewhat based on Rob Halford's departure from British Metal Gods' Judas Priest and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to be a tribute band to Priest. Originally titled Metal God, this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little or nothing about metal music, decided to turn down the volume. Since the change from Metal God's title to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack, this film presents itself poorly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band, I was really looking forward to seeing this, I was very disappointed with several points in the film. The soundtrack is not much metal for one, and the end of the movie is lame too. The film has some bright spots in writing and acting, but as a whole, it fails in the end because ... 1) A film based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2) There is nothing metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of ​​'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio and Black Sabbath are your idea of ​​metal, watch this movie for a good laugh.
