This was shown at Sundance last night for a receptive and silent crowd. Of course the story is worth reporting, it's powerful and true, but did the director have to throw each paper with a recognizable face? I mean, really, you spend your time saying, "Oh, look, it's the Armageddon guy," or "Hey, it's the Easy Rider!" and you lose sight of history. Maybe it's the only way this guy could make his movie, but it's a little disturbing, like "The Boat of Love," or those old Towering Inferno movies that were "full of stars!" just told the story simply with less famous faces. In addition, the camera work seems a little lazy, as if there was no thought on where to put the camera to tell the story better. In all, I thought everything was fine, but could have been very good.
