I saw this movie for the first time on a Saturday matinee when I was very young. I thought it was cool and I often thought about it. Well, finally I review it on DVD. It was still a lot of fun, but in a different way. It has to be classified as one of the most idiotic and country-minded science fiction films of the 1950s. It looked full of military footage. The dialogue is flushed and the effects are gross. There is a line of dialogue that made me in points. The line Jeff Morrow says while on the beach with the baby. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends. It's a classic.
