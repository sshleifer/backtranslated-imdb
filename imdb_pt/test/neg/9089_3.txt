This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a great, funny guy does not mean it's more than a B movie. The script is horrible, it just circulates constantly ridiculing crimes and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and continues to fall on your face, doing justice to neither. <br /> <br /> First, there are 30 minutes of Vietnam prisoners of war, somewhat unrealistic and uninspired. the guy is playing basketball at one point ... How much more can you give in to your audience? ... That prison time is boring, not convincing and can easily put one to sleep. Back in the US, the guy, for no real reason, is considered a "war hero." However, it is clear that he is quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling over all sorts of crazy setbacks. Or are they really? We'll find out soon enough. To yawn. There are annoying clich√©s: his sick mother, his little girl he never knows, a prostitute who falls in love with the hero, etc. It's very strange how this film constantly changes from tragedy to clowning in an instant. It does not work at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to the prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great comedian, played some good movies and died of multiple sclerosis, is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly, unconvincing and dull comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be thrilled to read 3 hours of Dada poetry.
