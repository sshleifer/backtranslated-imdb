Dictated by little experience (both life and industry) and out of money, the short film by Sofia Coppola is almost necessarily a piece of observation set on a high school campus. The cast is rather weak and does not benefit from being shot in b & w (it's hard to distinguish the characters). The sound editing does little to help a simple story of fickle teenage loyalty. <br /> <br /> However, there are one or two things to watch. On the other hand, the inconsistent edition of the high school campus is filmed with a large and intimate close-ups photo swing. The editing for music also creates an interest and a momentum (no descent to the underworld of Music Video). Coppola clearly made an attempt to vary the pace of the film. The dramatic turn is cut quickly and to the point and the second act is almost non-existent; we recognize that, in fact, it was played in conjunction with the first, which is the narrator's trope point on the crutches (which is an otherwise curiously added character in that first act). <br /> <br /> Despite these notes is a strange short. 2/10
