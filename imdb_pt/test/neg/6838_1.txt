Spoilers !! Bruce Willis, the comic and funny half-time guy plays a Hispanic killer dubbed an African prairie dog scavenger? I think all the good Hispanic nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpio, Viper, Snake, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (Whip), Razor, etc. were not available ?? And why would any South American murderer be familiar with an Irish Republican Army terrorist? The last time I checked, the IRA is not looking to open any branches in South America. And why were some Irish terrorists, tough and prison-weary, looking like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought maybe this movie was a parody of "The Crying Game" when Gere's character was introduced as the person who would hunt "The Jackal." What a bad cast! And why would the FBI be hiring depraved terrorists to track down the killers? It looks like a terrorist goes in search of mass destruction, and a killer usually hits a target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere is the only person who has ever seen Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought this movie should be a remake of the great movie "Day of The Jackal", but this movie is just a dumber version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both movies are really dumb, and part of the stupidity is the fact that, as the public, we are forced to watch Bruce Willis go through his routines and we must say "Wow! He's not smart!" The PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better film about assassins. "The Jackal" is just a movie about two middle-aged and fat middle-aged actors who could be paid for looking beautiful and pretending to be smart! "The Jackal" is so poor that I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme making appearances as "other" assassins or FBI. Needless to say, "The Jackal" has escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere gets to work, it's only a few days before "The Jackal" is choked! I think the positive message from this film is: "Thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from murderers." In general, the "Jackal" does not have redemptive qualities.
