The worst movie of all time, with characters from Carnosaur 1-3 inserted merely to fall into the same death they had in the first film, so that filming and special effects could be reused. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this debacle. <br /> <br /> Corman is ruining his legacy. He made and produced some amazing movies - but that era ended with Carnosaur being his last film "creative in its evil".
