It's hard to develop any enthusiasm for this horrible epic that for some reason has become a cult classic. Certainly it can not be because of the totally artificial appearance of the scenes or the clear performance of a cast of stars. Nowadays this is often shown on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. <br /> <br /> It hurts to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are even cast into this confusing science fiction plot, and none of them play. truth. It's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a Saturday afternoon children's show, full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialogue. It's a comic version of Jules Verne's novel. Fontaine's maturing was still appealing, but there was an expression of pain on his face, perhaps regretting accepting the psychiatrist's role before reading the script. It contributes absolutely nothing to your paper cardboard but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and it seems totally out of place most of the time. Faring is no better Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and - above all, Peter Lorre - as well as Frankie Avalon, who starts singing the title song that - it's safe to say - has not become anyone's favorite title song. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience to sit in a movie like this that misses an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence. Totally unconvincing from start to finish. The film, as well as the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus takes the film to a sad conclusion.
