Unfortunately, almost every shot or taken, you could say that it was a low budget film. <br /> <br /> Newborn babies are obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst is the doctor. The actors are not credible in their roles: their speech, when spoken, is very memorized, as if it were a reading camera test.
