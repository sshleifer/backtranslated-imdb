This was one of the slowest movies I ever had the dislike of sitting down. After the introduction, where we are given the story of "something" killing some people in a farmhouse, we are introduced to a lost family that is moving to a farm - and nothing happens for a looooong time. Then they find that bum who helps on the farm AND NOTHING HAPPENS again for long. So finally, the family girl has some things plotergeist happens. Then, a few more things happen, the bum guy goes crazy and the movie ends. In the middle of it all is about how this family had to move because the girl had some problems at home and they have no money and it was made POORLY that I could care less about these pathetic people. I can not believe I actually went to theaters to see this! Not only was this movie bad, but a $ 1.00 hole responded to your cell phone, idiot idiots making noise and the movie sucked. That's why the theaters fuck bad movies, bad food and idiots in the movies, I stay at home and watch DVDs from now on, at least I could smoke if I were at home while watching this stupid movie. Stay home and make some pie instead of going to a theater to see this typical crap. You stupid stupid shit.
