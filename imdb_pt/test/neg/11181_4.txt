Father Brown's thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. A bit of proselytism I do not care, but this sometimes gets a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some good actors have played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this film and does everything right for him, but you did not see any great demand for future films of Father Brown. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you're a committed Roman Catholic, you do everything perfectly. Common sense. It is much more important to catch the thief and convert him to his religion than to see that he has been brought to justice. <br /> <br /> But that's what we were asked to accept here. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in clerical attire is caught trying to put back stolen articles that one of his parishioners Sidney James had stolen during an assault. <br /> <br /> This is the story he gives to local cops and of course, this is something that James has trusted in him so he can not break the confessional. <br /> <br /> Now let's go for a bigger game. Master thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, stole a cross that is entrusted to Father Brown and was said to belong to St. Augustine in the past. But Father Brown is more interested in getting Flambeau back to his faith than seeing him brought to justice. So he fools the cops so he can accomplish his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but this whole thing was too much for me to swallow. Father Brown, I would hate to say that I was guilty of obstruction and should have been arrested. And he had no obligation to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau, the man had not sought him out as a penitent in search of absolution and spiritual counsel. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a Catholic layman very noticed in his time, finds all this very reasonable. Taking its logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with an army of parents. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne of Kind Hearts and Coronets and Barry Fitzgerald on Going My Way to create Father Brown. Granted though Brown is much smarter than the other two. There is also a bit of Colonel Nicholson in this picture. In The Bridge on the River Kwai, Guinness also played a character whose strange interpretation of the rules made him lose sight of what was important in Nicholson's situation. <br /> <br /> Father Brown is a fun guy. when he is solving mysteries and making the authorities look silly. We liked Brother Cadfael in a medieval setting and the American public liked Father Dowling played by Tom Bosley a few years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been fun.
