I know a lot of people like this show and I apologize to people who think this show is amazing, but it's the worst show ever created. Of course, I'm sure I would be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson was not there. I mean, I think testing cars and doing things like seeing if a car can beat a plane is amazing! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man. He thinks it's legal to fool speed cameras that measure his average speed, measuring his distance and his time driving 200 km / h on the track and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. He has my best friend saying pathetic things. . He shouts to the children just by taking a picture of him. Sorry, but Jeremy Clarkson is an aberration.
