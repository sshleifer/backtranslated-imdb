A young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child. Both are disturbed by a memory leak of two hours the night of conception. Interesting twist on a banal story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter excels in a cast featuring Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normality to the stranger. Many compliments to director Brian Yuzna.
