There is much to be said in addition to many Wire-fu and purported selfish Sholin monks about Kung-fu and Japanese caricatures planning to conquer China. All this would not be so bad if it were not for the totally false Japanese sword fight. If you've watched one or two Samurai movies, you can say that the "Japanese" who fight in the movie are simply the same stunts of "Kung-fu" (Really circus acrobats) doing the same things except with a Japanese sword. However, there are some fun times, like when a Japanese ninja rips off her clothes in the middle of a flight to disarm a monk and capture him with a fishing net. In terms of history, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as to whether the Japanese should be shown as utterly despicable or whether there could be exceptions. The "Japanese" protagonist is shown as largely honorable, but not beyond unjustified cruelty, such as when he kills a sedated monk so he can have his duel. Quite disappointing with a very silly ending. Not for a moment evokes even the appearance of the idea of ​​an epic battle.
