Jim Carrey is a particular brand of humor and I personally think he's a great actor (Eternal Sunshine, for example). <br /> <br /> However, this movie is presumably meant to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware that if you do not think your comedy style is funny, you'll be stoned along of this movie, since it has NO other to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Even if you enjoy Carrey's Comedy, I'm not sure if you're going to find this movie amusing. I went to see him on a Saturday night at 10.30 and the crowd was definitely ready to laugh. They laughed over the trailers, which were not particularly funny, but when it came to the movie, stony silence. I think it raised about five genuine laughter. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it does not know what it wants to be. You can not decide if it's going to be a joke or a serious one. If it were stupid everywhere, it could be forgiven, but (I'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the movie is the wait. ups, and there was so much potential here. But this did not begin until the middle and remained largely underdeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to go through the excruciating first 40 minutes while the couple's life deteriorates. Four separate groups left the movie while I was there, and if my roommate had not asked me to stay away from the house (her girlfriend had just returned from a month's vacation!), I would have done the same. And in all my 25 years of film, I did it only once before.
