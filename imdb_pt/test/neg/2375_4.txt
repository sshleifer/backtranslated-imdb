It's not horrible, but it's a waste ... Unpleasant jokes, bad music, bad cartoons and animation ... <br /> <br /> In relation to the impressive number of entertainers and intervalists in this photo (de, um ... a hundred different studios around the world? Come on, how can you expect something consistent when making an animated movie this way!) I wonder if a guy in credits = a drawing! The lines are rough, 3D work is inadequate (I'm not against, but not in this movie). But the scenarios are correct. The plot is pretty stupid, far from the accurate intelligence of the BD and obviously aimed at an international audience. Distributing a movie around the world does not mean taking everyone in the world to a simplefactor ... A cultural object is much more interesting when challenging even when it is a foreign film (being French in this case is even worse! Some new things are going well (the Olaf character, sometimes as the explanation of the stone but not cool) but the modern references are exasperating (music, SMS - not even a verbal joke, just one Stupid bird called short message service: does anyone know the imagination?). But, hey, it's a M6 / TPS production with some Celine Dion in it ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​underemployed and Obelix talks too much. Goudurix could be great (as in the book), but he's very clearly a "cool guy" having a love affair (with an uninteresting female character invented). In fact, only the Vikings (except the wizard) are funny. Lots of action, not enough laughter. The best part of the movie is the final credits. Not the music, but the few images it contains. BD style. Well, definitely, Asterix was not made to move!
