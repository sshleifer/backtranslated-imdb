There !! What a mess we have here. Not so much of a mess as a painfully boring and half-idiot excuse for exploration. Brought to you by the first and only, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same as the Moonshine Mountain. Dr. Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is, I think, somewhat inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The Late Mr. Patterson also stars in this joke as a brokenhearted / plastic surgeon who recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is insane to regret, to the point of making it clear that the next step is to kill countless females , then maybe steal some tombs for body parts in order to "unite" the perfect partner. It will not be easy, but thank goodness your friend Gregg, the hunchback, is available to give you help and moral support. <br /> <br /> If any proof was needed, some peoples goals should not be made. accomplished, here it is, gang. This hayseed patterson obviously never had any business directing anything, much less, following in the footsteps of good old H. G. as a master of blood. I've never seen a bloody movie that just refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. Even the blood is boring. Almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to tell whether it is intentional or not. I choose "no". <br /> <br /> Filmed in Charolotte, North Carolina (home of the California Ax Massacre), probably a 3-digit budget, for a guy, as untalented as he can get. was, who probably had an appreciation for the garbage drive-in, so maybe we should take a good break for the JG, that is, he tried (I suppose) that is more than can be said for most, and this movie is better than any big-budget superhero trash theaters throw out these days, though I realize that's not saying much. Besides, Dr. Gore is a big improvement over Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it's a little possible that he improved his craft in time, if he had not died, then maybe it's not so terrible, especially compared to the other movie the DVD, how to make a doll, then what the hell, check it out. 4/10
