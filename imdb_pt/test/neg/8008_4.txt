I think saying that this movie has many is not what makes this movie bad. The twists and turns are not the problem of the movie. The story is pretty clever and could have been really cool if filmed correctly. The main problems by which everyone is complaining about the plot twists in the film is that the film is not fascinating enough to make people follow them. The film is poorly filmed (at least compared to its genre, Lock, Stock). Worse: the characters are (though often well-acted) simply flat. Characters do not have enough time to be presented enough to allow the viewer to engage with one of them, let alone understand them. Oh and the sites are terrible: local-person (did not bother to see the credits for your name) - get another job (maybe still photography or interior design)
