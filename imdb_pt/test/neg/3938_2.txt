Good idea .... shame about the actual movie. Would you like to be a little scarier and explain more about the characters and who exactly the evil woman was? If she was torturing these children why they were helping her kill and not helping others to kill ?? It's a bit of a descendant of Malcolm in the Middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would benefit from being a little longer and going into more detail with the characters, although after about an hour I was wondering when it would have been better also if the actual characters that killed them did not were actually computerized, that kind of made them uncomfortable. And what happened to the Frankie Munitz character? He fell into a bed of wild roses, so he should be safe, however, the computer game showed him how to game over, that is, dead. The next thing he shows up with that annoying blonde girl is to rescue the guy in fear of fire who, I noticed, had no qualms about using the lighter when the demon woman was after him. <br /> <br /> Many inconsistencies in this movie. to really enjoy, however, can make you think twice before playing this new computer game!
