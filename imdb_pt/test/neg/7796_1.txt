think about the movie-worthy subject you can and that's 10 times worse. A woman needs to complete as many crosswords as possible in one day. We could not even see the questions and think the words alone, we just watched their fight. The woman seems so anxious and in a hurry to do the crossword puzzles, but for some reason she spends her time idly walking all over town when she could be focused on home. The acting is horrible, the actress huffs while trying to think the words, and we are completely in the dark. The scenery of New York is good, but the film depends a lot on it and gets old quickly. The film is a NYU rejected student film. This movie does not have redeeming qualities and I do not recommend it to anyone, ever.
