In short, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorite gaffes, plot inconsistencies, loose loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of that movie. I found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and plot lines as underdeveloped as the dinosaur embryos still locked in the shaving cream can of Jurassic Park 1. The editing was poor and none of the characters engender any kind of sympathy or feeling. In short, this film did not have any suspense and excitement that the first film provided from the point of view of history. <br /> Even the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although I really appreciated the pterodactyls). short shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action. As a scientist and former child paleontologist, the lack of any real scientific content (not that it had to be realistic but logically shaped as they built the dinosaurs in # 1 and the ramblings of malcom's chaos) was disappointing also. <br /> <br /> In short, the film seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back to the scene to make some money. I hope moviegoers will not fall into this trap again (although I've apparently fallen)
