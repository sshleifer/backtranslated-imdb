This film tries to profit from the success of Richard Curtis' films, particularly "Love Actually" - a series of different scenes following the love life of several couples. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea wrongly executed. The script tries to be a little too clever and simply does not resonate. Most of the acting is flamboyant, which is more a reflection on the director than the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on a plane) was called "Scenes from a Park", which is a more appropriate title. as not all scenes were 'sexual' in nature. <br /> <br /> I was so looking forward to this movie, but in the end it's disappointing. Do not bother yourself.
