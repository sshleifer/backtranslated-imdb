Deformed scientist, aged, kills a fellow scientist to steal formulas to rejuvenate cells and reverse the aging process. She takes it and turns into the beautiful and evil Satanik (Magda Konopka), who walks around, seducing and killing wealthy business men. <br /> <br /> She dresses very elegantly in late 60s clothing and manipulates the people around her. much like the late Marisa Mell of the movie DIABOLIK. Coincidence? <br /> <br /> However, despite all this, he is amateur and sloppy without the James Bond pop art gadget DIABOLIK had. Even the locations of Madrid and Lake Geneva do not make up for it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada and Roberto Pregadio and is not bad at all, consisting of exuberant orchestration with a bit of fuzz. guitar used as an embellishment. Perfect for one of those European Loungecore CDs that came out in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD also uses a grainy color print below the standard that is in bad shape, with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to age of the movie. Bull! They did not bother to look for a better source or could not find anything. There are only a few stills of Magda and that's it. <br /> <br /> Sloppy and poor on all sides, this one gets 3 out of 10.
