Maybe it's just the format of this film, a documentary, but I believe the film would have been much better served by good actors and a more solid dialogue. The fact that the actors are also owners of companies is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone the emotions and complexities of the business they were in, but because they are not professional actors, they do a very unsatisfying job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers. There were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade over time and the only memory I will have of this documentary is that it has had some good scenes that I can not remember. <br /> <br /> Pay attention if you want a first-hand .com bust account and see what happened to the 99% of people in the industry who did not become instant millionaires. However, be prepared for nauseating camera work, bad acting, bad dialogue and a bad movie that epitomizes the era of the Internet boom.
