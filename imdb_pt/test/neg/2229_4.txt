Some of my fellow writers have addressed the plot elements of this film, so I'll stick to some of the remarks of the fist ... 1. This is fun - but not for the reasons you think. It's tacky, but somehow still watchable. <br /> <br /> 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest has to be about thirty. The Christian girl Dan ignores is so much cuter. <br /> <br /> 3. Muriel stole Mr. Spock's shirt. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I'll have to ask for a transfer. <br /> <br /> 4. Ok ... so apparently ... Dan is responsible for the divorce of his parents! What kind of guilty trip is this ?! Muriel says it was Dan's prayers that kept his parents together. I just thought this was absolutely ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way they get together is if they decide they're going to do it. <br /> <br /> 5. I will repeat the atheist's comments about how this movie portrays non-Christians. Apparently, they're all sloppy bullies. <br /> <br /> 6. For something positive - David White is a decent actor. It gives the film a bit of credibility, even if it's the only one. He pretty much keeps this movie together on his own.
