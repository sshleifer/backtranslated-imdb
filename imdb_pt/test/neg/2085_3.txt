I've seen this movie for over 20 years and I have had fond memories of it. Picking up again at Cinemax this month, I realized how little insight I had about movies back then. This is an absolutely ordinary western spaghetti with absolutely nothing noteworthy about it. Script, direction, acting, photography are all a great blah. Stay with Sergio Leone's sights!
