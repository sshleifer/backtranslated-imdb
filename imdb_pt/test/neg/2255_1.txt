This usually sounds a lot better in my head (so excuse me for digressing) I'm hardly Tarantino's biggest fan (and I'm * trying * not to lower myself to call it a "hack" ... which is pretty hard) I like to mock or criticize a movie before I see it. So with cautious hesitation, I went to the movies today to watch Inglorious Basterds. Now calling it a rip-off of a rip-off would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from the clone Dirty Dozen of Enzo Castellari (less than spectacular), but it is not plot points (which he takes of all other genres of movies) 'Inglorious' opens with a Nazi official and his long interrogation against a farmer who is hiding Jews in his basement. This is such an anti-climax, in which the dialogue is obsolete and the result is flagged a mile away. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but more of her later) We (the obviously easily satisfied) audience is treated with the introduction of Lieutenant Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like movie B king ALDO RAY. ... ha-ha Quentin ... keep these "tributes" coming) and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with prominent chin , mr. Jolie treats us as a Nazi assassin with a shrewd and insightful speech. Meanwhile, Mr. Tarantino forgets that real adults can be present, so he presumes teenagers will not hear about 'Dirty Dozen'? Raines' platoon consists of bloodthirsty (John Cassavettes looking) soldiers, all looking to get the great return on Adolf Hitler. Tarantino, in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two such men, casting his long-time best friend (and party companion) Eli Roth (like the baseball bat wielding "Bear Jew"). The other man is called Hugo Stiglitz. (and I bet more than half of QT fanatics had never heard that name before this movie) Keep up the good work Tarantino, you got about 6 or 7 hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them <br /> <br /> Anyway, cutting off a long (and extremely annoying and prolonged) short story, both Raine and his men (the 'Inglorious Basterds' ). ') and the only survivor of chapter one, both have separate plots to kill Hitler in the showing of a Nazi propaganda film, in a French cinema (owned by the survivor mentioned above, now grown up) and meaningless) conversations follow two and frum, as Pitt tires away in a public past affection. And any genuine suspense, leading to the murder of the deadliest tyrant of all time, is thrown away by the directors' insistence on putting David Bowie's 80s song in a WWII movie. <br /> <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the problem that occurs with most Tarantino products ... it rarely knows when to start or stop. I do not need 'homage' after 'homage' to catch the * joke * (whatever it is) I met Inglorious Bastards, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the biggest crime in the entire movie) Ennio Morricone REVOLVER haunt. I go to the movies to see the stars ..... if the best you can do is the terrible Barad Pitt, I'll assume you (Mr. Tarantino) is the main attraction here? I do not want the audience to direct the movie. I paid to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity ... not how you can patchwork (and again) endless scenes from endless movies. It's time for the fan-boys (on IMDb) to employ a 'strong love' on their 'idol' (God knows, if you do not ... studios should?) Old fatigue discussion with the worshipers of Tarantino is "well, if you can do better ... do this" Let me tell you, if I were a 46-year-old director with the (unfortunate) pulls QT has ..... I want to offer you much more than a confused heated re-hash of better World War II movies than this gut. The directors he tries to emulate have made such bad movies by accident or due to budget constraints. It is a cop, over and over again, to hear his fans campaigning for his lack of imagination as 'art'. I'm sure he is capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt once again .... and not to mention two and a half hours of my life .....) maybe he is not?
