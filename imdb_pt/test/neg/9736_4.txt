Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally well regarded by historians and World War II enthusiasts as a gentleman, a soldier and a brilliant strategist in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler had given him the troops and the material he had wished for in Africa, the argument goes, things would have been very different. And that's probably true. Rommel was, in fact, a military genius and, in all cases, a sincere and honest man. <br /> <br /> But this movie does everything to portray you as an almost holy. He does his job, trying to win the war for Hitler, but constantly the Fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders, which Rommel (James Mason) expresses astonishment with, but rarely actually questions and never disobeys. Only when it is obvious that Hitler is leading Germany to ruin, Rommel thinks of treason against him; this dilemma is the main theme of the film, a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Mason is just like Rommel, but it's not a memorable performance, say George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel was not as colorful as Patton, but this film is so focused on making him look like a decent human who forgets to make it interesting. He occasionally falls into some heat when with his wife Lucie (a young Jessica Tandy, well-cast), but usually Mason is called to give a harsh British performance? as if the British were trying to claim Rommel for themselves (though, in all fairness, every Nazi had English accents except Hitler). <br /> <br /> Made cheap, with battle scenes going through stock footage and the beaches of Southern California doubling to Tunisia, there is nothing particularly to recommend this movie. A remake could be interesting (I would choose Ed Harris just because of a slight physical resemblance and, well, Harris can act) if it was tempered a little, but this film has shown me how much more demanding as spectators we have become in the last fifty years; a biography that is unspeakable would never cut her.
