If Daphne Du Maurier had established REBECCA in the 1950s in San Francisco, it might very well resemble this unusual and highly unusual noir of Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of Richard Basehart (who is also the guardian of the dead woman's son) ... it's absurd and exaggerated but also entertaining topflight. Cortese is great, slowly falling apart when he realizes the mistake he made. Basehart is good if a little bland ... although the lighting up to the end makes it look very menacing. Fay Baker makes a great caretaker of Mrs. Danvers. Wise is a great director and he keeps things moving in a really fast clip. He also stages a classic out-of-control car accident with Cortese (or at least a Cortese) on the steering wheel.
