Okay, before I get into that, let's go ahead and get the warning out of the way: this movie is SLEAZE's "cinematographic" quintessence! There are movies out there that can definitely shock or cover up that film that has more artistic validity than can be said because of this film. So, what makes it so despicable ?? Let's take a closer look at "Wet Wilderness" for a moment ...... <br /> <br /> Done in 1974 for practically nothing, this "roughie" does not have a real "plot" to talk about portraying what would happen if a FAMILY went into the desert to relax and spend a day being approached by a fat guy wearing a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicks ..... the kind that ends with everyone being forced to have sex one with the other, being systematically murdered by the masked creeper. So those sensitive to issues dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere. So to really add a level of surrealism or just demonstrate a complete ineptness to the art of making movies, the group's "daughter" flees after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black guy (!) Tied to a tree branch ("... that fat sum-bitch left me here for 3 days ...") with virtually no explanation !! He is saved ..... or is he? Of course not!! They get caught before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex too, forcing the mother to join, ending with a dead black guy (courtesy of an ax in the chest) when all is said and done. So our killer forces his daughter and mother to have oral sex when one of the women grabs the knife ........ and the movie ends abruptly !!! Just like that! No warning, no loose ends tied up ... it's over. Now there may be an appropriate ending to this movie (I honestly do not know), but I've only seen the extremely coarse version of Alpha Blue Archives. Your version seems to have the final cut off completely or that's how it ends. If this was intentional, then at Film-making 101, I'm sure there's some kind of rule in HOW to finalize a movie, but this should not be done like THIS! Fans of the movie "Psycho" should rejoice to hear the soundtrack, as it is throughout the movie! I would be willing to bet that no royalty was licensed or anything. Also, even though this is a "violent" movie, there is not much, so gorehounds will not find anything of real use here. None of the violence is shown graphically ..... just the results (one of the victims is stabbed with a machete just above the area of ​​the vagina). Plus, sex is a bit of the wildest sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is a very ugly movie to work as an erotic porn movie or connect someone but those with a tendency to like despicable, nasty and ugly things but not violent enough to win a real notoriety with those looking for something really brutal like "Cannibal Holocaust" or other films like that. The only "notorious" thing about this steaming pile is that the violence was added to an adult movie, a relatively new concept at the time, especially when pornography was considered to be all the rage and the grindhouses that dotted 42nd Street played stuff like that for a group of pornography experts. This was not and is not "mainstream" pornography at all. <br /> <br /> If you were in film school and there was a do-not-shoot list, this movie would be a brilliant example of that lesson! This cinematic demonstration demonstrates what happens when filmmakers with brain problems receive a "budget" (in this case, probably around $ 142 ..... because it seems!) And ignore all the "do not" and turn them into "do's". "The black man in the film is constantly being verbally abused about his color and that he is not a human being. the killer is obviously racist, but there was no political correction in the early 1970s. I'm not sure if a movie like this could be made today. To be honest, that will not "shock" anyone or Sex is so ugly and mundane, it's hard to watch with any sense of eroticism, so if you chance this, you'll thank God for the fast-forward button! The "acting", if you want to call it that, is amateur at best (I mean, it's even bad for PORN!) Without a reason to worry about anyone or anything at all !! If you just saw this from any way, download it because you will feel like a jump if you buy it. Some things are just useless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing more unpleasant than watching this movie would be watching this movie sitting in a movie theater and watching the other gifts watching it too and suddenly feeling insecure. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you like some stupid porn junk, still SLEAZY, give it a try. It's 54 minutes and still, it seems MUCH more !! Crackheads would love this! Then again, maybe there is something wrong with me for looking for this in the first place ...... LOL! Warning Emptor, sleaze lovers !!
