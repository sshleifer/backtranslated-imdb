One hundred and seventy-five million dollars is a lot of money to spend even on the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had such a big budget for Transformers, so just how Universal Pictures spent so much money doing Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly did not spend that in the script for one thing, since the movie is not so much a classic comedy as it is a Christian flag waving and bargaining for a laugh or two, you're more likely to spend the duration figuring out where the budget was or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it into a decidedly average movie just as his star profile began to rise. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty, this movie sees Evan Baxter (Carrell), a former supporting character, climbed the ladder into the player's main space. The story begins with him coming out of the newsroom to become a civil servant and moving to Washington with his wife and three generic kids (a rather odd kindergarten moppet, a high school student, and a grumpy teenage boy) . Evan's attempt to change the world through politics, however, gains prominence when God (Morgan Freeman) appears and asks him to build an Ark. <br /> <br /> In other words, it is an update of the ancient history of Genesis. , with Evan fighting cynicism and pessimists to build the huge boat. Unfortunately, although the premise is fairly promising, unfortunately it does not provide much laughter. There's a bit of fun at the beginning, where Evan's MP tries to reconcile the public service demands with the unwanted packages of animals that follow him and a beard that resists all attempts to shave him, but so how does he accepts his divine mission, the film dives. From this point on, it transforms into a message film. Evan begins to preach with alarming regularity and Morgan Freeman keeps appearing to offer wisdom, while gently nudges his chosen ones in the right direction. Without Evan's resistance, however, the only vestige of comedy left over comes in the form of some jokes about animal feces and the role of John Michael Higgin as Evan's exasperated right arm. Higgins may show the same rich comic potential he did earlier in Arrested Development, but his enthusiasm can not save the ship sinking, especially seeing how Carrell has put his formidable improvisational skills in the background. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it is somewhat similar to the Passion of Christ, but unlike the Mel Gibson movie, which encouraged everyone to believe in God through the bloodshed and guilt, Evan Almighty try a smoother approach. The movie simply tells us that we must have faith in God because He has faith in us. Unfortunately, this movie is just as likely to make you laugh as passion is. Carrell is on autopilot, the jokes do not exist and Wanda Sykes makes an offer to become the boring person on the planet. It may be sweet, but someone threw $ 175,000,000 into the sea.
