There is something strange about the antisocial feeling that you can find in some Cheech And Chong material. One of the songs from Up In Smoke, well, I often wish more songs these days began like this. But in this excuse for a video, the duo of stoners is showing us the videos of four songs from their album of the moment, also titled Get Out Of My Room. You hear a narration during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the disc as a novelty recording that will take up space in the charts. Unfortunately, this narration opening reaches the nail well in the head. <br /> <br /> Most of the RIAA-endorsed musical recordings seem to stick to the rule of putting the best material at the beginning of the album. Often, when the first song passes, the listener attentively realizes that the recording has little or no attention to hold their attention. Convention-challenging bands, on the other hand, often kept their best material to the end, or at least spread it evenly across the disc. In this case, Cheech And Chong seems to have decided to hedge his bets. The opening piece, Get Out of My Room, is a hilarious song with an incredibly bad video. Many viewers of a music video from the 1980s will find the careless direction somewhat nostalgic. Cheech's conception of British punk is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Where everything goes down is the second number, I'm Not Home Right Now. Nothing kills interest in a song like repetition, and it's hard to get more repetitive than that aural tantrum. Honestly, you feel the urge to slap Cheech's face and tell him we have the idea, he's not home now, so please go ahead. The next song, along the theme of love being a strange thing, is the absolute bottom of the pit not only for this collection, but for Cheech And Chong in general. It's almost as if this song was made just for the reason of the album's playing time. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the stoner pair saved the best for the final, but it's also curious to note that Chong is completely different. absent from this court. Born In East L.A. is a simple number based on the old Bruce Springsteen number that ridicules Reagan's vision of multiculturalism. As one rejoices at Cheech's tale, it is marvelous how many poor schleps who could not speak a word of Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not white as a sheet. Racism was an integral part of America's culture in 1985, and continues to this day. If something got worse, you have to figure out what it would be like Born In East LA if it were written in the current age. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, two cuts do not make an album, especially when there is a lot of boring stuff between them. The interviews before Get Out Of My Room, for example, are pretty funny. Do not split the side like much of Up In Smoke, but funny enough to justify its existence. Unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their footage. Boring song makes boring stuffing. If you cut the half hour of material from this video, you would have something substantially better. <br /> <br /> I gave Get Out Of My Room three out of ten. They are earned by the first and last video. I'm sure the stars look at materials like this today and wonder what they were thinking.
