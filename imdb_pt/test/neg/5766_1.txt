I'm shocked to see that this movie received more than two stars by some people. They must be joking or be totally blind to the art of acting, directing and other flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I just could not force myself to sit through the entire movie, it was just too bad. <br /> <br /> The first three characters, not including the "digger", were just horrible actors, and I mean AWFUL! Maybe the director did not care, or maybe he's a worse director. It was like watching a bad play at school. The film was filmed with a video camera (lowbudget - not real film), and the light settings were also not very good. Also, the sound man (if he had one) must have been a rookie or a drunk, since the sound was amateurish. Even in one of the first scenes of the kitchen (AWFUL acting btw) the sound of the dialogue was very bad. For example, when the woman moved her head as she spoke, you could hear her voice disappear and come back. It seemed they tried to correct this in post-production by slightly increasing the volume when she turned her head. In addition, you've had the annoying buzz of any camera equipment or other sources in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> All those squeakers in the first 5 minutes or so. Need I say more? <br /> <br /> A good school project or fun project for friends to watch, but it should never have been released to a real audience, especially for a paying audience. This was a RIP OFF, unless you have a very low standard with regard to movies, or just bad taste. You are warned! SB
