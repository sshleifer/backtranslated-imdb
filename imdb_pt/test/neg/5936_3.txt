Based on the 2007 Ignatius spy book, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to track down an al-Qaeda mentor while stepping a tightrope of loyalty to his The Jordanian hosts and their American chief manipulator Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the trailers can be forgiven for thinking that the story revolves around the double agent's action and Hoffman's betrayal of Ferris, but The story is much more mundane. Instead, we serve a soft broth of ridiculous subterfuges when the handsome, white American Ferris boy moves with virtual impunity through the crowded streets of Amman Jordan, without looking worried over the shoulder or attracting the attention of the locals. Just during a scene in which Ferris takes his newly found Iranian girlfriend for tea, reality intrudes when the couple are bombarded with looks of Jordanian men. Composing the problems of the film are plots and twists that seem designed as nothing more than filling. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to the UK, Ferris flies back to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children ?? one goes. This is the kind of thing you expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. In loyalty to punishing his body, Crowe gained a whopping 63 pounds of sagging for the role of corpulent Ed Hoffman, joining the small select club of actors that consists of Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as the actors who underwent a major gain or loss of weight in their roles. It's a shame that everyone involved did not share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, because if they did, we would have a much better film in our hands than that insignificant mess.
