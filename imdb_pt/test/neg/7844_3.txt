Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a newly convicted ex-convict from the jail who helps the feds capture a corrupt sheriff from a small town. Reynolds was often accused by critics of simply calling these 'good old boy' performances; True, it's on autopilot everywhere. But in his time, Reynolds knew exactly how to make a discreet effort work well for himself. Inspiring and beautiful, Reynolds comes closer to blinking to the audience without splitting; he seems to know these backlands as well as any movie star, while director Joesph Sargent offers an easy pace and sweaty environment that brings the South alive. Unfortunately, the story is not much, and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins outdo each other (as usual). Diane Ladd is well on a small part, and the real life daughter Laura Dern can be glimpsed in the background. Reynolds returned to this character for the "Gator" of 1976. * 1/2 of ****
