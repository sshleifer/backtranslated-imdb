Let's go? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON THE SCREEN? Are you kidding me? I would not put Molly Gross awful to play, even at school! Where did these people learn by acting? Borrowing some roles from the neighbor? Terrible plot, acting horrible. Heh ... why do you take us to a jerk? What can I say more? I understand that this is a TV production and the acting should not be that of Citizen Kane. But nevertheless, they should try harder to earn their money. And besides, what can be said in 10 lines for a simple movie like this? Want to write in the morning paper? To say what? Worst movie of the decade? OK, you want it - you get it!
