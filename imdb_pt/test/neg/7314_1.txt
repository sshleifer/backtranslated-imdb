'Gross Misconduct' was one of a series of texts released in Australia during the early 1990s that explored the alleged victimization of the Privileged Heterosexual Man in the age of feminism. This creature just needs to look at something very young, and he is accused of sexual harassment, and his life is ruined. Damn liberators of these women! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone may suggest, I do not buy anything from this anti-feminist BS, and correspondingly I did not like this movie. 'GM' trivializes issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relationships. Sexual harassment is here the product of a Confused Young Girl's imagination, and the professional boundaries that teachers must keep ... well, when the teacher is a handsome, handsome family man (and played by Jimmy Smits!), Well Needed Do not worry about it. <br /> <br /> Sexist trash, and even revising it, I'm giving more time than it deserves.
