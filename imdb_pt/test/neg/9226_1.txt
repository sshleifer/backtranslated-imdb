If the following sounds are tempting, then rush to the local Blockbuster and rent this movie in a hurry: 1. Horrible hairdos from the 60's, from pathetic to dubious cocktails. <br /> <br /> 2. Worst child actor in the world, who does nothing but cry and say Dad in the most annoying voice imaginable. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of footage of alligators and monkeys that do not fit the movie. In all. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotyped Indians who use blowpipes and talk to gobbledegook. Oh, and of course they scream around a campfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Hilariously false airplane dropping mechanism, where the cast really plays in the corners of the cardboard game. <br /> <br /> 6. The external outlets of 5, which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a rope being driven around a studio lit with blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. Terrible special effects that make those used in the first Star Trek series seem innovative by comparison. (Special mention: The boy's blond hair shining ... Oh, dear ...) 8. Random editing and continuity, where the background items move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc. <br /> <br /> 9. Do not have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Take any lady off the street to preach like an idiot! No one will notice the difference! Er .. <br /> <br /> 10. An "exciting" climax involving quicksand, snakes (more stuff from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. Do not forget to put a stupid 'tribal' sounding sounding too! <br /> <br /> The wisest among you, however, will wait for your inevitable appearance in MST3K when this classic TV series is resurrected and then you can observe it in the spirit that was planned. Any other kind of fun being derived from this crap is unthinkable .. not to mention impractical. So do not even try. 0/10
