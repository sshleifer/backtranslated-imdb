OK, I bought this a few years ago, from my brother-in-law, who took me to see "Get Shorty" in the movies, with which both were "impressed". And I watched both soft and cool one after another. I read reviews of people who did not see anything and I thought this movie was really good ... I just think it's another way for movie companies to fool the paying customer. All I have to say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years and Chili Palmer became a pussy .... The script was basically the same, they joined Travolta and Thurman after the success of Plup Fiction, played in a pair of big stars (plus a load of nobody) and I thought it was going to be good ..... Vince Vaughn's character was just boring, although I'm a fan of him and Rock, both actors were very unused and unrealistic. Basically I'm glad that this was bought for me as a gift as if I had paid money for it that I would have been super annoying.
