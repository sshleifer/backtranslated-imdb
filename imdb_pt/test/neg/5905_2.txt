This movie begins with the main character in a coma in a hospital ward, with the presence of two attendants. The main character unconscious is heard aloud, saying that the attendants are gay. The nurses kiss. I watched this in a DVD version and I suspect this is funny? said "comedy" on the DVD, after all and so on. If I had seen this in a movie theater, I would probably have heard part of the audience laughing because it is so funny and why they should perform in a comedy. While it is fascinating to think about what is funny and what is not, this unfortunately unfortunately only presents arguments about what it is not. Brilliant brains can DO anything funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proven this fact. But you have to know the "mechanics," I suppose. Director and co-writer Dani Levy does not mind these mechanics, he thinks that certain things are just funny, the fact that two attendants are gay and kiss instead of a man in a coma, for example. Do not get me wrong, some people can DO this funny, Dani Levy can not, not for me, anyway. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie is that I can not see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two brothers, a West German Orthodox Jew, a third-class copy of Fast Eddie Felson of the former East Germany, so strongly did not like each other. Both are insatiable characters. Her children are boring, apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now, but she creates her daughter with her cousin). But even those incestuous relationships? if anything they are embarrassing - just appear as an excuse because the writers could not come up with anything better. <br /> <br /> The performance is not bad, Udo Semel I really enjoyed it although he reminded me more of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not bad either, but maybe Levy should continue driving movies, leaving the script to someone else. Now I hear he made a comedy about Hitler. Hi, Go!
