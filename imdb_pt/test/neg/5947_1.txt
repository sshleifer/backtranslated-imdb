Tom Selleck plays an absent son for the senile "pop" Don Ameche and the tired mother Anne Jackson, compensating for his indiscretions (it is presumed) and taking them after Ameche set fire to his mobile home; Meanwhile, Selleck's work is won by F.B.I, his possessions are frozen, his wife and children leave him, and his detestable sister and her brats are here to stay. Brightly painted comedy-sickness is as out of date with reality as Ameche's old staggering bunny. Perhaps a first serious draft (with scenes like Ameche coming into traffic with two kids) has been incorporated into a second or third more silly version (with Selleck being poked, bumped, poked and eventually losing a finger and a testicle!). Anyway, it's a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden dedication to his father does not make much sense; he limps around and howls in pain but keeps his heart from grueling. This movie is a porridge. * in ****
