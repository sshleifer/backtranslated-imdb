Actually, it hurts me to say that, but this movie was horrible on all levels. The fault is not entirely Van Damme's, as you can see, he tried his best, but let's face it, he's almost fifty, how much more can you ask him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; arguably the best (western) martial arts film in years, has created it. Everything from storyline to dialogue to editing to general acting was just horribly put together and, in many cases, completely boring and pointless. Scott Adkins, who has fight scenes, looked more like a demo reel, was also terribly underused and not even the main villain, which is a shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The real villain main was not only not intimidating at all, but also very annoying. Again, not blaming Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid this one.
