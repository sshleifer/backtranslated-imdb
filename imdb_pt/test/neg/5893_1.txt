Was it full of holes, inaccuracies (the clock stop for injured players or the loss of helmets at Texas football games?) And not much redemption (So your dad beats the crap out of you? Well, do something right for once and then he'll love you and make it all worth it). <br /> <br /> Or make the movie about a team and their quest for a championship or make a movie about a player inside a team and their personal fight, but instead, this movie tried to do everything and came to more than a couple of yards less. The book probably showed the whole story much better; the film should have picked out an element of the story and got it. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from a character dialog to game flashes and then another character dialog months later without telling you who they were or why they were important - the QB calling your brother to take care of the mother - what happened to that? Because the mother was consistent until the end of the final game, does that mean she's not crazy anymore? His only redeeming quality was the soundtrack. Buy this and watch SportsCenter highlights while Iggy Pop plays in the background.
