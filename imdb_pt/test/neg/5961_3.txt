The back of my DVD describes the plot of "El Chucabra": after its capture in the desert, the legendary bloodthirsty creature Chupacabra escapes into the city creating chaos and panic. As they pursue the mortal beast, an animal control officer and scientist Dr. Starlina Davide realizes that a vigilante with her own suspicious plan is also tracing the elusive killer to a mysterious research center run by the diabolical Dr Goodspeed. This putrid horror film is a bit of fun if you see it under the influence of alcohol. The script is completely silly, the acting is wooden beyond belief and the direction is amateur. Two Chupacabra rubber suits are easily the best thing in this movie.3 out of 10 and that's extremely sweet.
