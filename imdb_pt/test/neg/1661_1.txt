I understand the budget was low in this movie, but come on this is really terrible making movies. The script is just awful and that was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this film presents itself as a conventional film of quick censorship with insignificant scares and biting violence, rather than an uncensored movie that was intentionally made for the video. Who were those guys kidding? How it would have been released in theaters. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible. The issue, another free aspect of the film, is beyond the amateur, and the plot, as I said before, leaves little to be desired. There is nothing original about the movie. Gore fans, avoid this one. For filmmakers: try something original next time or stop making movies together. You're not good at it. People hate a useless reprint, especially one of such low caliber. AVOID! Nor is it worth making fun of.
