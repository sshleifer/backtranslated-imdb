I watched this movie on TV last night, waiting for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmissible disease. I was disappointed and I think the movie was rubbish. It did not seem real to me. Some of the performances were terrible, particularly the doctor's. She was about the worst I've ever seen. The whole thing played out like a 'worst case scenario' on CNN. Even the obligatory disaster film, the parts of human relations did not seem sincere. I have seen some disaster movies, particularly those of the weather, which are actually so bad that they are fun. This is almost as bad, but neither is it fun, it's tedious and boring. Do not worry about it.
