Al Pacino was once an actor able to do paper work without resorting to the constant use of profanity. In other words, when he could act, he did not need to speak like a street junkie. McConaughey must have been impressed with Pacino because he became a promoter of the word "F" as well. This may be the kind of society in which they actually live, but most of us have the common decency to observe what we say in mixed company. I can not remember the exact words a teacher used to explain the constant use of profanity, but it was something like that. "It shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all those who have to listen." Maybe it's time for Al to take some acting courses again to sharpen his talents. Oh yeah, the movie ... Probably the worst thing McConaughey played. I hope your next role is in the company of more talented people. Rene Russo was always hot.
