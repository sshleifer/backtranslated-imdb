<br /> <br /> I used to like some Hollywood blockbusters from the '80s. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the 1990s action movie plummeted to new depths. The worst of them, I believe, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is shamefully planned and takes away the worst clich√©s that seek to excite viewers. The melodrama is so painful and horrible that you really can not expect Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had performed admirably in several independent films directed by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately decided to enter the commercial wave. This film symbolizes Hollywood's new aesthetic of great special effects and a small, precious dialogue or an authentic melodrama. This is the norm these days and I begin to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for the writers. It seems they only employ hacks and committees to write the easy scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single chunk of great and sincere human emotion in Armageddon. It just seems empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves the father of Liv Tyler, who does not even make an appearance in the movie. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith provides a theme song for the film - a ballad that actually sounds and at least pulls the strings a bit when the final credits come out. <br /> I cry for Western civilization if people like this predictable and heavy movie. It means superficiality, lethargy and decline in the human intellect. I'd rather watch it on Friday the 13th.
