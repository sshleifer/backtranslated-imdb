It's hard to get through this movie without choking on your own vomit, to be honest. Bad animation does not help because it makes it look like a decades-old video you'd find in Morrisons' 99p bin. Still, it is better than the abysmal script, which spends about a third of its duration on superfluous extras like Belle's current problems, things about Scrooge's father, and many charmless brags - suffocating - TWO ANTHROPOMORPHICS. These bizarre additions consume time on the screen at the expense of elements that you think would be very important, such as Dickens's dialogue and the main passages of his plot - the movie sets the game of twenty questions, for example, and sometimes fails to put scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
