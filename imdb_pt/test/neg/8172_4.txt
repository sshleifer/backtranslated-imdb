Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, wanted to release Dilip Kumar in the lead <br /> <br /> The film was finally rewritten and made in 2003 and therefore the subject seems dated and very shallow sometimes <br />> <br /> As the reason why Amitabh-Hema separates is very superficial, even the way the young are shown is very bad, as Gulshan in AVTAAR <br /> <br /> The message comes well, but the things are presented clich√© The character of Salman is the worst, it seems straight from a storybook while the climax of Bachchan's speech is good and also the end of not forgiving the children is good Ravi Chopra does a good job The song is decent, the songs sung by Bachchan stand out <br /> <br /> Amitabh stands out as always, he has played a stern older father, but here he plays a victim and portrays his last speech is great Hema is good on your part Aman Verma Samir Soni okay, Naseer and the other sons and wives are decent although Divya Dutta stand out Salman Khan is one of the ke, Mahima is well Paresh and Lillete are adorable
