This movie has been promoting throughout Spain with a huge advertising campaign, after seeing, you realize that someone stole your money. Paz Vega is horrible like Carmen, she is not at all natural and it seems that she is doing a fashion magazine cover in every scene ("the best" is when she, as an Andalusian woman ... can speak Basque and fluently, Leonardo Sbaraglia is much better than her like Jose, but the story is very slow, the plot does not work, and the script is actually very very bad ... I think Penelope Cruz (the movie was written for her) would have been a very Carmen more reliable and sexy. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time and money
