Yes, it's a SBIF (So Bad It's Funny) classic. With a running budget for the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acts you've ever seen, and absolutely no moments even remotely scary - not even a nanosecond! The camera work was at elementary school level - a shot still out of a house was obviously hand-shaken madly. The blood looked like a wet cherry, someone was making a trip to the local butcher to find the "human" bones, and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask that Wal-Mart could provide. <br /> <br /> Someone involved appeared? in the final cut and realize what a mess this was? Most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms, it would be career suicide to have this on your resume. Do yourself a favor and watch Ebert's video of your colonoscopy!
