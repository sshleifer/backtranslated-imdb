I saw this movie just because Sophie Marceau. However, his acting skills are not enough to save this movie. Almost all the casts do not play well with her character, except for Sophie and Frederic. The plot could give a better movie if the right pieces were in the right places. I have seen several good French films but this one I do not like.
