Dude, what a horrible movie. As with many terrible films, the structure of their horror is in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that gives a bad name to the whole genre. Okay, here's a big problem: Sandra Bullock's character is kidnapped by Jeff Bridges in his car in a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland does not find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the film completely unaware of her whereabouts. Let's go! Personally, I find this totally insulting even for the most meager members of the audience. However, we are forced to accept this absurdity. Of equal frustration is the reason ill-explained for the actions of Jeff Bridges. His character is a little eccentric, of course, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He spends about ten minutes, giving more or less, pouring his grain to Sutherland, as to why he performed his cruel deeds. But the explanation itself lacks the most elemental sense of logic. Therefore, no member of the intelligent audience can actually believe in the possibility of their evil. And if you subtract that element from history, the whole thing falls apart. It is also of great concern: -Jeff Bridges wearing a strange, pseudo-French accent, without reason. <br /> <br /> - The whole boring subplot involving Nancy Travis, most especially she saving the day by turning the tables on Bridges. <br /> <br /> -The crazy woman who somehow manages to remember the number of the board of Jeff Bridges although also think that the leprechaun of Lucky Charms is real. <br /> <br /> -The name of Sandra Bullock's character, Diane Shaver, conveniently re-scrambles to form the word "disappeared." Are you kidding me? -The logistical impossibility of drugging, kidnapping and burying (in a very remote location) a human being within the forty-minute period (as Bridges alludes specifically). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that reminded me of Donald Kaufman's incredibly stupid (yet very successful) fictional character in Adaptation. Many writers are brilliant and inspired artists. Some are just bozos that convince the imbeciles who direct the studios to do what they want. This particular script is so stupidly confusing that Donald Kaufman himself would have been able to sell it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff really did.
