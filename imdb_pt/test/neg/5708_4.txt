A woman who deals with art begins to have a love affair with a man named John. They make love everywhere they go and they play sex games. The problem I had was that it was all they did. There was no plot for this movie or I just did not see it. Hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie, but I wanted something else to happen. Maybe he could be a serial killer or she could have a secret. I just needed something and all there was was a lot of love making scenes. Not that it was bad or something, I just wanted more things to happen in the movie. Maybe a co-worker was sleeping with him, too. Anything! I was very upset that this was all there was. Mickey Rourke was so hot back then. I wonder what happened.
