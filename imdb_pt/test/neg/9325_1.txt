Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! "The Beginning" was also not the best, but better than this. This is not a good way to bring the original film. It's just awful! The CGI hyenas were so fake in both films! Why not use real animals? I liked the old Sinbad movie better than that. I was disappointed! The only good thing I can say about this wasted film is the cinematography and the clothes that really captured this era. I understand why this movie was remade as "The Beginning". It's so bad, in my opinion. Where does the money come from to waste it? Give me a multimillion dollar budget and I'll show you how it should be done!
