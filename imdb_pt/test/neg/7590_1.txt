This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lose their daughter? with the tone poltergeist theft? just pushes the edge with stupidity. I watched showtime, so I still had pornographic softcore scenes. I have to say it made me laugh at my butt. The effects of the 80's were very out of place. It included an invisible cat and a revolving vortex. Wow I wonder if the people who did this really feel fulfilled in life. The actress who plays the wife seems familiar, but it sucks anyway. His scream could be used as a torture device in hell by more than retired Nazis. Anyway thank you showtime for the super low quality horror movie. I will always enjoy the time I have seen the longest waist of time and money I have ever seen.
