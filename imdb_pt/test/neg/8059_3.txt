CANNIBAL FEROX (1+ outta 5 stars) Miserable excuse for a movie ... you might like it if you really like boring and senseless jungle movies, seasoned with scenes of graphic violence. A pair of drug dealers fleeing the crowd travel to the jungles of Paraguay in search of emeralds and cocaine. They meet another young traveler and his two hot friends, one of whom is an anthropologist who seeks to prove definitively that cannibalism does not exist and never existed. One of the two traffickers turns out to be a bit psycho and torture and kills a couple of natives to get them to tell him where they hide their jewelry. (And how could they even tell him when he does not seem to speak their language in the first place?) Well, the natives are not all of a sudden very enthusiastic about white people in their jungle and they all capture some torture of retaliation. Poor acting, poor plot and bad direction. Not a decent moment of suspense in all the sad 90 minutes. Even the special effects are not particularly convincing (although some shots still make most viewers shrink). The only good scene in the whole movie is when the two women are trapped in a clay hut and seem to touch the hearts of the natives with the interpretation of "Red River Valley." The following is a quote from the movie, but I would not be surprised if many viewers were not saying exactly the same thing by this point: "Oh God, please let her die soon. Oh, let her die soon. And let me die soon too, please. "
