While browsing the channel, I reached Channel 124. It is an urban channel. I saw this movie and decided to give it a try. I almost became a mass murderer because of this movie. I made home movies and they are of oscar quality compared to this massive Dookie dough. The lighting was terrible and the performance was absolutely ruthless. I'd rather watch Star Crystal ....... Holy cow maybe this is not a good example. The main issue I have about this movie is ... Was it to be a morality movie? The reason I ask is because there was a line where this lady in a wheelchair says "I would have been another gang statistic" Oh my head is starting to hurt. After hearing that phrase I went into the kitchen and got a knife ready to stab anyone who dared to watch this movie. But some sense began and I changed the channel to see the man with the afro painting. Well, that's all I have to say about this movie. If you want to endure this pain, go ahead, but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes
