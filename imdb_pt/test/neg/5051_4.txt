The only reason I watched this movie a second time, was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl playing alongside Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. I've never heard of her before. She's adorable. Captivating. With a lively face and a fluffy body, she is very much assisted ... She is real, "Poisenality" ... More than a passing vibration of Grace Kelly ... with youthful exuberance. I think she's Irish in the gene pool, (my favorite female DNA) so it makes some sense that she resembles the prettiest Irish American. The film is not worth noting, Katie Holms is the classic beauty in the flesh. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you follow with your eyes. In 1999, when this movie was made, she was about 25 years old at its peak. It reminds me of another silly and worthless movie, with the only redemption being Pretty Girl. It was "Career Opportunities" with the first time I saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Grease II" the first time I saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
