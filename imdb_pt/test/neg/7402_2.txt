Dresden had high expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it to be good ... but it's not. The only good thing is the special effects that are very well done but, as in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> It is poorly written, the script tries to comply with the rules of gender. with standard elements of suspense / love story, but there is no depth or originality. It's below average. The next thing: it is also misdirected. It has this uninteresting TV direction style, with many close-ups and incredible action, through quick editing, where, in fact, there is no action or suspense. The actors are not bad, but there is no performance that is playing in any way. <br /> <br /> I do not know ... they obviously try to make a typical TV movie and not a movie. , where it is always good to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why do they try to comply with the typical commercial rules of Hollywood? It really looks like the writer did a weekend class with an American screenwriter and then handed over this mess. Is there no producer who is responsible for the project that is interested in dramaturgy / visual style or simple in magical moments that make some great TV movies?!? Do they think that a TV audience is stupid and does not need to have a high-quality movie experience? The Fall was a good example for a good TV movie, but there was probably an executive or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this, rent "the fall" instead of ...
