"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one of the not very well-known films of the American Hitchcock. But if "Lifeboat" (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underrated masterpiece, not all the movies signed by the master of suspense at the time (early 40's) are really worthy of being seen. And to tell you the truth, not discovering this movie is not really a loss. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is a normal and conventional comedy where it is difficult to find Hitchcock's touch. . Perhaps you can catch a glimpse of her shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is capable of (but well hidden in an impersonal package) in a vertigo scene in which two of the characters are stuck at the top. of an attraction of the fair, and perhaps in the character of the mother. And that's about it! Even for Hitchcock fans, there is little to connect. <br /> <br /> And for amateur crazy comedies, there's not much else: no situation is exaggerated enough to be really funny, and we're far from Hawks masterpieces, for example. And if one or two scenes are a lot of fun, there is not even the funniest thing in Hitchcock's filmography, which created comedic situations in almost all of his films (even "Psycho" can be considered full of very somber humor). So there is very little to salvage in this movie, which can, without bothering anyone (or maybe just Hitchcock's hardcore fans and crazy comedy, who are in love with Carole Lombard), remains as one of Hitchcock's not-so-known first Americans. movie.
