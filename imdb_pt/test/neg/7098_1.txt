This has to be one of, if not the biggest Mob / Crime movies of all time. Everything about this movie is great, the acting in this movie is of true quality; Master P's acting skills really make you believe he's Italian! Cinematography is also great, probably the best of them all. This movie was great; and I have the brain power of a terrestrial worm.
