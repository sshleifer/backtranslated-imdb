I think I was prepared after all the years of hearing about it. I first heard about it from Siskel and Ebert. When they said that Divine ate excrement, I had to look for it. Then a friend told me about it in 1991. She also said that her parents saw when she left and that her mother almost dropped her father because of it! So when I got the Pink Flamingos at Sundance today, I was prepared. Mostly. <br /> <br /> I still could not help but be surprised by the anal close-ups and the blowjob scene. That being said, the only characters I was sympathetic to were Edie and the Egg Man. His crying scene at the beginning of the movie, though somewhat frivolous for ordinary people, actually makes me sad. Though she was not pretty, she had a sweet voice. I was happy for her and for the egg man, and they really touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the performance in this production of poverty level was not good. And as for the script, how does John Waters come up with these things? Well, at least it's different.
