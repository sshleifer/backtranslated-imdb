Even Mel Gibson could not save this slop from a movie. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would Mel Gibson make a movie that I'm sure he could not sit and watch? what was this? A total idiot about some heavy drugs chasing a schizophrenic lady, who also used illicit drugs. For all the spectators out there with heavy drugs; You're going to love this movie.
