Taran Adarsh ​​a renowned critic praised such a dubba movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a strange story in which a lover sells his love to a brothel because he wants money to save his mother and is also forgiven for that LOL <The movie sucks Every first half has its focus on the novel, comedy that does not work The twist shocks, but the whole second half is a mess and the climax is cliché <br /> Direction Aditya Datt is bad Music is typical of Himesh <br /> <br /> Emraan does his serious role well, but his wardrobe, his way of walking through the music.etc is similar to his previous films Geeta Bhasra annoys Ashmith Patel no manages to convince this actor was good at MURDER just so far and then a Mithun downhill some screen time and he is fine but his break in a song is forced Ranjeet is alright
