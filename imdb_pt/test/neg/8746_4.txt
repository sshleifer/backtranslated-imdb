As a kid, this movie scared me green. As an adult, I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I did not have the pleasure of watching this movie via MST3K. I picked it up instead, late Saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do except a few autumn leaves. I figured this had to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie has some very good elements; a mystic who guesses the water, a beatnik painter, a pair of idiot ranch hands, an old history buff and a "evil wind." Um ... I mean ... evil head. An evil head that, once the systematic hypnotism of each and every one is complete, will be searching for his evil body. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place on an evil "ranch" that apparently neither harvests crops, nor breeds evil cattle. <br /> <br /> As everything is declared by the resident mystic as "evil," or you roll your eyes horribly, or laugh until your sides separate, depending on your mood. I? I laughed until tears ran down my face. <br /> <br /> I remembered this movie with affection as one of those who really scared me as a kid. But some children are afraid of Santa Claus too ... no? Anyway ... if you're in the horror field of the 50's, then this is definitely a movie you should not miss. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good story, this movie has it. They are the greatest dramas and the innocence of time that makes them so horrible. The acting was just bad, but it still had some good elements. Maybe it's a remake ...? <br /> <br /> He ranks 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> The Demon :.
