"Grande Ecole" is not an ingenious exploration of mixed sexuality, but if you need it, a movie for a pornographic channel. While I suspect there is nothing in this film to please a willing spectator, the plot is simply an excuse for the man-to-woman and man-to-man unions in the unconvincing context of a competition between a Parisian school for future CEOs and an important school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts. There is also a frisson of cultural shock among young French people with high status and lower status, as well as a social conflict involving French native and Arab immigrants from North Africa. All that is missing is a female-to-female coupling, which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting is at a slightly higher level than in the usual pornographic film. film - but "Grande Ecole" is, to be frank about it, no more than pornography with artistic aspirations. I'm not offended by sex. It's just repetitive and, in a short time, boring. Where is the Hays office when you really need it?
