This movie is a total waste of time. I can not understand anyone sitting on this piece of junk. Oh, I would love it when I was seven years old. I think a seven year old may have written and directed. <br /> <br /> There's no script, no acting, just rubbish. The best performance is that of the fighting cocks. I think I could whip these ninjas and I'm not someone you'd consider difficult. Totally unconvincing and did not arouse a bit of interest. I was yawning and laughing at the end of the first ten minutes of the movie. This is one that would turn people away from martial arts movies. Great comedy, bad action movie.
