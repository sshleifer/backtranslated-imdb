My only regret is that you can not rate a movie on IMDb with a 0. "The Scene ..." would definitely deserve this! AT LEAST. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER? * The movie begins with a group of people entering a crypt to wake up an ancient Vampire. When a guy cuts off and his blood drips and falls on the rotten and dried up corpse that's supposed to be a leech, the metamorphosis happens and the Vampire, in an ANIMATION effect (you'd believe!), Quickly takes on a more human form, only to reveal that He is wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie! A tie, yes. Red, if my memory serves me well! I tried to check random jumping scenes a bit, but it did not look any better than the opening sequences. That's the point where I turned the film off, cursing him for making me expect to see a Vampire movie. That's certainly not one, unless you're five and can take that stupidity seriously. <br /> <br /> So if you like vampires and do not want to feel angry or even angry, learn from my mistake and do not even try to see this crap!
