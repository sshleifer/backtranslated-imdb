Thomas Vinterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road movie without the most important element of a film: a good story. The characters are not very original and are not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a pain in the neck, playing the same role he played in recent years and he repeated in "Festen" - it seems he thinks acting = angry and screaming at other people! The movie does not make much sense and is not very funny either - although it's hard to be "crazy" and "weird". If you're going to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?
