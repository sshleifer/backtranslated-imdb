I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commands had fought with zombies before. But surely they did not act like they'd seen a zombie before. Jumping and turning their back on them as amateurs. Second, the characters are very poorly written. The actors did their best with what was given, I blame the bad writing and the bad direction. Lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are higher. They miss the sample twice and girl Jennifer Holland does not know whether or not she was bitten. How stupid is that? As much as it hurts to be bitten, someone might think you know, more gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue. Bobo, the first movie had its flaws, but it has re-saturation, unlike this disaster of a movie, that I could barely get through once. I give the HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2: NO DOG, ALL THE STUPIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN
