Always enjoy the Classic Horror movies, however, this movie was really a great waste of time and if it were not for John Carradine playing the crazy doctor man who is able to control humans through their experiences. This film was made during World War II and John Carradine was a German Nazi working to find a human weapon against the whole world. Bob Steele acting in various roles as cowboy or gangster and in this photo Bob seemed bored with his role in this film and acted as if it were his first movie. Mantan Moreland, (Jeff) gave an excellent performance with great comedy that helped to keep the audience's attention. I hate to criticize a movie made in 1943, but that's really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the roles he played as Count Dracula in many movies during the 1940s, you would just like to see John doing his best.
