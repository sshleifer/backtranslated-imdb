I do not dislike Cary Grant, but I find his performances annoying in enough movies to realize; this, arsenic and lace old and bringing baby. I do not dislike him in North by Northwest, but I really find this movie unbearably silly. Besides, I think the endless delirium over Grant's class is exhausting. I have no idea what his class does to viewers who advertise it. Do not do a thing for me. In the backstage movie included on this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says that Grant was her father's favorite protagonist; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better leader in a number of better Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> With its ruined end, this is really half movie and has no discussion, and can not withstand the high ratings it is receiving. . Even if the film is finished intact, there is not much to do. Fontaine is a completely unfriendly sucker. She has to remain numb, inactive, and unwilling to contact anyone except Johnny for the whole movie in either of the two finals so that her tricks work. This is not much to work on. Cary Grant starts every line with "Monkeyface ..." until I want to strangle him. He says this about sixty times. It's positively irritating. Hitch's technique here is shockingly superficial. An endless succession of rooms / sets has a fake skylight projected on the back wall as a spider's web effect. And a lamp in a glass of milk can make fans excited, but it can not save such a poorly made movie. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich must retire if he does another Hitchcock / Cary Grant imitation of a DVD. I think it's your whole career now. As soon as I saw him, I thought, oh shit, here comes an imitation that only he is impressed. Instead there were two! oh joy!
