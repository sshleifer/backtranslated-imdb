I have not figured out what the chosen title has to do with the movie. This is another meeting of monsters like the HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN. It's not exactly a masterful plot, but Universal needed to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is very ambitious or exaggerated in the ego department. He is working on the cure to prevent Larry Talbot from becoming the Werewolf. Somehow, Count Dracula appears to get a fix on his vampirism. And completing the doctor's good experiments is restoring the energy of Frankenstein's monster. Along the way, the doctor's good-hearted blood is tainted with Dracula's. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he's more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr., as usual, is the soulful Wolf Man. Glenn Strange is the Frankenstein monster, who has very little to do this tour. Also with detachable roles are Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
