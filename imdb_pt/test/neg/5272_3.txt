Kevin Spacey is my all time favorite actor, he is undoubtedly on the other lists when it comes to great actors. He even drew a good Irish accent on Ordinary Decent Criminal as well. But Kevin Spacey, as a mafia leader? Or even a thief? I'm not sure if he could go that far. The film to me just did not make the slightest sense and some parts of the story did not seem to work out for me. <br /> <br /> I know once again that IMDb will make me write ten more lines. But I'm not so sure about what I could say about this movie because I'm still trying to figure it out. Fool, is not it? But I'm sure more than a few of you IMDb users have the same situation I'm in now, where you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten lines? Wow, this should be done. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
