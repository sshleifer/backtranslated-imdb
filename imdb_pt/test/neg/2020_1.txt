Oh my. And here I thought there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> Imagine the number of decisions needed to produce a movie. Conceptual approval. Roteirização Edition of Dialogue. Casting Set and prop design. Location selection. Performance Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Sound and video editing. Direction. <br /> <br /> Now imagine that each of these decisions was taken wrong. <br /> <br /> Outcome: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a movie supposedly set in the 2900s, this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap 70s gangsta movie. The set is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is atrocious. The time of each scene is ridiculous. The performance is beyond the abysmal. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Let's just pick up props, for example. If you have a set of footage on a space freighter built in 2900, what is the probability of having the plumbing and hydraulic doors of a 1960s tanker? What, the technology has not changed in 900 years? The 'Professor' uses a standard tandy keyboard and Radio-Shack switches to 'reprogram' the computer. Have not they discovered voice control yet? Of course, Prof is tied to a wheelchair. With wheels. Even so, you know, they have intergalactic hypermedia ... but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, let alone a floating, or bionic leg or something. And apparently this freighter was carrying an intergalactic consignment of rosewood coffins. How convenient. Then there are the guns - the crew carries standard firearms of the late twentieth century. In a ship. In the vacuum of space, where a bullethole would kill them all. Good planning there, support department. <br /> <br /> Oh, why go on?
