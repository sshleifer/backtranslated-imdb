This movie was completely obsolete and uninspired. The central premise of this film was basically a lot of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging a painfully bland replica. I did not laugh once during the whole movie. I could have sat in any barber shop in the United States and heard this banal prank, and maybe even come out with a decent haircut. I can not understand why this mess received favorable reviews, much less why so many people lost money on it. None of the characters here were funny or deserved to be imported. I really did not care if the rival barber shop across the street would get Nappy Cutz out of business. Do not waste your money on that, folks, since that's the only way to get Hollywood to stop producing those chaotic pieces of junk. 1 out of 5
