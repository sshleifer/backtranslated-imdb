**** SOME SPOILERS **** There is nothing in this movie that you have not yet seen surfing the Internet. Nothing is shocking about this movie. In the movie a man sodomizes a goat, there is a decapitation of a bulldozer, and a lesbian's face is burned. All these scenes of "extreme violence" are so false that it makes us wonder why anyone would want to reappear that piece of junk. I just can not believe I spent money sweaty with what surely has to be the worst movie ever made. Do not let criticism fool you, this movie would be a shame for anyone to own ... except maybe prisons that want to torture prisoners. For a REAL exploration classic, look at Bloodsucking Freaks or even the latest Doom Generation. Island of Death sinks into the back of the movie bathroom and needs to be released from existence.
