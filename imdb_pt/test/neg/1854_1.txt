It's hard to imagine two actors of such class and experience as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon getting involved in such an embarrassingly ineffective film. The responsibility for this misleading production must be attributed to writer Neil Jordan and director Conor McPherson. I doubt you've seen such a bad movie with such good credits in a long time. Comedian Dylan Moran, who made his mark as the cranky and incompetent owner of a bookstore on the TV series Blackbooks, presents the same routine here, except with such an excess and lack of comic control as to make someone squirm. It is easy to see how history could have been made to work, for the situation is interesting and full of comic potential. A classic actor (Caine) tries to rip off the mob (Gambon and company) with the advisor of a coy aspiring colleague (Moran), with predictable results. It could and should have been good. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be.
