This movie is really an excuse to make movies. The pace is bad, the budget must have been depressing, and the performance is low (that is, except for Bela Lugosi). The audio at the moment is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as if a jet was taking off for the whole movie. If these things bother you, do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you manage to overcome this, you will see that the idea behind the film is very good. A German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to act on various Japanese agents and turn them into the likeness of American businessmen whom the Japanese kidnapped and killed. After completing his work, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into prison. He later escapes and travels to the United States in search of revenge against his patients through a series of highly publicized murders. It seemed that Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the movie and to be honest the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and indigestible. The lead actress turned out to be rather boring and stereotyped, while the designated cop for her case was the common, chauvinistic, and always correct male found in many films of that period. <br /> <br /> I also discovered that camera work was completely uninspired, often taking exactly the same angles from the same rooms over and over again. After a while, this tends to drag the movie down, setting a very slow pace for the "action" which is more or less non-existent anyway. <br /> <br /> For me, the idea is fascinating. and with a writer, director, script, equipment and better actors, could become a great movie. Unfortunately, these handicaps keep the film back for now, and I can not recommend it to anyone other than the more open-minded of movie lovers.
