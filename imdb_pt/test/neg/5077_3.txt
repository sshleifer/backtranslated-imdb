I just watched this movie on DVD late in the morning and was so disappointed that I even thought it was a good joke to the public. In other words - the creators planned to make the comedy non-dramatic. Anyway, in the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was sincere about this movie. It's a shame because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fish tale! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character in the film remains probably his worst performance! What to say to Jason Statham - lack of all sorts of skills to develop the role that is an imaginary fiction ... For this reason I vote: 3/10
