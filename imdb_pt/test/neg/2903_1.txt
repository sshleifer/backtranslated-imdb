You can only describe this with a word and this would be WOW !!! Wow, I really did not think such crap could be thrown. If you watch a movie titled ninja, then expect to see at least some cool martial artists, right? However, none of these guys know any martial art and it looks like they went to China and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained for a martial arts day, that's the level of their martial arts skills! The actors are superactive, the special effects are ridiculous and there is no plot that makes any sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I have ever seen and I have seen so much!
