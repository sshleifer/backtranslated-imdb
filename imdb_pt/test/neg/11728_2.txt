Totally forgettable movie, but an unbelievable soundtrack: I would give it (soundtrack) a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and had to check the IMDb to remember what it was about. I became obsessed with getting the soundtrack and since then I had to replace it. It varies from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, who is the "other" guitarist, opposite Steve Van Zandt on the E Street Band. This guy can play! The vocals are handled by Nils (he can not sing very well - very strident), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
