A true classic Gothic Horror horror! <br /> <br /> Uhm, actually, it's a horrible movie. Best thing: the naked nipples of Rosalba Neri. Material intensely bottle. <br /> <br /> Oh, of course, Rosalba Neri is an excellent lady. I've never heard of her before this movie, but she's a great lady. But honestly, it was her nipples that did it for me, in that last scene, before the movie ended abruptly, all naked and erected ... Totally dreamed nipples, man. Okay, sorry, staying here for a while ... <br /> <br /> Basically, I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a despicable and horrible movie with a monster Frankenstein stupid and ugly bare-boob couple. And there's a castle. So I was not disappointed or anything. It was only creeping in certain places (the creature's first resurrection continued for a long time, with Father Frankenstein only experimenting, talking, trying a little more). There was a fun and stupid homage to the original Frankenstein: Instead of throwing a girl on a lake, here the Mongolite Franky took a naked girl and threw her into a river. I had just given up. <br /> <br /> Some friends of mine loved this movie a lot, though. I was maybe waiting a little too long. But Rosalba's erect nipples were certainly worth it ... (Crap, I really need to stop mentioning her nipples). I think I'll end this user comment now.
