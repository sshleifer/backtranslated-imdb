I thought maybe ... maybe this could be good. An early appearance of Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); many homage to old horror films; the Troma's label on the front? this movie could be a jewel! I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring, exaggerated and half-idiot homage to the horror films of yesteryear. The story is old, young people invading a house, getting drunk, making love and fiddling with things that should not be tampered with. The oft ?? The formula of the recycled slasher film is used here, this time with one thought to be the dead actor named Conrad Radzoff doing the killing. In fact, the performance of Radzoff actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. It makes the character arrogant Dracula style very well. But for kids, it's not so good, with Combs having only a minimal part. <br /> <br /> The movie has no entertainment value, and only features a cool character, and one or two scenes that can grab your attention. I do not recommend this movie unless you're desperate for something to watch, and this is the only movie left in the blockbuster.
