An interesting concept has turned into a carnage ... <br /> <br /> My first film by Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), When I first became interested, seemed at the time an interesting concept ... <br /> Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic scenery + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mix that has turned into a disastrous piece of Australian cinema that gives my country a bad name ... <br /> < > Pros: -Interessing concept <br /> <br /> Cons: -Waste of a good cast -Stored and stupid lane -Camera angle -Credded -There is not much variety of locations -Crap use of Shakespearean diologue <br/> <br /> Overall: Australia's worst attempt at a Shakespeare movie, Stay with Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: This movie is dangerous)
