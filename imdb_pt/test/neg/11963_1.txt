So my friend and I are waking up to our local movie store and looking for something to buy along with Spotless Mind's Eternal Sunshine, so why not pick up the third part of the Scarecrow series? Keep in mind that this is not just Scarecrow Three; that is, scarecrow: gone wild. Now we had both seen the first two Scarecrows, so we felt obligated to finish the job. Let's start with the DVD cover first. First we notice a photo of Ken Shamrock ("The Most Dangerous Man in the World") on the cover. Apparently he was used to marketing the film as the "lead actor." By the way, it has the shortest screen time of any member of the credited class. Then we noticed a picture of a very attractive and very half-naked woman in the middle of the cloak. I can assure you that she's not in the movie ... not at all. At the time of the lease, we assumed this was to reiterate the fact that the scarecrow was "going crazy." In the background we noticed a great carnival on an island in the ocean. I can also guarantee that the carnival is not in the movie either ... not at all. Looking back, me and my friend should know that something was happening. I mean really, who the hell puts a carnival on an island. Now for the real movie. We begin when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field. Do not ask me how they were cast, but think about when Brandon Lee woke up from the dead in The Crow. It's so stupid. But in defense of the scarecrow, he "went crazy." Anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives indirectly through the young man, makes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who have done it wrong. Because yes, in the Scarecrow world, the beaches are conveniently located in the same vicinity of the corn fields. To make the story shorter, the scarecrow kills everyone in its path without any warning, except for the hissing of the scarecrow's trademark, which indicates a blow. This is, however, quite impossible to believe, because the mouth of the scarecrow costume is clearly stitched. Several tracking shots that would make Kubrick roll into his grave later, and we have one of the worst third installments in a series. Well, except maybe the third Matrix. As Joel Siegel would say, "This Scarecrow is terribly bad."
