There's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders who put me in front of the screen every time. I saw "Pumping Iron II," "Aces: Iron Eagle III," "Raven Hawk," and even the TV movie "Getting Physical," which featured some big names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own ways (mainly because they introduced Rachel McLish. ROWWR !!). So I went and watched "Nemesis III: Prey Harder," on the basis that he featured such luminaries as Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. I love the ladies, I always go, but after that I'm kind of happy to have lost the first two "Nemesis" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the first, anyway. Most of the scenes here are raised bodily (and kicking and screaming, I think) of "Nemesis II." In fact, that one seemed a little amusing from the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But even if Price and company flex and pose, they do not have much chance to do anything else (like, say, ACT!) In fact, this whole movie is an exercise (Ha ha- ha ...) of storytelling, ambiguous characters and open film production (both in terms of footage and story). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes much sense, but even then, there would still be problems - like making small parts for women as big as these. What a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion? <br /> <br /> A single star, in consideration of all the work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev obviously placed in their bodies, NOT the "craft" work done within the film itself. Thank you, ladies.
