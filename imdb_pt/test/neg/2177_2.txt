Chaplin was a great silent comedian, but many silent era stars fell as the audience heard their voices in the early talkies. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when the sound came to the movies. Unlike most of the reviews I read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by Chaplin, the comedian, and did not spend his entertainment dollar by watching Chaplin's political comments. /> Despite Chaplin's awards and chivalry, I would consider his "contributions" to mankind. The Great Dictator was made at the same time that the brutal dictatorship of Stalin was having its judgments, and both Dictators signed the agreement that led to the invasion of Poland by both Dictators. World War II began in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this film was made and the Hollywood investigations by the federal government. If Chaplin had included Joe Stalin in that satire, in addition to including the Italian dictator, perhaps he had less criticism of his politics by politicians. The ill-treatment of Jews and Soviet dissidents exceeded the Nazis in time and number. Judged simply as a movie, many of the jokes were too current to be understood by younger viewers who would not know who Goebbels was. , Goring or Mussolini were. A classic work of art must stand the test of time. The classical Greek tragedy, the Mona Lisa and the 9th Beethoven are still enjoyed centuries after their creation, because they are timeless. Movies that are based on current political commentary or popular social views currently do not last longer than the generation in which they are made. But those who address issues common to all generations will probably live forever and receive a high rating on my part. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, director and lead actor, must take the blame for what I believe to be a dated and tiresome film. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's apologists condemned his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found America so offensive, why did not he return to his homeland? The great Britian fought the Nazis with blood and money. What has Switzerland contributed to the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and chooses its members based on race and class, and cares little about people who can not join the club.
