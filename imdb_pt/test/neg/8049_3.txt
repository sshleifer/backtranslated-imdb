The best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clich√©s are being passed on. Growling Chinese gangsters. A female vice president. A ventilation duct that is large enough to fit into a large Caucasian male. Throwing the wall to kill the bad guy. A situation where you need to extinguish some innocent people to avoid Armageddon. Independence Day scenes, where you exude some memorable landmarks in a fireball. The vice president in a well-lit room surrounded by subordinates, while the Chinese premier was practically alone in a dark room with a little dim light, snarling as viciously as the viscous gangsters. A solitary hero left alone on a ship (building, plane, whatever) wreaking havoc on outlandish thugs with big automatic weapons. Etc. etc. The second best way is to count how many zeros you need to put after the decimal to accurately measure the likelihood of the movie scenario. I counted to 45. A president agreeing to a meeting aboard a private ship. The impossibly replaceable command of the nuclear box. The part where the Chinese decided to shoot. Etc., etc. Man on earth is more likely to fall in the sun than for this movie to happen. <br /> <br /> I admit the film was interesting to the point where the evil gangsters in Taiwan kidnapped the president. Then the boredom began. Suspension of disbelief ceased, and I began to think of the amusement I would have torturing this movie ...
