The most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time that Garbo spoke in a movie. Besides that 'landmark' (if you want to call it that) this is a movie that does not go beyond the melodrama, with Garbo trying his best not to fall asleep. <br /> <br /> The plot involves Greta Garbo returning to his father after 15 years abroad. His father, who is a captain in a barge, is happy to see her, even though she is acting a bit cautious. She soon falls in love with a gray-haired sailor, who also realizes that something, a barrier, if you will, is holding her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two mates do not particularly like each other and soon come blows on Garbo when she spreads the situation, revealing his Big Secret, which is no surprise to us if you read the video box (MGM drug !!) Garbo is nothing but guns in this movie, she acts and acts waving her arms and grabs quickly. The two male leaders are doing well. Probably the best performance comes from the actress Marie Dressler, who plays the still drunk girlfriend of the drunken captain. What a performance! It's a shame the slogan did not read, "Dressler Talks!"
