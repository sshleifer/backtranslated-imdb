Following the success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "gem" going straight to the video. Each copy was rented for months and I even heard a good buzz around it. Then months later, I caught him in a movie network and sat down to watch him. First of all ... one of the movie locations (Walpole Island) is a place we used to visit regularly as a kid because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool huh? It's where the coldness ends with this failure. I mean the story is decent enough to justify a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are simply horrible, and frankly ridiculous with some star power really wasted and Mickey $ # @ @ e! Rourke playing a native Canadian / American hit-man?!?! What in the name of the Lord were they thinking? He does not even look like the native blood and his attempt with the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous. They could have gone somewhere with this story ... could they have hired a native actor, or changed Rourke's character, how about a white man raised by native parents? Instead, they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. <br /> <br /> As you may have noticed Mickey Rourke's "stars" in Killshot, I use that term freely. I've never really enjoyed Rourke, although his Oscar-winning performance has been decent enough. It shows and confirms my dislike for him. He seems bored, constantly bored, and his idiotic attempt to portray a native is bordering on the insult I would think. He makes a decent cold-blooded killer, but the story never explores that part of him that is totally late for the story. Diane Lane, although respected in Hollywood, presents another monotonous performance. She has had her moments, but overall she does not usually take off in any performance. She looks like she'll be great, but when she's not, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I've always felt that Jane deserves a career greater than him. I think he has an action star in his blood. All said and done its performance in Killshot is not really bad. He does not take things too far and he is hard and almost heroic in a way. He and Lane can have decent chemistry, but he does not get much in the way of his character. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) made this movie and B) had a character. Her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally equally bad. I have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless. The only character and redeeming performance of this film is given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the unbalanced mini-assassin who wants to join Rourke's assassin-man. Gordon-Levitt is very crazy and fun and his character is really engaging. If this movie had been entirely about him, it would have been a success. It literally saves it from the total crap. Its performance is almost worth watching this drivel for. Oscar-nominated director ... whoa wait? Yes, Academy Award nominee John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job) leads this mess. I've never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critique I received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was absolutely horrible. Screenwriter Hossein Amini has done nothing that I recognize but apparently was scheduled to write the next Jack Ryan movie and after that mess I can not even imagine why they want it. I understand this is based on a novel and I really hope the novel is a world above this mess. A little action and some kind of fake attempt at an emotionally charged story of a killer and his partner and the mess they engage in. Unfortunately, unless you're a big fan of Rourke or really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then there's no reason to put yourself in that pain. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 4/10
