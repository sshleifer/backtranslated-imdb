This documentary was very amateurish. It could have been done by college students. Assuming it was, my classification is as follows. Content: C, Sound quality: F, Cinematography: F, Performance: D, Soundtrack: F, Cast: C, Boobs: A ...... Overall grade: D <br /> <br /> I found myself getting Angry as we walked the streets with the characters, going up and down with every movement of the cameraman'step. My mother-in-law even changed the piles of her miraculous ear and could not hear the muted dialogue. Extensive post-production editing and CGI would not help this bomb. These "evil" students pass my course. I advise ... do not waste your time or money on the "A".
