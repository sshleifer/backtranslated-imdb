Well Wright may have made a brave description of life around 1800 - as he repeatedly and anally talks about when it was written, as opposed to published - but is not from Austen and should not be an adaptation. Mrs. Bennett looks like a rural laundress. This is a spoiled woman - they have servants (remember the scene from the book with the servant wearing the hair, etc.)? But Wright portrays her with a rough, reddish skin on his chest, rough hands and working the kitchen. And the wandering pigs! If he wants to be bucolic, he should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett - the script makes it very endearing and modern and ignored the weakness in it. The scene in which he plays for Mary should make you shrink - do not pass in seconds. If it does not, do not include it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in part and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by acting numbers. In the first proposal, he looks like a nervous boy instead of a man who overcomes his pride to make a proposal below his position. Most of his lines, he could also be reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is horrible. Altogether, with excessive hoists and jumps. In fact, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like the cute and laughable character that Lydia really is in the book at times. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Most of the time, Knightley is clearly imitating Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy is. And in your role you see the great mistake of Wright - THERE IS NO PREJUDICE. From the first encounter with Darcy she clearly imagines him. When he comments to Bingley about the attractiveness of the women in the hall, she initially seems hurt - not shocked and offended. The latter must establish the prejudice side of things. And when she and 'caroline' are jumping around the room, she appears like a taunt, obviously on top of him. And by virtually cutting off Wickham, you can not get Elizabeth to invest enough to create the damaging aspects of that relationship. <br /> <br /> And apparently it's Caroline and not Miss. Bingley. And Mr. Bingley happily walks into Jane's room. Eeee - Wright can boast of how great he is with the period he wants. But some panoramic photos of rural life (which show a preference for Hardy) do not excuse him for the gross errors made everywhere. The director of photography - who clearly wants prizes - should have been controlled. He strayed between Bronte and Hardy throughout the film - and was not Tess's latest shot / lighting proposal? The need to see Darcy walking the scape in his sloppy shirt was just plain stupid. But most importantly - when you pass between these two very different landscapes, they forget the most important - Austen. (She would have laughed out loud with Elizabeth = sad, so = rain, rushing to the picturesque madness, wet with Darcy's garbage). <br /> <br /> I admit that I found it impossible to watch the movie without using the book as context. I was prepared to give some room for maneuver as I had to provide the story in a short time. But to completely forget half the book's core in prejudice and Darcy seem continually more stubborn than proud, made it almost impossible to be found. I could only see this as a mess with generally bad performances (when Knightley was not imitating Ehle, she was either jumping or jumping or both and just calmed down a few times to indicate she has some promise - but fetish on swings to convey the emotion not is a substitute for a bad script and a bad direction - although for some it was simply a bad script case. Tom Holland alone would escape censorship.While he mitigated the comedic aspects of Collins, he adopted a Dench does superbly do the trick he can do during sleep, whether here or in Oscar Wilde - but this should be Lady Catherine De Bourgh and not Lady Bracknell. "She was just a little sane. > The shortened length could have been handled by a competent screenwriter, certainly? No characters filling in history gaps and helping along the public all over the place. followed by the sum of Â£ 10,000. And while they wanted to cut their time with learning Darcy's involvement in Wickham's marriage, the lines did not match up with Lydia. It was the worst case of incongruous exposure in the play. <br /> <br /> It really is terrible thing. Anyone who says that works well in the context of the book is someone who frankly does not believe I have read or understood the characterizations of the thing. Wright seems to think that his characters are not the 1709s of his behavior. I'm not convinced he read the book - he certainly does not understand. He does not understand Austen's acerbic wit or the lightness of the touch - he certainly made a heavy and bland movie. <br /> <br /> What is possibly worse was the sad pathetic need for little girl lovers to need the 'I love you, I love you everywhere so they can sigh and leave. The fact that it does not take place in Austen's work is apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone who analyzes it as a movie alone? Well, harder for me, except that I would notice the bad acting, the weak Darcy, and the buzz ignoring the insane irritation of the whole thing. If you will adapt, it can change a lot - but if you lose your mind and the main motivations, do not insult the book by taking the title.
