As a true lover of cinema, I must advise you to avoid this terrible effort. God knows how the funding was approved. Seriously, this is a cinematographic experience that offers zero dramatic tension and stirs until nothing happens again and again. connectivity is two scares that at least keep you awake Possiby the worst movie I've ever witnessed and the female leadership's acting is on the frontier of criminal intent. A blessing with modern technology, you can move forward and watch in 12x and it will only last 25 minutes, and you will not miss anything about the plot. I have no idea how people find this interesting and some are giving high marks!
