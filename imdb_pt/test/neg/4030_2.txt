Oh my God, there's nothing worse than that !!! I always love science fiction B movies that are so stupid they are funny and I thought this would be one of those but this was so stupid that I found it absolutely deplorable that it was released. What were these people thinking? They obviously are not real filmmakers and I really hope they have returned to their daily work after realizing that this is the best they could do! Performance and non-special effects were far from the standard of lower budget B movies. And what with men dressed as women, they could not find any woman who wanted to show up in this shitty thing. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would give a "0" if possible, it does not even deserve a "1" because it is horrible. Do not waste your time (and especially not your money) on this horrible loser of a non-movie!
