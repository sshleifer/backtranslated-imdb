WAIT until you've watched most of the other movies already released, wait a year, and watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values ​​that it does not challenge anyone's imagination. <br /> <br /> I agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to distort the data. Anything above 8 would be weird. <br /> <br /> It's good to see the very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was introduced, though she overreacted the New York accent, but other times the South (Virginia & NC) accent sneaked in. Ancient history for this talented actress who has grown so much since the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-biography section that only contained IMDb's Sandra biography. He also had a Trivia Quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. I hope you can do everything right!
