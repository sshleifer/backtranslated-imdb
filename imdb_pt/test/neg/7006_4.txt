The Midnight Hour AKA: Tell me no lies (as found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One by Merritt as a movie, complete with one plot (no holes), good story and believable conclusion and the other is by the skin movie that it is trying to be. This is certainly no more than a B-movie skin whose only purpose is to show all the girls in the movie at least once in an exceedingly long sex scene. <br /> <br /> If you try to evaluate this as a regular movie, then this is the bottom of the drivel line. Huge plot holes ruin any plot he has for him. For example, if a co-worker is killed, would you call the police or go home and go to the bathtub? Judging this film by the content of the skin, it is watchable ... evil. The girls, for the most part, are all beautiful, but obviously improved. The sex scenes were long and exaggerated, and this made the only redeeming quality a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted to. She was not as horrible as you might have imagined or, perhaps, alongside the rest of the cast, she looked much better than her. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played Detective Arraya, should not even be watching a movie. film, much less acting on one. She looked good, so we know why she was there. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really would not recommend this to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good skin film, there is something much better out there. I rate this 4 out of 10
