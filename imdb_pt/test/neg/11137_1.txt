This was obviously the worst film ever made ... Ketchup was the lead role in this movie and would be the only candidate for a prize .. because the plot, actors and anything related to this farce was absolutely horrible and ridiculous. I could have made a better horror film in my backyard within two hours with a handheld camera using lawns as the actors, at least the acting would have been better! Do not waste your time or money on this ... it is extremely fancy and horrible !!
