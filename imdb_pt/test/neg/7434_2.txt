This * must * have been an incredibly funny movie ... but it falls flat on the floor. (Actually, I stopped watching him in the middle, something I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-rate motivational speaker who is bequeathed to an elephant by his father (whom he assumed to be dead before he was born); he then has a week to get the pachyderm all over the country. Your adventures on the road are only slightly fun at best. Janeane Garofalo's considerable comedic talents are largely unexplored. Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as Jack's mother (who has much to explain), and Pat Hingle stands out as a former circus associate of Jack's father. - Maybe the second half of the movie was better than the first, but I find it hard to believe ...
