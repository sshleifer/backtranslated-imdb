Identifying this film as a vampire movie would be technically correct. Simply because it sucks life directly from you. <br /> <br /> Vampire Effect is an insult to movie fans everywhere. The plot is almost non-existent. The makeup is just awful. And acting is simply not there. <br /> <br /> I have to wonder if Jackie Chan owes a big favor to someone to be persuaded to appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> My wife got the movie from the store because she had a picture of Jackie Chan up front (like she was in the front) and she thought a good JC movie would be fun to watch. This movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can not help but look at the car accident when you drive by. You realize very quickly that the movie will not get better, but you keep watching how bad it will get.
