I do not care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of junk in the movie. What was John Landis thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a number of children's books, but come on! Even children hate this movie. It is meaningless and annoying. Tom Arnold demonstrates once again that his only talent is to waste money on production. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason why The Stupids did not show up in the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 people admit to seeing this crap. At least Hobgoblins did this on MST3K.
