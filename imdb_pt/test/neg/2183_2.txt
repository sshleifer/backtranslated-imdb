"Go Fish" gave Rose Troche, rightly or wrongly, the reputation of a very promising filmmaker. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand how it could produce a film composed of stereotypes that we associate with lower sitcoms. . The whole movie rings hollow. I cringed all the time. <br /> <br /> It's supposed to be a look at human sexuality of the nineties. Well, not much else here to be learned than from "In and Out". Now most of us really know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there are men who are sexually attracted to men and that there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rarely has this revelation been portrayed on screen with so little intelligence and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
