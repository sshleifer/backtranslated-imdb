I remembered this horrible movie I bought at the Camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when I was visiting my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Return of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror / gore genre had to offer .... or so I thought! I was only 12 at the time, so I really do not remember that well. I remember a psychopath running with a corkscrew killing people, and a couple of cops (I think) who were riding in a car that was not really moving, but being swayed side by side to look like it was ... true cinemagic. I also remember that it was the worst movie I've ever seen up to that point and I threw it all in the trash. <br /> <br /> Something tonight made me think of that movie (I can not believe I actually remembered the name), so I jumped on the imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise ... IT WAS! And a total of 5 other people saw ... Incredible. Even though I remember hating the movie at the time, I kind of wish I had it hidden somewhere, because I would love to take a look again to laugh (it would probably be a good movie to drink). Anyway, I'm happy to be a part of the elite who saw this little "treasure." I'd love to get it somewhere for a couple of bucks .... but beware, this is not a recommendation ... it's awful ... it's just for nostalgia.
