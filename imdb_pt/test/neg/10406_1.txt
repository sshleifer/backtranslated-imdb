And obviously I did not see! <br /> <br /> But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I now know how to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all the people above think the audience is dumb because it will not pick up continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant, will not you say? <br /> <br /> And I can not believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that. <Br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick really turned it down? Well, I hate to say that, but even if he took the role again, there would still be the same continuity error. I bet (if he really refused), he must have been incredulous to see that his character died in the second movie. <br /> <br /> I'll probably catch you by accident in a night air on some channel, but no way am I going to rent it or buy the DVD!
