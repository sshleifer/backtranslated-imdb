A great cast, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this movie had any of those things, maybe it was not among the worst movies I've ever wasted an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with endless typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare, but along the way this has appeared in their bin and has somehow been turned into a movie. You can tell the actors who are sorry to sign these contracts with every word they whisper directly at the camera. The CGI is amateur to the extreme and they may have created more tension from the cast that was attacked with the Sinclair Spectrum in which it was created. I wanted to like this movie, it has good appearances by Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I expected a fun horror movie that did not take itself too seriously. In fact, he tries to take himself seriously, but it's just as much fun as going to the dentist. Do yourself a favor. Do not watch this movie, you will only encourage them to earn more.
