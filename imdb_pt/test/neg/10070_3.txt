JP3 does not have Spielberg's touch. It's a full-fledged dinosaur "in your face" attack. Watching this movie was a bit like a hell coaster. <br /> <br /> The script is lame; he simultaneously asks and then leaves many unanswered questions. Also, we really can not appreciate the humans in the movie for all they are worth. For example, William H. Macy is a great talent for competing with dinosaurs for our attention. And Laura Dern was especially nice at JP1; in this movie, she's barely a speck on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The whole JP3 experience was very good. Lots of noise, lots of surprises, lots of characters dying, lots of predictable and gratuitous violence. <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: vote outside this island. <br /> <br /> (I rated a 3 for special effects; I took the other 7 points for not having any originality.)
