Oh, but this is unfortunate. One good actor after another turns into a lamentable dialogue in a somewhat emotional way under what must have been an unbelievably pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can act well when pressed and David Suchet is a professional of the highest integrity, but everyone sneaks like fish into a keg of watery gin. I swear Courtney was drunk, with painkillers or both. <br /> <br /> Was there a good performance on the whole thing? Well, yes, David Hood as the junior underground engineer whose partner was taken away looked like he was taking it seriously and crediting him for it, it can not be easy when "everything is losing its" so to speak, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director (if any) I just do not know what these people were doing in a movie that was so bad (besides paying the bills obviously) I can not begin to say I'm very disappointed with they. YOU MUST BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES! <br /> <br /> Anything but David Hood, the third one ... yes London's largely submerged aerial shots were very well done and the effects that the responsible artists deserved were better than having the your good work punctuated by such a superficial story, if you forgive the expression, as the few people who see it will do so on a screen much smaller than the best advantage. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? Why do British filmmakers try to imitate genres of tabloid genre without character and show like the disaster film and then make it even worse than Americans? Bold realism, integrity of character, capturing the real excitement in a way that makes you feel and care ... The Family Path, Spring and Port Wine, The Carter, The Long Good Friday, Trainspotting ... Do not stay I'm wrong, I like a little hokum escapist. The True "Italian Work", The Adventures of Tom Jones; but oh, that should happen, there was a more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
