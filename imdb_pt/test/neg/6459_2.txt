I was recommended this movie by one of my friends to make movies and therefore was expecting something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the first half - ah, a movie about a wimp√© revenge on his boss, how original - and watched the second part in rapid advance in the hope of finding something that justified the 45th. - I've already wasted minutes But all I got was the 'shock' that ended ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that this is a movie that seems unable to decide what it means, and says Whatever he says (hard to say). tell me what it is) bad. Great acting does not save a bad script full of characters that I can not care. <br /> <br /> Now, maybe, if I did not moonlight in the film industry, I would be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploration going on behind the screen, but how my feelings are as summarized above: 'Ho Hum '. <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10 if it was not for the acting and the paper cutting scene.
