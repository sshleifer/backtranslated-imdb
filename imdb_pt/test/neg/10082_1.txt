How can someone who liked JP's previous films be able to handle this 1 hour of conversation? There are so many stupid things about this movie that is incomprehensible !! I remember when I went to see JP as a kid, it was my favorite movie and franchise, the acting, SFX the Music, the direction! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was OK pretty much the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast kicking a raptor..Please!) but in a whole a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> But the third one does not make sense !! It's supposed to be a sequel that Carry is from JP2 and still magically includes new stuff for the franchise that would have been impossible to miss in the previous 2 movies! for example: 1) The "new" Mega Spinosaurus - Seriously, what the hell !! This thing follows them wherever they go, they can not escape their presence and still in the lost world (the same island) do you see this once? Do you hear that? Does anybody even mention that? NOT! It's ridiculous!. The star character in the 2 previous films was, and will always be the T-Rex, so what d (urr) will "Joe Johnston" do? Kill him! so you see the huge T-Rex in all its incredible glory, it's dead and you never see it again - a new Dino in town is the excuse ... where he came from !! ??? not a single explanation! and do not make me get the satellite-phone-no-dino-belly thing! 2) Just when you get over how stupid is the Spinosaurus, you see the Raptors, In addition to their new "Punk" haircuts, they look pretty reliable! * Phew * they are going to make this movie watchable right? ... WRONG! now they talk to each other !! and the excuse for them to speak in this movie and not the First and Second are ... wait for it ... Evolution! - yes, the process of millions of years in just a few months from the end of the second film, amazing! they should have had opposing thumbs and created tools so far !! OK, I will not say more about the plot, because it's getting on my nose, so I'll close it: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a bad blow for any of the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was fine and truly dead after watching this Monstrosity (no pun intended) Avoid this movie like the plague
