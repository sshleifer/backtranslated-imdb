For years I hesitated watching this movie. Now I know why. It's not just a comedy that fails to be even remotely funny, but there's also nothing to laugh about the movie. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this sucker and still felt out of time more than money. I've never seen a movie that bothered me that much. It's a movie about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. I really do not know how anyone with good sense could really act in that kind of movie. I used the IMDb for some time, but I felt compelled to register only to help prevent poor and innocent people from renting or, worse, to buy that stinky !! Really a waste of time and money. I must say the plot is horrible.
