Ok, I have not read the book yet, but I must say that the main character has been misused. How can I say such a thing that I have not read the book you ask? It's simple. As a spectator of this miniseries, I was irritated by the mannerisms, gestures and appearance of the main character, Fannie Price. It's one thing to be a good person, but it's quite another to be a stick in the clay creature who despises looking at anyone on the face or otherwise meeting his gaze. In addition to the exaggerated profile of "Susan B. Anthony," she seemed determined not to look at someone else. The scene where Edmond is pouring his heart out to her, she's looking forward all the time, forcing him to do the same. As a result, it was just weird and I could not imagine anyone being in love with her, much less Henry and Edmond. Many have said it was true for the book, if that is the case, I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create such a character as her main heroine. It is possible to create a character that has been placed by others and succeeds in gaining their trust and affection, but the portrait of this character in this miniseries simply did not do it for me.
