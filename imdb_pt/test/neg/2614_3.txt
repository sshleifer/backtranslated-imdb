The latest attempt to relive the series, actually based on a good idea, but without the necessary violence for this type of thriller - and therefore ... BORING !! Good special fx, scenarios, costumes, etc. but the film is simply foolish and almost a waste of time ... we hope the next issue will correct this problem.
