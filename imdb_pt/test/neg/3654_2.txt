This movie has the feel of a college project about it, who wants to do a blair witch project meets the theme of the saw. But it is not successful. Cinematography is poor and acting even more. The characters, in my opinion, do not seem credible. Editing the movie also is not working as intended. There are many bad effects, which I believe are put there to try to add a horrible effect. But for me it just gives me a sense of indifference. <br /> <br /> I'd stay away from this movie, unless you're a fan of dedicated movies, who enjoy watching "different" and indie "horror" movies. However, I believe this movie is not worth watching, for the average person. You will not have any pleasure with the bad effects and camera feel that this movie gives to viewers.
