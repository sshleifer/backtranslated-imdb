This has to be one of the weaker plots in a movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> However, this is not all that this movie is missing. This movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, his name - it's the worst ever. <br /> <br /> I recommend you spend your time on worthwhile movies and do not waste time on it. trash. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier post that "women" were definitely men in clothes, and that gave me a laugh, I keep trying to find out if they were being obvious about or if they were really trying to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching! <br /> <br /> To summarize: a horrible performance, horrible script, horrible idea for a movie. An hour and a half of my life I want to go back now!
