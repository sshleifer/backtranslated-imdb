A friend invited me to see it in theaters. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we left and went to the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in time to get the start of Against All Odds. <br /> <br /> I remember many monkeys dancing saying "oog, oog". Very little about the characters or the introduction of the story has captured any of us or been memorable. He just dragged it to the point of being painfully annoying (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with that particular friend). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a great studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. It seemed that Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell would be wasted in such a poorly written film. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you come in the second hour, there is something worth seeing. I do not have much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
