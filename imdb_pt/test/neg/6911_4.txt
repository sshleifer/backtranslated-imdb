There seems to be a whole subgenre of old, cheap, and tired "comedies," who say the same old things about middle-class couples. More or less like Friends, but with more soft pornography and without wit. This film is no exception - I had situations so familiar that I died of déjà vu. People sat on couches, weaving cliches about sex and relationships? Checks. Monogamy versus cheating with some woman / man who would never actually look twice at any other woman / man? Checks. PORN BADDIES !!!! 111? Checks. Some guy / girl who happens to be the only reason you're seeing this crap? Checks. The lesson seems to be - when you doubt it, make an old and tired "comedy" about people no one cares about in order to make some statement that everyone has heard three thousand times before. This is going to make your movie. It will even attract somebody sitcom in a bad wig!
