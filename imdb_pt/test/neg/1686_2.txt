I never started watching the program until it was canceled and I began to show the reruns. I really enjoyed the first to third season. When I saw the fourth and fifth, I started to get angry. The first problem was that they made it irrelevant, the story setting repeating itself (Jr having a son like their parents). The second had to be the one in which everyone had a pair with someone (eg Katie and Franklin). The third was when they made Jr even dumber than before, which was starting to be tedious and annoying to the point where I wanted to get on the TV and end his stupidity until he was unconscious. The room had to be that zealous idiot Clarie claimed as a boyfriend. The fifth had to be Katie, she was starting to be too good for herself and was treated by her "boyfriend" Franklin as the person he was. The last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson just more annoying !!! They seriously jumped the shark when he got to the show. There was little or no realism in his character, and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force that Noah could not act. Eveytime I saw that boy just made me want to slap him silly. However, B.F. (before frankly) this show was funny and very entertaining.
