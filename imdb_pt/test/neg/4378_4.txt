Well, the hero and the terror is a little below average in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a true martial artist and kicks some butts in this movie, but it is rather slow and the acting, in my opinion, is mostly below normal even though I think Steve James does a decent job. As my friend Ryan, I was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theater at the end of the film instead of going after Norris's girlfriend. Until then, the killer only killed women. Well, I guess it was not as predictable as I thought. Definitely a movie that you can spend.
