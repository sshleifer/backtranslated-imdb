When I heard that Disney had the rights to "Underdog", I figured it would be a Pixar affair, and we'd have a great movie about adults and kids like "The Incredibles." Unfortunately I forgot how Disney should cast the classic stuff for the stupid youth of today. What were they thinking? "Underdog" was a product of the 60's, its Prime Fanbase is in its 40s and 50s, why would you change the focus to 5 year olds? Should have been done ala "Roger Rabbit", half lively half real. Instead, we have characters like Riff Raff (a WOLF !!) stupid on another dog. "Underdog" may not have a "energy pill," as we are now so "enlightened," obviously would be a steroid or drug reference. The only good cast was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because he really looks like the cartoon version. Otherwise, old school "Underdog" fans should avoid this as the plague that it is. What's next? A live action version of "The Go-Go Gophers" disguised as a re-visionary story lesson? (My apologies if Disney skipped this!)
