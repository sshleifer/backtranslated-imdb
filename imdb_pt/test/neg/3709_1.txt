ZERO stars out of **** Infinite descent has absolutely no redeeming value, be it the ridiculously bad acting, the ridiculously awful special effects, the incompetent direction, the stupid script, or the gratingly annoying musical Dot. It's the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like that could have the slightest regard for being a green studio in the first place. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll dive into the plot, other than to say it's about a group of people who are trapped underwater and have to kill a bunch of fake-looking creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me go into detail about what is so horrible about this movie. First of all, the acting is simply awful. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a feat that is hard enough to get as it is. The supporting performances are not really better. And what is with the actor Luis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a sharp voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy, not for a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are even worse. Creatures range from strange eels to gigantic starfish and "most squirrels." The effects look like something you'd see in a muppet movie, and I do not think I need to dig deeper into this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has a cult status because of all the terrible films he has. did. I'm sure some will enjoy Downhill in Ed Wood's style, but I do not even think it's that good. All it does is poor quality, especially camera work. Man can not direct a movie, that's all there is. <br /> <br /> This was the last of the four films that happened underwater, and it sure makes Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad movies in their movies). right) begin to look masterful in comparison. Anyway, just stick with the Abyss.
