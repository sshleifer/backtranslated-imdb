QUESTION: How does a movie deserve two different titles like "The Librarians" and "Strike Force"? <br /> <br /> ANSWER: The movie is soooooooooooo that the filmmakers could not even decide on a title !!!! <br /> <br /> This film is a mix of martial arts, death wishes, melodrama, romance and other clich√© movie techniques. The story centers on a group of vigilantes called The Librarians, led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is looking forward to a nefarious, multi-lingual, tagged creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff), who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of South Florida. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds appears as a special guest in this film, and his scene is totally alien to the action. Burt does a long monologue on one of the strangest ones I've ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a sort of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in "The Godfather." <br /> <br /> Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak, who infiltrated the inner circle of Mark's bizarre world. Erika's character enters into an alliance with Simon. Librarians and Erika will become a powerful force to attack evil in a film that was delivered directly from the editing room to their cable TV converter.
