I made sure to watch this movie because it's a 1950s science fiction movie - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, while I was looking forward to wild-eyed aliens or power-mad conquerors, the aliens in this movie were a huge disappointment! First, you only see one very briefly at the beginning (and it seemed pretty common) and you also only have a small glimpse of a spaceship! Secondly, the alien was neither the conqueror of evil nor the benevolent friend of mankind-but a real strange ball. And finally, the plot itself seemed so dumb, boring and heavy that it caused more yawns than emotions. <br /> <br /> As the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the US) are abducted by an alien. The alien gives each of them devices by which they CAN destroy all life on the planet if they so choose - because, the alien admits that YOUR race of people would love to inhabit the Earth, but they themselves will not kill to get it. Then he returns them all. While it is 100% obvious that no one would want to use these devices, the alien announces on TV the identities of the five without saying that guns are so powerful! So all the militarists in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five hiding and one being tortured to make it reveal how the device works - how the Soviets want to use it !!! That part of the movie sounded pretty silly. Of course the USSR was a bad and corrupt nation (sorry, but it is fact - especially under Stalin), they would never have thought of using it as they did in the movie! Later, one of the five (the German scientist) somehow discovers that the devices can also be used to kill only all evil people who hate freedom. So he uses this to do away with all the evil communists and presumably with others who were anti-freedom and the world then becomes a paradise !! Preachy, silly and full of holes in the plot - this film simply is not worth your time, although it is an interesting relic simply by the way it approaches communism - in particular, the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
