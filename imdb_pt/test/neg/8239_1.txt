As I watched this episode, I kept looking at the clock waiting for something to happen. As the time ran out, I thought they would really give us a big pop at the end, and then - nothing. The whole family is curled around the Christmas tree as if it were something of the Hallmark Channel, get weak. <br /> <br /> Maybe one of the poorest season finale I've ever seen. Nothing to cheer about next season. The only thing discarded as an incentive to watch next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while picking up a sandwich that the New York guys wanted to get one of the guys from New Jersey. Wow!! Seriously? I would never expect something like that from mobsters, I'm on the edge of my place. <br /> <br /> It seems that they are trying to make everyone lose interest. They begin more plot lines that end up disappearing than any show I've ever seen. They tease and insinuate, but rarely deliver more. <br /> <br /> What about the Arabs staying in Bing? They keep throwing them in front of us and, magically, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie killed a child after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to his son and at the same time to the wind. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And how many more sinuous drug mounts with Christopher will we have to endure? Please get him arrested or overdose or something interesting. <br /> <br /> This was one of the few shows I used to wait to watch, but now, forget it.
