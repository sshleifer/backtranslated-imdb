Ok, first of all, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I lost credits and stuff. So when I finally got here, I was like, "Who the hell is this guy?" I discovered it was Flex hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex did not look like Michael Jackson. Not even a little. He could not dance like him, or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice. People have commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can not comment on that because I do not know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was like a simple wack. Dialogue sucked. Cinematography - if it can be called so - sucked. The soundtrack was sucked. Acting sucks. Yeah, even Flex ... I'm so upset about this. I did not want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex knew he could get away with it. But the whole thing looked like a dress. Do you know? It's as if no one looks like they should, except for Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> The concert sequences have just been sucked. I'm sorry, but Flex simply can not dance like Michael. I mean, how the hell was VH1 thinking? The makeup did not even match the time Michael was going through. For example, in the movie it was still dark when Neverland was invaded the first time. In real life, MJ was white as hell. There was some sort of stupid delay on his discolored skin. <br /> <br /> The movie was not boring, well for me it was not. It was not really anything. I was so upset with everything that was wrong with that. I wanted to see how this happened and if Flex could redeem itself. He did not, really. The only part I found a little interesting was Lisa Marie's whole thing. When they fell in love. That was cool. But I had to turn away when they kissed. And only two parts made me laugh. The first time was when they cut from Michael with short hair, you know the era of Thriller, to Michael with long, fluttering hair of the Dangerous era and he was still black! That was funny. The second time I laughed was when they showed all the posters and memorabilia of Michael, but they had the face of Flex instead! It was so funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was cheap junk. It was only two hours of dress and could have been much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. See if you want. But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculous of it. I got out of it feeling angry. And when I discovered it was Flex, I started to feel so bad. So ... watch if you want.
