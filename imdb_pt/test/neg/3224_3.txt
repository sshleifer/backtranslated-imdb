This movie can be o.k. if it were not for the whole language. I think the story itself is not bad, but I'd be ashamed to let my wife or kids see the movie. I know kids will learn all the bad words along the way, true, but parents should not help them in the process by letting them see and hear things disguised as entertainment. <br /> <br /> I used to like Robert Loggia a lot; he has a distinct quality with that rough voice of his, but in recent years all I have seen is a paper with a lot of language in them. If we had a premium for the excessive use of the word F, he would have to be a candidate. Unfortunately, I think he has now lost me as a fan. When I see your name in the movies in the future, I'll be thinking twice before taking that title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not a prude. I use language sometimes too, under extreme circumstances, but when we're watching a movie it's because of something that we hope will bring us some joy and escapism. I do not want to be reminded of what's happening on the streets in any big city these days, and it's a nuisance to have to ask me whether a movie is right for my family to watch. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it's a shame he has associated himself with an image that left his image like that. He probably did an okay. I worked on the film, but I hung up about 1/4 of the way after having had my ears beaten too often by others in the cast. Why can not these actors simply say no when these scripts ask them to continue with that gutter language? Once enough actors, especially the big names, make noise, the writers will stop putting it in the movies! <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I can not recommend this photo. Too bad, I think it probably would have been nice if it had been done well enough for decent families to watch! Thank God I only lost $ 2.00 on it!
