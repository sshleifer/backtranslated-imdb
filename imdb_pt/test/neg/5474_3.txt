The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last sighs of the horror scene obsessed by the occultists of the 70's just before Halloween appears, rip the rulebook, set fire to it and kick it screaming through a glass window . To shorten a long story, two enterprising Greek filmmakers imagine their chances of joining a new film franchise with the unlikely double womanish, wise act of the American investigator Milo and an abhorrent but kindly father, priest. Roche. An exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic follies - offering tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unpleasant effigy of the minotaur, and only Milo and Roche can stop him! <br /> <br /> Or something like that. <br /> <br /> Reality, however, is horribly monotonous, frustrating, and fraught with lost opportunities. I strongly suspect that the incipient filmmakers spent most of the budget to take Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) on board and hoped that this would be enough to influence audiences in the English-speaking world. <br /> /> It is not. The Devil's Men looks beautiful with certainty, camera and fantastic locations. Eno's score, though basically just a chord he probably did in an afternoon, is appropriately atmospheric and the movie is loaded with the 70's cookie, including that Austrailian type of Fawlty Towers and the hot Jane Lyle of Death Island. But then the positives end. Cushing sleepwalks through it, looking like he's got an ear of corn up to his homeless and Pleasance gets excited about trying his best, but never getting things right. To make matters worse, Milo's character is terribly fragile and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Okay, so it does not look so good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is a hint that the local villagers are possessed, but to be fair to them, they never do anything quite different from worrying about glazed eyes. Maybe they were just tired? When you are sure that things will come to some kind of head, Milo and Roche interrupt the baron's satanic party with a laughable ease, sending him to find his creator. The minotaur statue falls silent and look at it! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. The insane optimism that The Devil's Men may be the first in a series of movies is hammered by Father Roche's final line a few seconds before the ridiculously rushing end. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I can summon you again to help defeat the Antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll be making this call any day now, Donald.
