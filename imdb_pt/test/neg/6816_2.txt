"Dogmatic," as another reviewer described this film, is an appropriate word. The director's idea was to present Bach without plot, acting, entertainment, theater, dialogue, narrative or drama. Mission accomplished, Monsieur Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematic?" No way. This is anti-cinema. No one moves. Hardly anyone speaks. The camera keeps still pictures for 10 to 12 minutes at a time: very, very occasionally, the camera enters. You may catch a glimpse of Gustav Leonhardt's fingers moving over the keys. It is. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​looking at the nape of a stud for 7 minutes while listening to Bach, this is the movie for you. I prefer to listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
