Czech moviegoers may have liked and rated this film highly because it was Czech, but I found it to be banal, tedious, stupid, boring and insipid. Again, I suspect "ramping" in order to increase this dog's sales of a movie. Amazon describes this movie as being about a couple of colleagues who refuse to grow, but I will go further - I think it's about two comrades who have entered into a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone. I was told that one of the actors in the movie committed suicide after the movie, and I would believe that. When he saw his performance, he probably realized the horrible job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which I'm sure was much more dramatic and a far better performance than he. had done in "Autumn Spring". Do not waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. It's nothing but a dog in a manger.
