Because? Because? Why does not anyone tell the truth about this horrible, horrible movie? I still wake up in the morning and ask God why He did not stop me from seeing this comedy "revolting." I can not believe I paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste. I'm beginning to think that the 5 stars she has are because of the nakedness of Martha Higareda and all the men who can not afford a porn movie and avoid seeing it ... I'm going to call it "thing" because calling the movie is a insult to the Mexican film industry. The characters are a huge clich√©, the acting causes involuntary laughter and the script is ... well, I can not believe a human being wrote that. And when you think you've been tortured enough ... the last half hour is so painful that I wanted to tear out my eyes. The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only lasts 90 minutes (this would seem centuries, but still). Really, avoid the pain !!!
