Now, I like the Bollywood movies and I'm really glad they've recently been successful in the UK. However, the latest effort by Suneel Darshan is a deeply flawed film from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a modern version of Bollywood on Amadeus was quite exciting, until both supposed 'musicians' appeared. on the scene, looking like they've never touched a manuscript in their lives. Upen Patel is a very handsome man, and the film touches on his narcissistic sensibility, but is never believable as a modern Mozart. In terms of acting, all he can do is stand and pout. His expressions, hair and clothes all look the same, including the scene in which he is supposed to be "dying," when in fact he seems to have nothing but a mild sniff. Bobby Deol, playing the role of Salieri, does his best to liven up the little wooden script that exists, but unfortunately only gets a little annoyed when he's supposed to be jealous. <br /> <br /> Bollywood films are widely recognized for their stunning backgrounds and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like a BBC drama play. In fact, the closest thing Shakalaka comes to is Hollyoaks, while he blatantly hides a lousy script behind beautiful people looking, well, beautiful. "He still needs to achieve mediocrity" - the same can be said for the totally forgotten songs. <br /> <br /> In short, Darshan's latest offer has no boom, bang, blow or accent. Instead, he simply shakes with his head down, hoping to get his attention with a gentle pat on the shoulder. And that's not good enough.
