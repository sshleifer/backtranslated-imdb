If the directors / producers / advertisers wish to promote a film as "based on actual events" and make a film that serves to inspire and have meaning, then to maintain any credibility and integrity, honest as possible. <br /> <br /> A team that uses "all blacks" and does haka in America is simply dumb. Any intelligent person would know that the All Blacks are the National Rugby Union team of New Zealand and their jumpers are all black and Haka is played by them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having this stupidity in a film, without explanation, only reduces the film's credibility to zero and denies the message and inspiration that the film is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why?" Why would you do such a stupid thing and possible gain? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that writers, directors or producers saw it on TV before an international Rugby Union game and thought, "wow, that would be great in our movie, no one will know that it ever happened, they're all too dumb to know about NZ and all the blacks, this is going to be great. "As an American audience React to a New Zealand-made film about Americain's iron grid with a team wearing Indian American costumes and war paint, doing a Native American Indian dance, running in circles screaming "oh woo woo woo woo, woo woo woo wow" react? They laughed at their heads! <br /> <br /> The people who made this movie and the industry that generated it really should have their heads read. For some reason, the industry thinks they can "fool all people all the time". <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
