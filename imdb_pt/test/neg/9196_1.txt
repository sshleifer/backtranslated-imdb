This is a poor and poor movie. Full of cliches, unreal moments: punch the air in celebration after putting out a fire, it does not matter that someone has lost their home and their belongings !, announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all his companions before speaking in private first , walking the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason, stereotyped funerals and strained relations, the very dishonest and kitschy music at the end, the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment, the unrealistic explosion of that same apartment! ! Did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something? Anyone with a little intelligence can see that this movie was a joke. It's a shame because firefighters do an incredible job, and they deserve to have a good movie done about what they do, but not at the expense of common sense.
