Jack Frost 2. The worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Because? 1) The premise is WELL beyond ridiculous 2) The damn thing has no legs to move on! 3) He escapes AFTER being completely submerged in the Anti-Freeze (first movie) 4) Get this ... He travels all over the ocean from SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff who did it in the first movie. 5) "killer snowballs". I still have to be drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man" so to write this, Jack Frost 2 has the distinction of being the stupidest horror movie ever. Even surpassing the inanity of its predecessor (if you can believe it!).
