I did not like Underdog! I mean it was really unnecessary and needed a great lift and then it would have been maybe walkable but for the main part I did not like it. This was not like any other kid's movie is one of those movies that they wanted the parents (who grew up watching the cartoon) come there with the children to come and see this, I'm not one of them, so the film did not attract me at all. I had some problems with this, like I do not think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog that made him sound sloppy and very unintelligent. So it was really predictable what makes you feel tired and crazy. The mood was really what drove me crazy. The only thing that bothered me the most was thinking how almost everything out of Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. The acting was acceptable but needed a bit of improvement. If you have kids who might appreciate it but if you do not You're a boy for everything it means to see that you can like me. 3.4 stars out of 10
