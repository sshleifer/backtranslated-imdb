A conversation about how Jan-Michael Vincent is an exuberance led me to re-visit this DTV entry in the mid-1990s. A boy gets traumatized when he sees an ice-cream man being shot down in the 1950s and he becomes a psychopath ice cream (Clint Howard). Something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> Director Norman Apstein (credited as Paul Norman) made a career of making porn before that and came back to him later. That's what you get by having all the killings happen off-screen. And by throwing a skinny kid like a fat kid and make him wear a fat suit. Just throw a fat kid! In addition, there is a scene in which Vincent reacts stoically to a group of escaped freaks that surround him. He was totally drunk and was scared for his life or the filmmakers captured his "I really sank that bass?" complete shame. Despite being a low budget junk, this did line up some good names including David Naughton, Olivia Hussey, David Warner and Doug Llewelyn of THE PEOPLE COURT. How can you make a boring slasher with this cast is beyond me.
