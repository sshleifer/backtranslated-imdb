usually a film that begins poorly remains poor in a monotonically downward pattern. This bad movie started to improve before diving. The acting, except for the male antagonist, was horrible. The plot was essentially a setting for the final main scene, which is probably good as performative art, but was wasted on this film. I do not know why this movie was made.
