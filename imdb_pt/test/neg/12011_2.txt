"Problem Child" was a cool movie, but really deserved a sequel? I do not think it happened. The only redeeming feature of the original film was Gilbert Gottfried, and he was not very good in this sequence. <br /> <br /> I can not really understand why this movie was bad. For starters, it just was not funny. Even when I saw this at nine years old, I did not sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver). His character came to me as weeping, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. He seemed to hate all the women his father Ben (John Ritter) dated to hate them. It also does not send a good message to children with divorced parents (who make up more than half of US children today) when the only woman with whom Ben decides to marry (almost) is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children . how is it. <br /> <br /> And as cool as I thought it would have been to see SNL's original host, Laraine Newman, get back on the big screen, she could not even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a southern white deboucher whose name was Lawanda. This sounds more like the name of an African-American woman. But of course, this has nothing to do with why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie did not work because you had antagonists you should hate along with protagonists you should not hate. The character of John Ritter was to be a good father who desperately tried to teach his son from the wrong without conforming to authoritarian fatherhood. Instead, he left not only as a weak father but also as one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days regardless of how well he knew the woman. Did I mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck unnecessary and inexplicable return to play a totally different character to that young woman who was even more hateful than Junior, completely indifferent to humor the bathroom, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog collectors). The movie was just a mess, and really does not deserve a DVD release if it has not been released. It should just rot in VHS along with all the other bad comedies of the '90s.
