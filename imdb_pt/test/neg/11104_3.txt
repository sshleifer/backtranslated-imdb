It's all my fault. Everyone told me I should avoid watching this movie because I'm a big fan of the old TV series. They were right. While production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "do not look now") Julie Christie are not that bad, the whole film exhibits audacity and self-awareness that clearly has no justification. A comparison between Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes to my mind. In fact, the Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new mummy films than to the old series. But then the script is terrible, the speed does not exist and sometimes the movie is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the tomb looks just plain stupid), with cats clearly being thrown when they should jump (landing with their back first). Belhephore moves like a statue on wheels, neither impressive nor scary, and the psychological drama that unfolded in the old TV series when the heroine had to learn that she is a villain is completely neglected. This movie is so wasted (money wasted, actors wasted, blueprint wasted) it hurts. It's a below-normal Mummy-steal that's only good for a few laughs, but it has nothing to do with the classic Greco (she has a small role in this movie too - in the graveyard).
