A well-evoked scenario from the 1930s offers much interest to a viewer in the early twenty-first century; unfortunately, "London Belongs to Me" has little more to suggest than English charm. All problems lie in the deeply unfocused history. The main plot relates to the actions of the young boy Richard Attenborough, the problems he enters and how the community in which he lives unites to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main point here is that Attenborough's character brings everything to himself and, frankly, is guilty of almost all the charges against him, so it's disconcerting because the movie (and all the characters) has so much sympathy for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances when he really is not; and what's more, he is not shown to have much remorse for his actions, only caring to get away with the things he did not intend to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of screen time in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot and you wonder what he's doing there (though Yes is, as always, superb). You know there is a problem with the structure when the main frame constantly impacts the subframe, but not vice versa. And, following a calm and careful rhythm, the plot completely melts away in the last 20 minutes with a profoundly unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion, which does not even show us whether Attenborough's character evolved from previous procedures. The movie does not end, it just stops. <br /> <br /> The performance, direction and overall feel of the film can be praised, but unfortunately the story and structure of the play are constantly marked. A final point of trivia: Alec Guinness based his performance on the widely superior film "The Ladykillers" in Alastair Sim's performance in this film until the two characters have almost identical scenes.
