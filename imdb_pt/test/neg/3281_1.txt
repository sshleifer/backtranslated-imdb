This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can tell when you're watching a "I want to be" mafia movie .... and that's it. That made no sense, it did not start early in life, charactors were all over the place ... and the term "GODFATHER" did not exist until PUZO wrote the book! ... THEN, the real mafia lent the phrase and made their own after the movie ..... This piece of claptrap would have a thought that the phrase (representing the mafia don) was used in the 20s ... when these people were just called "DON" .... out of the original godfather movie, if you want to see another decent furniture film, check out Part 2 of the last one from the Don from Puzo (part 1).
