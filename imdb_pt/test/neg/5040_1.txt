I will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the heinous plot lines, I'll just say that this movie suffers from bad animation, about acting, obvious tag lines ?? These are some of your good qualities. if you are abandoned on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you have is this movie, throw it at the fish. I can not tell you how sorry I am to see this horrible hideous movie. Speaking of which, this movie supposedly a horror movie can not be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the ability to play from some of the actors. <br /> <br /> Be careful.
