The producer of this film is called 'Nott Entertainment', and this is a surprisingly appropriate name. That's a lot of fun 'Nott' from start to finish, which is a shame because a mix of zombie and western movie could have been interesting. Every time a low budget zombie movie is released, it will tend to be "for fans by the fans." I really consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but many more like this and I will be re-evaluating my opinion! The film seems to be a rip-off of the half zombie Aussie 'Undead', rather than just having the lead on a cowboy hat; everyone is wearing one; but that does not make much sense because the film is apparently set in modern times. The sequence of credits at the beginning of the movie deceives us believing that we will be in an atmospheric movie, but when the movie starts correctly; it soon becomes clear to what we are really going. Of course, there is a considerable amount of blood and this is really well done, although the good things I have to say about the film are virtually over. There is a twist in the way that might have been interesting if the rest of the movie was. Overall, this is just another zombie movie in a world with many zombie movies. I would not recommend this.
