The Net is a movie I've never seen since the release, I remember taking a look at the mediocre critiques and since then, you may have noticed a stretch here and there when you're on TV. Seeing this now, fourteen years after its original release, I'm a little amazed at the time it flies. Being in my early 20s made my childhood seem old. I felt like I should do some exercise before my body started to accumulate fat in all the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that was the best part of this cinematic experience for me. I would say the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me busy with the retro skies. Look at those big cans they call computers. Look, they talk in chat rooms! I remember those tops! They look ... stupid. And even Sandra Bullock's star. First billed! Would you look at that? Like a movie, The Net is just a Hitchockian cat-and-mouse thriller, unimaginative, simple and totally routine. Nothing archaic about it, they did it as much as they do now. Bullock plays a reclusive computer nerd, who has the job of fixing software for people who do not understand "that whole computer". When this happens, she comes across some sensitive information and after her vacation trip ends up almost being killed by a sexy layman who turns out to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have been suspected by the fact that they're in an American movie and the guy smokes and has a British accent!), she gets her "annihilated identity." Her house is empty, for sale, and upon verification, it turned out that she now has a new identity. A condemned and imposing prostitute, no less. <br /> <br /> Now you can say that this is unlikely. How could they do that to her? Even in 1995, it's impossible! This is true, but in 95 many people did not even know what the Internet was. I can see what a hole you could have accepted back then. What is even more disastrous are the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The film obviously owes much to Hitchcock's films (he's one of those thrillers who feature a carousel at night), but Hitchcock always made sure his films were plausible. The characters did not act like confused maniacs when they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not give way to a structure where one obstacle inevitably leads to the other. The characters also tried a bit before going into all of the rouge chase. The character of Bullock really has no friends? Could not any high school teacher confirm their identity? Or how ... the nearest pizzeria? Oh, well, she asks for pizza from the internet. Nevermind. You imagine the movie very quickly. There seems to be hope in an ex-boyfriend. Do you really think so? You should always count on at least one surprise. The network does not offer anything. <br /> <br /> The Internet represents a great danger, this movie seems to predict. But if the film had been made today, imagine the problems that villains would have to deal with to ensure identity cleansing. Not only did they have to do all those boring and literal things, she still would have her Facebook membership, with at least 100 friends or more, and photo tags, not to mention she might be on YouTube or Linked-In, and about your video blog with about 150 daily hits, or the webcams in your home and videos recorded from her on other people's phones, webcams, web downloads ... your IMDb affiliation?
