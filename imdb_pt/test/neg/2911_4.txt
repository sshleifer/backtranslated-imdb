The pro-American war propaganda film that came out in 1942 made the East Side Kids stiff against any Japanese they identified in their own neighborhood when they knew they were too young to enlist. Ultimately, they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals, but also happen to stumble into a spy ring, then they set out to break. The film is harmless enough in its form, although some may feel offended, since innocent Asians were actually chosen during World War II. Overall, though, it's a fairly generic effort and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall would have better times, the best tend to come here when they improvise.
