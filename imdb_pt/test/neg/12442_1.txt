I could ruin a better movie. This is a waste of time and money. makes me sick that movies like these are actually being made and the people who make them really think they're good. I like teenage comedies when they are well made. This film, however, takes this genre to a new level. With movies like this, people think it's okay to do this filth and ask innocent people to pay to sit down. It's sadism.
