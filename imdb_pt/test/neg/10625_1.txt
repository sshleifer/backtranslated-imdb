I received this movie as a birthday present because all my friends know that I am a big fan of low budget Horror movies. Kaufman Studios always made the bloody movies that worked. I loved watching your movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I saw Bugged ... WHAT HAPPENED? <br /> <br /> This movie started with a very good concept about mutation errors and even added some slippery comedy, but overall the writing is just plain bad and that was a number one mistake. Ronald K. Armstrong should first learn to be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. After reading the Credits, we discovered that he was given the most important role in the movie! two words Mr. Director "Acting Lessons" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors casting their own films and this is error number two. <br /> <br /> The only thing I believed saved this movie was the work of artistic camera and the musical score (let's hear this for the team!) The cast of other actors who at the beginning of this production seemed a little cold, really warmed toward the middle and the end of this production. Everyone came together and helped get this movie out. Ronald Armstrong may not have the talent to become a decent Director or Actor, but, I'm going to tell him that - He seems to know how to organize people to get everyone together and get their productions. This film, I have to say, can be an inspiration to any young filmmaker who dreams of making his own film, because if Mr. Armstrong was able to do it, anyone else can too. If you get a chance to watch this movie, watch it to get inspired to make "Better" in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better Horror Flicks to keep that genre coming back from its grave.
