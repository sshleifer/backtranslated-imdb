Like many of the comments above me, I also thought this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. I found it quite patronizing and actually preaching. <br /> <br /> But that's not the only comment. The scenes are very "artificial" (not as in the scifi, as I will explain in some moments). (The next sentence is a small spoiler.) The movie represents more or less a discussion between two groups. The physical configuration of a discussion typically involves two or three men next to each other, typically speaking. In the worst case, the other party is represented by one person. <br /> <br /> Also the interviews that the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. For example, sometimes the discussion is between reporters (I mean, from a point of the respondent, 'akward'). In addition, the interview people are always calm, they say everything without normal emotions. That is you can not tell whether they lie or not, they are crazy or not. They show almost nothing. <br /> <br /> This is also very unprofessional, 'Christian' reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: <br/> <br /> All the conversations contain: <br /> <br /> - facts <br /> <br /> - arguments pro / with <br /> <br /> There are no lies. Nobody lies. (The next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you're still planning to see the movie.) The only lie that's happening is to demonstrate how unbelieving "bad guys" are. <br /> <br /> It makes me conclude that the movie is a movie B It's very similar to Plan 9 from Outer Space, but this movie also has an annoying and wrong discussion about aliens and beliefs Christians. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I have no intention of insulting Christians, people who believe in aliens or whoever. This is a thought I have about the movie, not about people. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like to note that I do not know if the actors are bad or if they have only received terrible scripts.
