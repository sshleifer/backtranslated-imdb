Beginning with a shocking poem and images of American missiles, starving children and mutilated Palestinians, I quickly realized that this would not be an objective documentary. 5 young men condemned after the Gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explanation as to why they had to destroy the city center and then (oh my god) actually paid for what they did. I was watching and a lot of questions were raised, the trial was done correctly and the police had the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked ... and then it crashed. There are no interviews with judges or through documents on the trial .. nothing. <br /> <br /> In short: Nothing new, than every Swede saw on television a hundred times - just poor publicity.
