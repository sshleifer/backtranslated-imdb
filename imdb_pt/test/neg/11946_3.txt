There's only one reason to watch this ill-fitting and totally predictable movie about a tense chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes when she inherits her niece orphan Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a crash car. And this reason is to watch Aaron Eckhart (Nick) who, with his seemingly attractive haircut and attitude, looks good enough to knock between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette and a little sun dried out in cubes finely tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought that he could take off his shirt really was the only thing that kept me up to the end. He took the apron petulantly several times, but to my disappointment I never went any further. <br /> <br /> I can not be too critical because I was watching on pay per view at home so it did not cost the price of two movie tickets at least and I was educated to be grateful for small mercies But in fact, this is the Rom Com in its most formal format. Zeta Jones gives a very flat and monotonous performance, she seemed totally devoid of passion (possibly due to the amount of time she apparently spent in the restaurant cold? Thirty gets there it can not have been fun) and her face barely changed expression throughout the film. Abigail Breslin was very good as her niece, she is such a handsome girl that it is impossible to criticize her, and anyway I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always a good value and I can not really blame her performance as the restaurant owner because she seemed very underused given how good a actor she is and how little she had to do here. But the whole thing is so clich√©, much of the dialogue is banal and the result is so obvious. This is the cinematographic equivalent of painting in numbers, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on the screen. <br /> <br /> Nick likes Italian food (arguably indicating his ardent passion inside) and cooks to the sound of Puccini. Her appearance in Kate's kitchen in 22 Bleecker (the name of the restaurant) predictably shakes her feathers, but her strange ability to relate to her niece cooking pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room brings Kate around and despite some stumbling along it ends up giving him his valuable possession. No, it's not your honor. But her recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm being very unfair here, are not I? I mean Rom with Rom is, and we all know what we're leaving for when we sign up. But does it always have to be so tediously boring?
