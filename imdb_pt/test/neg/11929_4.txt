It's a bit disconcerting when a studio refuses to show a film to the press before it's released on a large scale. That many movies suck is not a surprise, but when the studio itself admits this in advance, the process of going to the movies becomes a kind of passion game. Consider an early Christmas present from Hollywood, so that "Aeon Flux" is not nearly the affront to the taste and decency one might expect, given the above. Although, at the end of the day, you are overwhelmed by your faults, at least you have (sort of) an idea to play with. Too bad that director Karyn Kusama seems to have little idea how to do it all. <br /> <br /> It's the future. There was a plague. There is a dictatorship and there are rebels. These latter are known as the Monkeys, and far from being a cult of beret worshipers or tennis rackets, they are in attempts to overthrow the first, called the Goodchild regime. The scheme is occasionally meant for citizens, which is more than Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) and his friends can stand. Through some kind of biochemical virtual reality technology, the Monicans are given orders from their beloved leader (Frances McDormand), a type of mystical priestess who seems to have been crushed with a carrot. It is up to Aeon to use some futuristic elatas to carry out the orders of the High Carrot, which are, of course, some version of "destroying the regime". Having seen her sister get paid by the Goodchilds years ago, she needs little persuasion. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder things get complicated. Goodchilds may not be exactly what they seem, and Aeon itself may have an unexpected story with them. Although occasionally confusing, the central concept of the film (of which I will not disclose further) contains some precise notions about the nature of human existence and survival. There is room for much more exams than the film does, but ideas are there at least. The great problems of "Aeon Flux" are technical. Kusama has taken the bewildering decision to film almost all the action so close that we can rarely keep up with what is happening. To make matters worse, it is edited in a barrage of cuts that leave us completely lost. The result is a serious spatial disorientation that takes over the film. The aesthetic of "Aeon Flux" is of fine dress, strangely angular architecture and agile characters. Much of the action takes place in minimalist and open spaces that implore for some long uninterrupted plans that can convey grace and athleticism implicit in the above items. Instead, we split the seconds into flying members, breaking glass and accompanying sound effects. <br /> <br /> There is a very good movie trying to get out of the swamp of "Aeon Flux". Put these things in the hands of the Wachowski brothers, say, and the results could be quite different. As it is though, I felt that "Aeon Flux" was pushing me away from a movie that I wanted to enjoy. This film is not tied to its own strength. As a rookie poker player has given a royal flush, somehow he finds a way to lose despite his potential.
