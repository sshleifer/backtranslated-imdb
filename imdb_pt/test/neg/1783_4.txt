I thought it would be a fun comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there's no sexual content, but for being a "fun comedy," I just remember having laughed three times during the episode "The Green Butchers." Hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just a sick humor, in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I should have gotten out of this movie and I'm kicking myself because I did not. In fact, I should not have seen this movie in the first place. The only good thing that came out of this movie was the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally made up and put their ugly past behind. I advise anyone well intentioned to avoid this gross film.
