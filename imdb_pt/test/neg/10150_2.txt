So one day I was in the store looking for a movie. I came across this and rented it because it was a movie I had not seen or heard of. <br /> <br /> Now I like horror movies in general, but that sucks, not good for laughs. In addition to being ultra ultra cheap and containing all the clich√©s of horror movies and a terrible acting, it has the most incompetent and inept direction I have ever encountered. Now sometimes the above mentioned traits may be present in a movie and can still be enjoyed with some pleasure, but not here. Painful example of homemade horror.
