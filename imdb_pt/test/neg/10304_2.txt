Fox is very bad. They cancel the wrong shows. It is bizarre that they cancel a well-written program like "Arrested Development" and still keep this program and "War at Home". I feel that Fox loved that they broke barriers with the then "Married with Children" but now it's getting ridiculous. "The Loop" is a nonsensical, boring clock, and its jittery jokes simply fall apart. For nervous comedy to work, you have to keep the jokes coming. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a steady stream of jokes. Fox needs to pull his head out of his rectal cavities and stop letting his relatives write this mediocre snitch. I mean, if you're going to invest money to do something fun, make it fun. Also, stop using "unnamed" actors. It's great to have beginners, but you need to anchor a show with a celebrity celebrity. Duh, Fox.
