This movie has it all: it's a thriller, a chase movie, a romance story, a tale of crowds, a comedy, a road movie ... well, actually nothing like that. <br /> <br /> All the time you're waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you're still watching the same monotonous, uninspired and shallow clich√© of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. Even the performance of leading actors lacks credibility. A gunslinger with his quirks, a girl who's playing hard to get, mafia guys who act like tough and incompetent cops, yawn ... <br /> <br /> I would recommend not watching Backtrack. If you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, go and see 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada' by Tommy Lee Jones. Now, that's what I call worth watching.
