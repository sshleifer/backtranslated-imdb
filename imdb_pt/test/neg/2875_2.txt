I really like Salman Kahn, so I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. It did not have much plot and what they had was not so attractive. Salman however looked good on the film looked young and refreshed, but it was well worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad, it was very good. Usually Indian movies have at least two to three hours in length, but this was a very short movie for an Indian movie. The American actress who starred in the film is from the series Heroes, Ali Larter. His performance had much to be desired. However, she looked good in the Indian dresses she wore. The whole movie did not have much to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better in his next film. Thank you.
