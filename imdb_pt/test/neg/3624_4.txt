This was another one of those shows I watched to eradicate the positive elements, and because I've been a Nick fan for years. Some of these would be the scenarios, the B plots, guest stars and some of the main actors who were good. I became interested in the high school show as I quickly grew to despise Jamie Spears, along with the other girls on the show who can not perform. The only characters they seemed to enjoy were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael and Logan. Quinn is a perfect outcast who eventually started to fit in; Stacey is a complete eccentric; Dustin is put into a lot of strange and random situations; and Michael is a kind of man of logan comic dexterity. There is a noticeable difference between the quality of performance and acting out of the B-plots that surround them, and the A-plots that show a lot of screaming girls and an iconic "Miss Perfect", repeating bad, obsessed lines by you. This show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the plots, but the main plots simply did not deliver anything. When he came back recently in reruns, and I tried to watch him again, I was more insensitive about the girls' abysmal performance and had to change channels. However, I will give credit to the characters listed earlier because they made the show worth more or less of my time.
