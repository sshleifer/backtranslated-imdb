I lost 35 minutes of my life in this turkey before giving up. The main character is completely ignorant and astonishingly unfriendly, but there is humor in his mistake. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the writer pulls the old stuntman "there's only one room in the hotel, you'll have to share a room with a pretty girl." Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a little first. Watch "It Happened One Night" to see how to do it right - or any of the thousands of movies ever since. <br /> <br /> The acting is consistently third-rate, and the impromptu dialogue should have been left on the court floor floor. She snakes without any plan, despite the fact that the film wires the fate of the relationship from the moment Greta is introduced. <br /> <br /> The first song in the meeting room is slightly funny, but poorly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be fair, I only heard those in the first half hour) are just useless and horrible. Most singers are painfully out of tune, but not intentionally humorous.
