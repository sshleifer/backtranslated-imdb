Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what I'm about to say about it made for the TV movie. But, I paid money for the movie and discovered that this movie is a disaster. The direction is very bad. But after researching your information here, I realized that there could be reasons for the poor quality of driving and producing. Maybe they did not have a budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility also had little money, but it turned out to be a success. The director of this film did a very poor job of telling the story and the film could not even maintain a rational continuity in itself. He keeps pulling me out of the scenes. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the plot / frame. The dubbed sound is also very bad. My God .... Normally, I would appreciate every movie because behind it are ideas and imaginations of an individual. but this time I'm just crazy: "I really want to hit something HARD." ... Just do not do the work if someone can not satisfy you to the fullest. Bad arts (it's not art, what is it?) They really hurt people.
