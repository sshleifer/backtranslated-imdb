The movie Soultaker is essentially an old Final Destination form in which several teenagers destroy their souls separated from their bodies and must deceive the death that chases them ... The film has its moments, and its concepts, being the idea of ​​disoriented souls separated from their bodies is a pretty cool idea ... If this movie was remade with some good actors / actresses and some awesome special effects, it can be extremely incredible ... As for the movie, I recommend watching the movie MST3K Version, the pure version may be too boring to sit down, unless you love bad movies staring at Martin Sheen's brother ...
