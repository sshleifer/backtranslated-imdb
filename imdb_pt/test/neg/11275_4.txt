With some movies, it's really hard to tell who they were made into. Huevos de Oro seems to target the well-educated Spanish middle class. There must be many inner jokes in this movie that you will not understand if you are a stranger. This can be very annoying. <br /> <br /> Symbols and references to art and popular culture are plentiful, the film alludes to the work of Salvador Dalí, Luis Buñuel and the surrealists in general, a certain passion for bidet bathing seems to point to the mades ready from Duchamp. In addition, the main character also has a special talent for karaoke tapes with songs by Julio Iglesias. But why all this is mixed in a pretty way, but also free, simply escapes me. I can only imagine that it all serves to highlight the vital, impetuous and coarse vulgarity of the main character the director seems to admire and despise at the same time. As all really beautiful women run after him (the main character, I mean) is a bit disconcerting. <br /> <br /> The movie has three parts. It begins in the Spanish enclave of Melilla, in Africa, where Benito, the main character, does his military service, apparently in the corps of engineers. He then heads to the resort town of Benidorm in Spanin where Benito wants to build the tallest skyscraper in the place and become a vulgar Howard Roark. For the latter part, a defeated Benito moves to Miami, Florida, presumably to begin a "new life". But the change of places is not really explained satisfactorily. It is also somewhat annoying that there is no character development and that the film enters into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic. It must be said that Javier Bardem acquitted himself very well by playing the young stallion that gets soft and deflated. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie because I'm interested in And Benidorm is a kind of special place, town, in that aspect Gold eggs satisfies me only partially. In Jess Franco's She Killed In Ecstasy (1970) , this particular location was used in a more rewarding way.
