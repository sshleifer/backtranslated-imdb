To sum up this movie, it's LaBute taking his sadism to the realm of comic farce. The predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes, insisting on surrounding them with violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continued efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight, but then apologize for this with weak gestures to the PC. Basically the film just does not work, its plot is more than planned, the characters are one-dimensional cliches, there is no consistency or development of anything, and comedy (where it's not totally out of place) is the worst kind of movie. Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters who look like parodies of studio-oriented audiences - no matter what, make them pleasant, neutral (and castrated), and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is here just long enough to convince him that he no longer belongs to the movies. Chris Rock, in fact, has negative chemistry with fellow killer Freeman - it's like they're acting in different rooms, even when they're two inches away from each other. In fact, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least he's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> The 15 minutes of LaBute may be ready now. It already seems that he is overestimated with his welcome.
