As a new convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which led me to watch every episode of the season, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie offering a slice of medium Joe's I need reasons to interest me, to care, to feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin in charge I also expected a lot of bright comedic moments. This movie was missing me over and over again. <br /> <br /> Jeff lives with his mother, fat sad sack that is a social disaster. He has not had a relationship, real or even casual, for many years. He seems to be mostly unemployed and, as noted, shacks with his beloved mother. Can things get worse? Right. In a short time he is fired by everyone around him, including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. Everything reinforces your 'loser' status. Silverman's "fat" experiment was as cruel as absurd. His obsession with the role of "Marty", as the lifeline of his career, also reaches a great dead end. <br /> <br /> While the final moments of the film offer a glimpse of better things to come, the film journey, though with occasional golden glimpses, was sadly lacking.
