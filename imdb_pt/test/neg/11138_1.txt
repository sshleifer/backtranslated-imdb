I think rubbish really sucks. I watched a few weeks ago and I have not seen that kind of c ** p in the movies since Female Trouble by John Waters and that was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; really stank, it was so bad it made me want to leave the theater and ask for my money back. But, actually, I'm glad I saw it, because then I could tell my honest opinion about it. You should see this movie, even if it stinks.
