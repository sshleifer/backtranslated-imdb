Okay, last night I saw the world premiere of Paul Schrader's The Exorcist: The Beginning at the Brussels International Fantasy Film Festival. With all the commotion surrounding the film was highly anticipated. <br /> <br /> The director was there and so were most of the stars (except Skarsgard). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film was a big surprise. It was a real disappointment for me because I'm a big fan of the original 1973 film by Shrader and Friedkin (RIP). <br /> <br /> What was wrong with that? Most of it, actually. The FX (you would think that the digital revolution of Matrix and LOTR never happened: it was so rendered!), Editing (without rhythm or real rhythm), acting (only Skarsgard sometimes managed to convince). The screenplay was created by IMO to explain the African scenes in the original film. So the film had the feeling of creating a scene, but nothing contributed. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, although I saw him better (Apocalyps Now). <BR> <br /> All the time I was thinking this was just a rough cut, a work in progress. And that, given the (well-known) circumstances, is probably what it is. But that does not change the obvious problems with the script. I had a chance to meet Schrader (very briefly), but I did not dare tell him what I thought of the movie and I was so nervous (this is the guy who wrote Taxi Driver by cause of Christ !!) I forgot to ask him to sign my copy of the script Taxi Driver ...
