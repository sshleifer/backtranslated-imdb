If I could have given this movie 0/10 I would, and this is the first movie I wanted to rate so low. It's worse than horrible. If I went to see the movies, I would like the movies to pay me for watching (at least the minimum wage). Some camera photos were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish, for example. villain reflex in a mirror that separates the head and shoulders from the side of his body (see is believe). Several totally useless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud because of the actions of the victims / facial expressions when they were shot. I only watched until the end (fast forward about 10 minutes of boring meaningless dialogue) hoping to see Seagal in a decent hand-to-hand combat, but there was almost none of it (you should know that when in the beginning he threw someone down an elevator and was shown in slow motion with music - end of the 'action' scene). In one scene, we see Seagal's hand cutting someone's neck in slow motion, which makes it obvious that his hand never made contact. The main villain keeps coming back to life. He is shot in the chest on two different occasions. The 1st time is with a shotgun that expels him from the 2nd / 3rd floor to the street. In short, this movie is a total waste of time and a total joke. It seems very low budget (even for Seagal). The color is opaque and gray. I could continue ... just like this movie, but I will not. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep.
