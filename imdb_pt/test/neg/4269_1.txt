That horrible action? science fiction movie sucks. I just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story makes no sense, there are many shortcomings in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown cast is horrible, the lead actor seems to be too old for his role. I was induced to buy this VHS, which has a magnificent cover, and I see this crap due to the illogical rating of the IMDb user and some criticism of "ten stars". I have just checked the authors, and each of them has only a brief review (of "L.I.N.X.") published in IMDb, and nothing more. Why are they promoting this garbage? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
