Bad and bad movie. When I saw the synopsis, I expected something like Ring with just video games instead of tape. None of this happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie, but that's not it. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the person from real life, the Countess Bathory, is a stupid move that adds nothing to the story. . Anyone, even vaguely familiar with their story, would begin to wonder why and how this Hungarian nobleman ended up in this film. Choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> So there is a whole concept of you dying in real life how to die in the game. Like I said before interesting, Ring-like story. But rather than developing it into a good story, it simply flows without any explanation given why that game became such, why it was created, and so on. Waste of good idea. <br /> <br /> And finally, this movie does not even have snippets of funny parts that can, if not save, make at least bad horror movies. The death scenes are very fast and the acting is a lot of wood to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid if possible.
