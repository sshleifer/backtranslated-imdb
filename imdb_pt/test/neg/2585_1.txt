Well, of course everyone has the right to have an opinion on one thing ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, the year 1968, student demonstrations, general strike, youth, ideals, love, etc. Sorry, but I did not feel the love, romance. A lover who is well that his girlfriend sleeps, no matter who? This is Love ? But not only that, the movie is too long and for no reason, I had to stop watching the movie several times because I simply lost interest. I hoped something would happen, but ....... NOTHING. The only thing I was impressed during the film: Gypsy violinist playing in the streets, yes, that was cool. I do not think art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Big disappointment and waste of time!
