This movie is a great movie only if you need something to sit and laugh at its stupidity. As a geologist, this film leaves most of the important facts wrong and uses actors who are too young to be considered at the top of their fields. It is interesting as lava lava shows in huge caves below the surface of the Earth. It's also funny how seismically active areas are shown to have massive destruction from a 6.5 magnitude earthquake. They seem to forget that construction patterns in these areas would be higher, needing a larger earthquake to do so much damage. It's also funny how much they make the coastline of Washington State and also Oregon to look like they are beautiful beaches of Southern California. The analogy of the jelly donut is a lot of fun, even if the way it is used is wrong. The director does a good job of adding more comic relief to the 2 "doctors" supported.
