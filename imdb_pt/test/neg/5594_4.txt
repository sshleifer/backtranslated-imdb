First of all, the first thing that came to my mind after I finished this movie last night was "Why the title of 8MM 2?", Because I saw the first one obviously, and what this has to do with the plot of the first movie? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to go to the porn industry and this was not even necessary in the plot because after you see the end I will not ruin it, it just did not make any sense. > <br /> A diplomat and his fiancee are in Hungary and realize that a woman who is swimming naked in the pool area is very attractive, so when they see her in a club they decide to have some fun. and have a smoking trio. But things get extremely intense when the diplomat receives photos of everyone taking the case, fearing that this may come to the public and jeopardize his career, pay the guy who sent the photos, the diplomat goes crazy and "kills" the guy, leading to a case of murder. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl they had the affair with, but things get deeper and deeper as they dig deeper into what they got into. <br /> <br /> What could have been a good thriller in an unexplained movie and not very well thought out, which was sad. Like I said, the title really has nothing to do with the first one, so do not fall in love with it. It's just a sexual thriller that does not make sense, but it's only good for those nights, because, frankly, this is one of those movies where it's so close to pornography that it can also be labeled a soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
