Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each focusing on a female personal device that became popular for a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the second half of 1998, instead of the initial episodes that were all directed by women). From the opening statistics that make Rabbit Fever look like a soft porn movie, we are treated to a sea of ​​predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world uncontrolled with women's addiction to solitary pleasure. <br /> <br /> Men, as Germaine Greer arrogantly explains, invented a device for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. The Rabbit Vibrator (which some statistics suggest represents about a quarter of all sales of vibrators) is so named because of the small long ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while the rotating beads within the shaft stimulate the interior of the vagina. The film interviews characters who watch Rabbits Anonymous to help overcome their 'addiction', as well as people known as Tom Conti passing by a teacher or Richard Branson (amid scenes of rabbits being banned from airplanes) saying that he would like to provide free rabbits for first class air travel passengers and finally for all of them. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of cinema, the sketches do not have the writing skills to tell a Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais to make them funny enough and while this can make late-night TV, it does not have a hook to get people to queue in public in multiplexes to watch masturbation jokes. Lines like: "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how are you coping?" rather thin wear after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word "rabbit" will laugh. . . and another and another. The frenzied midnight drive to buy batteries can be fun in real life, but here they seem pretty busy, and the special emergency service is welcome. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the BBFC gave a certificate of 18 despite zero. violence, almost no explicit sex, and sexual references that are less "perverted" than any late-night comedy show. The company protested against the decision, but the BBFC did not move. At first glance, this seems like an exaggeration on their part, and consumer advice now simply says, "Contains strong and frequent sexual references." It might be thought that young people would consider jokes about masturbation to be more amusing than the most desperate parties of the bachelorette party and the subject that deserves to be debated; but Rabbit Fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably Ruocco's The Rabbit Song (which plays a band called Thumper in the movie). For those who dozed off and woke up to the final credits, there is a bonus scene at the end of them to ensure they have not missed anything.
