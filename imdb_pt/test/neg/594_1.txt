Do not waste your money or time. Terrible movie. Bad acting, plot all over the place. Really, really bad acting. Man, this movie is just plain bad. I hung up in 7 minutes. The script is bad, the direction is bad, it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their theater class. Yeah, it's so bad. The acting is not convincing, remember I only saw 7 minutes of it. How this movie came to the DVD is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Should have been left in the editing storage. I saw the cover and thought it was cool, I'm sure I will not do it next time: _)
