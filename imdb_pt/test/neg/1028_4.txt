I think only a select number of audience members really had an interest in seeing how a male prostitute in New York operates, but I would be willing to bet that even those brave souls were turned off by the annoying patchwork technique and deliberately stuffy display here; the fact that these inherent "defects" were a direct result of the experimental nature of the low budget film / underground / is, I would say, off the charts. Anyway, for those so inclined, the film features extensive male nudity and Joe Dallesandro, understandably, has become an underground? is gay ?? icon! <br /> <br /> The episodic structure that shows the protagonist's daily life offers some slightly interesting scenes: his encounter with (and eventually posing for) an eccentric elderly artist; the one in which Dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and outlines his particular modus operandi for a pair of prospective "colleagues," including perhaps the most unlikely of traffickers? a nerd with glasses! Perhaps, fortunately, the film lasted only 89 minutes against IMDb's claim that its total length is 105 (but the latter could be a mistake)! I had watched a few other Warhol 'movies' and this is not decidedly as satisfying as the most tolerable example I have ever seen, BAD (1977), and just a little better than the Goste of MY HUSTLER (1965), which were mainly a strain to sit on. The fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy does not bode well for anything but, as the saying goes, you have to do what you have to do and the other two 'chapters' had to follow in rapid succession. Despite my generally negative reaction to it, FLESH is still valuable as a time capsule of the 1960s and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era, both in the movies and in real life. For the record, a Dallesandro image of this film adorns the cover of The Smiths' 1984 debut album and the transvestite Candy Darling (which appears here without any surprise) was immortalized in "Candy Says," the opening track of The Velvet Underground. album of the same name of 1969. Although the last band is the favorite of all time, and one reason for this is that through their original and innovative music, they described a lifestyle so different from mine, this is really a case in which I instead experience something vocal rather than visually!
