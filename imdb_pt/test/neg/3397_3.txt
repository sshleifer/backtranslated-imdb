I read many reviews here about how this movie gets in the book. I do not think any of them have actually read. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and the monkeys were killers and hunters. We know differently now and this movie portrays Apes in a more modern view. I've never seen a Tarzan movie that comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with trustworthy talented and respected authors to tell the story. So if you've never read the book and enjoyed a good story about feelings and a cute rabbit vision of wild animals, maybe a good cry, watch the movie. I hope John Carter from Mars is more respected than Tarzan. We missed you, Edgar!
