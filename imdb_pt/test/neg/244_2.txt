Following the pleasantly atmospheric original and the fun second fool, this incredibly monotonous, slow and monotonous sequel appears as a major disappointment. Once again, the evil criminal responsible for Death (Hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewels from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The bat builds an awkward clumsy robot clumsy with a human brain to achieve this heinous goal. Directly directed by Rafael Portillo, with a taciturn and tedious script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, raw continuity (for example, Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but is miraculously alive and right here!), An excruciating slow script , an excessive amount of images from the first two films, a sinuous narrative, an incapacitating lack of action and momentum, largely melancholy going through the (not) acting movements of an understandably disinterested cast, and a badly staged climax battle between the mummy and the robot finally explodes into splitting the stupid life with the big party but unfortunately lasts only two minutes and therefore proves to be very little, too late to relieve the severity of the general boredom) that numbingly dry, drippy and dragging snorefest rates as a complete washout.
