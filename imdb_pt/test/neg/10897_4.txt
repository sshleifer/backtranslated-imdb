A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) become targets of a demented serial killer after stopping for a "comfort break" at a remote roadside stop. <br /> <br /> What could have been a frighteningly scary chiller in more competent hands, ends up being a messy and confused mess under the sloppy direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the screenplay). There is a good deal of juicy violence, a brief superficial knowledge of nudity and confident cast performances, but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that you can not help but feel disappointed. On the surface, the film unfolds as a standard, clich√©d, "killer-on-a-fly" movie, but Shiban (a former X-Files writer) casts some subtle supernatural elements that suggest that their goal was something more completely: a ghost story, with the rest stopping to function as the home of a vengeful specter to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> By reading the movie, checking the theories of the viewers here on IMDb, and watching the extras on the DVD, certain elements of the plot begin to make a little more sense (although, even with the advantage of information, there are still many unanswered questions). In my opinion, any movie that requires much research to become (only partially) understood is not particularly good.
