I was telling a friend of mine about the time when my grandfather really chose that horrible crap for us to see one night at the theater. He never chose another! It was so bad! Anyway, my friend told me that her father wrote some of that garbage. I thought she was joking. Turns out she was serious. She had never really seen it, and she said that she quickly cut short her father's writing career. I told her not to waste her time. But if she really collapsed and watched, she would see, in the first minute, why this ended her father's days as a writer. I mean, even for the 1980s, that crap is bad beyond description. I mean, Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why the hell two cops would mind a house full of ghosts? And the movie poster? A ghost with tongue out? What is it? Nothing about it makes any sense. Well, I told my friend that this crap not only ended her father's writing career, but ended the careers of everyone involved. Or at least none of them have completely recovered from being in this junk from a movie. Let's just say that I will always ridicule my friend for revealing me that his father was a writer for this movie! Only that should tell you how bad this is!
