Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The interior counts for something too. Many of the previous winners seemed semi-decent, but they are terribly cruel and create problems for other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in all seasons. About the only thing worth watching Top Model is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a competitor who was a preoperative transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine appearance. Tyra should have given her tips or maybe she could have sent Resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the competitor was met with harsh criticism and no enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons on DVD and Top Model has only 1 season on DVD. This is called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of renovation and a little more humanity.
