An excellent cast doing its best with a horrible script, inept direction and some of the worst notes I've ever heard. More TV movie of the week than serious drama. Which is sad when you consider that the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that instead of building drama and character, it was best just to show the most graphic and violent fragments and expect the audience to be shocked in sympathy and affection. In my opinion, one of the most blatant ways of adapting cut and paste films.
