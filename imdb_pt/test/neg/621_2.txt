Making a movie based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 Andean plane crash, is difficult even for the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this forgotten film and cheap exploitation neither try! The actual names of survivors and victims of the Uruguayan Air Force plane crash have been altered, the accident itself is obviously staged in a very slippery way, and the aspect of cannibalism has been unnecessarily and morosely practiced. Shockingly, he made a ton of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, he thought, luckily he was forgotten. But the same people behind it would give us the equally revolting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED! <br /> This cheap film of horror exploration required the production of ALIVE some fifteen years later. This movie was a masterpiece. To say the least, it is not.
