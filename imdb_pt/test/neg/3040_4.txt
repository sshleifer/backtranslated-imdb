Simon West's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring the old school's emotions to a contemporary audience. Starring the talented teenage Camilla Belle, when a Stanger Calls can not even provoke a face shocked or even surprised. The weak attempts to scare the audience range from blurred coats that look like people to build strained music for a cat to come out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenager who has to pay an account to her father through a nanny. She is invited to work overnight at a house by the river, and finds it a perfectly easy way to make money. But she hardly knows, a stranger lurks in the house and constantly assaults Johnson on the phone. A pathetic excuse for a movie.
