This movie deviated from the Bible and fell so far below the bar of the 1956 film. I hate that they replaced the 2006 film with the 10 traditionally seen commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not as the charming man Charstonston Heston in the 1956 film. I will not waste my time again watching this movie. They strove so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep it on the limit that it was more like a soap opera (not a good one at all). I am sure that the younger ones who have never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but with each of them. In addition, it took 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, it probably took 2 months to do this. The special effects were not as surprising as the first and after all those years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
