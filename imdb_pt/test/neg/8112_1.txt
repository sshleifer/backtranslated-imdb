The first word I can find to describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First of all is the plot a very fine plot (will not comment more on this part) and a plot that a lot of movies of this genre is following. This makes the movie so bad because you know what will happen. Secondly, the film contains many questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and this is not spoiler) is: what the heck are the kids doing in that CORN !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the actors who are sorry. They are bad as they can be. <br /> <br /> The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it is a horror movie. You should be scared of the killings or sudden shocks, but you're not afraid, you're not horrified because you know what's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The movie is as bad as the movie. about the killer ants! I hoped it was a very good movie, but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises many issues and, not to be scary, the film is better than ever seen.
