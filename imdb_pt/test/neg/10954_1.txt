This movie confused me. I could not control myself. I thought there might be something missing. Glad to see that most of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent review of RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> Exposing the flaws of this movie would be a glorious waste of time, then I will. They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? Not? I did not understand ??? When I got the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COOL! That was how it was presented. I have not seen it yet. I hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> They DID NOT! They tried to create an iconic character that would generate a series. They did not. <br /> <br /> They tried to make an Australian indie zombie movie in the caliber (and perhaps riding the coat tails) of the very well done "UNDEAD". They did not. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing and disjointed salad of film that could be edited into something watchable. They did not! This is the new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies. There are really only the two so far, "DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM" being the first (not to be confused with "DAY OF THE DEAD" which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time). If you're going to make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie filmmaker, I'm just a connoisseur), make a good movie. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of recent decent zombie filmaking. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you're really forgiving, you might think, well, did not they at least throw something to make us feel like we did not want our money back? Guess what ... THEY DID NOT!
