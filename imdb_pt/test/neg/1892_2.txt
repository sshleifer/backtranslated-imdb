I'm not picky about movies, oh I saw so much crap I could watch anything. Maybe that was the reason I watched this one to the end. I'm a big fan of RPG games too, but this movie is a disgrace to any worthy RPGer. Shooting the security camera of a game would make it appear more realistic than this movie does. The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong. In some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when !!!!! (spoilers ahead) !!!!! People running around do not disturb people sitting around computers. I mean, would you continue your work if you had ninjas around you? Oh, and the jokes about pirates, that's the worst of the movies !!!!! (spoilers end) !!!!! At least the first one looked like a documentary, now it looks like someone's homemade video experiment. You can find better movies on youtube. Top line: Do not waste your time and money on it, it's as bad as it sounds.
