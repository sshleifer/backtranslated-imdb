I only watched Icon on DVD and despite being a great book, the movie is a weak substrate of it. Those responsible for writing should be banished to Siberia. Why they mourn the great story with all sorts of sub-movies from C-movies that are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond me. <br /> <br /> However, the filmmakers and cast do best to do something with this, but in the end, the film was not satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Can someone please make a decent movie to show how this is done. I'm sure the crowds will gather for such an original novel turned into a book, not a cheap movie.
