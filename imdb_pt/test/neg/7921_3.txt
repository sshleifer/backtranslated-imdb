All Dogs to Heaven was a quirky and funny movie; With a good talented name, the voices lent an adult familiarity to a basic cartoon for children. It was interesting enough to be enjoyable to adults, plus something good for the kids to watch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is a worthless sequel, trying to get some money out of the first. Charlie Sheen is an acceptable replacement for Burt Reynolds in this second film and Sheena Easton's voice in some of the films, but forgettable songs make her a worthy choice as a co-star for this. Add Dom DeLuise's first movie and you would think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first. Unfortunately, even with the addition of other good voice actors like Bebe Neuwirth in Anabelle's horrible role, this film can not be saved from the atrocious production values ​​and animation skills (or lack thereof) present throughout this movie. Horrible editing, voice syncing, and flat spaces where the characters' mouths should be moving to dial, but do not combine to make this movie look like an animation project for college interns, instead of the decent sequel it might have been. <br /> All in all I would say unless you were a big fan of the first movie I would give a very big PASS.
