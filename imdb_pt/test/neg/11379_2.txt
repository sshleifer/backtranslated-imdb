I just got off when the film started (because I saw Juliette Lewis's name on screen). The script looked very complicated first, but as the film continued, it became understandably clear. I focused on it well, but the result was disappointing. o The sex object used too much in the movie unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignore those who have a tendency towards the opposite sex. In my opinion, the well-prepared script could not be incorporated. As we look at the cast, the film promises something in the beginning or I just waited too long ... and finally the end ... the end is so mediocre that I would not expect it. the main character Cassandra wants to get the message about having a baby and how a baby can change a life, in my opinion the scene is the real disaster for the movie. all in all the characters are funny and acted beautifully.but only cast can not save a movie.
