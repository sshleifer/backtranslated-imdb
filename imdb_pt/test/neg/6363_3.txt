I particularly did not like Sliding Doors or Twice On a Yesterday, so I certainly did not use that poor second-rate excuse for those movies. An idea that was made to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is of poor quality and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity simply to earn a R note and certain scenes that simply do not were needed, but I was there to push the limits (I do not really need to see a child urinate or struggle with a diaphragm. Especially when they have absolutely no connection or use in the movie). <br /> <br /> The acting was also very bad, the only actor I found the least satisfactory was his daughter; the rest was two-dimensional and quite unbelievable. The people I watched this left the room in the middle of the road; I was able to finish it, but not without moving quickly on part of it. <br /> <br /> General: Nothing new here, it's a generic and boring movie. The few funniest moments are overcome by fools or stupid. That would be monotonous, even if it had not been done before. If it were not so, I would rate a five, but even for an Indie film, it was missing a lot, and as a repeat, it also loses in originality: 3/10.
