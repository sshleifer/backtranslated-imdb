I really do not care about the creative ideas embedded in these films, but seriously. There is not a consistent part of the game in this movie. That seems to be the trend, buying the rights and then making a movie that has nothing to do with what the fans want. This carnage is almost fun because you know you're hiding behind a lack of skill and control of money (not yours) that allows you to do that. Play a game, or hire someone for, and please make a real movie, or stay in the boxing ring and have your butt delivered to you as you so will not happen. <br /> <br /> Wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. had to add blah to bother you, sorry
