My wife and kids were advertised as the very own Cosby show- but unlike the latter, it was bland and unwatchable. In fact, it's so poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around mickey mickey taking stupidity of Michael Jr and the fact that he's a loser, who got increasingly boring and annoying as the show continued. <br /> <What should have been a promising success eventually turned into a silly and silly show later, where ideas became so ridiculous and ridiculous. And as for the second Claire, I did not like this character very much: she became a spoiled and childish teenage brat in most of the later episodes. MWAK was not the trendsetter of Cosby, instead it was just a poor black sitcom by the general standards.
