Dude, this thing bites! I'm sorry, I already sat and watched! Friedkin was insane for making a movie trying to win the sympathy of the viewers for this lunatic. If it were up to me, I would have made the public hate that low life rather than keep their eyes clouded over it! He killed people! Very grizzly I could add too! And Friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's "not right"! I say Friedkin can forget that! I hate the guy this movie is partly based and hope they made it wise and give your butt excuse the juice !!! In a nutshell, do not waste your time! It is sick and perverse!
