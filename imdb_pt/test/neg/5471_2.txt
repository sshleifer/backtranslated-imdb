How can you go wrong with a movie that mixes Peter Cushing's sophistication, Donald Pleasence's determination, and Luan Peters's bust? Easy, you give them a terrible script to work on. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing, in an evil role, leads a satanic cult that has conquered some friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined but distant priest who wants to locate his friends, but needs help from Scooby-Doo Fred to locate them. He summons the aid of a New York hunting dog, who dresses up as the cartoon hero in his task. Meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing persons, Luan Peters, joins the quest. If all this sounds interesting, then you, like me, have been deceived. <br /> <br /> It does not take long for the trio to sniff out the bad guys, but their methods of taking bad guys to justice are foolish. Besides, women will find that crap. Every time they enter the bandits' trail, our two male heroes tell Luan to stay at the hotel, even if she can deal better with her than the touchy father played by Pleasence. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: $ (The script really disappoints us No tension is built No valuable dialogue is given to the stars And you will need both hands to count the number of times Luan Peters is told to stay behind and let the men make the men work If you are interested in seeing a minotaur in the movie do not bother. We have a statue of a minotaur who spits flames. VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and some sacrifices, but those of you who drool to gore will be disappointing.) ACTING: $$ (Even though there are three of my favorite actors in this movie, there is nothing redeemable here.) Peter Cushing does not have much time on the screen, Donald Pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and Luan Peters is misused. This should have been much better given the talent involved, but again, Ya nkees lose a game here and there too . <br /> <br /> NUDDADE: $ (Luan Peters take bath, but you do not see almost anything. She's not as gentle here as she was on The Flesh and Blood Show.)
