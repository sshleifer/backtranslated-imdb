OK, let's start with the good: nice landscape, Channing Tatum is easy to see, Amanda Seyfried has beautiful hair, that's about it. How much of this movie was on the floor of the editing room? Probably the plot, action, good dialogue and point. Terrible acting, horrible agitated dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who always cries in the movies came to the part that should evoke tears, and she laughed so hard that we thought she was crying! The film seems to want to tackle many issues - war, loss, autism, cancer, but fails so miserably to cover any subject satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to chew on and your cell phone to return text messages!
