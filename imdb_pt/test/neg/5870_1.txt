It's often hard to decide which is the best movie you've ever seen, as that can vary by genre, actor / actress preferences or even the mood you're in on a given day! That said, this movie is by far, in my opinion, the worst movie I've ever seen !! I thought the acting was terrible (were there any?), The plot was just stupid, and the props were totally fake. Could a lower budget output be created without being an amateur production? I think not. Even the friends who watched the movie agreed it was the worst video we've ever rented, and even today we're still joking about the night we watched this movie.
