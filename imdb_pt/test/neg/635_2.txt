Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of shock, shock, feather and, yes, sheer terror. To think that the actors who did a good job in the past should come up with something like that. The horror, the horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if this sounds familiar. A specially built train for a political campaign is en route to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a Texas senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah, a meteor burns a car waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement is called. Oh, can it be? The senator has a lovely young man (Amy Locane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who happened to be married to one of the police officers who answered the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVERY, LA BAMBA) is the ex -husband. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the eeeeevil aliens were able to lodge on the train. <br /> <br /> The train departs. Lou gets his friend to fly a helicopter so that Lou can fall on the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so he can save the day. As a friend's reward, he hits the helicopter on the mountain. <br /> <br /> Which is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The cop hero's helper must die, we all know that. But he must die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives. <br /> <br /> Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so he can channel Bruce Willis into DIE HARD wearing a women's t-shirt. Yes, Lou is 46, but he walks into the gym. The part he's playing is not worth worrying about, but he's in good shape. <br /> <br /> The Senator is going to have an enchanted afternoon with Miss. Utah, but aliens will intercede and he and the woman are young enough to be their granddaughter to pay the final price. <br /> <br /> Soon we will have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course the train gets out of control and accelerates to meet destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT) STEPS) try to save as many lives you can <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise throughout the film. Earlier in the story, a couple raised wine glasses for their thirty-fifth birthday, hoping to spend another thirty-five years together. The guy is beaten, but he and you live. Maybe writers just lost track of them. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you would love to be a fly on the wall. Those actors who did a better job (and, in fact, deserve much more than that) are probably happy about the work. Did they really think they were working on something that was worth it or were they crying (and / or drinking) to sleep at night? At the end of the story, the survivors (quite numerous, all considered) gather in the last car of the train, which is untied. The other cars pass over a cliff, but the one containing the protagonists stops a few inches off the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I would have thought that the first thing they would do was to get off the train so they had solid ground under their feet, but I digress. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out the window and sees a Star shooting. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will open and crawling hand puppets with large teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has come to a point that we see the words "The Sci-Fi Channel Presents" in an "original" movie tells us that we will be happy to have Ti-Vo so we can move forward in the next two hours . Or better yet, just go ahead and delete it two minutes after the story and spend that time wiser.
