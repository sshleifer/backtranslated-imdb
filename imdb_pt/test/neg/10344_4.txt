Corben Bernsen directed a horror film about a chemical weapon being thrown at a sporting event and turning them all into insane monsters. We watch how a radio station's staff reports. <br /> <br /> She has moments, but most plays like a horror movie of life with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just do not work. In fact, the ideas of the film are best treated in a movie called Pontypool, which practically works all the time and creates tension by not showing us anything. It shows us things and it seems cheap. Given the choice, I would see Pontypool again instead of watching this movie again.
