How could a movie deal with Mexican illegal immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border being dull? Well, "Border Incident" is. <br /> <br /> No wonder George Murphy's career has ended not long after this terrible movie was released. The policy was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies horribly in this slow-paced movie. The film stereotyped the typical Mexican migrant farm worker as dumb and terribly boring. <br /> <br /> The film only takes on intensity when the identities of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban were discovered as federal agents for the US and Mexico, respectively. <br /> <br /> Disappointing, at best, we see similar problems in our own society today.
