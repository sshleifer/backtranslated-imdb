Not since "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" and "How High" previews <br /> <br /> I laughed so little at something that the filmmakers thought it would be hysterical. Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as 4-F by the army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army of about half a dozen. He then poses as a Nazi commander in Italy, and eventually attempts to kill Hitler. This is the description of the fragile plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is as funny as a heart attack. This movie makes "Heroes of Hogan" look like Shakespeare. If the men of "The Producers" money really wanted to lose their money, they should have shown this movie. I can not emphasize how bad this thing is. <br /> <br /> Lewis's direction consists of two different cameras that record the action from two different angles and are then edited together. This kind of sitcom direction works on television, but here's an obvious attempt to fool the audience. He ends most of his scenes with a shot, as if giving the viewer the chance to double in points before going to the next set up. I spent most of the film folded in abdominal agony, accompanied by severe flatulence, because of that. Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makes no attempt to wear period clothing or sets. Everyone uses the latest style and has the latest interior design ... for 1970. The support cast is lost when Lewis explodes on his patented tangents, <br/> <br/> <br /> > that last as long as the major surgery and are so painful to watch. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the movie screaming at the top of his lungs in a performance so hateful as to ruin any goodwill you try to bring <br /> <br /> at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The last embarrassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to put one on the Japanese. They use cow teeth, squeeze their eyes and speak with a "funny" accent. It may be one of the most egregious racist occurrences since the concentration camps. I was jaw-dropping because of what Lewis did with this whole thing, but that put me to the limit. Pay attention to the very bland scene of Kaye Ballard, where she tries to commit suicide several times. George Takei, of "Star Trek", has two small scenes, so wisely <br /> out of the picture. That has less laughter than the last three Mel Brooks films put together. There is nothing more sad than watching a previously respected comedian ruin a project so horribly, you really feel embarrassed by them. Jim Carrey learned this from "The Majestic", but Jerry Lewis still appears on television once in a while while pulling the same bland. I'm sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which way forward?" it's cheap, bland, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone involved, and for anyone who has to endure it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. <br /> Although rated (G), this contains some physical violence, some weapon <br /> <br /> violence and some adult situations. If your child shows interest in seeing this, consult professional help. <br /> <br />
