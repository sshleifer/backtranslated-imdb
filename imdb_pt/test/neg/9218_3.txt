One should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament who have read the other two, or at least know a little more about them than miracles and Judgment Day. This film contains absolutely nothing relevant to viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy - there is only standard British social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in bars. <br /> <br /> In fact, good candidates for a true Third Testament have been published several times - such as "A Course in Miracles" or "Conversations with God." They all have new twists and angles instigating Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in the IMDb rating is not the number of stars, but how many people took the trouble to vote. In four years, only 387 people took the trouble to vote for this film. As usual, enthusiasts are the most anxious. For comparison, take a look at "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - 1973 original version.
