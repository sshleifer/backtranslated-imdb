This movie was recently televised by Turner Classic Movies. It may have been considered cheeky in its time, and may have made money, but even the most stubborn Jane Russell fan will find it difficult to stay here. <br /> <br /> There are many movie musicals of all time. the 1950s that can withstand the test of time even if dated by current standards but that can still be enjoyed because of good music or dance or a fun storyline. "The French Line", however, fails in all these respects. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that Russell was an excellent singer when she received a bad vocal material. The whole cast is drawn by a storyline and boring and banal dialogue. <br /> <br /> Neither is it worth recording and jumping just for the musical numbers - they are bad.
