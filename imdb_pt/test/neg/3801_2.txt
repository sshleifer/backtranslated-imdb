Sequels, well, there are many reasons to do them, but what has gone through the mind of Irwin Allen to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters. There are so many open replies to this movie that is ridiculous ... like The Poseidon who is a monster ship with passengers is drifting in the sea and only Michael Caine with his miniboat and an evil Telly Savalas discovers the boat ... Well, at the beginning the French sailors are flying over the wreckage with their helicopter, but as a sinking ship is an everyday thing, they simply fly away ... What am I trying to say? Hmmm, Michael Caine goes on board with Sally Field and he can take everything he sees (diamonds) if there was not a Telly Savalas looking for guns on the ship ... my God, why am I really losing my words here? It's ridiculous and knowing that both Field and Caine were involved makes you wonder what went through their heads while reading scripts ... Certainly not diamonds ...
