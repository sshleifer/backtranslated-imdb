The Adventures of Sebastian Cole is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier) who imagines himself a writer at some point given that he really strives for it. This film is presumably the years in which he receives his material for writing, the years of adventure, hence the title and the previous citation. In it, we experience the very typical stories of old age and the warnings of loves, drugs and sex ... changes. Yes, there is a little twist here that is very interesting, and it is that Sebastian's stepfather (Clark Gregg) makes a difficult decision to achieve a sex change that has a huge impact on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his step Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather and is very good in the part, very convincing without being exaggerated, that is a route that this film could have done with enough facility. . Luckily they did not. Adrien Grenier, who I only know from Entourage, is also very good on his part as Sebastian, and together he and Gregg have a great relationship on the screen. It is always very interesting to watch this relationship of boys as it develops and is genuinely painful at times. <br /> <br /> And that's the best this movie has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it some mediocre camera, directional and cinematographic work. Not bad, but it's far from good or memorable. The characters are also finely written, and it is clear from the outset how most bows will develop. The only really fascinating character is Clark Gregg's Hank / Henrietta. I've already said that Grenier did well acting-wise, but Sebastian's character is not just not engaging but is completely unpleasant. I do not honestly see why anyone in the audience would direct their character into anything he did. He mocks, cries, cheats, minds and has no other aspirations besides being a complete slacker. Would it be different if he were maybe a secondary character or comic relief, but have it as the main focus and be asked to take the character seriously? Come on. <br /> <br /> And I really do not keep you against this movie, but I just want to say ... choose a different song in all these movies, Hollywood! No more "Where Is My Mind" by the Pixies, we all know it's good music, stop using it in all other movies! <br /> <br /> I feel like I could keep ripping this movie out ever more. apart, but in all honesty I did not hate it. I really did not care about that, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The adventures of Sebastian Cole is not a bad or boring movie, nor is it very good or engaging. It is very uneven and the script could have used a bit of work. I think the purpose of the film is to be a kind of superficial look at the life of a writer before it appears, and it worked ... if that writer put pieces of fiction that I would not want to read.
