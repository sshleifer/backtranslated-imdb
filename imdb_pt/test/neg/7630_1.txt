I thought Sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" ending in film history, but of course I was wrong. I had no disappointments that this movie would be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. The worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can not believe it until it really happens.
