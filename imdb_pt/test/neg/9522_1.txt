I'm a bit scared of some of these criticisms praising A.K.A. They not only sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all sorts of insider information that you would surely find by reading the press book from cover to cover. Please do not tell me that the director is writing his own reviews, as this would be very sad to contemplate. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I'm one of those who hate the movie and were surprised by their lack of remorse. amateurism. Great idea, shame of execution. And it was very disconcerting to watch so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones, including the leader), all apparently thinking they were appearing in a series of very different films. <br /> <br /> I wish AKA had been audacious, innovative or simply interesting. Unfortunately, it was like watching an involuntary hysterical home video with artistic aspirations. A missed opportunity.
