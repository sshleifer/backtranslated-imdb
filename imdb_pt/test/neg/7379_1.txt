As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to stick my head in a bucket of caustic soda, pull my eyes out and jump off a cliff." It sums up my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort. Artless, self-indulgent, thoughtless and just plain bad. Bad beyond comprehension. What else can I say? If you have the misfortune to be in an area where this dumb junk is playing, please have soul mercy and avoid at all costs.
