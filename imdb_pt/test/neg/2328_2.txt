I had stifled high hopes for this David Lynch, whom I really like to film, but the very poor acting for everyone, but Naomi Watts was the first indication that this was a wasted effort. Some Twin Peaks characters are recycled in this movie, but it was not strange, it was not interesting (except for the Watts scenes topless) and the peculiarities were poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I'll probably give Lynch one more chance, but the hype around this movie does not work, especially for those fans who saw Eraserhead when it was released.
