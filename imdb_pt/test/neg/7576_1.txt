One of my co-workers recommended this, implying that it was one of the scariest movies she's ever watched. I checked in with my girlfriend and gave up after 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, I had a long talk with my co-worker (we're still friends!). <Br/> <br /> This film is as original as the last film starring Steven Seagal. Does not bring anything original to the table. The scary parts were made thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw, however, is the painfully slow pace of this movie. The periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialogues and many ... nothing .. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 molotov cocktails
