This movie could have been a lot better than it was if it was not a Disney movie. I thought the girl who was playing Shirley was fine, you could tell she was really trying to get the job done right. The teenager Shirley Temple was not right at all. I think they should have passed the last time in their infancy, the first hour should have been about the young Shirley, so the last minute should have been about the older Shirley. This was a boring movie, not a good story of Shirley Temple.
