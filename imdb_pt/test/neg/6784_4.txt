Visually beautiful with good music, this movie has a fairly banal TV quality. The romance between two characters, which encompasses a cultural and educational divide, is simply NOT plausible. Of course, from the beginning, we knew that our shrewd heroine would brighten up, conquer the locals and find true love, but that does not make it less regrettable that the film has to take long-awaited shifts. This film had many promises, which makes it a pity that the promise has not been fulfilled. Maybe a good under the blanket on a cold night freebie on the cable, but I certainly would not recommend rent paid or purchase. I'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.
