Boasting some really cool special effects from Rick Baker and Deran Serafian in a small role, this really bad Italian film deserves some recognition. Cerchi gets some credit for continuing to make bloody movies, while most other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) have switched to discreet TV movies. As for plankton, it's half Piranha - half The Thing, with people turning into monsters, raping women and causing general confusion. The ultra-dingy, scornful and overly sexualized feel of the movie makes it difficult to have fun. Available only in Italian language print jobs.
