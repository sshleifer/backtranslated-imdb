I have loved heavenly creatures and I make a point of picking it up every time I go. <br /> <br /> So, imagine my joy when I discovered Love & Suicide while browsing NetFlix. Echoing Celestial Creatures, an easy choice, to the top of my queue was. <br /> <br /> I watched the last one, I got comfortable, and waited. What I thought was a preview of a high school student's banter movie project (I laughed loudly once or twice, thinking "I just lowered the bar from straight to the video") ended up being the movie. Horrible performance, amateur direction, weak dialogue. I usually like low budget movies, there is something tangible and real about them because they can not afford the superficial thing to distract from the "flesh" - the acting, the direction, the plot, the story. I would compare this to a student who has not studied for an exam because he knows he will fail and just puts his head on the table and sleeps. <br /> <br /> In someone else's hands, the plot would have serious Potential. <br /> <br /> Do not expect magic or even a classic cult like, say, the Polyester of Divine, or Showgirls, at least there you learn to expect bad performances. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide went from bad to worse for the worst movie I've ever seen.
