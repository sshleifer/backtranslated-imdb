This movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book. I think they were trying to save time. the only advantage I had was that the actor playing finny was cute. Some of the dialogues between the main characters seemed a little cheerful, which was not the case with the book. The main parts of the book were once again cut. You lost the general effect, it was not as scary as the book and left me without much responsibility. Also strong language, although brief, was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not pleasantly) by a new character who was not where in the book. One of my favorite characters (leper) was misinterpreted and portrayed. He looked more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. Above all disappointing.
