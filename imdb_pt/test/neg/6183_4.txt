I've read all the posts courtesy on this confusing semi-noir and I'm intrigued by the high regard for what it seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a very sloppy product of assembly line of the end of RKO. All that endless documentary of fish, waves, fish and waves has little to do with the central conflict and only fills the execution time. The editing is totally careless: the scenes end, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialogue brings the deformed traits of Odet's origins: extravagant metaphors that could never have come from the limited imagination of these ordinary people. But what really surprises is how horribly exaggerated the triangle is, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she growls and writhes and attacks violently - an undisciplined performance several degrees below her standard. Douglas, exaggerating to be kind, then goes to a supposed murderous fury and is equally a farce, just like Ryan, snarling and screaming more abnormally. The second least interesting couple, at least, provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is a type of Neanderthal by today's standards, is soft and persuasive as Stanwyck's (much younger, supposedly) brother and Marilyn Monroe, like his girlfriend. is natural and unaffected. On the coast swept by the Monterey wind (and all of Monterey's footage, though largely irrelevant, interesting as a document of what the city was like), amidst all overheated hysteria, these two islands of sanity. One last point, and a spoiler: Maybe Breen Office sent it, but does anyone believe in the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may have temporarily regressed to being an obedient wife, but I give the marriage a month.
