OK enough. Every time I think I've seen a movie that's so wrong, so bad in every way that I do not think anyone could find something to compliment, I just came to IMDb where I'm greeted with the usual "Undiscovered" masterpiece "" GREAT FILM "- I mean, honestly, what movie you guys are watching, because it's certainly not the mess I just saw on Fox / MGM / UA's new DVD. There are about three fun lines and a storyline that gives incoherence a new meaning.And then, after ninety-three interminable minutes, it stops and the final credits begin.Then there is another scene.The DVD is quite miserable, which fits the film.The source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown.It's hard to imagine that this movie has followed Get Carter.Critics and the audience have achieved this at the time - it was a disaster and a box office disaster, and rightly so.But analysts keep trying.And I'll keep trying to find a movie that does not have someone to praise it.
