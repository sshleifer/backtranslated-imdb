This is a perfect example of why so many people say the '90s suck when it comes to horror movies. A boring horror tale on campus, starring the once promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, THE LOST BOYS, etc). There may be just enough things going on to keep you from falling asleep and it does not look too cheap, but this is still a horror directed at an audience that was in their teens in the 1990s. I might have been part of that audience, but still I was so Good when nothing I watched now. And nowadays, teens are already accustomed to much more and better, and I can not imagine any of them knowing or caring who Corey Feldman was. Or, "it's", in fact, how the guy is still making movies. But the only thing that still connects him to his glory days is the sequel to LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE that was made recently. And I imagine even that one will not encourage anyone to look for VOODOO. Just another movie that was lost in the horror of the 1990s for obvious reasons.
