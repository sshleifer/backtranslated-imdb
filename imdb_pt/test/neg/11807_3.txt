I just saw this movie and all I can say is: where are the cars these days? This looks like it would have been a great second feature on a unit in 1977 (maybe playing with one of these Joan Collins movies) but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's. A silly storyline full of holes , but reminiscent of the era in which it was made. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not much of an actress. Actually, there is not much acting in this movie. It's kind of a Dukes of Hazzard adventure without a sound or a 1969 Dodge Charger jumping about things in the Woods. But there is a Comet Mecrury jumping over a garbage dump in this one!
