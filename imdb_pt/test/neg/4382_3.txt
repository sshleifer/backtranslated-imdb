I chose this local Family Video movie on sale for $ 1.50, which was probably the first sign that it would not be good. Watching with two friends, none of them wanted to end it because of how horrible this movie is. I, strangely enough, could not stop watching. But this movie is definitely an example of how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple and looks great: Chuck Norris has nightmares about a serial killer he put behind the bars. The serial killer escapes and his nightmares begin to come true once again. Serial murder, Norris, round kicks ... this sounds like a great movie. <br /> <br /> And part of that is very good. The flashback scene where a man breaks a ladder with his teeth is intense, a scene where a van falls off a cliff and is crushed is incredible - and I learned to get out of jail using nothing but Chapstick, powder and dental powder . floss. But there is a lot wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> One: the editor is an idiot. When making an action or suspense movie, you need to keep the energy moving. There are too many scenes that are not crucial to the storyline left in this movie, slowing down and distracting the overall story. At least 10 minutes could have been cut and the pace improved and the film would be a little better. Two: The sound guy is an idiot. Apparently someone tried to shoot the bulk of this movie in an area where you can not get a decent sound, so most of the dialogue is dubbed, killing the sound and not aligning with the mouth. Also, the music is too dramatic in some scenes. Three: The casting director is an idiot. They released Billy Drago as a psychiatrist. Billy Drago is a great cult actor (from Brisco County, Hills Have Eyes and others) and would have made the appropriate serial killer or some kind of villain. Your character is so flamboyant that Drago's abilities are wasted. Four: The writer is an idiot. Two plots are in this movie - the hunt for a serial killer and the romance between Norris and his pregnant girlfriend. Every time I saw that woman on the screen, I wanted to tear out my eyes. And sure enough, she never understood the other plot, making her story completely meaningless. <br /> <br /> Will I watch this again? Perhaps. But unless they remaster this movie at least a dozen times, you should never. Not recommended.
