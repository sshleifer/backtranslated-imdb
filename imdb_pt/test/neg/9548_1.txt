* Criticism does not mention spoilers * I rarely make comments from users, but this is a movie that I have no problem in slander. This film stinks, and its mediocre rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for that pulp. The Bone Collector does not have the same movie caliber as Silence of the Innocents or Seven, despite what your ad says. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow - I actually went out for about 10 minutes and came back on the exact scene with exactly the same character with absolutely no progression (I am referring to the part where the Angelina Jolie character discusses Denzel about cutting the hands of a corpse). The film is not at all scary, but tries to make up for it with a love subplot, although the character of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington. Of course, what you get is something comparable to the relationship between mentors and students as seen in the epic Brillium of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however even this has no efficacy and I was personally directing the villain to kill Denzel outside , in order to avoid banal laughter between the two. With such a bad movie, I was expecting a turnaround or some sort of spectacular situation to give the film some things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream did. Anyone with a 4th grade education can see the end how it will be resolved (a situation that mimics Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window). The cliché of having the killer explaining his motives was uninspiring, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that it made me spit coffee on the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think the killer's intent was completely lost when Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets his pet project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (as I am), you will not enjoy this movie. If you have not watched a single movie in your life and would like to follow every Hollywood cliché you've ever seen (the beating of dawn in someone else's window, except the killer, the ridiculous serial killer to start the relationship with the horrible investigator "Woman trying to survive in a male-dominated workforce, also known as SOTL", see this movie ... but even then it is very slow and you would be bored.
