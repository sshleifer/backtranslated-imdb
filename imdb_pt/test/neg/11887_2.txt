Ham-handed tribute to honest hackers. He felt good in a soft-core way about the equivalent of his lightweight pornography, until his insipid lack of technical and economic reality, emotional and moral sophistication became apparent. <br /> <br /> Basically a remake of the '85s from the' 85s Real Genius, with less and more stupid geniuses, and a bad ending cynic. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie might attract someone who is delights with the thesis that becoming a billionaire is so easy that it's almost accidental, or maybe for technical types who like to see themselves described as cool and sexy. than the movie itself. The music of closing credits for movies is more interesting than the film itself.
