Red Sonja is a career-step-in-the-wrong direction for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Having made some sword-witching films (such as Conan), he switched to more serious acting roles in such films as Terminator and Commando, just to make a mysterious return to the wizarding genre for this 1985 disaster. It's hard to figure out why he bothered, as this is weaker than the two Conan films in every possible department. Supposedly, this would be Conan's third film, but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted to the female protagonist, the titular redhead, leaving poor Arnold to play an incredibly tedious supporting role. Take a thought also for the director Richard Fleischer, who had given the world classics as 20,000 Leagues Underwater, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this penultimate film, Fleischer also took a giant step back in his career. <br /> <br /> The evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to dominate the world, and she needs an invaluable and powerful talisman to do so. She and her brutal army attack a fortress populated by priestesses and steal the talisman, massacring the helpless priestesses while they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery warrior who, upon learning of her sister's death, vows revenge for the evil Gedren. Sonja rides the earth in search of the lair of Gedren. Along the way, she catches fellow travelers in the form of a boy prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). She also knows the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. Initially, Sonja does not want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), preferring to prove that she can face and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms up and accepts his help. <br /> <br /> Red Sonja is an incredibly poor movie, especially when it is thought that it was made in 1985, when the sword witchcraft genre was nearing its end. It seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily confuse it with an initial example. The performances are poor overall, ranging from Bergman's embarrassing OTT villain to the incredibly annoyingly spoiled brat of Reyes to the woodless and unenthusiastic hero of Schwarzenegger. Nielsen is a bit better than the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the idea of ​​being in her first lead role - but she is disappointed by the stupidity of the screenplay of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser. The film is full of pranks, including a scene in which Schwarzenegger is seen in close-up, hacking bandits, but in a sequence in the same sequence, there is a corpse in sight. Technically it's also very inept, with substandard special effects and terribly mechanical monsters. There are some trade-offs, such as Ennio Morricone's enjoyable music (Morricone spent much of the 1980's providing good music for horrible movies, for example, The Island, Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another compensation is Giuseppe Rotunno's lens of the sites - in fact, most of the time it is much more rewarding to see the enchanting scenery than the actors in the foreground! There were very few sword-witching films after Red Sonja, so in a way, it can go down in history as the movie that destroyed its own genre.
