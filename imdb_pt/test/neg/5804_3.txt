There is an underlying current in all the positive reviews in this movie - it's just a comedy without a brain, do not take it seriously. Chillax face !!! Well, that's a point of view. The other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same bland people in all these "comedies." <br /> <br /> What you get is a lazy person who, through some totally unrealistic circumstances, has to change his life (always one), to overcome a set of circumstances that only represent a problem for a raccoon or a teen, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the girl he met two days earlier and triumph while remaining a lazy but with more money / self-esteem. On the way, someone does something rude, but very illogical. That means the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you will not believe it.This guy thinks the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhea that the other guy left after eating laxative brownies.Then he shines with it" . Hilarious. <br /> <br /> Most common names appear. David Spade and Rob Schneider are not funny, but they are crrrazzeee characters - a Russian and, I stand by, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. Adam Sandler, the king of comedy dull, unreasonable, brainless, co-produces and some born talent named Dante appears once again. The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy, Dante, is famous for because we have no idea. Allen Covert plays a 36 year old man who gave me the biggest laugh of the night. He was 42 years old and looked years older. <br /> I laughed? Yes, but no more than I would on a TV and do not have to pay a penny to watch them. Please stop making these movies.
