There's a reason to call it a teen movie. Out of 100 possible points I would put somewhere in my teens. It is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the smaller roles and, above all, it is super predictable. The end is so corny that I should have left early and maybe it had passed. By the way, could you call the pervert male? I bet, if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said that. Finally, at the school where I grew up, even though the middle class had over 1000 students, we could have picked a jerk like Josie as being a cheat and we would have picked her out of the crowd. My final word is to save your time, when it comes to watching TV something better, like stock quotes.
