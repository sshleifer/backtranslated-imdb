I registered on IMDb just for the purpose of alerting others about this movie. Has anyone ever gotten funding for projects like this? This is the mystery. Goodbye to Harry may be the worst movie of all time except that I've tried to erase the others that rival this idiotic babble. Bad plot, non-credible logic runs everywhere. I can not ruin this movie for you, revealing everything that would make your experience less enjoyable. There is nothing fun in this movie. I have the CD and I will send it to you for free, it's so bad. First come, only served. If I know you, this offer is void, because I would not inflict this movie on anyone, not on purpose. YOU WERE NOTICED.
