I wanted to see this movie because I liked "Kavkazskij Plennik" ("Prisoner of the Mountains") and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov, Jr. and "Vor" ("The Thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Well, unlike the other films, "The Quickie" was a total waste of time. The story that makes little sense, very unequal acting (Lesley Ann Warren was especially bad), really horrible dialogues, bad cinematography, what else could go wrong? I find it funny that in virtually every movie made in the United States, when foreigners who speak the same language (the Russians in this case) are left alone, they prefer to communicate with one another mainly in broken English (and when they speak Russian , for some reason, translators feel compelled to add a lot of "f ** ks" in sentences, which have no profanity, literal or non-literal. At the same time, native English actors choose to speak in broken Russian. Back to the story, most of the film's subplots (for example, betting on the house, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) make no sense or do nothing more than confuse viewers. Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) were involved in this disaster.
