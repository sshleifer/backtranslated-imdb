Another example of which we should stay away from trying to make spectacular action films in Sweden, does not work except for Widerbergs, still unsurpassed, MANNEN PÃ… TAKET. Stormare does his best, I suppose, and some scenes are lightly effective, but the plot is full of holes. Why does Hamilton continue to attack the base, knowing that his wife is held hostage? It was fun to see Mark Hamill, but his Bad Guy part was heavily subscribed. I am constantly amazed that relatively large Swedish films like this are made without a sensible and functional script. 1 out of 5
