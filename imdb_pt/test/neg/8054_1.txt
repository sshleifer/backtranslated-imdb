Much is really all that one needs to know. First think about all the things that can be bad in a movie. And then try making a movie that is bad in all those ways. You will have done "Vacationland". The state of Maine must be insulted: it is a very nice place to serve as a backdrop for such a trivial and irrational problem. I'm a romantic, and I always want movies about two people meeting to succeed, and I struggled to find what was good about it. Was difficult; Very hard. I could not find a flash of emotional connection between any of the characters in this dull monotonous exercise. Except perhaps in one or two of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Maine is a good vacation land; this movie is not.
