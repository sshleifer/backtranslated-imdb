Ho hum. Good-looking rich kid gets in trouble, poor girl falls in love with him, ex-boyfriend jealous causes tension .. yadda yadda. I really laughed out loud at many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and just plain stupid. As one scene shifted to the next, I often wondered how we got there, as if I had skipped a few chapters in a book. <br /> <br /> The script was very unfortunate and did not let me or my wife caring much about any of the characters except the abandoned boyfriend. Now, if the ex-boyfriend had picked up an ax and destroyed the girl and the rich boy, then ... then we'd have a movie, and all the dumb dialogue and jumps in the plot could be acceptable. But as this movie tries to touch and totally loses the boat (and ends up resorting to the novel equivalent to divine intervention to try to tear out a tear) ... it falls very, very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Clip your nails instead, you'll have more fun.
