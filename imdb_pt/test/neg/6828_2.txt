"How many people know this?" ... "Let's leave it like this!" I wonder at least some new dialogues can be made or not? The film is a very poor copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably made this movie while he was half asleep. The way he looks at Richard Gere's face with his cold-blooded gaze as they near the harbor ... oh my god! It scared me a lot. Why he kills Major Koslova and his companions is still unclear to me. Another thing I could not understand was the poisonous solution he put in the car (what in the world was it?). <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is crazed and the climax is monotonous. Another funny thing was how the Russian was killed in the club. I fell from the chair laughing when I saw that scene. Besides, what was that thing about the gay guy ... what purpose was it to serve? I think the film is made too fast to be easily understood. You have to really think what the heck was in the director's mind. LOL. <br /> <br /> And the best scene after all was Richard Gere trying to hold the pillar between two fast-moving trains. must have made someone lose their heads if they do not come into contact with the pillar.
