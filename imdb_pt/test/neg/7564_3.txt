This movie is a real low budget production but I will not say anything else about it once it has already been covered. I give this movie a low rating just for the story, but I met the director the night I saw the film and it gave me an additional reason not to like the movie. He asked me how I liked it and told him it was not easy to like. My main objection was the lack of basis for the relationship between the two main characters, I was never convinced that they were close. I also told him that the scene in which the main characters were introduced when the kids became friends was too late in the movie. <br /> <br /> He told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. That they were added because he felt that the two main characters did not seem close. He went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to their satisfaction as they were out of money. I agree that they did not do much for the film. <br /> <br /> Another fact about the film, which I did not know, is the actor who led the script based on his own personal experience. This is usually a bad move, as some writers do not take into account the emotional reaction of the viewer. The story is so close to home that the writer makes many assumptions about the public's reaction to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it did not work for me as I never cared about any of the characters, at least the lead. What was presented were two bad people to make a buck anyway, regardless of who gets hurt. When Ms. Young's character decides to give up the bad ways, it seems she does it because it's ineffective, not because she knows she's doing something wrong. If the movie has a message, I suspect only the writer is aware of it.
