Oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this movie. If you can even call it movie. This looks like a first-year art school project, hastily patched. <br /> <br /> The "talents" here will subject you to a painful mix of sub-e-overacting, and virtually every scene has been terribly planned. and pretentious. <br /> <br /> The film does not reflect in any way the culture or social conventions of Malaysia - no one speaks that way around here. I live in Malaysia, BTW. <br /> <br /> Spinning Gasing seems tailor-made to win a prize in the foreign film category of some western film festival. And unfortunately, this trick seems to have worked. Some critics would undoubtedly describe it as "exotic," but a more precise word would be "atrocious." <br /> <br />
