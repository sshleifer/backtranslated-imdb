If you've visited Shenandoah Acres as a kid and wondered, could there be a worse vacation spot in the world? Well, you could have watched this movie and get your answer. Flavia (a.k.a. Fistula) Macintyre's ranch is often frequented by casual business Gordon, at least since resident witch Jessica was 13. But Jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that divining rod ?? Buried "tray-shure", lost jewels, corpses, even a talisman that will prevent her from dressing like a whore and raising drinks with a fake beat and a similar Suzanne Pleshette while hypnotized by a head without a body. Bad, bad evil.
