Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the mediocrity sequel of the Hellraiser series fits perfectly. The imagination and invention of the first two films disappeared. It was the ethos of Pinhead and his minions. Gone are the sickly desires of humans. In fact, everything that once made Hellraiser so original was destroyed by this mess of photos. <br /> <br /> All that remains is the basic premise of Christian mythology that there is hell with evil demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This diluted excuse for a Hellraiser movie is filled with endless Psycho Babble, so that Pinhead becomes a gossiping philosopher senseless and not the harbinger of doom as it should be. <br /> <br /> The film uses the most basic of cinematic formulas, with characters separating and killing individually. Pinhead is not an alien. The connection between the box and the 'demons' or 'Hell' is never established, she just comes to a sacrifice and sits on a dresser. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist is called 'Rimmer' and the producers obviously find it very funny because everyone keeps saying her name. Really the movie should have been renamed to give the character's name. <br /> <br /> What a shame for you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee.
