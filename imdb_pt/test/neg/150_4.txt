Not as close as the films of "Guinea Pig" was inspired by ("Flowers of Flesh and Blood" or "Experiment of the Devil") and not transmitting any real philosophy, this video, that hardly has duration, adds hardcore sex (with censorship in mosaic) for your inspiration. The special makeup effects, which include the cut of the stomach and the break up, are very good, if superlumbrated. The amateur sensation of production is a distraction. Everything seems cheap and lazy. The lighting is hard and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porn actress who ends up starring in a real movie. Only when she gets tired of being abused, true abuse begins. In the scene of the hero of the film, an actor cuts the woman's belly open in graphic close-up, puts his limb inside her and begins to do her things. I did not find "Psycho - The Snuff Reels" shocking. On the contrary, I thought it was a desperate attempt by amateurs to a "guinea pig" and its bloodthirsty. Interestingly, this was distributed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.
