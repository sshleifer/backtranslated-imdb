Do not misunderstand me. I really love the "martial arts genre of the arena," and I'm getting more and more surprised at how many movies like that are out there. This is one of those, and it's not even close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues, I thought it would be good. He can not save this movie, and to be honest, he was not very good either. Just do not pay attention to what other people say; The fight scenes in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I mean, since I've seen so many movies like this. There are also a lot of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. I think they added these just to make the movie last a bit longer, in addition to manifesting the villain like, uuuuuuh ....... bad (as if we no longer knew).
