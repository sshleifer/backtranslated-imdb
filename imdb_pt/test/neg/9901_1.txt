What a mess - and I'm not referring to the "destruction" in the title. I could go on about the banal plot, the bad effects, the (actually remarkable) casting faces as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. I'm just going to say that there were no palms in Chicago the last time I checked and left it that way. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... I need ten lines to post this on IMDb .. Okay, well, I think a DVD release with outtakes might be interesting. Maybe Dennehy will reveal what favor was called for him to appear in this thing. Maybe Dianne Weist shows us the sack of money it must have taken to wrap her up. Maybe CBS executives apologize ...
