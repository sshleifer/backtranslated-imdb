It's the strangest thing I've ever seen. It's sad as he struggles to make a good joke and all he does is curse and think his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He's the bitterest person I've ever seen. His whole act is trying to show how much he does not care, and with that only showing how angry he is with critics and people with some taste and sense of humor who would rather go through immense torture than go watch his "exhibition". There are good comedians, there are bad guys and there are horrible ones. But this guy is a championship of his own. I'm sorry for him and even more so for the people who find him funny.
