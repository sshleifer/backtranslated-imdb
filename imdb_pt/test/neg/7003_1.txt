It's hard to believe that a movie can be so bad, but you live and learn. What is more surprising is the fact that the people who put this thing together probably had a college education. Meanwhile, the fruit of his work reveals the appearance of something a group of five eighth graders may have done. On the plus side (if there is one), the soundtrack has some nice moments, which is another reason to wonder how the rest of the movie can be so horribly bad.
