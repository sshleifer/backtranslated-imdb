Ironically irreverent, but unfortunately bland satire of detective films, with Michael Caine impassive face playing a British author of worthless crime stories traveling to the Mediterranean to help write the memories of a so-called gangster; Soon, he realizes that he is being followed and his life is in danger. Caine recounts the process with considerable cunning humor and discreet sarcasm, but his actual performance is devoid of energy (Caine's outbursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere, and he does not connect with anyone on the screen). Other cast members (particularly Mickey Rooney, Lionel Stander and Lizabeth Scott) do very well in colored roles, although Al Lettieri has an insulting role as an apparent homosexual (Lettieri is insulted without being able to defend himself, an unenviable position) . Screenwriter and director Mike Hodges has the germ of a good idea (satirising detective movies of the 1940s without compromising conversation and the environment), but he does not have a keen sense of humor. When a Bogart look-alike - asking a question about a hawk - is the best joke, what follows is really anemic. ** in ****
