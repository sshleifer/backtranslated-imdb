I like black humor and non-PC stuff, but not if it's without purpose, but to rise. Bashing a group of people without any trace of self-irony sucks. <br /> <br /> There are people who could make funny concentration camp jokes, but who made this movie unfortunately could not even in the very easy task of having fun. on the Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if you are the equivalent of Germany to an inbred hickory (= endogenous southern of a village where virginity is often lost to farm animals) you will certainly fail with this and also with life. I've heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (that crap being listed here is an insult to the next worst movie) is a drug like the calf that the producers of this movie met a few years ago.
