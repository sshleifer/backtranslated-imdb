"Curse of the Forty-Niner" does not really deserve a lengthy and detailed review, so I'll make some random remarks about it: <br /> <br /> - opening legal credits. <br /> There is no plot. - Someone who has seen a horror movie before and can not guess, in the first 20 minutes, who will survive and who will not be among this group of traveling stereotypes? ? <br /> <br /> - Hey, the newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is really hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (invented for about 100 years) and John Phillip Law have fun <br /> <br /> - Karen Black plays a bigger role, but she is not fun - she is quite embarrassing <br /> <br /> Martin Kove is onscreen for about 40 seconds but still has his name on the cover of the video. Did they pay for this apparition or was it the other way around? <br /> <br /> I hate computer-generated effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4.
