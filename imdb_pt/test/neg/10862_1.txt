This movie Oh my god this movie is so poor, I'm amazed to have been able to watch everything .. First of all I'd like to say that Vinny Jones should only play a London bandit period that is the end of story .. <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so unconvincing his comedy almost .. Crash in Dennis Hopper and David Carradine did not save this movie .. in fact I think it is a total comedy and as a comedy that deserves its 1 star ... <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Vinny Oh my God, I thought I saw it all when he played that Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer will realize that this movie is maybe just one will never be kind of movie .. I can not see how anyone could actually drop this crap
