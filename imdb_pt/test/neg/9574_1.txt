The old bat turns into a younger girl after drinking a potion. This movie was terrible. The atrocious performance. The camera work made me turn my head. And features the longest and tedious striptease ever made for the movies. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed to direct this. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should have been blacklisted just for writing something so horrible. Do not rent this movie, the only exception I can do is maybe. If you are dying and have less than 90 minutes of life, watch this movie. it will seem like an eternity and you will be begging for the Grip Reaper to arrive a little earlier. <br /> <br /> My Note: F
