Having seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. Boy was I wrong! So again, A-PIX movies have a way of showing incredibly bad material, even worse than you might expect. I believe this is the first A-PIX sequence, and may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequences. <br /> <br /> It's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the show. backs of the film in which Jack Frost's puppies (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, mouth and sharp teeth) begin to kill people with the typical comedy dialogue and silly voices to accompany him. They are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say looks very tacky. The animation of the computer surprised me, since the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that you see the original "Jack Frost" before seeing this (both of which would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full fun, and why it would make more sense "sense" being a relative term). <br /> <br /> Now, only if there were "Uncle Sam 2" ...
