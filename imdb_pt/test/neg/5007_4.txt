What's wrong with CURACAO (aka DEAD CHAINS, though the reason for the name change is that I have no idea) can probably be summed up where a woman tells her lover: "Keep I'm trying to sleep. "<br /> <br /> It is not the dialogue that is the problem or the way it is delivered, it is the fact that the actress has an accent from Central Europe. Nothing wrong with that until it is revealed that your character is from Philidelphia in the United States! What impressed me about this suspense while watching - The way the accents do not match their characters. Besides Mme. Philly with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who looks like an Irishman going through a Gestapo officer and, worst of all, George C Scott playing someone with a Dutch or British accent. it sounds as if it were a South African dyed American. You soon give up following what's on the screen and end up focusing on what nationality a character might be due to the weird way they talk. It is interesting to note that this site did not give this film a country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel that this was produced by the United Nations. <br /> <br /> Even if you're not curious about accents or dialects, you'll probably have to give up after the action anyway. because CURACAO is less plotting. Things happen like an exploding boat, a hostage situation, and the hero being recruited as an agent of South African intelligence, but you scratch your head, wondering what the hell this is all for.
