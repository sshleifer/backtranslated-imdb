The characters are annoying, immature and scaly ... Madison is the most annoying of them all. OOH ... a cold spot! Such a terrible threat! Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! To shorten the story, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair flying through a room can be scary, but this is as intriguing as it sounds. I watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat to the TV set instead of watching that trash again. If you want a good horror movie or even an acceptable comedy, that's not it! The only good part of the whole thing was "the roach scene" and at the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the cockroach!
