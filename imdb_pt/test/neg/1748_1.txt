I was so offended by this movie that I had to write SOMETHING about it, so please make me moody. <br /> <br /> His only redemptive virtue, apart from some good deed, is that it is nothing but the past. minutes. Even this length is about 30 minutes longer. <br /> <br /> Comparisons were made here with the brilliantly somber 'The Grifters', but I can not see. They are two different movies together. The closest that 'Swindled' comes to an existing film is 'The Sting', made in 1973. It borrows (sorry, STEALS) liberally from this splendid entertainment of George Roy Hill, which is exactly what it was. I liked it because I did not pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many red herrings in 'Swindled' that I thought I was in a fish tank. It's very confusing, but this is just one of your many problems. The main one is this: if you make a movie where everyone lies to everyone else, where everyone is cheating, we have no 'anchor' to anchor us. The inevitable result is a miscellany of very sloppy seconds from other alcove films. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is conniving and objectionable. Certainly a basic lesson in Cinema 101 would tell us that audiences have to "care" about someone. We can not 'take care' of anyone here: they are ALL swine. It could have worked like a rough comedy, but it's straight from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, DO NOT READ MORE. GREAT 'SPOILER' COMING. Sorry, but I have to do it. <br /> <br /> There is so much false blood and so many false murders that do not overload credulity - it destroys everything. The ending is absolutely ridiculous - a 'murder' at a crowded airport that is not really a 'murder' at all? And the 'murdered' fellow, drenched in blood, just stands up, walks away, and walks away, fake blood dripping with the booty? All while the police and the hordes of people are looking, and no one intercedes? The director must have a lot of balls if he thinks we should buy this. Noirish B-movies of the 1940s was better. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of European films, but this confirms that schlock does not always come from Hollywood. As far as 'Swindled' is concerned, my judgment is on the famous line of producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew all about schlock: 'Include me'.
