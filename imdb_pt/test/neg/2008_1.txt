Well, that's about 1,000 years into the future and we finally broke away traveling the vast distance between the galaxies !! But unfortunately, we still use guns that shoot bullets, black men are still calling each other brothers, and getting tall, stoned, fighting, etc. Common stereotyped urban black men are still getting the short end of the bat! Babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they are from Baywatch share closely with the captain and crew. Crippled people still need wheelchairs to move around, without sophisticated cures, implants or robotic legs. Dracula still looks and acts gay. I need to go ahead ... In short, this move was filmed in a typical sci-fi setting low budget props, actors, and there are no real special effects to speak of. The beginning, middle, and end were pathetic. I have to go out and kill myself now, there is nothing left to live.
