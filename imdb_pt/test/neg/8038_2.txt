This is one of those "family" movies that I can not imagine to have much appeal to anyone over 9 years old. A group of brothers discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passageway in their eccentric uncle's cottage, for which they were evacuated from the London blitz. ... And you have it, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of realizing desires, but none of these questions is examined in a way that is interesting to adults or instructive to children (or vice versa!). The only reason I can think of watching it is to see how the exceptional talent of Freddie Highmore stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.
