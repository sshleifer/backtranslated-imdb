The opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a high school game. But I've seen high school plays with better acting! Each line was delivered so obvious that I felt like I was watching actors work instead of seeing characters. I found the development of the character poor and the performance very forced! I discovered that 25 minutes after the movie, I really did not care what happened because the plot was overly obvious and I was bored. I hung there, waiting for the movie to redeem itself, but that never happened. Sister Theresa was excessively sweet, even to a nun, but she seemed impulsive and slightly manipulative. All in all, I was very disappointed.
