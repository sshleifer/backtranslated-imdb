OK, number one - this "movie" is a 90's version of a 70's shit show no one remembers! Number Two - As soon as the movie started, I was confused, it was like I had stepped into the middle of the movie! There was no plot! it was very boring! Horrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but you can not believe the skinny Omar Epps can chase a big, grown man without a gun, and scare him to talk! It's a ridiculous "plot". I'm sorry, but for me, kids these days can not even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone pick up some "bad killers underground." I left the theater and asked for my money back! I would not recommend this movie for more than 12 years old!
