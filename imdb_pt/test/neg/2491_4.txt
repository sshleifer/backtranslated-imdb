This movie is a definitive 5. I finally got on HBO the other night. I remember when I left in theaters telling a friend that it would never be a success because Americans did not want movies about the story, especially movies that were more about ideas than about action. I do not know if that was the reason the FMLB did not do well, but now, having finally seen it, I can add some of my comments. <br /> <br /> First, while Dwight Schultz went well on Star Trek and The A-Team as the lead in this movie, he is disheartening. I kept waiting for him to shout like Jon Lovitz, "I'm ACT-ING!" He wording and tone of voice looked like he was trying a lot had to be an ACT-OR, on a stage where he had to oddly emphasize various words and phrases. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I liked the sly positioning of Paul Newman's character as a manipulator who, at all times, struggles to gather these cats (the scientists) to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> Third, there was some discussion about the moral implications of creating the A-bomb and whether the US should use it. Probably not enough of that, or as deep as it might be. <br /> <br /> Finally, there seemed to be many twists to a dramatic effect. I do not know how much of the events in this movie are true to life, but things like having the test bomb slipping into its chains or having a laboratory accident caused by a cup of spilled coffee (and a dead scientist as a result) were lengthening the limits of credibility. Perhaps these things, or similar events, actually happened, but it seemed that several scenes were added only for dramatic effect, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> FMLB was OK. I need to read more about the actual events to know if it was over or just more accurate.
