There is not much to say in the end. One would expect much more from a director who made better films in the past. It seems he did it without really caring. The actors are doing their job (though Belmondo is far from incredible), but you just do not get hooked. In a word, it's annoying. This is all the more disappointing as I have heard over and over again that this movie could be considered a reaction to all the great American blockbusters who are considered a threat to the French exception by those who simply can not admit that they should turn to another job. I tell you, if this is the best reaction we should have, boy, I'll be very depressed soon ...
