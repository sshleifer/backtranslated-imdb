The plot: Four people are caught in an elevator. One is a business man, the boring type who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a traveling sample of stress and hostility. Then there's his colleague, a woman who is much nicer in her character. A teenage rebel who has just invaded a coking machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad, and an older guy who has just stolen 100,000DM makes up the rest of the cast ... The film is all about how they deal with their problem, as time passes unsuccessfully to reach the outside world, when the lights go out and the cables begin to break one after the other .... > And yet, it's not very exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how can so many things go wrong in just one elevator?). You do not like the characters very much, you just hate one of them. And all the twists and turns in the plot are not contributing to the excitement, it's just stupid excuses to fill in a few more minutes with dialogues while the writers go uninspired and inked in a feature film set in an elevator. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that Phone Booth is a better effort ...
