Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are well under par even if it was on a Playstation 1, no matter a Gamecube. The gameplay is pathetic and the camera moves disorientate. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I totally love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool that they do all the games that way. Batman: Vengeance could have been great since it got off to a good start, keeping all the gothic visuals and voice actors, but they stumbled seriously when it comes to gameplay and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is not fun to play. I really need to emphasize how bad the graphics are. Do not let color schemes fool you. I've seen better things on a Commodore 64.
