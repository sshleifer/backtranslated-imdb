The boss of the moody, verbally abusive film studio commands his male assistant with nagging requests, holding the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year of office terror, the hard work finally breaks down. Writer and director George Huang has possibly bitten more than he can chew here. His "swimming with sharks" is not a diatribe against Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hard-working underling ... instead, it's stunts with a twist, a pony of a tunnel-view trick. The surroundings do not look like Tinsel Town (maybe due to a limited budget), and we never realized this stressful environment as a movie entity (could be an office of Realtors in the Valley as we all know). Leader Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives a controlled and focused performance as the mad power tycoon whose ego is out of control; he does a good job, and yet the character does not sound true. We have learned so little about him and his acquaintances that their important position and high status status do not match what we see; to whom does this man respond? what drives you beyond humiliating others for sport? With what projects is he juggling, besides the script we see? The film is so emotionally atrophied and subpopulated that it begins to look like a play on the big screen - and yet without sufficient characters or motivations. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his film looks like a half-cooked project that needed a lot more insight, humor, and atmosphere. ** in ****
