This movie features several well-known actors that I usually like so I had minimal expectations when I rented this on DVD. I was very disappointed. I actually went out for some snacks somewhere for the last half hour and somehow ended up in the kitchen instead of going back to the TV. The acting of actors in which the public was poor in general and none of the atmospheres of the film seemed very convincing. Pretty much every scene had that "just a movie" feeling to them, I just sat there waiting to hear the director calling "CUT!" followed by the team having a little talk about the scene before moving on to the next. Since the movie is about gangsters, most of the characters are tough and look like the mafia, the problem here is that all this evil boy attitude is so misunderstood that it seems like a joke. The guitar drilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere as well, but when the same track is played for the 18th time, it only adds to the already strong feeling that the whole thing is just fake. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was just a really bad script, maybe it was poorly executed. I'm not a film critic, actually I find it rare to see something that's REALLY good, but that was just plain bad, no matter how objective and tolerant I'm trying to be. NOT recommended, not even as a rental!
