"Happy Days" was produced and broadcast from the mid-'70s to the early '80s and seems to get more ridiculous with age. At the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950s were middle-aged with families, and scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought artificial nostalgia to them. The Fonz was, of course, the coolest (although the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned to ride a motorbike). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blond-haired boy who was likely to be elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show has to have a best friend, I think. And Ralph Malph was the awkward partner of the Fonz, if not the whole group. I loved it when Fonz hit poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged man who ran Mel's Diner. Of course, who could forget Mork's appearance? Was this really the 1950s? Ironically, films made during the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Savage," have improved with age and depict the period more honestly than this show, which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays. Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same league as "Rebel Without a Cause" or "American Graffitti." "Happy Days" may have captured some aspects of the 1950s with its burger joint, juke boxes, cool cars, and tacky plaid shirts, but it's more of a nostalgic idealism made strictly for laughter rather than an honest portrait. "American Graffitti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" seemed more about what the middle-aged people of the 1970s wanted the 50s to have been. The result was a kind of dilute manufacturing that really has nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Days" is, at best, a comedy fantasy with part of the artificial culture of the 1950s as the backdrop. As pointed out by another critic, the American boy Richie Cunningham probably would have been punished for befriending people like a dropout like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his Diner. <br /> <br /> A quick story: "Happy Days" was originally a pilot named "Love in the Happy Days" that was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots who had themes about sex and romance that did not participate in the program sometimes appeared on the "Love American Style" radio show, which used to be displayed in place of baseball games that had rained or other unexpected programming cancellations and / or changes. In short, "Love American Style" was a disposable show that contained all those comedy pilots from an episode that never made it to the premiere. "Love in the Happy Days" appeared as a "Love American Style" show sometime in the early 1970s, but at the time TV executives could not predict how a 1950s youth program would be popular, particularly during the apogee of comedy shows centered around middle-aged people such as the Mary Tyler Moore Show (and their successive spin-offs as Rhoda), The Bob Newhart Show and All in the Family. (As things have changed since then, most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most programs about middle-aged people like the plague!) <br /> <br /> Subsequently, one of the young stars of "Love in the Happy Days", a young actor from "The Andy Griffith Show" named Ron Howard, had the chance to star in a 1959 film about "American Graffitti" directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas, whose " THX 1138 "had bombarded miserably at the box office.Even when it was premiered for film executives, again the studios could not see how a movie about youngsters in the 1950s could become popular because it did not fit what was popular in the past, although they did not realize that much of the film audience was young in the 1950s. As everyone knows, the film was a great success, and studio executives acknowledged they had misjudged the audience. During the American Graffitti theatrical tour, TV executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was very much like American Graffitti. They brought back the original cast in addition to Henry Wrinkler as "The Fonz" re-titled "Happy Days" and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 70's. "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than superficially. The issues with which they deal are trivial. And their reactions seem foolish and foolish. Nowadays, Fonz's character seems to be a caricature of, well, the Fonz. Was the idea meant to be a parody of Marlon Brando's character in "The Wild One"? Looking at the show with new eyes, I feel the producers really missed a great opportunity to present the 50's in depth and realism that could still be fun and entertaining. Instead, the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick money. This is definitely a show that did not stand the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many of the outside appearances of "Happy Days", but it had an advantage. He had an honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" took the look of "American Graffitti", but could not take his heart.
