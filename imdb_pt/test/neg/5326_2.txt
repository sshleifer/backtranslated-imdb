One of the most stupid movies in movie history. Wait, I accept that - this movie can not be included in any movie-related category; belongs to categories such as "waste", turds or similar categories. Ironically, it's even two garbagemen. The film is "Men At Work," a light crime comedy starring the brothers Estevez (Sheen) of 1990. Leaving aside the asynine and implausible plot, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly performed acrobatics and clowning, continuity errors and high rate of unnamed actors to never be seen again, after all, it was a really bad movie anyway (in essence, I mean). It was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn all the lines, and, in an extravagant way, repeat them in public with your wasted friends, thus ensuring your life. status as the biggest idiots in their tenth grade class. To make matters worse, I actually sent a trivia trivia post (along with this negative review) to the IMDb page in the movie, even though I discovered a silly punk music joke that apparently no one else saw yet (on the statue of Butthole Surfer). I'm so conflicted about why I should * waste * my time sending what seems to be a supporting note when what I really want to do is blow Emilio's acting career (no, wait, he's already done it himself Thank you, man!) I'm so happy that I wasted my time on this, not real money. For that matter, can I have at least a tenth of your budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with what they spent exploding cars, carefully putting bikini bimbos in the background and beating useless extras (goons) in suits. I would mention Emilio's writing credit, but it would be an exaggeration to call this script "writing" - it's more like cartoon ideas scrawled with crayons. And Charlie Sheen, if you're reading this, I assume M.A.W. must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a Hollywood brat who had not grown up yet. (Oops, I'm sorry, I think part of your life is not over yet.) Get it soon, you "half man." Such promising talent, then * wasted * "oh look, have that word again.
