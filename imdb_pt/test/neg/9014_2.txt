Another gray, a bit horrible of schlockiness from the Corman family. The first space capsule in outer space lands on Earth (with some of the worst special effects of all time), and the pilot seems to be dead. But appearances can deceive. He's actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including an old paternalistic misogynist doctor (who's also really, really boring), a greasy guy who looks like he's trapped in the hair oil market, another guy so annoying that he does not even make a good impression, a female scientist who never seems to be injured or irritated by the old man's boss, and a photographer with a haircut by Farah Fawcett (pre-Farah, of course) and as lively as a dead duck <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently everyone in the cast, including the women, was called Steve. Anyway, the dead pilot Steve is not only alive, but is incubating baby aliens (or seahorses, or shrimp, or any other) inside his torso. Mother's beast that implanted these little creatures looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again, I'm struck by the laughing ability factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman. The Venus Space Carrot in Conquer the World is still officially the worst and most laughable monster I've ever seen on the screen, but the Cormans are always able to deliver when it comes to evil, full-fledged monsters. <br /> <They also managed to deliver their other trademarks; (Corman made most of his films in black and white, as his color still can appear gray) two or three locations at most, stupid and lame props and special effects, and many and many dull dialogue. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you did not count the roasted parrot..err.alien blood beast being slaughtered at the end of the movie). Praises went off the earth, I'm sure, when the alien rips out the old doctor's head and (apparently) eats. Now you can speak English and have the doctor's memories. You can also move the pregnant astronaut as if he were Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The monster's apparent intent is to rebuild its race using humans as food and giant bellies. There is a confusing bit at the end (well, more confusing than usual, at least) where the creature tries to explain why it is doing it, but it makes no sense at all. Something about how humanity is about to follow in the footsteps of its race and destroy itself for something they will soon create. Never really said what it was. It could be anything from toaster ovens to digital clocks, who knows. His minder stabs instead of letting the alien shrimp crawl out of his body, and the oily guy (and the other guy) burns the alien-parrot to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the smell of roast chicken..err .. alien. End of story, in which the rest of the characters move away and leave their dead companion lying on the ground to rot. Why not save the expense of a funeral? I'm sure that was what Corman was thinking, when he tried to cut costs and make his scenes as cheaply as possible.
