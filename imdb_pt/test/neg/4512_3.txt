I've seen and got the original 1959 black and white star Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I watch, I can not help but cry. <br /> <br /> This version was (obviously) a set, like the 1959 was, but there were so many bugs in the layout. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist in that time frame existed in the movie. Doris Roberts, sad to say she can not play drama, she is a comedy actress and this will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel looked like a college professor of mine, instead of the dentist he was supposed to touch. In the original film, Anne walked the "glove" to go to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a minute. In this low quality remake, it took less than 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct ... This remake is just that, a remake. What was the director thinking about comic actors in a drama role like that. I'm sorry, but James Coco can not do drama. Max .. Schell was better at Deep Impact than this movie. The irritable Mrs. Frank was so angry that I could not stand her. Referring and comparing to the 1959 version, I like her better, she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. From 10 stars, I give this remake 3. Do not waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.
