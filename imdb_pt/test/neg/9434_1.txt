Can there be a worse movie? Even Ed Wood, at his worst, could not think of something so bad. Cheesy, stupid, wordy, absurd ... and those are the good points. I saw this junk in the early 80's when I was incredibly bored to begin with, and I really sat the whole thing without blowing my brain, though that would probably have been a more enjoyable experience. I really remembered why it was so bad. This makes me sad in a way, because some of the best directors started out making TV movies (ie Spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their first material before the audience, but crap like that just completely killed the whole audience. process.
