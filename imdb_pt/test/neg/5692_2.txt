You see a movie called 'battle space', what are you going to think? Space battles with cool blasts and all firing at each other. What do you get from this movie? Well, you have a little strength in the space battle, but most of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. NOBODY TALKS !!!! What is this nonsense?! We have a narrator and a ton of British computers, but that's all. The main protagonist must be the worst I've seen, since she does not even have dialogue, and sleepwalking with scenes (literally!). Some of the things that happen are just stupid, like they used a rocket (like to go into space) for basic transportation on the planet side, why not just use one of those cool space ships? Anyway, the music is almost non-existent, with some dead flat samples, but the main thing you'll notice are the Atari sound effects that ships use ... you must be kidding me. I can also say that the budget was low because everything seems fake, which is not what you'd expect from a movie, especially what should be a super cool space battle movie. I seriously think the budget must have been double-digit, it's so bad, making you laugh more than it should. I'm starting to think that they paid the actors based on how much dialogue they had, because their is very little here (if you can not say since that's my main complaint here, as I probably said, as 3 times already ).
