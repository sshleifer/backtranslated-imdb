This is a cheap biography of a star of black and white minstrel shows, a certain Dixie Boy Johnson. If that person really existed I do not know, but considering the cast lists a certain "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns playing the character as well, I assume the man existed and that this is a white-washed version of your career. The plot, as it is, follows Dixie Boy from Career Heights to Depression with the death of his wife in childbirth, his abandonment of the child to friends, and his return to his daughter's 16th birthday and debut on the stage for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a beautiful baritone voice, but no acting talent and it's a boring piece on the screen. Gladys George courageously tries his best to enliven the works to no avail. Judy Clark does the best Betty Hutton imitation I've ever seen, though I believe she thought she was being herself. The score filled with many musical numbers for its short runtime of 70 minutes deserved a well-deserved Oscar name. Worth a look.
