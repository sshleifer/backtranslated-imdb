Only one word can describe mr. Unfortunately that is no AIRPLANE. Appearances can decipher, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on the old cartoon, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, an almost idiot blind who stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. Now he must hunt them using ... blindness basically. And that's all this movie does. The MR MAGOO blindness. Now, maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this, but basically it's just one of those "stupid smiles on your face because you're ashamed to admit you paid to see it." <br /> <br /> But MR MAGOO is not as bad as it is hacked. At least it has some funny jokes, and it's good fun for the whole family. (Nielson tried to do a "Naked GUN" for families at MAGOO, but it's not nearly as good as that.) So, see once, you can hate it, you can love it, whatever. I personally did not hate it, but I sure did not like it, I did not even evaluate "okay." 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
