What a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square feet of reconstructed ancient Rome, 2 million cubic meters of buildings 50 feet high, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of works, an International Committee of Ancient History (sic!), Some first-class actors and actresses. The end result? An empty TV movie for a single digit IQ share.
