Bad performance? Yes, but it was not a surprise. Stupid story? Yeah, so what? <br /> <br /> But why, tell me, Mr. Director, why all this slow-motion crap? The fight scenes were bad, very bad, because of the slow movement and the bad cut. Not because of Seagal. <br /> <br /> "What if I just accelerate this for 2 seconds and then slow down the next 5 seconds and then ... Maybe I need to play the coin to decide?" What were you thinking, Mr. Director?
