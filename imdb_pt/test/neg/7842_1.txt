One commentator said that if you like Austin Powers, you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard for laughs. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were screaming as if the scream itself was funny. I understand where they were trying to go with this movie. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just does not work. Austin Powers gets silly but smart, Zorro the Gay Blade lacks the savvy of Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting I was surprised that someone was actually paid for the script. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the film was flat. My 17-year-old who selected this movie in his title, left after 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems like a lot of people on IMDb liked this movie, but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy. .
