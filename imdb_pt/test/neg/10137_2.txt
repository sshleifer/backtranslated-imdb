My parents can enjoy this show, but I can not find the humor in it. What is so funny about a dentist husband getting his hygienist assistant and the eldest daughter pregnant by the captain of the school football team? Absolutely nothing! Sometimes it's a shock to me what people think is humor today. The blame is on shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" bringing the issue of sex to the foreground in the mid-1960s. Of course, the series has its touching moments but that's no excuse for content which otherwise entered into this series. This is nothing like the family-oriented days of "I Love Lucy," five decades earlier. <br /> <br /> One answer I would have to why this series plays on the Lifetime cable channel is because the women on the channel think women can relate to Reba's character! I absolutely do not like the character of Reba Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers, is so in real life, far from acting. Who plays the ex-husband dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is servile in itself! The characters of Van and Cheyenne are also very annoying. <br /> <br /> Another thing that baffles me is why dingbat-of-a-series creator Allison M. Gibson decided to put the series in the place where I live. 25 miles away; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire is not even from this state, she's an Oklahoman! Why during a season or more they decided to make incidental music sound like a pork snorting? What I mean is that we hear this baritone saxophone being played on drums accompanying, but the melodies are basically timeless!
