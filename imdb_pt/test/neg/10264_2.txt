This movie SUCKS !! It seems they just chose to put scenes together randomly. Good gore but little tangle. Sally whimpers and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I realized she had PMS. It certainly looked that way. The dubbing in this movie is horrible. A scene that the woman was talking about and a few seconds before we heard any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the USA. I tried to follow along, but I got lost in half and found it very difficult to believe, even for a horror movie. Some good characters, but not many. Not worth wasting time.
