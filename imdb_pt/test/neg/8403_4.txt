A disturbing movie that climaxes with an intensely intimate meeting between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure contains a poetically imagined visual exploration of the innocence of an idealized amnesiac. <br /> <br /> The plot follows two topics, the weakest of which is the gradual revelation of the Graham / Paul condition. Wounded through this, however, is a beautiful description of his condition, and his winding path toward a partial awakening, driven by his affair with Irene. <br /> <br /> The case is the strong thread as long as the specificities of the subject. The plot is conveyed by a collection of apparently clinging characters: Graham's best friend who can reveal the cause of his flashback condition, his boss manipulator and his crazy scientist psychologist: all of whom have an interest in keeping him lost. and dependent. <br /> <br /> The film's failure lies in the conflict between the two topics. One is visual, winding and sublime, while the other is structured as an inept thriller, all expository dialogue and unresolved patterns of symbolism. <br /> <br /> However, I like New. He continues to flirt with the abyss of the taboo and hide in something beautiful, like the quarry, with the bass player and the two women, when a scene for a cheap porn scene becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still do not understand the tooth. <br /> <br /> Strange, clumsy and a narrative failure, but with an almost redeeming beauty.
