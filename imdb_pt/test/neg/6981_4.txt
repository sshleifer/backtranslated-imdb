This movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just makes me want to scream, "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes the movie "Yes Man" but directs "this" maybe he should keep writing. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed because I heard all the great reviews. I was expecting something like knocked out. They say this is from the manufacturer of "Knocked up"? Why can not I see the resemblance? but that sounded like a superficial, over-the-top type of movie for me. I'm so disappointed. Actually, it's not bad if you consider it as an ordinary girl movie, but this "band face" character gets on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just was not paying enough attention to the movie. , but rather they have some funny lines and scene, but I did not feel the originality. And the ending makes the movie a little better. At least the end is not a boring cliche.
