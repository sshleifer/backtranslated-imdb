I just watched this to see Joe Morton in an opening role and honestly wished he had not bothered me, he could and since then, he's done way better than that crap. I can not understand why anyone thinks this kind of stupidity is funny, but each with his own; it's an absolute mess and it's not funny at the least. Do not wait, a line was just funny, where Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this crazy job as he was invited to dinner (God only knows why). Pest for Mr. Kent: You know what it's like a dog, you've been there Mrs. Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny, but that's what a line does not do a great comedy and that tat is so far from to be funny that should be consigned to the nearest garbage cart, is good enough for that. Joe Morton - happy to see you do not show up in the trash like that; you are far superior and a great actor.
