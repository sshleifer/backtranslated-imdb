George Cukor's The Women continues to be one of the brilliant gems of 1939, the most golden of Hollywood's golden age. The movie popped and teased and the absence of males was a subtle touch, hardly noticed because of all the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York, across from Saks. Large crowds move along the avenue ... but something is wrong. The shot reveals only well-dressed women (attractive and young). Creepier than I am legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and then in a big fashion show. Which NYC fashion show does not have at least 5 gays? The "not-men" rule is shaken in our throats, creating an alien world, unbalanced and distracted. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, first sight digging in your garden with a ridiculous makeup complete with its retro curls and fluttering arms. Immediately I sympathized with her husband and I could understand why he was looking for another place. Later in the film, she turns into an older Jennifer Aniston look and holds her arms at her side. This seems intentional, as if to say, "Look, I can still be relevant!" Ryan's character is loaded with a coven of friends who do not match (insert Sex and the City here) who, if it was in real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the power bitch, who during the film realizes that the dream of her life does not make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the lesbian of power, all atitudinous without any use for some of the men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice for the bad girl to say the least. She seems false, acts falsely, and whatever mood she tries to show falls. Someone commented here that she looked transsexual. Several other stars appear to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant cast of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have called their price, stuck their tongues firmly in their cheeks and took something very clever and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks about itself too much for this kind of exploration. Instead, we receive this thing that creeps awkwardly without dullness. Entire sections of the original dialogue are raised and placed in a scene with terrible results. At one point Ryan exclaims something along the lines of "This is not a 1930 movie!" Not Meg, it's not.
