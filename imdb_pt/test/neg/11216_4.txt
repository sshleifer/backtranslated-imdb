Young Michael Dudikoff, like the young Lord Greystoke, was abandoned in the jungle on a Pacific island as a child. But instead of being raised by the monkeys, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he did not know the war was over. And like the young Luke Skywalker, he fell into the hands and learned the fighting skills of a Ninja. <br /> <br /> Good thing because they were separated and the young kid came down with a case of amnesia, but those fighting skills did not go away. The orphan boy, now called Joe Armstrong, joins the Army and places himself in the Philippines. Meanwhile, his Obi Wan Kenobe, played by John Fujioka, is rescued and will work as a gardener at the planter and terrorist estate between Don Stewart, using an accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. <br /> <br /> As these things happen, everyone meets and Dudikoff solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the daughter of the bandit commander in this Golan-Globus production. Charles Bronson was getting a bit long on the tooth now and Golan-Globus needed a new star for his action movies. Michael Dudikoff filled the project very well and made some movies for them, including several American Ninja sequences. <br /> <br /> This movie is all action and Dudikoff despatches bandits at a record pace. What he does not do, Steve James does his best Rambo imitation and shows off his considerable martial arts skills. <br /> <br /> The movie has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those army vehicles through you see in the story. But that's what the ticket buyer's public does not care about. Dudikoff certainly looks gorgeous stripped of his fighting clothes. No wonder so many sequences have been made.
