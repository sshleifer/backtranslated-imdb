This is almost the territory of Ed Wood. Yes, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey vulture and a bad day in the dentist's office. And this sound effect makes the nails cross the sound of a blackboard like Mozart. And why The Giant Claw, when the silly little bug swallows its victims with a mechanical jaw. We have great close-ups of ugly chicken feet, but nothing more. I think producers thought that a more appropriately titled Big Mouth might suggest a Jerry Lewis comedy. And speaking in comedies, all that "anti-matter" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a Lewis movie. I think the screenwriters got stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter could not take care of a 1950s flying threat, so they invented a real whopper from another galaxy. Yes, this KFC fugitive must have flown from another galaxy behind an antimatter shield, as explained in excruciating detail by one of the film's resident geniuses. In that case, Jeff Morrow, a pilot I know in his spare time, advises Einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is also Morrow who maintains the ridiculous procedure out of the movie "Hall of Shame" since he actually shows his lines with a serious face. Besides, he even seems to believe them. This is a movie acting triumph of the first order. For the Oscar, Morrow deserves a combat medal for acting above and beyond the call of duty under the most extreme circumstances of cinema. Notice the protagonist Corday, so you can evaluate your fortress under fire. It looks like she just woke up in a nightmare, and maybe if she stands still, no one will notice her. I barely made it. Oh well, the first time I saw this disaster was through a haze in the back of what is now a residential venture. I should have learned my lesson and broken another pack of 12 the second time.
