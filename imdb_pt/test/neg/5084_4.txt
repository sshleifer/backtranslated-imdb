It may have been exciting for an audience in 1946, but the film is now a bit boring. I had a hard time understanding the whole thing, and it was very predictable: I mean, we know from the beginning of the movie that Welles is the Nazi war criminal, and I'm going to give you a chance on whether he got caught. and appropriately punished at the end. <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. It's sad that Welles made only three films worthy of being seen in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
