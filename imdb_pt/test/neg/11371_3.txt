While not as bad as some movies (such as the horrific "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" still relies on common misunderstandings and inaccuracies about the nuclear power industry to advance its plot. I am currently studying nuclear engineering in pursuit of a master's degree, and it was easy to point out flaws that would be obvious to anyone involved with the industry. Walking in the false fear that a Chernobyl-style collapse could happen in an American factory, the film claims that any collapse (even partial, according to one of the commentators invited in the film) would mean disaster for the area. In fact, a partial collapse in an American factory, while destroying the core, would pose no risk to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island experienced a partial collapse and no radioactive material was released into the environment, thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and core design used in this country, paired with substantial containment. <br /> <br /> The security steps shown in the movie were perhaps the part of the movie farthest from the truth. At any important strategic location - whether it's power plant, chemical plant, military base, anything - you'll never see the staff responding to an alarm talking like a drill without warning. This is especially true in a nuclear power plant where, at the sound of the alarm, the reactors would be SCRAMed immediately, shutting them down. SCRAMing can be done with the push of a button in the control room (you do not need to put the core in the "shutdown mode" as shown in the movie), and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being brought back into power approximately 9 hours from a SCRAM. So if this scenario unfolds in real life, the assailants would not be able to cause a significant collapse. In theory, they could still cause a partial due to the residual heat if they exposed the core immediately, but this would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant - there are far more than the single backup pumps that talk about how much to spent fuel tanks, it may be possible to turn the pools into a dirty bomb, blowing them up, but that is much harder than simply parking a truck full of explosives. near the pools. The fuel is under (approximately) 18 feet of highly purified water. Water can not become radioactive (no radioactive vapor as they speak in the film). Particles dissolved in water can, but water itself can not; hence the reason for a very thorough purification. So the only way to turn a pool of fuel into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. It is no easy task, as the water is very heavy and the pools are below ground, with very thick concrete walls. The explosives would have to be in the pool below the fuel (which is tightly secured). And there would have to be a lot of explosives, since the water is very difficult to go through an explosion. Even if this occurs, the spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not cause as many dead as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread. From the basic point of view of the film, I was a little tired of the style I used. The constant fading in and out, use of sandy black and white and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those of the US government. I have some issues with the twist thrown in the movie but I will not discuss it as it would be a big spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall, 3/10
