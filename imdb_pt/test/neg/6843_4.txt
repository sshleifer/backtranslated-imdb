The most fertile man in Ireland revolves around Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and still a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He's also a very shy guy about women. Everything changes for Eamon when he is seduced by a woman (as much as I remember a neighbor). It is not because he loses his virginity, but he discovers that he has a super power. Despite being protected, this neighbor becomes pregnant. He is informed by the doctor that he has a high sperm count. His mother brilliantly comes up with an idea that makes us see redhead babies around the movie. He begins to help women on both sides of Belfast conceive babies. First voluntarily, then with the help of your colleague, run a business. The most fertile man in Ireland has his funny moments, but he needed to create better jokes and a better script. I could not help thinking that this gave me the impression of a TV sitcom rather than a movie. Kris Marshall is a different name on the silver screen, but does not shine like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in such and such a movie. Like him being in Love Actually (I think he was very funny about it) .. Well, it was okay to watch, but I could not stop napping from time to time. ** outside of *****
