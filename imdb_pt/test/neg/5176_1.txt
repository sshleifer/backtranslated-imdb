This is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has destroyed the British film industry since Mockney Guy Ritchie launched Lock's actions and two malicious barrels. This story of "True Life" by Carlton Leach (who?) Has all that is wrong with this genre, a really horrible script that consists of people singing "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I'll kill you, fahcking cant "ad nauseum. The acting is uniformly appalling with the two best-known cast members being two ex-novel stars quite noticeably out of their depth. For some reason, the film assumes we've heard of these people and can assure you that someone from northern Essex does not have it, and that we should be interested in some low life story. Because? This is not Goodfellas despite the synopsis on the DVD cover. The story revolves around a football hooligan who turned himself into a gangster who ended up being shot. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are totally unfriendly is the only minor advantage to this movie. In all the action scenes it looks like the camera was stuck on a piece of rope and spinning while people pretended to fight and the story of someone most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens is also a complete waste of time . People talk about how violent the movie is as if it were the sign of a great movie, and although many great movies have violence in them, that's just an excuse for the FX guy to show what he can do. Overall, this movie is a reminder of why the British film industry is extinct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions, the better.
