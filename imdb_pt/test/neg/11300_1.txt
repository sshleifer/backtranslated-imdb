I witnessed some movie atrocities. Over the past two years, it seems producers and directors are committed to making films that take me ever closer to insanity. Hannibal was no exception. I did not expect much when I went to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, "The book is always better than the movie" did not guarantee that this movie would be anything but junk. But what I saw was a movie that made all the other bad movies look better by comparison. <br /> <br /> Normally, when I see a terrible movie, I find it more fun than anything else. Unfortunately, I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a movie that Hannibal is. The movie was filmed with promise, I think. There was Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, and Gary Oldman. And to drive, there was Ridley Scott. There were films with far fewer talents that were tremendously better. There was so much I would have cut out of this movie that I doubt anything remained. It was pathetic. The plot was so ridiculous that it looked like a complete idiot who had written it. The worst thing is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to include, which is sad in the case of a movie in which <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Ray Liotta's brain was being baked into pieces. That scene, more than any other, made me want to cry, because it stained its predecessor to such a monumental level. Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was a two-hour joke. This film should only be seen, if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.
