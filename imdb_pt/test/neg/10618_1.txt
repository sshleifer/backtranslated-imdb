I chose this movie because it looked like a decent movie, and I've always been a fan of foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Although it aims to expose the lives of young and lower-class men in Lima, and to the extent that it happens, the characters are hopelessly superficial and the audience ends up having absolutely no feelings for them. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves mainly around M, he rarely speaks, and his dialogue is, at best, surprisingly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> Attention: some small spoilers. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story revolves around a young man named M who has been looking for jobs, but without success (he he gets a job twice, but quits because they "are not for him", when you are poor, the last option you have is to be picky). Some time is spent with his friends, whose idea of ​​"fun" is to rape a little 14 years of age, steal bad tires from a piece of car for a sack of grass, and several other activities somewhat delayed. M.'s friend comes with a plan to make $ 25,000 a piece and move to the US, taking Cocaine to Miami. When the dealer gives them a job, we are taken to an extremely stupid scene of the three friends who buy clothes at the mall with music playing in the background. We see them experimenting with different clothes, like little girls giving away $ 200 to shop, cutting their hair, and then showing off as slippery thugs (a character, Carlos, will wear dark glasses EVER ... even at night). The day before they leave, the group leader goes out to talk to the dealer, leaving M and his friend to be dumb. They have fun, take samples of the drugs they must run and invade their old school, acting like animals and destroying everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when M tries to call his girlfriend. , which hangs on it. The friends then fire on the pay phone, which brings a lot of boys and an old man armed. M's friend and Carlos, in charge of drug trafficking, appears on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now. Then he takes off alone and is shot by that old man. The police come and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and covers his dead friend with newspapers while the music plays and that ends up in credits. <br /> <br /> End Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see some subtle and redeeming factor for this, but I did not see it. A complete waste of 102 minutes. Although I must give him credit for being direct and not departing from disturbing elements, the cast, acting and general direction still leaves much, much, much to be desired. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a movie that explores the issues you are supposed to, go rent the City of God. Avoid this rubbish at all costs! You were warned !!
