I just saw this at an independent local station in the New York area. The cast showed promise, but when I saw the director, George Cosmotos, I was suspicious. And sure enough, it was as bad, as useless and idiotic as any George Cosmo movie I've ever seen. He's like the Michael Bey of a stupid man - with all the horror the compliment promises. <br /> <br /> There is no point for conspiracy, no problem that incites the conspirators. We are left to ourselves to connect the dots of some graffiti on various walls of the movie to the next. Thus, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million uninsured Americans, stagnant wages, and the demise of the middle class are all overwhelmed by the sheer terror of graphite. /> <br /> A truly incredibly stupid movie.
