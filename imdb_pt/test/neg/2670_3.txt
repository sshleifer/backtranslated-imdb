Avoid this one! It's a terrible movie. So, is it very exciting? All this is just meaningless murder. And the whole thing with the curse of Thorn and Michael, that was the worst thing they could do in the series! Why could not they leave Michael's story a mystery? He should be the bogeyman, not part of some dumb cult !! Ugh! Thank goodness for Halloween H20, which turned out to be Halloween 3-6! They all sucked! But anyway, if you see this movie, expect no more than meaningless murders.
