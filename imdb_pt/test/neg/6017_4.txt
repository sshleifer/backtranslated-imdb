Christopher Guest is the master of mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of the many great documentaries that exist. Zak Penn is no good at either, but he certainly could take a lesson from the other two. The guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the line between the two is always clear in his films, a kind of essential with a mockumentary. Penn could also have a lesson from The Blair Witch Project. Even if you knew it was a fake documentary, you totally bought the world that the filmmakers created. It seems to the public as if the whole thing were real, even though you know deep down that you're watching fiction. In other words, it was fiction disguised as truth. In fact, many of the early viewers watched it, at Sundance and other premiere audiences they thought it was real. Penn, whose forte, by his own admission, is to write on the screen, should probably stick to it. Documentary or mockumentary film-making (and it's hard to say where one starts and the other ends with this film) obviously is not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legitimate documentary about filming a documentary, a kind of meta documentary. Penn, however, confuses audiences and loses his confidence from the very beginning when he walks into Herzog's house before filming Herzog's "Enigma of Loch Ness" about the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a movie that apparently was never finished ?? probably because of Penn interference). Although Penn apparently is the director of the movie we're watching, he starts looking at the cameras and saying, "What's the film crew doing here?" and begins to move away from them. He does this on some other occasions as well. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a trick, but this is never clear, and Penn is seemingly keeping us intentionally in the dark. This leaves the audience scratching their heads and asking, "Who's in charge here?" If Penn is working against her own film crew, what kind of world are we? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to enter only completely into the fictional world (I think) when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But when the monster makes its first appearance, we totally get out of the fictional world that Penn tried to create, so everything seems silly and pointless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in which Penn has the chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and becomes a movie about Penn and his antics instead of to shoot of a documentary. Penn's presence begins to permeate and obfuscate the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Herzog's interviews are compelling and we really believe he's not acting. We even begin to wonder if he and the other members of his team are being deceived by Penn in the same way that the public is, but you're never sure of that. Penn, in his interviews for the camera, tries to be weird and unintentionally funny, as the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary, but he can only be annoying. In a guest movie, this effect is hilarious, while here it falls by surprise because you never know what Penn is. As a result, we, the public, begin to dislike him as much as the team apparently does. Besides the beautiful landscape and the superfluous appearance, out of nowhere, a beautiful model, launched to give the film a seasoning, there is much to recommend here. Perhaps its only redeeming (unintentional) quality is that it is a prime example of why the public is important; and completely ignoring the conventions of the narrative, doing them a disservice. Just for that reason, I think it would be a good movie to show to film students? kind of "what not to do" movie. I have nothing against a film counted in an unconventional way, as long as it is done cleverly, with a thematic basis for giving substance. This movie is completely lacking in that. <br /> <br /> I'd like to call it a brave effort at something, but I'm not sure what it is, other than a complete mess, and finally a waste of time. <br /> <br /> (As a side note: It seems that bad art always makes me think well. <br /> <br /> This film made me think of Lillian Ross's "Picture." Ross followed John Huston during the filming of "The Red Badge of Courage "and brilliantly documented for the New Yorker.It would be a great movie indeed.If you want a great example of meta-art, read it.)
