I like all the different types of movies, so this is not a romantic movie party for a guy who just likes Matrix, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> I just felt like it was a bad movie. I do not feel there was enough of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and, while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall desperately in love and helpless ?? It is not realistic. This movie did not make me believe it and feel it emotionally and this is something that you are looking for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If anyone can relate to them falling in love so quickly, without any true substance, so be it. You are neither right nor wrong. Another very unbelievable aspect to the film was the very rude daughter of Diane Lane becoming nice and friendly at the end of the movie. Will a teenager who is so unhappy and annoyed at her mother for not having her husband cheat back will have a switch turned on and be cool? This movie, in a nutshell, had some great names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
