This film is shown as an English version of an ABC after-school special with nudity. This makes you wonder who the target audience is. It's not as if writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot. Although it has a certain capacity of observation, the Virtual Sexuality is softer than the meringue of dandelion. It's a good movie to watch if you're in the snow, the cable is out, and it's the only tape you have.
