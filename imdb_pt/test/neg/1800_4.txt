Heart of Darkness Movie Review The Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad is quite somber, deep and very deep. I would have to say that reading the novel is so much better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik, was totally the wrong actor to play the role. He fit the character in "Of Mice and Men". The film left out some important parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story. <br /> <br /> The movie is poorly edited. Shows many non-important and annoying flashes. In the novel he has a very suspenseful atmosphere, but in the movie he does not have that kind of feeling. In the book there is so much that was left to the reader's imagination. For example, when Marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that the whole scene was left out of the film. In the novel, Marlow waited a long time for the rivets to come to him to repair his boat. This was a great source of futility in the novel. The movie added more parts that were useless and did not make sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz broke the monkey's neck and killed him. This kind of just ruined everything, it did not make any sense to me, which always happened. So my suggestion to you is not to see the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and will interpret the story better. <br /> <br /> ~ Chris C.
