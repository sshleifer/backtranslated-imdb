Half a mystic thriller and half the fractured fantasies of a fragile mind, "Border Guardian" is an engaging journey that soon deflects. A strong image and a convincing premise are soon subjugated by incoherent conspiracies, trivial dialogues, amateur acting, and the most strange and exaggerated phallic images of recent memory (here, a fish is definitely not just a fish!). Of course, this is the first Slovenian feature film to be directed by a woman - Mrs Weiss must have been determined to prove that she could be as lugubrious and gratuitous as any man.
