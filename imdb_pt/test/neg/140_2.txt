The success of the original French series "Emmanuelle" (I just watched the first, which was not too bad considering) led to a series of imitations; the Italian counterpart, who even changed his heroine's race, was clearly less polite and more exploitative - descending increasingly to vulgarity as the series passed. Incredibly, there were 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies in total, with heroine even spelling her name changed to avoid copyright issues !! Still, Laura Gemser - the object of desire - has become almost as iconic as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (though, personally, she is too thin for my taste)! Here she is even called "Emanuelle" and not with her real name - with the director, in the same way, becoming "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film offers little interest: in fact, it would be better to approach it as a travel diary with decent images of African wildlife. As for the sex scenes, I do not know how complete the version I saw was but, while there was a lot of nudity, none of this was very explicit - or even exciting (the scene that came closest, perhaps, was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and his companion Karin Schubert exchange the camera for each other, naturally without clothes, in the middle of the jungle! The film also features an artist made to look like Salvador Dali, but fortunately, perhaps, his scenes do not occupy much of the picture. The score of Nico Fidenco is typically insipid in the 70's and, in fact, nothing that can be written.
