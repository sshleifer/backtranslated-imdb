I see this film as a poor tribute to horror movies. Because it really does not stick to the '70s and' 80s of the gold age of terror, of course that's where personal taste comes in. <br /> <br /> This movie falls into the category of "New generation of slashers" in my book, the cast are the typical 18-24 years and potential models. I personally am quite tired of this image in horror movies, the old movies at least had some variation in people. One or more fat people and imbeciles in general. Simply looking for people, of course having a couple of good viewers is good they've always been there. But when the whole cast is just a bunch of shelves and asses, it's getting silly. I mean, okay, yes, I like to see HOT GIRLS. But not in a horror that should reflect some ordinary people being hunted by a maniac who uses a knife ... You expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street. I think. There are, of course, some movies with just good viewers which is perfectly alright, but they are not many. "Wrong turn" is an example of the best. <br /> <br /> The next point is the murder scenes that slashers should have. In this poor movie, all you can see are 2-3 frames of sound / sudden scream and music in crescendo. And that's it. The little you can see is not very graphic, not for people who have seen some horrors over the years. Old school slashers compared to this had much more and better death, blood and blood. Not to mention the killers in those films, which went beyond what you can see here. <br /> <br /> As for true horror fans, it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the originalities. that appears, the killer on this one does not add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone stated earlier, the CGI is something I hate to watch. Personally, I prefer makeup, in that sense I'm conservative (unless the CGI is really well done). But the most important thing is to set a good environment that allows you to "get into the movie," a good background story is a very good thing. Also revealing and explaining a lot of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away the whole sense of mystique that adds a lot of humor, and does not give you much to think about. Just as an example: keeping the murderers' story a complete mystery to the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean, if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail, then there's too much content left for the viewer to reflect on ... It's like watching a porn movie and waiting for a great movie. however, history. <br /> <br /> Why do old school slashers still work, at least for some people. It's because they are established cult films from the time they were a new thing, making new ones of this type today is admittedly difficult. The exception may be for people who are younger in this type of horrors, of course. I have noticed that many people like this kind of horror movies, so of course there is no "right taste" for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for people who can share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference what to expect from this movie.
