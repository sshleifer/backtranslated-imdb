Why did I have to go out and buy (yes, buy!) JACK FROST 2: VOWING THE WOOD SNOWMAN MATCHES ??? Maybe it was an explosion of temporary mental disorder? But I think it's because I liked the first JACK FROST. It was a silly but funny horror comedy that had some positive effects by Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel there was a nice picture of that face impaled by this giant pendant (coming out of the mouth with lots of blood and all). So I thought: if you're as stupid as the first and have some good splatter / gore, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> Let me first say that the film deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plan. I mean, a mutated killer snowman on a tropical island that breeds mutant killer baby snowballs that can only be killed or harmed by bananas ??? As much as I love the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (apparently being filmed in real film and all), this sequel has the look of a third-rate novel. It has a very simple look to shoot on video. The lighting is simply awful (bright white patches for the day, and dull colors like blue and green at night). The acting ... well, not even going there. The dialogues range from rigid to extremely senile (the Jamaican man was just an idiot, saying "man" after every sentence). And when it comes to the snowman's murderer's voice, all I could think about was a seventh Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY spitting idiots and supposedly witty before killing anyone. <br /> <br /> The best joke was an expensive question "Why are you talking to your watch?". And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian girl popping out of nowhere and taking a dip in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). Oh yeah, and that little scene about the final credits with those two Japanese guys on a miniature ship being too dubious made me laugh too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the bloody and sprawled action that everyone is talking about? There were many occasions to show some decent and bloody murders. Many people were killed in original ways here, but all off the screen. As I read in many other comments, there were indeed legal arrangements for an explosion in the head, a crushed body, eyes being plucked, tongue torn, ... but at crucial times the editor cut off for some blood spattered on the floor or anything. That front shot of that British guy being impaled (on the back of the DVD) was not even in the movie. I only saw that particular killing filmed from behind (meaning I did not see sh! T!). I was waiting all through the movie for this to happen, and then I did not see anything?!?! What a disappointment! Did I see a reduced version of the movie? That would be a shame because only a decent amount of fun could have saved that movie if you ask me. Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just did not cut it for me. Speaking of these snowballs: they were made very badly. They made the MUNCHIES look like "animatronic" last generation. But I think that was the main point of it. At some point, the special effects team came to use a little laughable CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. The best thing is not to see, actually, because this movie is really bad (okay, I laughed about it, because it gets worse and worse). Just stick with the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be fine (just in mind it's a very silly but fun comedy by itself). <br /> <br /> It's Funny, But Writer Director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized he was a lousy director after JACK FROST 2, and then focused on writing. It turns out that he wrote two great suspense scripts for THE I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So the man seems to have some talent at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> Now it would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible. Then I say a point to that naked Asian cat doing the skinny dip and a spot for those completely retarded snowball babies. Way to go Mr. Cooney!
