It should be remembered that the Gammera films, like many of Gozilla's first-grade films, were, in fact, aimed directly at the children. Little Kenny and his comrades are living the reveries of the children in the audience: they run and play with super-secret things while the adults wait and allow; they start playing with monsters, and even when the bad guys come in, they are never in real danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first Gammera movie is an aberration because the child is punished and put in danger. , but the rest of the series is pure fulfillment of desires. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer put it, these are not flighty adult movies, but rather hit films for children.
