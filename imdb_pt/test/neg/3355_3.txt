I actually tried, but this movie just did not work for me. The action scenes were monotonous, the acting was surprisingly weak, and some of these characters were very stereotyped even to be funny. Pam Grier tries, but when you have nothing to work on, even your considerable talent can not prevent a disaster. Even by the standards of this weak genre, this movie is very bad.
