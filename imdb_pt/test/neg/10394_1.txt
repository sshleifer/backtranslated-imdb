The film began very well ... until now the exorcism of Isabelle could be believed .... but then, dammit !!! I did not know if it was a horror movie, a drama or a must not see one! The creature possessed attacking the sheriff had no connection to the movie ... the makeup !! Well, it looked pretty real at first, but in the end, the last part of the movie, the makeup (especially the teeth and eyes) was too exaggerated. If you want a good "Exorcism" movie, watch "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". <br /> <br /> Along with "Hard Candy" (Completely boring and pathetic), these two films are the worst. seen from Lionsgate !! Well, the movie company has given horror movie fans great movies, but with this movie, you'll never want to rent it !! Fans of exorcism films, just stick with two "The Exorcist" and "Exorcism Emily Rose"
