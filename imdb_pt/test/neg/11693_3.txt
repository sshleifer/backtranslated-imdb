I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most of the horrors in between. So I got the 'Acacia' DVD in the post and I was looking forward to a slow build up of ever-increasing tension and scary kids with strange and disjointed movements hidden in duvets. <br /> <br /> The main selling point of this film was that it has a much more linear plot than many of those - you understand who the characters are, where they are from, and what they do. You get the basics (good couple, you can not have children) and realize that the premise is too normal for something strange NOT to happen. <br /> <br /> And then comes the evil. The number one complaint is that the story is obvious. I understood almost the moment the boy hugged the tree. I knew where the movie was going and was able to predict the order of death and why. <br /> <br /> The issue is shocking and, unfortunately, not for the benefit of the movie. Even though I'm still pondering the events, the tension is not allowed because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final gripe is this ... the tree was unnecessary. This would have been a perfectly good tale of subtle horror, with only the couple breaking the child's death - the tree holder did not buy anything new or exciting for the movie. So, I'm going to finish where I started - my overall impression was 'Oh'.
