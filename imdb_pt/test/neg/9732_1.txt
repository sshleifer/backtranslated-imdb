It seems like whenever a movie company wants to make teen movies, it focuses on just one thing: sex. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a prude, but the fact that these people seem to think about getting rid of everything is what interests me is highly offensive. Take The Convenant, a movie that depends so much on you to find the main characters that you think you can escape without a plot and / or script that has not been written by a six year old. This is essentially the craft with (supposedly) warm faces. And yes, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually makes us bad movies, hated it. It's really incredibly bad in that it can actually be funny. I would have laughed were it not for the fact that several other women in the movie theater seemed to enjoy it. They were accompanied by several cunning-looking guys who positively rolled up and died when the boy (really clich√©d) in boy kiss happened at the end. Watching them squirm was really the highlight of the movie. I do not think Hollywood cinema will produce good movies for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone), so I think I'll give up. Unless you're a teenager who likes The Pussycat Dolls, you think Paris Hilton is "hot" and watching MTV is like some kind of wasteland. Life is difficult when you're fifteen and you like an art house. :( Q. Someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls think they would be members of boy bands "totally HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
