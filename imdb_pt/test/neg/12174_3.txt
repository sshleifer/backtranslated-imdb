I'm completely surprised at how super-rated "Cemetery Man" is among the horror fans! Now, I usually get movies that mix two or more kinds of genre styles into one and I love almost every zombie comedy I've ever seen. To my amazement, this Italian cult classic really did not show me much to be very enthusiastic ... It follows the unusual duties of a full-time graveyard keeper and his retarded, son-in-law, Joe Curly. looking assistant as they seem to dispose of mostly the recently deceased who leave the ground seven days after their initial death. He meets a widow who he "wows" with a horrendous atmosphere of grave yard and develops a fast romance, soon having sex with her in the grave of his deceased husband. Her husband's body jumps alive and bites her, triggering a series of events that seem to consume the rest of the film. "Cemetery Man" tries to incorporate all possible elements, such as horror, romance, comedy, action and failure entirely in the long run. He advances, never concentrates on any aspect long enough to make it interesting to the viewer, such as the relationship of the pot-bellied helper with a vivid cut head, a zombie walking motorcycle coming off the ground, the main character deciding to knock down random people in the sidewalk, etc. This thing is so complicated and monotonous that it is almost impossible to take it seriously. Of course, it's elegant and often "elegant," but even the most "artistic" movies need the right kind of lineage to allow it to make sense. "Cemetery Man" advances, seeming unable to concentrate on something for more than a few minutes, which becomes very tiring after a while. People argue that "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie." Frankly, when it comes to zombies, I do not want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... There is a bit of blood and nudity - especially in scenes where he wants to play "horror movie" but not enough to compensate the lack of intransigent structure. Terrible movie.
