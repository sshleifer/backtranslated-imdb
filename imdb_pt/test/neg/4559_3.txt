Ugghhh !!! This is exactly the kind of Pre-Code movie that could incorrectly convince the viewer that films from that period are bad - and they are NOT - it's just that this particular movie is horrible. Horrible because while the film struggles a lot to be "hip" and "adult", it's also so hopelessly old-fashioned, boring and mushy that I was torn between laughing at the movie or just falling asleep !! This is a unique combination, to say the least. <br /> <br /> So why exactly did I hate it so much? Well, the film is unbelievably sleazy, but it has no style and the film is made to shock, but it has no subtlety and takes many ridiculous turns to be believable. The movie begins with a clich√© - a prostitute with a heart of gold. Dorothy Mackaill is a prostitute and she seems to accidentally kill a man! Shortly after running away, she meets an old boyfriend who insists on marrying her (he does not realize her profession). Seeing the innate goodness of this man, she decides to change her life and stop living the wildlife. This is difficult when she hides on a fictional Caribbean island. Here, alone and waiting for her man to return, there is nothing to do and the place is infested with super-excited and totally unpleasant men. In fact, this part of the film is so monotonous that audiences may find it difficult to stay focused. The men on the island are so inflamed by Mackaill's presence that they seem perpetually on the verge of raping her-only to be rejected because she's no longer that kind of girl. Frankly, I've gotten tired of all those lascivious scenes - there's just too much movement and wagging to make it look like something other than a really bad movie. And looking at all those ugly dogs was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> But wait, it gets much worse. The man she thought she killed appears on this little island (what are the odds?) And he tries to rape her too. However, it is not to be dissuaded and she ends up shooting to save her newfound virtue. While the jury on the island is about to absolve her, she runs back to court and mind - saying that she intended to kill the man and was premeditated (?) Because even though she is acquitted, she knows that the wicked jailer will have his walk with her when she is sent to jail on a gun charge charge. Since the jailer himself gave her the gun to ride her, she running to the court and saying she was guilty seemed very, very silly. Why did not she just tell them the twisted plan of the jailer? Supposedly she did this to preserve her virtue, but admit to having killed someone, so will people think you're a virgin ?! So, to avoid a short prison sentence (and, once again, the threat of rape), she does not consider telling the court that he is trying to force her into a sexually compromising situation (the jailer has promised to rape her). when it's locked). And just before being taken to the gallows (in order to avoid rape), the boyfriend appears in time to send him away and the credits. <br /> <br /> Situation impossible and coincidences abound. Seeing so many times that the movie is just stupid. Combining this with all the sexual innuendoes, this creates a bad, dirty mess of a movie that will only attract the most die-hard fans of pre-coded movies. Everyone else, beware, this is very sticky and silly from start to finish!
