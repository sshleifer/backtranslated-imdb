The only thing he has to offer are the interesting opposites of Tru and Jack, their choices and points of view, and the philosophical questions he raises. Tru feels she's helping people who should not die, and Jack thinks they should die, and she's messing with the plan of fate, or the plane of the universe, or something. <br /> <br /> But she is obviously able to change things, so obviously there is no such thing as destiny in the metaphysics of the series. Jack has no basis to believe he exists. And very conveniently, Tru never asks the right questions. No one does. Which obviously proves that the creators of the series do not have an answer. <br /> <br /> There is simply no plot! <br /> <br /> Instead, they leave everything obscure for the series to be able to continue with their boring girl thing, only occasionally interrupted by Tru and Jack running against each other toward ends that are unknown ... <br /> <br /> It turns out there's nothing to it. A teen pop series with the one that pretends to be something else. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent sleeping.
