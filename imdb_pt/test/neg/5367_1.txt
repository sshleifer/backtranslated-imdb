There really are no redeeming factors about this show. For simplicity, it is simply terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's just a spectacle of terrible "reality." Not only that, it's a terrible fiction. Imagine this: a group of overly imaginative teenagers get together one night and say, "Hey! Let's do a paranormal show like" Ghost Hunters "and everything! So they pick up a camera, chase down locals and film random landscapes behind a monologue painfully "trying to be dramatic, even if unsuccessful." This show is basically a lot of teens running around with a homemade movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show really has a budget and writers. A wasted budget and terrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the problems, as I tell you? Well, first of all let's talk about it from a personal level. I'm not totally skeptical when it comes to the paranormal. I am willing to believe in what is paranormal and what is not, and I am sure there are many people who feel the same. So if you are going to do a show about the paranormal, you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they are seeing is paranormal or not because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. I hate comparing, but I do not see why not this time. Take "Ghost Hunters" for example. In "Ghost Hunters" you can tell that the cast is flush with the audience. They are not totally skeptical, but are still willing to keep in mind the possibility of any paranormal anomalies. They have to look at something and be willing to say "this is possible that it is simply nothing". And with that in mind, they decided to try to prove they were wrong. They use technology and several other gadgets along with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal along with the fact that what they may be monitoring could be nothing in mind. Not only are they trying to convince themselves of what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. This element of doubt is not present in "Paranormal State". Hit one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State", the cast simply says "there's a scary place, and its HAUNTED, so let's find some SPIRITS!" And immediately you know and say to yourself, "Okay, convince me otherwise." The cast is not professional in their interviews. In fact, it sometimes seems that they are just harassing the locals of these so-called "haunted" areas. They have no real evidence to support their claims other than assumptions and theories, and the best they can do is someone who "says" to be able to contact the dead without anyone backing up who that person is and who they really are valid They could easily have picked some random people on the street and said "pretend you can get in touch with spirits for our show" and went there. In the episode "Mothman", this only happens. Without any convincing evidence at the end of the show, they bring this kind of individual out, where he does a randomly and painfully scripted "reading" of an alleged area of ​​how something is "haunted" to convince his audience. Very, very little effort. I feel that one of the main problems of the program is that it seems scripted. During one of the episodes, the cast is attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" sometimes, in an attempt to be dramatic. That kind of dramatic sequel would make any skeptical laugh and even those on the wall realize what they're watching is just a bunch of tabloid-esquire rubbish. If the aim of the program was to try to convince the public that these "paranormal" events are real, they are doing a terribly poor job of doing so. Strike two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always the meter. Just one last point of view to see if the show really worth anything. What if the show is not trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction? He also fails on that level as well. If the creators of the program were trying to create fiction to entertain the audience, writing is very poor and even on a fictitious level, it fails to convince the audience that their cast members are actually experiencing the unknown in all its full glory and horrifying Writing is simply not convincing and even, I daresay, boring. Attack three. So what's left of this show is simply a bunch of teens who are too willing or too gullible to believe in the paranormal simply because it's simply so much more incredible than the reality that set off with a camera, bad script and bad actors usually only make a very bad horror documentary. That's all the show is at the moment. There is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no reason to worry about it. To be frank, its lame. There is absolutely no redeeming factor about this show.
