Do you know what farmers spray in the fields? That's right - manure, so when the BBC decided to make a very sensational conspiracy thriller about GMOs and cultivating what we got was one of the most stinking manure the BBC inflicted on your audience! SPOILERS !!!! GOLDEN FIELDS opens with a group of masked scientists in a laboratory where a female scientist (According to the BBC all fashionable scientists are women) announces "A new lineage of wheat that will save the third world of hunger, "then the story shifts to another equally bland scene. If you're going to make a thriller of any kind, should not you open it with a hook that grabs the audience? PHYSICIAN WHO WAS BRILLIANT IN THIS, LIKE THE X-FILES, WHILE 28 DAYS LATER was opened with a hook that was held in a laboratory. I think someone on the BBC did not think this thriller needed a hook because viewers had trailers down their throats weeks in advance. As the (not very exciting) story continues with some is a drunken man with inferior morals to Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush combined, while the other is a feminine journalist full of virtue) investigating patients at a county hospital that may be being expelled through "mercy killings." It is at this moment that things start to get confused when the journalist is threatened by MI5 haunts and the first episode ends with the main MI5 assassin being murdered. <br /> <br /> The second episode reveals that county hospital patients dying for being infected with a VRSA superbug. This is when things go completely haywire. Throughout FIELDS OF GOLD, the public was led to believe that the intelligence services and the company shown in the opening sequence were behind the killings - but they are not. It turns out that the villain is an organic farmer who manufactures the VRSA superbug in his bedroom and the story ends with the work of the MATRIX camera with the drunken male journalist firing a field full of VRSA, thus spreading the superbug across the land . I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD. At the time of its broadcast, I was a member of the Green Party and Greenpeace. Since then I have given up my time in the environmental movement, but even now I am somewhat offended with the way environmentalists are portrayed here and having the villain spreading a fatal genetically modified virus as an alert to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very silly. It's a bit like a CND member releasing a nuclear bomb in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war. I was also slightly offended with how the male characters were written as bastards, while all women were highly intelligent and morally superior to men. There are also other issues with the script, especially with regard to VRSA. If, unlike the writers, you spend some time researching VRSA, you'll see that it's completely different from what's seen here. Oh, and if you set the diesel on fire, it will not explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it looks like the structure of JEEPERS CREEPERS, in which the last ten minutes contradict most of what was before. Where, as JEEPERS CREEPERS lasted only about 90 minutes, FIELDS OF GOLD lasted twice that, so it's doubly annoying and illogical. As a footnote environmentalism never makes a good subject for a thriller (Does anyone remember those Steven Segal films?) And it's about the time that TV and movie producers realized
