Dead Man's Bounty (American film title) has the look of a Western Italian classic. The cinematography, costumes and scenery look great. The cast is sturdy, not a pretty face between them. At first I was getting ready for a really cool movie, but what I ended up witnessing was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was perfectly terrible. There was no suspense and very little action or a worthwhile drama. <br /> <br /> Although it looked great, the cast spoke in strong European accents that were often unintelligible. <br /> <br /> The final The nail in his coffin was the broad pretense that paints most of the image, focusing heavily on the waitress character who appears in some very clumsy sex scenes. Also, his speech near the end was pretty disgusting! <br /> <br /> The only novelty comes from the cast of Val Kilmer as the dead man, continuing his recent series of DOA performances!
