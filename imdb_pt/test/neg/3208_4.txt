Sending the Bugs to space seems like a fun idea, but was there really any need for a third movie, let alone this room? A movie with Brad Dourif can not be all bad, can you? Well, maybe in this case. This inexpensive sci-fi effort stars returning kindly Klutz Charlie (the trusty Don Keith Opper), who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of Critters' species, when Ugh (Terrence Mann) tells him that he is about to break some type of Trans-Galactic Law of Endangered Species. Then, at Ugh's request, Charlie puts the two eggs into special holders inside a spaceship. Unfortunately for Charlie, the damn thing takes off through space and it's stuck inside. The smoke beneath his feet puts him in hibernation stasis and he wakes up 53 years later inside a decrepit space station like Captain Rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malice, and greedy until the nucleus is exploding space pod trying to see what possible novelties are in for possible sale or trade. Rick, unbeknownst to him, releases the two creatures that feed on his flesh. You see, Rick and his team found the space pod adrift and they had intense dollar signs winking in their eyes to get them to dock. Ugh reports to them (now in an excellent and prominent position as Advisor) that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the Terracor organization. Once the crew dock, they find that this station is in ruin with many aisles in poor condition, but what is worse is the computer station Angela. Angela is a real thorn in the crew side because she went without repairs without proper maintenance for some time. It takes some little tricks to get the doors open and close, not to mention the elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, practically the entrepreneur of computer functions (and is practically the true leader of the group because he is the most balanced and intelligent). He seems to be a paternal figure for Ethan (Paul Witthorne), who just wants to get to earth to find his father .. this story, though not necessarily reach zenith. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is mainly in the movie to be a drug victim for the chew creatures. In the movie, Charlie, after a bug gets into Rick's mouth and eat his throat (yuk), becomes the team's guide in understanding what they are fighting. The film has some elements that I find quite confusing (or for a better word, ridiculous) .. the two creatures grow rapidly in size, are somehow able to coordinate a ship to Earth, not to mention grow to huge size in this laboratory on the space station. The crew is able to tap into a record of a Dr. McCormick {Anne Ramsay, whose badge is found on a coat thrown to the side to which Ethan discovers his access card} which shows signs that Terracor was looking to breed a species to exterminate worlds and people. Knowing this bothers Al Bert, who wants to leave Angela and her bleeding season for greener pastures. Things do not work that way, because well-meaning Charlie (thanks in part to Al Bert's "old" Colt .45) kills an animal that has come on board, but by firing several bullets it hits the main guidance systems of the ship. So many repairs in order, but they stop when Ugh and his shock troops dock at Angela and prove that they are not what Charlie thought they would be. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the Crites for purposes of cruel nature (representation of corrupt government types of corporations?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie ... he may have grown a little bit (a little bit) and now he understands that some people only change for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will face the creatures ... will the crew be able to escape a space station that has defined self-destruction? This movie does not really exploit creatures as much as the other three movies. I believe we can clearly see this as the true end of the franchise. The first movie was a joke ... a really fun joke. But by the time this sequence arrived, the creatures were only welcome. The cast, however, gives a boost to the film. The creatures can feed themselves a little, but their plans for global domination are underdeveloped. His role in the film is not set to the highest heights. I said to myself, you have this huge space station with unfortunate prisoners on board ... could not you get that idea and run with it? Unfortunately, they do not.
