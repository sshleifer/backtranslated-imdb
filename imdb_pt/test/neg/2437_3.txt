It's hard to say who this movie is for; the characterization and style of a series "Children's ITV" crossed with an Australian soap, but the subject, nudity and language target an older audience. <br /> <br /> The first half hour has heroin. Justine philosophizing about losing her virginity, and it's terribly embarrassing for anyone over 18. A complete theft of "Ferris Bueller", from the most talked about part of the camera to the graphics on the screen. <br /> Your nerd friend Chas takes you to a computer fair where an explosion while using a virtual reality machine turns her into a man. Or, in fact, it creates a masculine alter ego of her, called Jake. Do not look at me like that; I'm just reporting the way it was shown. <br /> <br /> After that, the film is slightly amused for a while; among all theater school robberies, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a true comedic touch to his role as a woman, Jake, trapped in a man's body. There are some funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new feelings; nothing that you have not seen before, but in this movie you will cling to anything that is fun. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Justine and Jake meet, and hilarious antics happen (I desire), involving the owners of the virtuality machine who wants to kidnap Jake to have sex with him, or examine him, or something like that . Either way, it's just an excuse to fill in an extra half hour with some blasts and car chases; for such a cheap film, the explosions come frequently and loudly, suggesting that the money was spent in all the wrong places. <br /> <br /> In the end, the heroine realizes that she can not fall in love with herself, erases her alter ego, and ends up in one night with the nerd to lose her virginity (presumably it is what is meant to happen to a happy ending in the 1990s). But only after he takes off his glasses and puts on some hair gel and a leather jacket; God forbid to have sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of PC movies that tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it's refreshingly reactionary to have a movie that screams "AS YOU!" in you, and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve. <br /> <br /> The characterization is simple, terrible; the nerd is very nerd (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardation, virginity, no leather jacket), has a slut, she is very naughty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, accompanying music vampy), has a jock , he's fine ... you get the picture. You can get away with this kind of characterization in a broad comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not very funny. It's only slightly fun in some parts and excruciating in others. It takes a lot for a woman as cute as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to annoy me, but she does. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title; there's absolutely nothing erotic about the movie, and it does not deal with the topics of how new communication technologies are changing the way we see and get relationships (unless you think there's a chance your PlayStation will explode and change your gender ). <br /> <br />
