It's funny how the reviews for this movie were consistently downhill, now add mine. I think the script could have been saved by a better acting, and acting for a better script. Together it was difficult to watch, and I do not retreat from such a subject. Sigourney was the best part (I thought the relationship between her and her surviving son was pretty much the only new thing this movie offered to her genre), but even she was left behind. I can not blame her, who knows what leads were left on the court room floor by the director and / or editor. The whole movie had an "okay, that's good enough, let's move on," when I knew there was more to be extracted from the actors and the script, which had some good lines and some interesting themes. <BR> I do not think this counts as a spoiler, but a perfect example is the scene where Sigourney goes to the house of his son's supposed torment and has that look on his face and I thought "this is the face of someone who is exaggerating what it is to see someone living in a mobile home "and sure enough, the next shot, means to shock us, I'm sure, the bully lives in a trailer as opposed to a legal house, like hers. <br /> <As many other posters have pointed out, there are SO MANY better movies with similarly airy scripts about cluttered families that play the notes better - "Celebration" is probably the best example I have ever seen.
