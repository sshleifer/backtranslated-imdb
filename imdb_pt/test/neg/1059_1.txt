Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we're all idiots. If not, how should we understand this: <br /> <br /> American pilots take off on Mig-29s. Suddenly, all aircraft turn to the F-16s. There is magic! After an action ... Migs earth. The magic again! <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention that the F-16s had Israeli markings? <br /> <br /> Another spell: obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bombing enemies. <br /> <br /> And more magic: while every movie is set in Europe, we can see a desert on almost any flight. Perhaps the director has squandered all his magic on the above things because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic and the explosions also look terrible as if the pilots were bombarded with Molotovs. <br /> <br /> OK, OK this is a movie. I should write about your story ... wait. A story? Yes, there is some story in this movie. And it's horrible too.
