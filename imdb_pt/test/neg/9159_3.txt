I honestly thought this movie would be cheesy, even though I've enjoyed Alvin and the Chipmunks for a long time! I was very wrong. IT WAS GREAT!!! It was the best movie I've seen since October! In my opinion, it's the movie that everyone should see this holiday season! Enchanted (I thought anyway ...) was horrible, The Golden Compass was alright, but the ending was pretty bad for fans of Dark Materials, and I Am Legend, well I have not seen it (or National Treasures 2) but it looks okay. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything, but this movie is great for anyone, especially children!
