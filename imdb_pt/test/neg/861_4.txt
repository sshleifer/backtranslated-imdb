Sylvester the clandestine cat upon a ship the Tweety bird happens to be with his owner Granny. Oh, I do not even have enough words to express how much I despise the Tweety and Granny characters. They simply are not funny to me and have made this short enough the task of actually sitting down. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but there's so much he can do when he comes across the huge horror of that damn old witch's senile witch from a grandmother. This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
