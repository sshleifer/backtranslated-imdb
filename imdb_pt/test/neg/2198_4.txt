Computing . Can there be something more annoying? Sitting in front of a computer all day typing a few keys all day long, tapping. That's the big problem with this movie, the heroine sits in front of a computer VDU playing the keys and no matter how many shaking looks she gives, or how many suspense notes the composer plays or how many extreme closes the director uses there is not much excitement about the fact that there are few things less exciting than watching someone on a computer. <br /> <br /> There are a few other problems, many of them factual errors about how computers work. Is it possible to break into a computer that is disconnected and not connected to the Internet? I think that when THE NET was created 10 years ago, very few people would understand how computers worked so writers could study at length, but now we live in a global village where almost every home in the Western world has its own computer. The public is certainly very well informed about the factual errors of this film. And of course there are many cases where someone acts stupidly or out of character at crucial moments in order to progress in the plot, which makes THE NET a very mediocre movie.
