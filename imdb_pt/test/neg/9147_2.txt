This version of "The Magic Flute" is not only the worst production of the great Mozart opera I have ever seen, it is also the worst video production I have ever seen in any opera. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of opera and I have more opera on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheesy. Papageno does not even have a bird costume. He's just dressed as a guy. The sound is in mono. The color is very bad. It is saturated with orange. Most DVDs of this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with it. In addition, the language was changed to Swedish rather than the original German. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie version of "The Magic Flute". It's a filmed performance and it's not a good performance and it was not filmed very well. You can choose any other DVD available from this opera and I guarantee it will be better than this. My preference is for the version led by James Levine with David Hockney sets.
