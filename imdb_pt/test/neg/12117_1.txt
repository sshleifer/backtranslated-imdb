Any night with Jonathan Ross now means to me his wit at first bothering and disturbing with carefully chosen words a 78-year-old man on the phone and then suggesting that he and Russell Brand should masturbate while he slept as a way to apologize. for making obscene phone calls to him. Kinky! It's illegal. For a really big laugh, maybe next time he should try on someone he knows well, like his boss? Or a follower of Abu Hamza? Would he have fun if someone did this to one of his daughters? <br /> <br /> Over the years, I may have seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC chat show Star Man Ross because I find it so disgusting, some of the guests I saw were OK though - probably most of them that have appeared were OK for everything I know. As a chat show it looks very poor though? What's so talkative about asking Tory leader David Cameron on this TV show if he ever masturbated with photos of Margaret Thatcher? He talked to Gwyneth Paltrow simply asking if she wanted to fuck him. However, Ross's yob mentality was finally fully exposed with the above revelations, and I thought to take the opportunity to warn the few decent people around the world who might not know how vile this man is and stay away from him and his companions. - unless you think all comedy should be "daring," that is, obscene / empty. We're not all the same here, though the BBC and Channel 4 are dropping all standards. <br /> <br /> In October 2008, Ross, with the naive Russell Brand, made a series of obscene and premeditated sexual phone calls to Andrew Sachs. The answer-phone (Manuel de Fawlty Towers) broadcast it as intended on BBC national radio against Sachs 'request and then attempted to have Sachs' granddaughter burn the evidence if they were sued. A significant number of people here (probably most of them non-paying the BBC license fee) found hilarious and / or that the national scandal was exaggerated, but many people apparently still knew the right wrong and 42,851 complained to the BBC about the incident . Many unfair and other media fools silently laughed about these 42,851 never having heard the radio program (and never wanting) - using their argument they presumably also consider an event like the Holocaust justified because at that time relatively few people complained to the media, and none of us here should be horrified at this because we were not there. The two BBC producers initially involved in broadcasting it thought it was a "very funny and brilliant" comedy and only 2 people complained about Brand's radio program at the time - that I'm only afraid to state the moral level that its 400,000 listeners with the BBC's specialty help. Highly moral BBC tried and failed to use it in mitigation in later investigation OFCOM. Roll over Aristotle, tell the story to Lord Reith! Sachs' agent complained to the BBC but was ignored by them until a conservative national newspaper took over the story. The penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally be dismissal and prosecution, maybe even imprisonment, but while Brand and BBC Radio 2's chief were ordered to resign from the multi-millionaire, Ross received a 12-week holiday from the BBC's chief. I suppose he first asked for Ross's permission if he could pay Ross's salary at £ 1,500,000 to prevent him from prosecuting to return to this program again in 2009 before his contract expired. All this time to think of more obscenities and / or insensitive insults for his 4,000,000 viewers to admire - but at least he can still laugh his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up. Some people think that their position will be unsustainable and it can not continue. I think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back breathless and re-energized with repressed vitriol. (Update 23.01.09: I've just seen the first 5 minutes of your new series - the "most massive pau-up" - to use your referential phrase - continues to allow this law-breaker who does not regret receiving the public's money But who knows, perhaps in the future, after the scanty British film and TV industry comforted him by the moral stance taken by the 42,851 and charged him with prizes, he will become lord by his services to the perversity of perverts in Government. that this pair of nervous deviants sign up for other perverted commercial TV and radio stations and stay there, so I will not pay to disrespect the law and disregard illegal obscenities in the future.In 2009, OFCOM fined TV license fee payers British £ 150,000 for this case "sorry" - Thank you Ross for offering to pay! <br /> <br /> For the apologists: Get a life / sense of humor / sense of proportion! It's not the end of the world have one pair of untalented perverts as your heroes and there are far more important things to worry about in this world, like the price of real cheese! To sum up the family man, Dross: a comedy genius for seemingly millions of people (especially himself), just a nasty obscene phone call getting an obscene salary package from an obscene multimedia company to others. So much for our society of political correctness and respect! As you may have guessed, this does not apply to the rich and famous and will never be, but only to the poor. To sum up the BBC: Stumbling blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Phonegate now Rossgate, I hope your next crisis is Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks that comedy should always be challenging and pushing backward, that is, offensive, is not challenged or offended by my opinion of this pervert pervert, his perverted programs, and his perverted current bosses.
