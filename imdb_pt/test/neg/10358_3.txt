Cruddy, innocent..not smoking, drinking or riding a motorcycle, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make it morally viable for a bad biker movie, post-biker (feat). They knew that, we knew that ... Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted ... but they lived. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best Performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY one to actually get the latest exploration scooter movie after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew that. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (from two bad Elvis movies, TICKLE ME and something bad) in yellow and leather is the modern hot with J. Slate fighting for honor. Worth seeing, but it sucks. But check it out. Well worth non-biker, non-smoker, non-boozing, "biker" types with yummy.
