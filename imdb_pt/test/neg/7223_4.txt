Richard Donner shows his liberal credentials with this ridiculously over-cooked simplistic attack on South African politics. It is not as if America were the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and more irony is added by the fact that the film is set in the country. city ​​that was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the Police Department that so much made up for community relations with his brutal racist behavior. So the pair of Donner's salt and pepper that clearly has a teenage passion for each other does its own thing with disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one cares because the thugs are white South Africans - certainly one worrying example of police racism in itself? Within Rudd's office (Joss Ackland - eminently hissable) the decoration is designed and illuminated to resemble the Fuhrerbunker as much as possible, and in case any dumb spectator misses the goal, he and his men are called "Nazis" at regular intervals. . For me, the only bright spot in the film was when Mel Gibson appeared at an anti-apartheid demonstration carrying a banner with the inscription "End Apparently Now." The intensely annoying Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the shoulders of the boys, following them around barking incessantly like a poorly trained puppy. That would be bearable if there were the most remote possibility of him ending up in a concrete Overcoat, but unfortunately he survives to annoy another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems in a world of her own, perhaps not believing in her fate to be chosen alongside Mel Gibson, who has little trouble getting her to bed in her mobile home that seems to have been taken to a beach somewhere place. In the case, they are under fire from several helicopters firing enough rounds at Mel's caravan to keep the US Army in Iraq for six months. Luckily he has a pet dog that is not afraid to cause interrupted intercourse as soon as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the impending attack. I hope he has a special bone as a reward. The movie climaxes (without interrupting Mel's dog) on ​​a cargo ship bound for Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa), when Mel and Danny kill so many members of the master race that I've lost count.especially babbling like Bonnie and Clyde the impact of a shower of bullets, Mel survives, curled up in the arms of her partner as a small child with a wise and benevolent parent. Take this, Apartheid!
