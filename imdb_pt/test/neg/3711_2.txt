It's hard to find something worthwhile with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever, but that does not say much. The plot is rather incoherent and unbelievable; it seems the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to do it underwater to profit from The Abyss' success. In some scenes, it seems that the story really was set for outer space initially; the submarine has a landing gear, technicians are worried about a tear in a rubber diving suit in the depths of several kilometers, where pressure would crush the diver and the costume like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The film begins well, with planning a recovery of a lost naval submarine. After that, the movie takes a dip together with the Siren 2. <br /> <br /> The effects are more or less. The navigation screens are all made on the Commodore 64 (remember, this is 1990, not 1983), the sub is controlled like no other sub ever; instead of control consoles, officers have keyboards with which they insert sequences of long numbers to control various functions of the ship. The interior of the ship is also not very convincing. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jump from the awkward to the absurd. Welcome to the fifties, you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I do not see the pleasure factor here. The movie is not good or hilariously bad in the MST3k style (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a slightly bad apple.
