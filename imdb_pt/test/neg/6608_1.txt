Brodzki's creation is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. First there was a book written in a great mood. Book that has numerous fans who would be happy to provide help when producers, for some reason, decided to employ people who have hardly heard of the book in the first place. Then came a script as bland and full of nonsense as possible. At the same time, the script was written to allow only those who actually read the books to understand something of the plot. Not that anything in that movie made much sense (eg, "I'm like a piece of ice. You can burn yourself," Yennefer said as a warning - warning that logic is something missing in this movie). To add to this, we have to mention that no matter how much money was supposedly spent on the film, it all looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes seem to have been borrowed from a really poor theater. They're the best that look like that. And to add that we have some "naked scenes" put there just so they are in the movie because they have no explanation on what we could mercifully call a plot. The film has only one force that can hardly make up for the rest - the music is not bad. Although, if I were to choose, I would rather have it separately. Sounds better if you do not need to look at this overproduction glitch.
