Another movie with a wrestling star. So far I've noticed ... the fighters can not act on the movie screen. This movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The action is terrible. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can not be serious, they try to act in fear, but they fail and they look stupid. The acting is horrible, possibly the bad director. <br /> <br /> The plot was stupid .... Only a few people are put in a hotel because they are criminals, and they are randomly killed. The movie is stupid all the time, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only one thinks and that's why I give a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way that Good evening Jacob dies. The pole in his head and his stories plunging was incredible. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a really horrible movie, and you definitely should not waste your time on it.
