I watched this movie with great expectations. The synopsis on the back indicated that this would be unpleasant. But it was very tame and a little unsatisfactory. The violence was nothing I had not seen thousands of times before, the blood level was only medium (note that there was probably more than was seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years - maybe more), and at no point did I even feel uncomfortable to leave together scared. Once again a CAT 3 film with large wrappers did not match its hype. <br /> <br /> Of course you hire this movie, but do not go with any expectations. I'm so eager to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but I'm continually disappointed. I loved Ichi, and Audition, but, again, Miike is alone at the moment. <br /> <br /> Please inspire me ..... there are a large group of fans tired of genres that are hungry for quality horror. !
