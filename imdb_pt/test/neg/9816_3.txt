A Porcupine Linnea Quigley drinks milk, straws and kills her sister and sister's boyfriend after having sex. She goes to an asylum, makes a friend of Amy (Karen Russell) and the two chantagram to leave a psychiatric institution sleeping with her psychologists (one of them is interpreted by Carol Burnett Show's Lyle Wagoner). Outside, these two mafia princesses who hate men (!) Stop taking their pills and invite six ex-boyfriends to sneak into their big country house for a party where they are systematically slaughtered in a very bloody way by a glove The terrible David Barton FX is so bloody but so unreal that they assume a kind of surreal quality. The same goes for the movie. The dialogue is so strange and flamboyant, the film is so inept and edited and the acting is so different from the world that you begin to doubt your own sanity. This movie really tries to have a plot and three-dimensional characters, but it's all so poorly managed that it's almost like what would happen if Ed Wood did a rewrite of an Ingmar Bergman script! And like any good Bergman movie, this has a mature moral to be fulfilled - any good party needs a proper "face / girl" relationship, so there will be enough girls to "tickle your lizard." See for yourself ... or not! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I was even interested in seeing this to begin with) is a lot of fun in this, has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several nudity scenes. Unfortunately, she also disappears completely from the last third of the film and the film suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
