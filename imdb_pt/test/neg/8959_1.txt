I bought this movie as a buy-in, and I deal with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted to see Star Worms II: Attack of Pleasures, DVD is a double feature of the movie. I really did not know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I was scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you say about the trailer? Well, apparently I could say a lot. This movie honestly made no sense to me. The special effects were so terrible that you can not say what in the name of God is happening. I understand that Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but come on. And it's sad because in the interview it sounded like it was an epic movie and meant more than you could ever see. But unfortunately watching the movie is one of the most annoying hours and 15 minutes of anyone's life. It's so painful to sit on. I really can not even explain the plot to you because I did not understand anything and I unfortunately saw this movie twice! Apparently, they used some kind of puppets for the "alien dinosaurs," as they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can not emphasize enough. And, most of the time, bad special effects are good, but this movie needed them a lot. It happens on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs fight against each other and bad actors in hooded sweaters race around, and they seem to be in kkk. And a box with a blue light is the president. I know in the interview that Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, I can see why it was not for CBS or for NBC. There are two good things about this movie. 1. The music is really very good, it has an epic score that stays in your head for days. E 2. The introduction of Lloyd Kaufman is as always hilarious. Overall, do not waste your time, but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!
