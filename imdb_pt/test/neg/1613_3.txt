This film takes the plot behind the science fiction film "Doppelganger" (an Earth astronaut hitting a "counter-ground" on the opposite side of the Sun, and the totalitarian Cold War vibes in the world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and the TV is probably better for it. <br /> <br /> Everyone here is perfectly fit in a 'made-for-TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns into his usual solid performance. So it is with Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man of John Saxon) who plays the robust individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the founding of the 'World Order' on the contrary Earth. <br /> <br /> But the low budget and the low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the sceneries and cinematography keep this science fiction adventure firmly attached to the launch pad. <br /> <br /> I'll give you an example: in the original model for this pilot, ("Doppleganger"), astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a storm, and bring down their ship in a truly terrible sequence it was obvious that their ship would never fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the steaming remains of their vehicle in the midst of rains and howling winds, only to be hit and vanquished by faceless men screaming through loudspeakers. In Stranded in Space the astronauts are sitting in their seats when the bells ring, things start to shake, and the camera goes off in a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves in their seats, the director was not shaking the camera or the device). I've seen episodes of "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that required more effort to establish humor and scenery than this mediocrity made for TV. <br /> <br /> And that, in essence, is what's wrong with "Stranded In Space". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just making symbolic gestures and hoping that the imagination and enthusiasm of science fiction fanatics will fill the rest. Sorry, guys, it did not work. <br /> <br /> I'm sure everyone here has just finished the job and walked away, and they never thought about it, except as a listing on their CV. And that's what you, the viewer, will do. You will remember, if pressed, that you watched a TV movie called "Stranded In Space", but that did not leave a lasting impression on you, and you can not remember much of it.
