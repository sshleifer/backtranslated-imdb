This film seems to be an exposition of the current trend of globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are increasingly joining large conglomerates (the American producer Mondavi in ​​the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make "the perfect wine" - and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. For some, this is a good thing (especially since few can afford $ 50 or more for a wine every day) and for others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is fading. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and do not think there is a villain or hero in this business. Sure, good cheap wine is a good thing, but like what happens with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European malls are almost indistinguishable from Americans) and mega-shops like Walmart / Asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of "the little ones". So I was definitely ready and willing to listen to these filmmakers. However, with a product that has almost two and a half hours in duration and a general lack of focus, the film simply became a very big chore to watch and I lost interest. A focused 80- to 90-minute film would have been MUCH more effective - especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (that's the high-level word for a "wine aficionado"). <br /> <br /> On the positive side, filmmakers are smart not to talk too much - and just let both sides talk. In addition, the topic is so relevant and timely. However, despite choosing a good style of making documentaries, the film simply continues, very, very long and ended up making a very annoying movie.
