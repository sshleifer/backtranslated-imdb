The movie was half finished before I could figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast from a movie about four family dinners on Thanksgiving. The clich√©s and stereotypes fall on each other. When it's all over ten hours later - well, it seems like ten o'clock - you're intrigued about what it was all about. I do not want to see a movie about the dinner table dispute. There's enough in my own family. The turkeys looked very good. The rest gave me indigestion.
