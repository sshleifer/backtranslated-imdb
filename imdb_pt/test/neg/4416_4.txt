After searching through this Bruceploitation for months and then accidentally buying it cheap, it was disappointing. I heard about it on a DVD-R site, and it sounded crazy. <br /> <br /> But no, what I got was a very bad martial arts movie. The kung fu-ing was not so bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful, and made the movie look very, very long, much longer than the 85 minute run time. <br /> <br /> note, the monkey got funny for a few seconds (especially when I think they took the only close-up of their face from another movie), and the black guy in the middle was funny because of the line which he said, which made all blacks look full-blown. <br /> <br /> But it was not enough, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> 4/10
