I bought this video on a disposable table in the video store expecting a good cast in what was presented as an award winning British sex comedy. I think I should have read the best impression. I rarely write a panoramic review, but here it goes. <br /> <br /> These actors in gay roles really play with their memories of much more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke to the detriment of the actors, the audience that goes to the theater and all the films that contributed to its reputation. <br /> <br /> I repeat: is the joke about disrupting the actors? Are other people on the screen highly respectable with this grossly useless movie? Can the reference to Austen's Classics of Pride and Prejudice and "Sensibility and Sensitivity" be something else? How much of a political statement was to produce this melodrama using these stars? Do we simply want to make it a mistake that all actors are gay and thus let the on-screen representation affect our lifestyle, is also accepting their private homosexual relationships? I'm sorry, but I do not think so. I say NO to this.
