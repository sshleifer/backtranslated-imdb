The real problem with this story is that there is not much history to the story. There is virtually no plot to speak. Widower buys an electric grandmother for his children. A boy resists the electric grandmother. Then he finally accepts it. Then the children grow up and Grandma leaves. Really, very little happens. It is much more a premise than a story. <br /> <br /> In addition, take it out of the schmaltz, and you have a story you've done before, and better: The Lonely. Same basic idea: the person initially can not accept the love of a robot, because it is just a machine, then eventually gives in and goes to love the robot. The biggest difference is that The Lonely is much more powerful, as both the protagonist and us, the public, abruptly collide back to reality and we are forced to remember that in the end the robot is really just a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find the story highly flawed in that electric grandma is just * perfect too. It is not only "human", it is * superhuman *. She is * wiser * than a real person, she has no mechanistic traits for her, and she makes marbles out of nothingness. Frankly, that gets annoyed with the credulity of thinking she's a machine.
