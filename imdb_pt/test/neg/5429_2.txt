This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex and fast in the midst of this stunning novel. <br /> <br /> And about 99.8% of them missed the movie. Seriously, the script and direction were horrible and clearly made by people who could not understand what was good about the novel. I can not blame the actors because, frankly, they never had the chance to make this turkey live according to Crichton's original work. I know that good novels, especially those with a science fiction edge, are difficult to bring to the screen in a way that matches the original. But that may be the absolute worst quality difference between the novel and the screen adaptation of all time. The book is really very good. The movie is just awful.
