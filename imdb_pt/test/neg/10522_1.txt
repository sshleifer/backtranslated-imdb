Even my five-year-old son was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and exaggerated. This movie could not decide whether it was slapstick, or an ironic comment on the state of sports "pee-wee". <br /> <br /> The characters were underdeveloped, they could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage. <br /> <br /> He did not like the reference on the goalkeeper slipping the laxative to his teammate ... too bad for a child's movie. <br /> <br /> The typical "Mafia" behavior was boring and stereotyped. <br /> <br /> The dog, however, was so cute!
