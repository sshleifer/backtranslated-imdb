It seems that since 1982, every two or three years, we have a film that claims to be "The next officer and a gentleman." There is not yet a movie that matches this statement and this movie is no different. <br /> <br /> We received the usual scenes of the OAAG ("I want you, PAIN", the instructor gives Richard Gere character his overdose of workouts in the hope that he will leave, the character Gere back to the girl, the character Gere realizes the instructor is great, etc.) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the East and is horribly miscast at the top. Costner plays his usual "wise teacher" character, the only character he can play, and you really have a sense of his limited acting skills here. Kutcher is lousy in Richard Gere's character, only with acting skills just above Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this aspiring OAAG is that the two main characters are so unbelievably one-dimensional that you never cared for the least or when the character of Kutcher finally turned around (just like Gere did in OAAG ), you would simply go "so what?" The movie leaves no turning point and it seems like it never ends as if it said "oh wait, we forgot to close the girlfriend's story, or what happens after he forms the story, or the other six points of the movie ... "What is more disconcerting is the great reviews I see here. The opinions of the general public never cease to amaze me.
