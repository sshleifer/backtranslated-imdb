Italian horror master Dario Argento is called many bad things by non-fans. And it deserves absolutely none of the backlash. In fact, every time I hear something bad about Argento, I think they're really talking about Michele Soavi. He simply does not get the same attention because his films have never been successful in theaters. In fact, his best film - Cemetery of 1994 - was probably his least success. Or simply did not get the attention he felt he deserved, because after that, he left the film and started directing the television. He never went back. So people really do not know how much their other films are inferior because, when they see them, they are already fans of the aesthetics of Italian terror. Which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive movies. This is where the Church stands out from the crowd. Because visually, it is so cheap and old-fashioned, you can smell the dust. But it also has its charms, although they are few. The camera work is really impressive and the soundtrack is extremely elaborate and grandiose. <br /> <br /> Since Argento is the reason why people have seen Soavi's work, I do not know anyone who has taken The Church before the Suspiria of Argento. and dark red. Soavi is a bit of a hack. More or less like an Italian Mick Garris - the greatest example of a director who prefers style to substance. The failings of the Church are constant and abundant. The film begins with a rather interesting prologue showing knights on white horses running through a peasant village similar to those you see in any Robin Hood adaptation in some distant century. These scenes are intense enough, energetic and come quickly to the point. So we cut to the present, where the style of the film takes on. Yes, the movie is fine to look at. And for about 35 minutes in the present, in 1980, anywhere in Italy, the film is interesting enough to lead us to the elements of revealing horror. So now we know that the purpose of the movie is to build its horror. And it's a decent buildup, for the most part. But when the film approaches the middle of the road, we realize that the film is passing, and ... nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple. I think. Two people working in a church, one as a book cataloger and the other as restorer of the wall art of the building, discover a parchment / deed that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or invaluable artifact he can sell and get rich from Then he follows his "map" only to discover a force under the church that leaves him hallucinated, while he is slowly becoming a demon that will make everyone hallucinate. So while he's doing his demonic work, someone he's forced to force himself to kill himself in a way that holds everyone in the church while the contagious demon spreads around the world, leaving a black preacher and the little girl who fled the church all the nights to go to nightclubs as the only two people who can prevent the plague from spreading beyond the church walls. This probably sounds action-packed and Soavi's style is much more lethargic than Argento. But I've never seen a surrealist movie attempt so agonizing and boring. I'm not kidding with you. Absolutely nothing happens throughout the movie! I've seen expressionist movies (or impressionists, I'm not super-grad film) before, but most of them actually show things going on (John Carpenter's Halloween for one). <br /> <br /> It follows very closely in the footsteps of the films Demons de Lamberto Bava (since Argento co-produced). We are shown to a place where a group of people gather, one turns into a demon, all the others are isolated, that person infects everyone except a few survivors, then the demons infect the world or the survivors when the demons die . This movie puts all those same elements in place. Except that, unlike Argento's work, nothing happens. Okay, some things happen. But only a bizarre sequence has the grace of the films Demons, much more fun of Lambert. The neck of a random woman is impaled by a demon using a section of fence that he pulls off the ground. What's bizarre about that, you ask yourself? This happens in front of about two dozen people. What they do? Anything. She dies, her head runs blood in close. But all these people do not even notice it, even though it happens in sight and less than two meters away from them. Maybe 4 people notice the demon rushing to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her, so they get out of the way. She is dead and in the shot after she dies, everyone is just sitting, snoozing while a boy plays a saxophone. I'm not kidding with you. That's what happens. This is more than logically incoherent - it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> The scene is suggesting that the woman simply disappeared and no one saw her die. They all rise and forget. And this 15-second thing is absolutely the only event that happens in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, blood or murder we see. It is not. It's just the one thing we can say is happening. For example, in a scene, a beautiful woman sees herself in the mirror, looking old and ugly. She begins to scratch the skin from her face, but when it reappears minutes later, no scratches. People are devoured by fish and their faces are crushed by subway cars. But later they become totally uninjured members of a possessed cult, in a scene that commits the ultimate horror by copying a famous scene from Roman Polanski's 1968 masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby, the greatest horror film of all time . Even if Argento did that, I would be furious!
