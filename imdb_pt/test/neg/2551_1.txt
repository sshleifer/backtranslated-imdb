In the dusty little town of Furlough, Texas, an animal is slaughtering cattle and locals. When teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, his friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonz√°lez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) discover that a Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is the killer and they plot a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "Mexican werewolf in Texas" sucks amateur and among the worst movies I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing works in this movie: the script is laughable, with some of the most terrible lines I've ever heard. The direction does not exist and the camera follows the "style" of "The Blair Witch Project". Amateur acting seems to be a joke to high school students or a high school play. The "special effects" are horrible and extremely poor and the "werewolf" is the cheapest I've ever seen. Ed Wood's films are cultured, but this "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is pure junk. In the end, Jill says no man can resist her boobs (actually, the prettiest thing in this movie). But I believe the correct citation should be "no man (or woman) can resist watching this movie until the end." I was motivated by my curiosity to see how bad a movie can be and lost 88 minutes of my life, but I believe most viewers will stop watching less than 20 minutes in length. My vote is a (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mexican Werewolf in Texas" ("A Mexican Werewolf in Texas")
