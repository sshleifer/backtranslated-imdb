I saw that last night and being a fan of the early Demons, I hoped the sequel would have the same fun and scary spirit as its predecessor. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The set-up is similar to the first, in which a horde of carnivorous demons actually exploded when released from a horror movie being played ... (The first was a movie theater, this is in an apartment building and on TV .) Once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage happen. This is very beautiful with regard to the development of the plot. It worked very well in the first part because of macabre make-up FX, fast paced and unpredictability. The sequel, however, does not cut it. The first problem seems to be that there are many characters with whom we do not care one way or another. If they were annoying or idiots, then there would be at least some kind of gratification when they are inevitably massacred / demonized / eaten alive ... but these people are just waiting to be slaughtered. Also, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the building (and out of it), they are constantly switching between them, which keeps pulling me out of the story. There are some fun bits, courtesy of the FX splatter and campiness. Such as a steady stream of blood dripping through the building of one floor after another as if it were an alien acid ... The first demonic possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party, and a scary child demoniac clawing her way to the room of a tenant who is pregnant as a child. However, this sequence turns into a ridiculous-looking rubber-demon baby doll thing that explodes in the human child's chest that constantly crosses the room into its intended victim. I chuckled at that scene, but I do not think it was Bava's intention. The scene would probably have worked better if they just kept the child demon to attack the woman, but hey ... Other small things like the overzealous acting of most characters and bad dubbing do not help at all. In short, I was able to see the unrated version on DVD, and I can not imagine having to sit all the way through the R version only available previously, because the make-up FX and gore were the only thing I got out of it. Also noteworthy is an early role of the future sexy daughter of producer Argento, Asia. In fact, she probably gives the best performance of the entire cast and she's barely on the screen. Argento / Bava fans may want to take a look just to see it, but they'll probably find themselves looking at the clock, as I did. Gore fans can have fun with some of the fx, but they'll be laughing at their seats on the world's most pathetic evil doll since Dead / Alive's Little Selwyn. You could do worse, but it certainly does not live up to the original.
