I really do not know why so many people love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but that totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself said, this movie betrayed the book: not only is the story violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, are all lost in an 80's fantasy / adventure film for children . Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to the books: I hope someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day direct the story of Neverending REAL. A great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve this.
