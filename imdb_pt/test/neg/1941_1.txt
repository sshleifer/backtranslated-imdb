Does anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K etc ..? At the time, when it came to doing crazy and cool things, instead of watching Bam Margera act like an idiot, pampered 5-year-old aspiring rock superstar. <br /> <br /> The show used to be incredible, however, Bam's fame and wealth led him to believe, that we now appreciate him acting childishly and idiot, more than cool things, which used to be in the former. CKY2K. <br /> <br /> The acts are so repetitive, there is nothing new except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments ... The only things we see is Bam Margera, so busy showing us how much he cares , how much money he got or anything. <br /> <br /> I really do not have much to say except to give CKY2K back, because Bam sucks ... <br /> <br /> I like to see Steve-o, Knoxville etc. thousand times more.
