This has to be the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. Randy Quaid funny as a supporting actor in the original, but not as the leader. Very Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, the supporting actor took the show. Ed Asner was very funny. He's the Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! How Snots still look the same after all these years and everyone else in the original seems to be 14 years older. After 15 minutes watching this movie, I can not believe I've laughed yet. The island thing just did not work. If it had not been for the beautiful South Pacific female guide on the island, the movie would have been a complete loss. I sat in this review for a week and yes, I still think the movie should never have been done. Let's hope there is no THIRD! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
