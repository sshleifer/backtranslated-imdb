Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the small Bulgarian city. William Cole, a wealthy industrialist, ends up replacing part of his brain with that of a Russian taxi driver, Yegor. The two could not be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common enemy. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the genre of B horror movies that gave him cult status, this time not just in front of the screen but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time, the laughter does not deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try to fill the gap in this film. As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, books and action figures, I was expecting another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this movie before the purchase, I'm glad I do not have the "pleasure" to add it. <br /> <br /> The first movie goes wrong in the story, which at first glance seems like harmless fun but ends up being boring dribble extracted. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never hits, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of funny stuff and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen ... him fighting himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. It brings a freshness and a fun time when the movie really needs. This helps if you're a fan and have followed these Evil Dead Clowns to Xena, and that's why I felt compelled to like this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell's experience as a director, of directing TV episodes. Hercules series is apparent. Campbell makes the movie work well enough, even at low budget. In the end, there are not as many things for this as you would expect, but Campbell fans will get behind this, no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I will not.
