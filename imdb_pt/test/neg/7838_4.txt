The film career of Jean Claude Van Damme seems to have gone to hell in a wheelbarrow, so it's ironic to see him playing a character who finds the same fate literally at the beginning of the movie! It is also interesting to note how much the plot of his films are very similar, regardless of who the producer, director or screenwriter. Van Damme usually plays a character who is living in France, so due to a set of circumstances, he is in another part of the world where he has a brother who dies and it is up to Van Damme to take revenge helped by a character that he just to know. Look at AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films featuring the headline "Starring Jean Claude Van Damme" and they all feature almost the same kind of story structure. This does not mean that they are identical, of course, just very similar and if you watched a Van Damme movie, basically saw them all. It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK
