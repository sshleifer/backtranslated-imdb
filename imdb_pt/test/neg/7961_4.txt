If there is one thing I want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here, it is that I am the queen of finding strange movies at Thrift and Dollar Stores. That being said, you can not imagine how happy I was when I encountered this. <br /> <br /> I even remember that Saturday morning when * every * simulcast station, so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else (so again, I guess that was the idea). As a kid, I did not know if I liked the way all the different characters were stuck (there are some crossovers that do not work *). But I think the special had the intended effect. Do not use drugs because you will have nightmares with the Muppets. <br /> <br /> Now, if you watch this as an adult, you will be treated with the * strangest * anti-drug film. this side of "Madness of Reefer". I think I'll quit before I get into trouble.
