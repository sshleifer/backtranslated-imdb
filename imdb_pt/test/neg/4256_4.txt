The production year says it all. The film is a looting mess of politically correct nonsense of left self-esteem, of a symbolic variety so heavy it seems ridiculous nowadays. Each scene is intended to shed light on one of society's hottest issues, especially the role of women in the work community, the role of women against men, women as sexual objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. commented on by the internal dialogue of one of the main actresses, or turning the scene into a surreal joke. I have no recollection of any plot, or who the main characters really were. It's the kind of movie where consumerism is ridiculed by a couple making love in a sales showcase of a furniture store while the sales agent makes his speech, or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into an act of full striptease. Of course, "the offending lords of the press are the same as an obscene audience in a club. So we move quickly, because we need to see the war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feminist discourses being drowned in cars or crowds , and of course we need to see Stalin's newsreels and all the other usual suspects.You got the idea.But all of this does not matter at all.The film is an unequaled piece of eyecandy for any amateur Ingmar Bergman (male). film that sports Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the pinnacle of their beauty makes this reviewer completely surrender and just drivel ?? and also enjoy watching them so generously use their acting skills in a movie I had never heard of It's hard to believe how especially Bibi Andersson's face is the owner of the screen every time she appears. fia is wonderfully orchestrated, often revealing an overexposed dimensionless whiteness (?), and you never get tired of seeing the artists. How absurd is that a film so carefully considered by the feminist agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be seen merely as objects of desire, has nothing better to offer 21st-century viewers than a parade of beautiful babies. As mentioned, I'm not complaining. I could watch again tomorrow.
