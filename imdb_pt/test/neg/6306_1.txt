Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really hate. It is an absolute torture of the highest echelon and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract intelligence from captured intelligence agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he's totally at the top of this movie. He does not cross the line so much, he vaults over it, then jumps back again and again. He grabs and opens mugs as if on an incredibly bad acid trip. It's one of those rare presentations where you'd like to be able to get into the movie and beat the man within an inch of his life by doing something so horrible. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other prize for bad acting? That is the only conclusion I can give. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a poor performance for ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy? <br /> <br /> The extreme opposite end is Winona Ryder, her features plastic and plastic performance. I came across a review of his acting style that compared it to a wax doll. This was of course an insult to wax mannequins across the land, all of which could have brought more humanity into the role of Jerry's cousin / minor wife. This brings up the confused message of the film, that it is 100% correct to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. I can not see what's so "good" about it, but it seems like Hollywood thinks minor incest is great. Talk about "family values". <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a direct view of Lewis's life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about the really weird scene where Jerry drives to school, starts singing a song and everyone starts dancing like a Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. But who really cares? I do not. And neither should you. You can not recoup the minutes of life you would waste in this movie. So do not waste your time, it's too precious for something so misguided and poor.
