I would not recommend this movie. Even though it is rated G and it is clearly for children there are quite a lot of profanity (including the dreaded 'F' and 'S' words). This kind of language does not offend me particularly, but in a children's film? Come on. <br /> <br /> There was also some implicit sexual content between one of the first male adolescent characters and any adult woman to show up - including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The performance was as good as it was in this kind of movie, but the plot was very tacky and even my four-year-old said he was "stupid." <br /> <br /> Despite having Elizabeth Shue, this movie is definitely not worth checking out if you have not seen it yet.
