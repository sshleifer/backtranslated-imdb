Like many people in my age group, I remember seeing this movie as a child in 98 and leaving the theater practically in tears. It seemed, at the time, to be one of the most important and inspiring film experiences of our generation. At once fascinating, action-packed, funny, moving, and truly inspiring, Armegeddeon really had everything going on, right down to Aerosmith's captivating theme song and the thrill of an end. <br /> <br /> Jebus. What were we smoking? I watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels, and ... I can not even describe it. This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Where to start really? I do not know what to do, but I do not know what to do with it, but I do not know what to do with it. which combined low quality writing with low quality performance. There are many examples of this to start listing here, but one in particular comes to mind - the scene in which Bruce Willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to track down each of his family's oh-so-delightfully-cheeky members. ('check out every bar in New Orleans', 'the craps tables in Las Vegas', 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in Sturgis' ... everything in 'Come Together' ... that's me remembered some of Anchorman's "NEWS TEAM! MONTE!" scene, except serious). Ben Affleck proves, once again, that he is by far the most unseemly actor in Hollywood, having less depth, reach, and overall talent than anyone else in the business. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, OR ANYONE ELSE on the GARBAGE GODFORSAKEN piece was much better. <br /> <br /> (I have to say though, I got a kick out of seeing a pre-star Owen Wilson getting killed in the middle of the road ... is this the only movie where your character dies?) < Peter Stormare is perfect as the Russian COSMONAUT most ESTEREOTYPICAL UNSHAVEN you've ever seen. (So ​​again, Peter Stormare seems to have a talent for playing over-the-top Eurotypes.) It really was a lot of fun as, almost IMMEDIATELY after the Americans dock with the Russian Space Station (which is actually called in the movie) Ben Affleck manages to make the whole joint explode in the spectacular fashion of Hollywood. I also love the fact that, in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth to be destroyed, and that absolutely no one seems to care. And on top of that, it literally turns into simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am of being an American. <br /> <br /> There are many other things to talk about, but I will not ... suffice it to say that this is really a really DYING movie, which I feel ashamed to genuinely like. <br /> <br /> I give him two stars just for the mocking factor.
