This is one of those films that get sold out and are very expensive on eBay. This film is a little-known movie, quite amateur, which has the strong advantage of being the only film that Shannon Doherty appears in several nudity scenes (looking very seductive, I might add). It also has the smallest advantage of being popular in the fetish of Shannon Doherty and in smoking fetish sands. It's a pretty mediocre attempt at a horror / drama / whodunit movie. It tries a bit of the wrong direction, but you can see what is one kilometer away. Shannon does a decent job with her role, but the woman who is playing her sister is out of the night amateur, as well as Shannon's husband. Avoid, unless you are one of the groups I mention above. Now, let's go to eBay and see if we can unload this thing. 8)
