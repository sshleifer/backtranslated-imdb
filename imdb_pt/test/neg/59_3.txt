Not like I've been expecting a lot out of it, but I was hoping at least for a great dunce budget fun movie. That's not even that. This item is in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen many of them). Bad acting, zero characterization, little or no thinking, almost non-existent plot (and that's where you can drive semi trucks through the holes). Of course, it has action and is loud, and has more action, and more noise, blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good (or even half decent) movie. Beats me as some people might say that this is the best vampire movie ever made - all I can assume is that they have not seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.
