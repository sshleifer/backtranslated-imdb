Special previews are always a good time. No matter what movie you are watching, the theater will always be packed by people who are waiting for the movie, like free stuff, thought it would be something to do, or just get lost. Either way, no matter how good or bad the movie is, the audience will only make it fun. Now when you say the movie is a PG-13 pseudo-horror movie (can you really plunge into terror when the MPAA has its back to censor it all?), You know there will be gossip, laughter and breath. With The Messengers, the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbreaks and warnings to the characters on the screen. As for the actual film, I feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been so much better had it been stimulated and allowed to stretch their legs beyond the fright / diminish / show the parades those films. In the end, we are shown a boring story and no surprises and few moments of real suspense. <br /> <br /> History is common. A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try to rebuild the relationship between them. Once settled, the spirits of the house go out to the reformed, rowdy child whose past makes it even easier for parents not to believe everything they have been told. Of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it's too late. I'm going to credit the Pang Brothers (directors of the acclaimed The Eye that I would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without the interference of Hollywood ?? supposedly re-images in The Messengers were made by someone else but brothers kept credit is a shame what our studio system does to foreigners, especially when it was the creative independence that made the films that bring them and not the final interference), to really have a proper style and keep the tired plot a bit cool . Unfortunately, however, I must also give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness. Just as I did not like What Lies Beneath, I could not stand the lingering suspense, which goes so far as to make it laughable. When our heroine and her brother are in a hallway with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes with only static, oddly compounded close-ups and depth-of-field shifts to culminate in absolutely nothing. By being only 84 minutes, I almost think it would have worked better even shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective opening sequence, featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland (strangely playing a boy) and great atmospheric credit. sequence, the only thing that saves the film from the total garbage is acting. Except for Penelope Ann Miller, who first made me wonder what had happened to her and then, after a few scenes, made me understand why I'd never asked that question in the years I've been away, and Dustin Milligan, completely devoid of credibility, to act it's very strong. Dyan McDermott does a good job as the father trying to keep his family together in all difficult times. He has many small moments of mild comedy to counteract his serious and dramatic role. William B. Davis (Cancerman's favorite of all) is used effectively as a character almost sensing, unfortunately is no longer used. Our real stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with it and the Panic Room on her resume. As for Corbett, if he did not fulfill his role, the entire film would have been unraveled completely. I wish he would get more work than I liked him since the understated "The Visitor" series. I still need to get his first role in Northern Exposure, a show I have not yet been able to catch up on. It's a shame he's probably more recognized by the overrated Greek wedding My Big Fat. At the very least, The Messengers gave me a good introduction to the work of the Pang Brothers and reinvigorated my desire to check out Chinese horror catalog. The humor and performances were there; it was just the simple, vague story that needed a lot of filling to make a movie. If they delved deeper into other characters, instead of just Stewart, it could have been more effective, in addition to having something else to show, then ten-minute scenes of nothing. If our protagonist is the only one to be attacked, there is no suspense as to how much the creatures will harm her. The moments of danger had no gravity for them and until the end really remained as filler. I am excited, however, by the free comics given after the special screening, as I hope the medium will allow for a faster-paced story to absorb before attempting to surprise.
