The series does not begin as it means to continue. Although it is the first two seasons full of incredibly medium episodes, as well as countless failures, the pace increases and one of the best operas of space is born. The first episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is notable for two things: they are very enjoyable introductions to the whole main cast and the peculiar accent of Marina Sirtis that would later disappear. Seeing how it all started is very satisfying, and seen in the minds of the rest of the series rather than actually changing. Otherwise, it's a very mediocre episode with Q and some giant jellyfish. That's right.
