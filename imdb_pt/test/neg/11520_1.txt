Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give hope to any young aspiring filmmaker. Any script you may have thought of using to line up a litterbox or a cage now should not look that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stock of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this movie made me realize that Good vs Python was not that bad. It would probably have been better to make this film in Claymation, at least in this way, no actor would have to take credit for being in this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many nicknames. There is a good side to watching this movie where, if you can get someone to bring you a packet of chips, you can eat out of the cheese cocoon that surrounds you, allowing you to <br /> your way to the cheese cocoon of your television set that surrounds you.
