I can only imagine that this movie was an experiment that failed. Years earlier, there would have been moving images accompanied by music. Later sound would have been added to the silences. Eventually it would have been Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element into the spoken image. During all emotional scenes, the character stops in the middle of the dialogue and his inner thoughts are narrated while they look away or appeal to the camera. This interruption is painful at the very least. Imagine these top-notch actors trying to look busy while the narration continues. Painful. I have no idea who invented this trick, but it was the only time I saw him used - and for good reason. In all the scenes, the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wring their hands, or exaggerate to such a degree, I really wondered if this was really a comedy. <br /> <br /> History is a hopeless novel that happens a few generations ago. Norma Shearer, disappointed in love, seeks a reason to live. She has a friend, played by Ralph Morgan, who raises her - but she takes it for granted. She is attracted to a doctor, played by Clark Gable, but he is self-absorbed and not interested in her. She is content with a weak one who desperately needs it. She marries him only to find out that there is insanity in her family and she can never have a child with him. Next comes the doctor who, selfishly, puts a bun in the oven, only to find out after he loves her, after all. The child builds confidence in her husband, who becomes a success, but she realizes that it is really Clark that she loves after all. Confused yet? Forget the rest, just watch a few episodes of "The World Turns" and everything will be clear. <br /> <br /> If you are forced to watch this movie, wait for the final scene. The oscillations of the actors left Harold LLoyd ashamed. Not to be missed.
