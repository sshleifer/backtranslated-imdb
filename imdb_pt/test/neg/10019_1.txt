This is truly, without overstatement, one of the worst Slasher movies ever made. I know, it came out in the 80's following a trend started by "Friday the 13th". "The Prey" copies the movie mentioned in several ways. The scenery of the woods, the killer, the stupid teenagers, the blood, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Fang" is as bad as you might expect. I do not even remember it if it was not for coincidence. <br /> <br /> Well, the killer is indeed human, so do not expect a supernatural killer like Jason. The situations are quite boring and lack of tension, blood, violence, etc. This simply does not work for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is simply awful. The score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with 80's cheesy tunes?! I will not even mention the technical aspects of the film because, believe me, it looks like it cost just $ 20. <br /> <br /> Please avoid this like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something to be said. Thank God it seems to have disappeared from the earth.
