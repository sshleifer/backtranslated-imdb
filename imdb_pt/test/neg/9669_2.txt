A bad bad movie ... terrible plot, it depends on the Yeung Bolo character, but he speaks maybe 20 words throughout the film and only has one fight scene - still in great shape considering that he was also in the classic "Enter The Dragon "" Interesting to see William Zabka ("Johnny" of The Karate Kid) in another martial arts role.
