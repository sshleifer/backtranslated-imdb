This movie was perhaps the biggest waste of two hours of my life. From the opening 10 minutes, I was ready to leave. The clich√©s there struck him in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than Swiss cheese. I'm thinking of suing for two hours lost, and $ 6.25, coupled with the fact that I'm dumber now for watching this film waste. The T-Rex must be turning in their graves, so to speak.
