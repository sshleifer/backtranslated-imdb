One of the worst gay-related movies I've ever seen. Since these are not characters in this story, it is difficult to comment on the movie itself. So since Colton Ford (aka Glen) has put his life open for everyone to see, I think he's a fair game to criticize. And this is not hard to do. Here goes. 50 something Glen is a great porn star who wants fame and fortune as a great singer. (I think 11 movies make him a "star") Being gay and forty, I saw porn and I did not recognize him or his lover. Personally, they all look the same to me with different hair styles. Face it, guys, he's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. Okay, though. The purpose of these movies happens in about 6.5 minutes, so they all pretty much have the same requirements, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So Glen wants to be a serious (legitimate) singer after he dumps the porn industry, but he can not convince anyone to take him seriously. I want to know why? Was he so stupid to think he could wash his clothes and have sex at the movies? And according to the film, it's not just porn movies he enjoys, he's living in a house with other "stars" where people can connect in their bedroom, in the bathroom and wherever it is through webcams. It's $ 500 an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip shows in optional "hotel" clothing. Doing something called meth that I presume is a drug. And then you have the guts to get mad when someone at a club show tries to touch you ---- because it's "legitimate" now. Hi! <br /> <br /> The only interesting and cardless character is the Oscar-winning homosexual screenwriter who did not want to identify himself. And considering that this is a documentary, well, pornography is like pornography. You can tell he's more fun with the stupid rabbit's porn actress. <br /> <br /> Glen has a hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to "sell him" as a porn star in hopes of making him gay. He tries to do Svengalli's routine. "Use it." "Do not smile." "Say it." Not what it means to control problems. But our anti-hero will not be controlled or informed about what to do. I'm not saying that Kyle was right but if any beginner singer starts questioning the manager, they will not get away, sort of like: the one who is his own lawyer is a fool to a client. /> <br /> All this would not have been bad if it were not for a little bit of information. Battery roll, please. He is bad. He sucks. His talent as a singer is up there with Ashlee Simpson. Difficult to cheer for someone who - while trying to make their dream come true - at 50! --- Does not work like normal people No job Can you say lazy? And the whining, and the "Why do not they accept me?" Music and dance. And one After a few months of work in the music industry, he said, "Why do not I have a recording contract now?" Actors are waiters. Writers work in low-level newspapers or magazines - whatever. This guy is over that. It is true. He wants his success now simply because he decided he wanted to. To whimper. Lamentation. Your lover leaves you to return to breastfeeding, but I tell you that I do not want that idiot to give me medical care. Both were useless. Airheads The movie is useless. Unless you really like it, the Whine and Cheeesy people stay away. Do not waste your money on the bad lives of useless people, there are much more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.
