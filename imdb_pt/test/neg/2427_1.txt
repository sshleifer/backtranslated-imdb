OK from the point of view of an American, which I assume do not know much about rugby, this would be an incredible movie for them.First of all that has good moral heart, the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy. However, for us, where I come from rugby is the number one sport, is a way of life is a game played only by the most courageous and victorious are hailed as heroes as if Americans do for their baseball / basketball stars. I'm not sure if it was the cheap budget or maybe the director or the actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan all my life than some of the actors who did not even know rugby existed before playing in that movie. In short, this movie was terrible. If you watched and found it great, please take some time to get online and maybe Google "All Blacks" which is the national team of New Zealand and the ones that made the haka famous. Believe me, they'll make the Highland kids look like girls from school.
