A Wacky Chick movie. A beauty contestant ends up dead and the usual suspects are reunited. Another entry into the vein of the Texas Cheerleader, this is an average example of its kind. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Bleeth transforms into her usual healthy girl performance, and Jill Clayburgh does a good job as she slightly stressed out mother obsessed. <br /> <br /> A few slightly funny moments listening to the insipid PR of self-service coming out of the mouths of competitors. ('I would like to own a restaurant so that I can give food to the homeless.') <br /> <br /> You have to wonder what people are using for the brains when they think of a cheer or beauty crown is worth killing! <br /> <br />
