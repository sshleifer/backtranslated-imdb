Update from director / writer Diane English of the classic comedy of George Cukor of 1939, MGM, unfortunately shows more mothball than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's insightful play in 1936 about the relationships that evolve from a strictly feminine group of spoiled Manhattan socialites, the story seems ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of the thematic overload of English, production appears as an extended therapy session with a shortage of intelligence. In addition, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to comedy-level stereotypes in this film, and the central concept of the original play of eliminating men from the plot seems even more artificial given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men, as well as women since the 1930s. To add insult to injury, HBO's recent screen adaptation of "Sex and the City," made this kind of brotherhood style much better and with much sharper teeth . The skeleton of the original play remains. The story revolves around the wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising career in clothing design to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like "Sex and the City", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, editor of a successful and successful magazine modeled on Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada" (another film that echoes); the always pregnant Edie Cohen representing the wife who stays at home; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group usually excluded from an exclusive group. Through a manicure, they find out that Mary's husband is having an affair with the male devourer Crystal Allen, a girl of Saks's perfume more than willing to break a marriage while struggling to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter much as it becomes a series of bond-focused scenes and sisters fights, none of that very enlightening and without the satirical buzz that propelled the 1939 movie. strangely young at age 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a way that tries to resurrect the goodwill she engendered in the '90s with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle." It is not that she is not fit for age here, but her familiar vivacity seems to be at odds with the passive nature of the character. Annie Bening does a little better in stealing the scene from Sylvie de Rosalind Russell because she has proven to be adept at imparting toughness while masking vulnerability, but her character undergoes such a banal transformation that it severely damages her performance. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent saleswoman against the smart, hard cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are on the sidelines of Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better is Candice Bergen as Mary's sympathetic mother, and Cloris Leachman as the non-absurd maid. Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the movie's release, the 2008 DVD does not have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her girlfriends having a girls' night in contrast to the elaborate feast in Mary's garden, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's participation as a multi-married Hollywood agent advising Mary one early morning. in a yoga camp. Two featurettes complete the extras "" The Women: The Legacy "about the story behind the original 1936 film, and" Women Behind Women, "which has cast and crew endlessly talking about female self-empowerment and self "The irony is that this version of" The Women, "directed and scripted by a woman, has such a paternalistic look on women.
