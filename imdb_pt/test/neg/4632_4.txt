The history and experience of recent decades have shown us that intellectuals talking about sex are about the most unequal and non-intellectual thing anyone can do, but that was not so obvious in 1986. Basically, the idea in this movie is that these The insatiable desire to find comfort, security, and pleasure in sexual acts is, in fact, the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves - which they hide from themselves with more sex. This unit is linked to the "decline of the American Empire," as expressed in an initial interview within the film. <br /> <br /> So the idea is that relatively obnoxious people talk about sex, and that this conversation is supposed to reveal how detestable they are as people. Arcand at least continues to give momentum and momentum by doing interesting things with the camera, such as isolating most of the characters in unique frames, revealing their ultimate loneliness and cutting quickly between them, showing how they are at war with each other more than they . are in agreement. And to give credit to Arcand, this is basically what the intellectual life is, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone knows that standing out means standing alone. <br /> <br /> But yes, the characters and the action is uninteresting and pathetic. I think this movie is much more an aspect of your time than something to last, which makes it kind of dated. It is also the exact type of mental misalignment in dialogue and references to people like Susan Sontag, who makes art films so unpopular around populist entertainment spectators. All in all, I'll take it anyway - it has its place basically among the exact type of people the characters are - it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who is not these characters. <br /> - PolarisDiB
