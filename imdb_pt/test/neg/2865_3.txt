I really enjoyed several films by GÃ©rard Depardieu and hoped that I would like much more of this film than I did. The biggest reason was that I did not find the film very interesting or funny - so I did not care. Also, although he does not sleep with his stubborn daughter, the idea that she is lying telling everyone that he is her much older lover is simply disgusting! Yes, I know there is no incest and I know that no one around you knows that he really is his father but I have found that any child who passes his father as his sexual lover is very disgusting and prevents the movie from being really funny. Besides, I really did not really like this brat. In addition to her lies, she seemed very cheeky and self-involved. I'd rather that somehow she'd gotten her go-uppance and somehow been punished, like I just did not like her.
