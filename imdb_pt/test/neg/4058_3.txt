"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a lousy essay to make a sequel over a single year. The first movie was cute, cuddly and charming. The idea of ​​a dog playing on a basketball team is very unlikely, but he defiantly drew enough tricks to save the concept. Even human history had some explanation for it. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he's sad. And the audience gets emotional too. <br /> Now, the sequence badly made. This is terrible. This is the worst kind of bad sequence, the kind that changes good ideas and turns them into good ones. The type that changes the main plot in a way, this time the K-9 plays football instead of basketball. It is no longer madness how much time is spent in mind on the matter, benefit from a doubt, get into an open mind of an attitude you have with a movie like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to making bad movies. The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eighth grade. He lives with his mother and little sister in a suburb of Seattle. In the first film, human history involved the loss of his father in a plane crash, with which the public can identify, most people know what it is to lose a close loved one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is dating again. He and Buddy, his dog who knows how to play basketball, do not like it at all. Because? If I were in his place, I would love to have an extra dad in my life, especially one so cool. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him as a local veterinarian for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The story about animals is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out the school's football team, the Timber Wolves. The staff itself looks like something from America's Funniest Home Videos, and can even catch a ball without tripping or falling on each other. So when Bud appears one day, he proves he can play as a receiver to them, and he is arguably the best player on the team. <br /> <br /> The friend is extremely cute in his football outfit. Oh, it's enough to melt the heart. The dog is the best in this movie too. Too bad there were not enough stunts done by him to divert attention from the fact that no one ever asks questions about a puppy playing with a school football team. <br /> <br /> There is a very bad subcommittee. plot about Russian circus workers who like to steal amazing animals, of course they try to catch Buddy. But their obscure minds are dominated by animals and end up doing what appears to be a "Alone at Home" scenario. <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a lot more silly than the first one as well. . The Russian kidnappers add a lot of lamprey clowning, which, I must admit, made me laugh at the stupidity of everything. There are many sequences detailing a crazy nature and very few scenes that depict the real reason people will watch this movie - to see a dog playing football. <br /> <br /> The presentations were also quite embarrassing. I liked the performances of Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the overall degree of performance would be equivalent to a D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> There were some hilarious moments near the end by some football advertisers, but that's hardly worth mentioning. Will the children like this movie? Maybe, but even they will get tired when the heart feels that the discussions become too long and too deep. They will surely complain that the dog did not have enough screen time, and are reluctant to the quick-change script, and protest against boring performances, and argue that this film is rubbish compared to origami to "Air Bud" as I made. <br /> <br /> I suppose they will think the dog is adorable.
