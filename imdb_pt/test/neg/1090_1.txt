Relentless in a bad / good way ... this movie has officially become the worst "made for TV movie" in my book ... except for the value of the camp it offers, I give it a quality 1 and a 10 for the camp value. Suggestion: Watch with friends, champagne and lots of popcorn ... you'll want to play some on the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth from their 'Sex in the City Days' ... this movie is terribly funny. This is definitely the low point in the careers of all cast members ... honestly, I do not know how they managed to laugh when the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is absolutely pathetic. ALL participated in the school of excessive performance; and poor Joan Van Ark, I believe she was the one to take this theater of the absurd seriously ... she is credited as a producer. Her "mommy" jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer. This film also crosses the delicate line of social inaccuracy when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot. This is an obscure movie showing on Lifetime listed as {With Harmful Intentions} ... Has anyone else had the pleasure?
