Director Lo Wei was known to read the running papers and take naps on the set - he tells us something about his "approach to movies, huh? The comments I read fall into two categories: 1) this is such a bad movie it is funny, or 2) it's such a bad movie that it's boring. <br /> <br /> So, let's go to the point where we all agree - this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> I vote for the category 2.) The story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is further fragmented and distorted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing.Although Lo Wei was so in love with her that he slowed down so we can all have a look at him either <br /> <br /> Maybe Lo Wei was upset by the day (or two) this movie was made in - he just wanted to make everyone suffer, cast, crew and audience <br /> < Save yourself the agony.
