The Congo is another multimillion-dollar adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence. I'll make it short and to the point. The scenery is beautiful. The actors, well, are the best they can do. The script? Try to congest hundreds of pages in an hour and a half movie. You get a mess in the end, but how clean of a mess is what counts and Congo falls somewhere below that. There were some silly moments, like why did the murderous gorillas decide to jump in the lava? And Amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, can still intimidate dozens of murderous monkeys around her? What kind of common sense twist is that? Which brings me to this. If there was a boring character in every movie, Amy is one of them. You see Amy is this naive little female who can talk with a special backpack and harness tied to her. Good idea, but it gets annoying after a while listening to her conversation. Congo is worth seeing, and not deplorable, but it certainly is not a memorable movie either.
