After watching Steven Spielberg's version of War Of The Worlds in theaters, I was hooked on the subject. I could remember my favorite parts of the movie, people becoming vaporized, people in panic, fires, explosions, everything was so great ... <br /> <br /> So, a few weeks later I went into my store, and I see David Michael Latt's version of War of The Worlds on the shelf. "It could not have come on DVD, so fast, could it?" I told myself. I read the back of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell instead. "Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders!" So I thought, it might have been a try. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, wrong. As soon as I watched the opening credits, I watched them take forever, I knew something was wrong. Something was going to disappoint me in this movie and it happened. The whole movie stank like a cheese sauce that has been left in the refrigerator for 10 years. From acting, special effects (stupid tripod things, when people vaporize themselves, they turn into orange skeletons), and above all, it never came close to being as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact, the plot was annoying and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What the hell? I ended up getting so bored that I had to advance the film until I found something that seemed remotely interesting. And nothing really was. <br /> <br /> My advice: do not even touch this movie, stay 30 yards away from it. Spielberg's version is coming near the end of this month, buy this one! But please, please, I beg you! Stay away from that shit before it chokes us!
