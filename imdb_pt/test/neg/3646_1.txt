Well, there are some things about this movie. Everyone should see this. You see the nation of Iraq as you've never seen it covered by the media, and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most Americans where the film has its main audience. However, all these glorious things in mind allow you to take a look at some other facts of the movie. There were 150 cameras delivered to the Iraqi people, most of whom see war and the subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the betterment of their nation. And, compared to Saddam, it's simply a weakness in the skin. In addition, Netflix, as the premier distributor, announced the announcement before the election we just received by sending a bulk email to the entire list to see the movie. Many of those who should be labeled as opinions, like facts listed by Iraqis interviewed, are wrong. If one were to review the Red Cross records of Abu Ghraib torture, it was not Saddam's tortured bullies that was a good mix of 80-90% of innocent civilians and 10% to 20% of those legally held. It has never been reported that any of these 10-20% were Saddam's henchmen or curfew rapists. In addition, the Arab world has never listed 'Democracy' as one of its opponents, more correctly are the 6 billion US dollars a year for Isreal, our military bases in Saudi Arabia and our interest in oil. I agree that the media is a complete distortion, but this movie shows that same distortion. I fear that the Iraqi people this film represents have been edited to speak with a Yankee voice. Yes, it is true that Saddam is a vomit, and that his removal many see for the better. It's true that some Iraqis actually get paid well. Just as it is true that no Iraqi people have control of their most valuable oil and American corporations. Nor does it mention that 20,000 civilians died exclusively due to US artillery. Still 15% of the country that has had running water and electricity now does not have it. Nor does it mention that from 1993 to 2003, UN sanctions proposed and authorized by the US government killed more than 200,000 Iraqi civilians. Nor does it mention Democracy when people decide the government, not a massive war machine that sends the message "Be dead or obey." I fear that the floor of the court room should have a few Iraqis who are not so happy with the occupation. Just as the vast majority of the world was not war. In fact, America, Britain, Spain, and the rest of them are not Democrats, they turned their back when they saw how pockets could be full. Hurray, Saddam is out of power, but I'm afraid no Iraqi is in power. Corporations are in power, the media is in power. Read, do your own research and do not blind them.
