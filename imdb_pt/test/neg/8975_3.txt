The main part of this lightweight musical history is located in the fictional Midwick College, which Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) watches because of the generosity of stage actress Grace Hayes, her real-life mother who plays the same role here, and who can provide her love interest through his secretary Mary (Healy), who is his real-life wife. Drably directed from a weak script, and additionally hampered by excessive cut and poor editing, this film provides some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number and has nice turns by soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as a diner holder and the dynamic tap dancing Roland Dupree.
