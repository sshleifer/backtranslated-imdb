I initially tuned in the Paranormal State because I (more or less) think the paranormal search genre is interesting, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> I really like Ghost Hunters because more than half of their investigations result in total Debunking, and find the most haunted to be hilarious with their use of British mediums and frumpy British women with day-glo eyes Paris Hilton fainting from fear / demonic presences all shot in the lovely green of night vision. <br /> <br /> Paranormal State has none of this appeal. It looks like it was cobbled together of "leads" that the Ghost Hunters rejected. The episodes ranged from trailer families and single moms to teenage girls sitting around and scaring themselves to an "interview" with a 5-year-old boy about the monster that lives in his room (the monster says RAWRRR). All these people calling a college club to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his huge ego. He leads his troupe of bully-eyed colleagues except when a case is considered "too extreme" and orders them to stay at the HAHAHA hotel. It is better to leave this to the professionals, that is, himself. <br /> <br /> The unconscious comedy of that program is all about how participants are gullible. Ryan reports his stories of being hunted, followed by a demon he first encountered when the Catholic Church recruited him to help in a case. Sorry, but the Catholic Church has people who can do this, they do not need the day shift manager at Quiznos to earn their 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is horrible, shame of A & E by bankrolling. this nonsense, trying to follow in the footsteps of some shows with much better paranormal themes. It's almost unintentionally funny except that Ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock is not worth it.
