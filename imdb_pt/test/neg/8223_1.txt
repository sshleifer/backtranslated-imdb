Garden State was a mediocre movie at best. The film looks more like a compilation of thoughts than the writer (Zach Braff) had, rather than a cohesive story. The disjointed plot might have been more engaging if it had not been interspersed with nonsensical scenes that were nothing more than "quirky". Coincidentally, these scenes are often those that are conveyed in the conversation (Zack going through taps that call as he passes, crazy party scene, screaming over a canyon, the list goes on). The main character is flat, disengaging and ultimately unpleasant, which is most displayed in the scene in which he speaks to his father, selfishly ignoring his father's problems, including a recently deceased wife , and speaking for himself "What should I do with my life?" problem. The film ends when Andrew (Zach Braff) decides not to return to Los Angeles because he can not get away from the love of his life, Sam (Natalie Portman), whom he has known for two days. . Which can only lead me to the conclusion that the movie's message is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas ... Of course you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities, but if that were the case, you could have been made better. Much better. <br /> <br /> This movie does not know what it wants to be. A drama, a comedy, a movie of abandoned teenagers or a range of other things. I say this not as a person of a single genre, but as a person who loves pieces of various genres, such as those dominated by Stanley Kubrick. The reason I feel this does not work for the Garden State is because instead of mixing the genres together, it jumps around; one scene is one genre, the next another, and back, so on. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot of people telling me to cut a little slack for Zach Braff, after all it was his first feature film and he debuted. as director, writer and lead actor. Impressive as was the first movie, I should think that with as much money as he, he could do better. There were much better filmmakers for the first time (Michel Gondry "Human Nature", David Gordon Green "George Washington"). Maybe if he kept typing or directing or acting, it would have been better. Zach Braff is a talented artist, perhaps his second attempt is not so boring and disconnected.
