I could not believe the original rating I found when I looked for this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately it seems like I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> The film is very slow and boring, one of the saddest things is that if the film had a realistic rating around 5 or 6, then the expectation was would not have been so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was not the case, so by watching the movie, and seeing the poor history and acting, I am giving a score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is superb in Stock Lock, and also Snatch, and he plays a big hard man, however, he should keep this role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger made comedy movies, they just do not work. <br /> <br /> Nor can he play the lead actor, he plays better as support or not. When he interprets lead, his acting talents are very "in sight" and are shown as not very good. Mean Machine is another good example of this.
