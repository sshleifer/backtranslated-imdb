Scim-fi inexpressive and extremely low budget without any charm and appeal. Even scenes related to falling asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot. It's just a steal from "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). Mr. Hopper seems to be eager to escape this senseless and bland science fiction entry. <br /> <br /> I give this a 2 (two). And do not say I'm not a good boy!
