A dark terror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples spend the night in a cabin after being a bit uncomfortable with the hostility of the locals. Who, or what, are the Blood Stalkers? After a while they find out. Stay tuned for the character of the village idiot who cackles like a chicken, he sure is weird.
