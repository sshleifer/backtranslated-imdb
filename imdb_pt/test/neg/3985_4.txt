I saw this movie shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two films. Both have great castings and good acting. Both have very different sibling stock characters, an offensive stepmother, a woman friend / confidant, an emotionally unavailable parent, a dead mother, and a surprise lover. Both films make the characters experience a change of life and both films suffer from a kind of sentimentality of 'love conquers all'. Both add a bit of excitement with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back of Gwyneth Paltrow naked. <br /> <br /> Both films seem artificial, as if the writers of the works on which the films are based did market research. and said, "Okay, there's a marketplace for stories about relationships between women, so I'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother ??" In other words, instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship, the relationship is invented to suit the dramatic situation. It seems forced, the characters do not seem real, the relationships are unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The resolution of tensions between the characters is simplistic, with simple excuses completely driving away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling hot and confused. Forever. It's not just real. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> The characters in In Her Shoes are a little more exaggerated than Moonlight & Valentino, especially the stepmother. Sydelle Feller is so wicked that it's hard to believe that her father would stay with her, or even marry her in the first place. <br /> <br /> If you liked Moonlight & Valentino you'll probably like In Her Shoes as well. Pleasant performances in both, in fact, the actors bring depth to their parts that go far beyond the invented sentimentalism of scripts.
