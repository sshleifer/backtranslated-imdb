This DVD is only 30 minutes long, and has dull interviews that reveal that the average Slipknot has an IQ of about 30. But those aspects are the least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the less talented metal bands to sell more than 100,000 units of its crap. (The only reason I say "one of" instead of "the" is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Like Ed Gein's girlfriends, the band's music is made up of old metal cliches, which must be found in his image and his ultra-dull music. In fact, your image is fun; their videos are like snippets of cheesy horror films, so they serve at least some purpose as entertainment. <br /> <br /> His music, however, is not of a quality - just a bunch of puzzlers, ears-they- Riffs of a million times before played only with the guitar that are in no way related to each other and yet they are randomly grouped to form "songs" that have no cohesion, no highlight, nothing. But if the riffs are really bad, then the vocals are even worse: Slipknot's lead singer has a stereotypical and uninteresting "grunt" - the kind that 90% of metal bands have today - but that's nothing compared to when deluded hunter begins to try to sing! Still, what could you expect? Rule # 39 of the "Nu Metal" manual states clearly: "You will alternately growl and sing. Ignore the fact that the two styles do not mix well because most of your fans are so deaf that they will love you even if you tap on the microphone. " Slipknot is in its worst moment when its "singer" begins to belch "melodies". <br /> <br /> But back to your image. It is stolen, copied, stolen, stolen, borrowed, borrowed without asking for anything other than Mr.Bungle. Have you never heard of them? Of course you do not. You just listen to nu-metal, and Mr.Bungle is pretty far from it, and beyond any categorization anyway. They also wore masks - grotesque, hideous, Slipknot-like, I might add - in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This band, whose vocalist is Mike Patton of Faith No More, has never done very well because music was not aimed at average fans (to say the least). <br /> <br /> So, basically, Slipknot is not the same original in the imaging department. They have nothing new to offer, so they will be forgotten in several years: once the masks become boring for the legions of their fans, that's when Slipknot will be forced to compete in the music business with just their generic music. Speaking of Mike Patton, it's interesting that several nu-metal bands often sing him as a big influence. Predictably - and fortunately - Patton is not flattered by it and denied being proud of being an influence on one of the worst metal subgenres of all time ... That said, enjoy this little DVD and the cheap emotions he can bring to the untrained ear and bored eyes ... And then polish the Slipknot posters, because in a few years no one will care for them, the poor ones. Having seen Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed," I finally understood why he wears a mask: he is a blue-faced, baby-looking ginger, looking like Dave Mustaine's younger brother! It's not exactly scary. <br /> <br /> For more of my speeches in the world of music, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please punish me very hard, difficult by clicking "No" below.
