First, I'm not a firefighter, but I'm in some sort of para-fire fighting unit (the guys that are called if an earthquake hits and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I've had some training and simulation but I have no experience in real life. <br /> <br /> But still, there are some points that someone notices as totally unbelievable. I can understand that they removed the mouth / nose-pieces from the masks and that there is not enough smoke because the audience would not see anything. But some things defy logic: <br /> <br /> - No second mask attached to oxygen. How the hell do you want to rescue people through the smoke without one? <br /> <br /> - Rapel people. No, it's not like that. I'd be screaming too if someone grabbed a rope around me like that and hanged me from a building. If I could scream, that is, and not faint from shortness of breath because the rope squeezes my lungs. The second time, when they are practicing Jack, it's better, but still strange. <br /> <br /> - "Aim high". No, you do not. You always fight the fire as low as you can. You do not fight either sprinkle flames, you will want to extinguish the fire, and this is below the flames. <br /> <br /> - Without discipline. They're running like chicken. And they scream all the time, instead of using the radio and maintaining discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why do not they work on teams of at least two? You can still separate, but it takes a lot more than if everyone just rushed past for victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really go into buildings without water? I, Europe, the firemen would never enter a burning building without. <br /> <br /> - Firefighters on the roof. WTF do they think they are doing there without safety lines or water? - Explosive rooms. Wood and brick do not "explode suddenly". <br /> <br /> The best points are actually camaraderie and the other parts of the film that are not fire-fighting. It's very kitsch, but that's okay. I'll make a point for that.
