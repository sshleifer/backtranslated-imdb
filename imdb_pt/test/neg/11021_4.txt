... BREAKER MORANT and ROMPER STOMPER. He also gave us watchable films like BOOTMEN and THE ODD ANGRY SHOT. Unfortunately for everyone involved in this disaster, WOG BOY will not join any of the two lists. <br /> <br /> I was eager to see this film simply because of the politically incorrect title, so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on the BBC 2 late in the evening, the announcer did not even mention the name of the film, so I was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw would fall into disbelief. He fell into disbelief, I found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this would be a great international success. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the cast and script. I know that Australia, with its small population, does not have a large group of actors, so I'll forgive most, but that does not stop my criticisms of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve. For this kind of comedy to work, you must be impressed by the comedic abilities of the lead actor and I'm sorry to say, but Nick G simply does not have the skills. I've never heard of him and have not seen anything else he's been in, so maybe he's a lot better at other shows. Here, however, he is simply annoying, unconvincing and I lost count with the number of times he stole it for the camera. The jokes are very simple and predictable and coming back to the script looks very underdeveloped, I mean, who thought that a joke about a female Minster Of Work that is taking in the back of a limo was funny to begin with? You have the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said, "Look, buddy, this script is not good enough. Go and make it more subtle and structured" <br /> <br /> I've been hardness and harshness has been required in this review. I gave the film four out of ten and it would have only three, were it not for the genuinely funny sequence in which Steve is watching a reality show just to appear on the screen and labeled "Dole blodger." This shows that the writers were aware of comic time and social commentary. Too bad they did not come with a much better written movie
