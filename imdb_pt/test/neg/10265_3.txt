(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important that you could not have discovered) Yes, it's very strange. I rented in a Blockbuster because I had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box, just a list of bands that had songs on it. But after that, I had a dikens of a time to find it, even here on IMDB. I was confused by "Night of the Demons", but, you know, they're basically the same thing. <br /> <br /> The parts that I loved the most about this movie were the whole thing in the garage. That black guy at the gym was hilarious the way he screamed all the time. Even when shouting was not really necessary, he let out a "LISTEN NOW! BLOCK THE DOOR WITH CARS !!!!" and so they drove cars in front of other cars. But then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick that I believe he was. The other part that caught my eye was the part of the accident outside the building with the guys the girl did not want to see ... What significant aspect of the movie did that give us? What was this? Why did this happen? Why did the movie end with a guy breaking the TV in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running toward the screen, but he was half distant. I mean, he could have just turned off the TV. Yes, this movie was recorded on a whim and yes, I hated it. Good day...
