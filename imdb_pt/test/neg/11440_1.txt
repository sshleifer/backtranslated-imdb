WOW, I'd hate to sound opinionated, but anyone who rates this movie any higher than I have should have an I.Q. which reaches unimaginably low depths that extend beyond time and space and connect to the planet "Hopper-is-a-retarded-to-make-this-movie." WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's haircut looks like SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPIIIDDD! In fact, I considered sending Fred Ward some money in compensation for the miserable haircut he had in this horrible movie. Jodie Foster, of course, does not have much to work with, but she still performs terrible performance everywhere. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who mysteriously is not cast) plays THE ULTIMATE Joe Pesci stereotyped film character, complete with mob killing and constant use of the F word. You will not believe his eyes. Dean Stockwell, watching him in this mess, made me feel bad for him, because in fact I thought he was intoxicated or temporarily retarded during the course of the film. Jon Turturro must have been intoxicated when he agreed to participate, along with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you're thinking, GREAT CAST! I know, and it was the WORST great cast I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper drives and stars and does the same in both areas. How could the man have driven EASY RIDER and that is far beyond my excellent imagination. His ultra-aggressively moody character accent is beyond the realms of horrendous, and is only matched by the hilarious and bad end. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most uninteresting couple I believe I have ever seen in my exposure to the world of cinema, and you will be hoping for them to get lost and then become greatly crazed with the ending. What exactly are the two of you wearing in this action-packed conclusion? I do not know, but I know that if I meet Dennis Hopper, I'm going to do a lot of mocking him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid. Join me! IAN
