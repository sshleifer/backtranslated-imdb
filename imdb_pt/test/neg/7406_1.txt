I can not believe how bad this "movie" is. To begin with, the film deals with the legend of Big Foot and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and having Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising outlook. Unfortunately this is as interesting as it sounds. That sounds like a direct DVD release ... or so I guess. This is basically a non-production case, probably with the worst editing (with a constant "fading to black" between each scene !!!) I've seen in my life and acting that will definitely make you cringe. Why Lance Henriksen chose this is completely unfathomable. And the film takes cues from virtually any other genre film, from "Blair Witch Project" (video scene) and "Predator" to "Alive". This is supposedly based on true events, but the only truth to be found here is how bad this movie is. I'm usually not a hard critic and believe me, I tried to take advantage of this junk, but eventually did not. Do yourself a favor and avoid this DVD. <br /> <br /> I'll try to say the least: this movie is pure trash and made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask for a refund to BLOCKBUSTER !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, what a shame! 1 * of 10 *
