There are good bad movies and bad movies and bad movies ... this is not one of them. This is a movie that does not realize how bad it is. <br /> <br /> I saw this at a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the "Cinema Grindhouse" this theater puts on every month. Hopefully presenters Eric Caiden & co. will think twice before letting the writer / director Lawrenece approach again. What a con man. The guy got up to talk before the movie - you'd think he was Orson Welles talking about "Touch of Evil" or some other lost classic. Difficultly. Nice for him to take 20 minutes of public time with his incoherent ramblings. "Young Warriors" was described as a cross between "Animal House" and "Death Wish," but if you're expecting something like "Revenge of the Nerds" or "The Exterminator" The direction is so bad that the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car explode? <br/> <br/> Poor Richard " "In this film he plays another character with the first name of" John ", but this is the only similarity that his character has with the aforementioned classic.I hope this movie allows him to pay the rent for another month. actors who seemed to want to be somewhere else included Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of time.Even the audience did not seem interested (except for the scarecrow boy sitting in the background, who shouted "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend, who laughed with the fervor of a lobotomized Barbie every time he opened his mouth). <br /> <br /> For real-life watchers, I would suggest the following: Desire for Death I, II, III, Terminator I, Vigilante Force, Ms. 45, Rolling Thunder, the No-Mercy Man (the latter two being a couple of films presented in this theater a few years ago - probably the same budget as "Young Warriors", but both were a million times better!)
