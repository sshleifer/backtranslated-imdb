A robbery of Roger Corman mounted for what seems to be virtually zero budget. All of the special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars," and I suspect a fair amount of props, costumes, and scenarios were reused from other sources as well. The story seems to have been written around these elements, so this is not really a movie as much as it is a recycling project. The third-class "Star Wars" junk was not needed then or now.
