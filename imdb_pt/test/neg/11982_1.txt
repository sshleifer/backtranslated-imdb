Barely came through the whole movie ... Acting is bad, the dialogues are even worse. I felt st00pid 4 half watching, but was named the same as one of my favorite games, so I fought through. They even ruined the sound. In certain parts of the movie, the background music is so loud that I had to turn down the volume. It would be great, if it were a contest over who could screw it up. <br /> <br /> Oh, and PS: I do not know what this guy "Uwe" is capable of creating ... I certainly do not think this movie is bad just because he is the director. I checked the list of your work, and this is your first (and probably the last) creation I've seen. <br /> <br /> More and more.
