Dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully extravagant cinema. From the beginning, I assumed that I was into something very unpleasant. With a cast featuring Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio and Tiny Lister, what would you expect? Well let's just say that expectations have been overwhelmed ... <br /> <br /> If I really start, I feel that this review will last a long time, so let's keep it simple. The vampire is not even called Dracula. The space crew is carrying coffins from the Carpathian sector of the Transylvania system. In his big scene, Coolio talks about the most horrible things in the history of cinema. In the year 3000, everyone wears bad clothes by current standards, has nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair and decorates with neon lights that seem stolen from a skating rink. <br /> <br /> Everything out ... the end. God is merciful and sweet. It does not deserve to be ruined. It has to be sen to be believed. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie as a "1" and I would like to give it a zero ... but I feel compelled to make you watch. What madness is that?
