It's really overwhelming to see a once great director like Deodato delivering a second-rate giallo like this. This film was so terrible that it effectively put an end to his film career. The box is a lie, this is not an "erotic thriller," the hell during the 97 minute length of the movie, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us a nipple! I thought I would pick up once William Burger appeared (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed abruptly and phony. This movie fails in almost every way. The music of Claudio Simonetti is little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by ghosts who attack using phones. (?) In the end, all the characters seem to have forgotten the past 90 minutes of hell they passed, and casually laugh while they enrag the evil spirits at someone else, Lewis' ex-boyfriend. What?!? This movie did little for me besides irritating me ... and bored me to death. For genuine 80's Deodato fun, watch the BARBARIANS or the ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS, let this rot on the shelf of the video store. Argento could do a better giallo than that!
