I can not fake any knowledge of photography or of Mr. Angelopoulos. But I know Greece and I love her people. In July, my 14 year old son and I traveled to Cappadocia, Turkey, in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great-grandfather Iordanis lived until the great exodus of the Anatolian Greeks in 1923. Reading the summary of the film (refugees from Odessa) I thought maybe I could learn something more about the forced migrations of the modern Greeks. If I had not had a home in Rhodes I would not have gone to Greece 28 times in so many years if I had not been familiar with dozens of islands and cities in Greece and had never enjoyed the friendship of these effervescent and intoxicated inhabitants? people, I might have believed that this whining had something to do with modern Greece. As a teacher at a New Jersey state college, let me assure you that I am familiar with the story of the period covered by the film. In fact, my wife's uncle was murdered by the Communists during the communist invasion of power. My mother-in-law lived the Italian invasion and German occupation ... barely. These characters on the screen speak Greek, listen to Greek music, but who are they? No, they are not even vaguely Greek. Of course they are not people, but simply allegories. They are what the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to their perception of what it was or should have been like. All represent some aspect of the post-war in Greece, which larger external forces consigned to a destination they did not deserve. As we played in the late 1970s in America: "The Revolution did not happen." For an ideologist / artist, this is not a joke. In fact, it's reason to spend two and a half hours of torment. And it is all because the various Powers (the soliloquy of Eleni's "guards" in different colored uniforms) did not allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (Spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of Nikos and his fellow musicians, that is, the Movement, the Cause). This gloomy and surrealist revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the Greek people to sustain their desire for life through the tragedies of the 20th century to reach out beyond any of their Balkan neighbors to become so politically evolved and globally integrated.
