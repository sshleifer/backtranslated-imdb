As Ben Elton once remarked, nothing comes faster than comedy. Steve Martin's latest offering - "The Pink Panther 2" - recently open to bad reviews and black box office, while Mike Myers's "The Love Guru" seems to have conquered few admirers. <br /> <br /> In 1970 it was Jerry Lewis's turn to feel the pain of rejection (ironically, your character in this movie experiences a funny turn when someone uses that word in his presence) when "Which way forward? " effectively took him off the big screen for almost a decade. <br /> <br /> In this World War II comedy, he plays Brendan Byers 111, the richest man in the world, who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty (and also because he is bored with success), but is rejected because it is medically inappropriate. He then decides to start his own privately funded army by recruiting other 4-F's. <br /> <br /> Dressed in ridiculous uniforms that look like those used by 'International Rescue' in 'Thunderbirds', they go into training. Some good visual jokes here. When they fire rockets, they seem satisfied with themselves until they find out that they have just destroyed a Texaco oil station! Wanting to learn German, Brendan plays a long-running album called 'Songs To Mein Kampf By'. When this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a messy dining room full of drafts, they are in an opulent room adorned with a chandelier. <br /> <br /> John Wood is very funny as' Finkel ', Byers' always - So English butler. His best scene is when he blackmails a Mafia-type gangster to teach Byers's brigade to kill. <br /> <br /> The script was not Jerry's own, but Gerald Gardiner and Dee Caruso, the author of several episodes. of 'The Monkees'. 'Front' often has the appearance of a television sitcom, in fact, sometimes you almost expect to hear a chuckle. <br /> <br /> When that goes wrong, it's the last thirty minutes, when Byers replaces top Nazi commander and, after ordering the Germans to withdraw from the front, gets entangled in the plot to kill Hitler (and Tom Cruise not in sight!). As commander, Jerry presents a performance so inebriated that it defies description. He gives Brian Blessed a run for his money in the 'loudest man alive' bets. It is a relief when the final credits appear. <br /> <br /> Maybe the moment was simply wrong - launching a war comedy when the Vietnam conflict was not a good idea. Or the audience just had enough of Jerry (that beard probably did not help!). What he needed here was a good producer, someone to take him by the hand and say, "This joke stinks. Throw it away!" "Do not go up the bridge, lower the river" is a masterpiece compared to this image. With the arrival of the 70's, the new icons of the comedy would be Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Monty. Python - fresher, more biting and in the case of Allen, more humane styles of comedy have replaced Jerry's antics. It would not be until 1982 that he would do anything as a successful comeback - as the vain talk show host "Jerry Langford" in Martin Scorcese's brilliant "The King of Comedy".
