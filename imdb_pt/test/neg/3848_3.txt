Just to save $ 3, or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store, and the harrowing hour - and yet - this movie - here is a simple plan. Go to a friend's house, invite them to rent The Pest for you, watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up an excuse to leave. The opening sequence is really funny, definitely worth watching. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. Without the shower scene at the beginning, this is one of the worst movies of all time.
