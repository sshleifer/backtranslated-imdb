Now I'm a big fan of animation - I love Svankmeyer and I'm usually in all stop motion applications, so I had high hopes for this one. So I joined the IMDb and stopped - always suspicious of movies with a bimodal distribution of votes in IMDb. Here we have another --- a lot of 10s (shill anyone) and then some really low ones. I'm also wary of those with the word "visionary" in them. <br /> <br /> Of course there are visionaries, but this character is not one of them. Despite my doubts, I've seen this movie and have to stand by the others. The stop motion animation was ok, but the plots were banal and overall they looked amateurish. Treat yourself to the real deal get some Svankmeyer and let this also ran on the shelf.
