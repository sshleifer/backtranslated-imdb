I have to say I've seen worse Sci Fi Channel originals, but this Nu Image Shonker by Yossi Wein was still pretty tough. The big problem is that it simply is not convincing, not just its creature, but acting, writing and any attempt at drama. The direction lacks talent and the screenplay of Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never works, is predictable, often ridiculous, while offering fewer howlings than some of those types of movies that never offer anything to engage or raise the pace. Actors do the best they can, but with this material, their work efforts have little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is an adorable hero, Meredith Morton, similar to a love interest. In fact, she was a little less convincing, but at least she was easy on the eyes. The film, at least, has the dignity to fit in a reasonable pace, but the biggest advantage is that the octopus is not fully rendered by computer graphics. So even if it does not look good, at least there are some legitimate scenes of characters struggling nested with rubberized tentacles in a very amusing way. I also laughed at the disparities between different representations of the octopus, the cgi shots of the creature as a whole vary throughout the film, they are also different not only in size but also in appearance, and there are practical scenes. scenes in which the tentacular action suggests that the makers had abandoned, pretending they were making a movie about an octopus and just imagined its creature as a bunch of diverse tentacles. Scenes of the creature attacking people age very quickly, but there are some funny scenes where it takes on other things, like a boat and a crane. Yes, these scenes are bad, but they made me laugh. Undisputed highlight, though, is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes on a New York landmark, the scene may not be much longer than a minute, but it's really inspired, and it's worth looking up on youtube. Also, things are not inspired everywhere (a lack of blood or evil prevents it from being taken out of the trash). The film turns out to be disaster territory in the end, but I can not really give credit because the best shots in the last scenes were taken from the movie Stallone Daylight (which, according to my recollection, is very good). All in all, this was pretty crap and it was not something I would really recommend to anyone except the creature feature, die hards. Better than a punch in the eye with a wet stick, but not much.
