The discussion was held a thousand times. The "Merchant of Venice" is anti-Semitic? (I think it is.) Is it always unfair to point out some anti-Semitism in such a great work of art? (I do not think so.) Does that tarnish Shakespeare's reputation as the greatest playwright in the world? (I think so.) Does this play a role if he does not do it for a specific racist purpose? (I do not think so.) Michael Radford knew all this and that's why he added to his film a prologue about the unfortunate situation of the Jews in the Renaissance Venice. <br /> In vain; because the play remains what it always was and the new composition only gives a first (but futile) hope that someone has dared to fix something that remains a permanent outrage, not because its degree of anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking, but because part comes under the name of William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time portraying a man's hatred - Shylock? Why employ a great and serious actor like Al Pacino, if in the end everything is ruining itself in this scandalous (but hey, I'm not-responsible-Shakespeare-wrote-it) court scene. And now I'd like to be very precise, just like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> He is demanding his right, according to the contract that the - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who always used to look upon him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Of course, what Shylock demands is cruel and useless, but that's not the point. What we see (or must see) is a man who has been humiliated all his life, to the point that all that remains in him is his hatred. I think, it's certainly a little inappropriate to teach a man about things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But what the piece / the movie (they are one and the same now) does at this point is .. Become a novel! The cruel madman with his knife, the public horrified (but a little dizzy), the poor "victim" tied to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his fate, but why can not he just say one word, "sorry"? I do not think we need to waste a lot of words on the ridiculous verdict of the young dottore of Padua; is a veritable popular verdict not unlike what would have been seen 400 years later in the Nazi trials. From one minute to the next, this Jew is robbed of everything he possessed, condemned to be baptized as a Christian and expelled. <br /> <br /> Is not that outrageous? Obviously not. The story advances to the romantic complexities of the rings and their happy ending. <br /> <br /> What can be learned at the Jewish Museum of Libeskind in Berlin and in similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the masses. because what is so devastating to a minority or to some individuals is embedded in the alleged greater good for the majority. It should be exactly the task of each of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask such tendencies. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this film was meant to empathize with the battered Shylock (this just does not work). I do not think anyone can be forced to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; in particular, not for an Oscar.
