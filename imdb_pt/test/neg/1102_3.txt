I can not believe I let myself in this movie to do a favor that my friends asked me at the beginning of this April 14, 2007. This movie certainly a pain in the back in the theater and boring sickly, I did not even feel the bloody impact of their "scary scenes", which I consider to be complete failure to attract their audience. The worst even ran over me because my friend did not arrive on time at the theater because she was busy helping her boyfriend find a suitable store to stay in for one night. I was not very disappointed with this subject, but this movie is really a subject for me, poor plot, useless plot, naively created and I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> The title I do not suggest, however, that shivers and horror do not dominate us, perhaps the beating of animals can be more chilling if they show the real situational game in theaters. Good luck to anyone who tries to watch it anyway.
