I'm sorry, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can not believe that after doing the first of the series they were able to get a budget to do another. Not that the budget could have been too much - this is the least scary movie I've ever watched and laughed all the way to the end (actually I can not believe we watched it until the end) but I guess it's because we might not I really believe that.
