Great music, but these people are not PATHETIC?!? A real piece of The Trippy Sixties, and it left me depressed. The director paints the wrong side of the jetset's life and stings like a wasp nest. If the culture of the time led people to do these things, it seems to me that everything was a journey without discovery, just despair. I've tried, really tried, like this movie, but these people are not anywhere on my page. Yes, it would be good to see the world, to leave for a while, but I always plan to return. Drugs are not the cause of these characters' falls, are they their bad attitudes? these guys drink passionately their poison cup. They make their lives cheaper and, in the end, they make life cheaper. Has the novel ever been so dark? <br /> <br /> Congratulations: Interesting scenario. Wonderful soundtrack by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Warnings: Dated. Drugs. Depressing. Completely unpleasant characters; they are not children of flowers. <br /> <br /> Just for the curious, since most packages faint at the Pink Floyd connection. (Rare Floyd tracks many never heard before, as FM is not what it was.) Rating: Two Stars.
