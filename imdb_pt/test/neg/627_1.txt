Beautiful, stereotyped, good-looking, the story makes a wide and confusing arc, prompting you to go through a series of garden paths (without fairy assistants) before plunging to an end that makes you go hollow. <br /> <br /> If you are after a movie that climaxes or ends with a satisfying thud, this is going to be a disappointment. Despite the fanciful sexuality of the main character, I felt that he was androgynous, lacking a clear masculine personality, more or less like the lack of a clear French personality. Even if he is lying naked (or rather, sitting naked) at the end of the movie, the viewer is as unconscious as the character about the motives - that little thing called a plot. Probably a stereotypically speaking English point of view, at least if you take the side of the film.
