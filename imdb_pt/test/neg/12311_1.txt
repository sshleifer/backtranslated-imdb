Sacred cow, what a piece of this movie is this. I did not know how these filmmakers could get a 250-word book and turn it into a movie. I think they did not know either! I do not remember any fart or burp in the book, do you? <br /> <br /> They took this classic of children, added some farting, burping and sexual inuindo, and prostituted in a joke of KAKA. That should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by the mood of the bathroom (if you think this kind of thing is funny) I DO NOT WANT the kids I know to think it is. <Br /> <br /> Do not take your kids to see, do not rent the DVD. I hope the Ghost Phantom of Dr. Suess comes and haunts the people who made this movie.
