I can not understand why many seem to hate this. <br /> <br /> This film brings together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using stage pieces, props and costumes similar to those seen in other films. Here, however, the story attempts to traverse all of human history, with a framed story about the human race being judged, with a verdict of guilt that means that the -h-bombs will explode all over the world. The promoter is the devil, played with demonic joy by Vincent Price. Okay, so it's a bit cheesy to call the defender of "The Spirit of All Men," but I think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of vintage charm. The Spririt of Man is, by the way, played very well by Ronald Coleman in his last film. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played only by extravagant humor. Chico is not at all funny like a monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, we are told, is to be Isaac Newton, uncovering gravity. Most of the other performances are well done, though. Other hokey things are that the trial is supposed to occur in outer space, which is described as a region of clouds and blue. There is something called "The Great Clock of Outer Space," which, upon reaching midnight, may signal the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But deep down, the film addresses the problems of weapons of mass destruction and the eternal. asks whether the man is basically good or basically bad; and puts this into what I think is an interesting way. Also, anyone who likes the look of fantasy epics from the fifties should like the look of this movie.
