Director / writer Allan Burns seems to have put together two different scripts before reaching this little exit: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. It results in a lamentably bland movie. Christine Lahti plays a cynical television reporter who befriends aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and soon dines with Moore and her family - only to discover that Mary's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret affair! Burns has a strange rhythm to stop and start in his dialogue, which is neither realistic nor effective (increasingly annoying because nothing important seems to be said). Moore, lean on railroads, with a frighteningly fragile look on his collant, has a radiant smile, but does not convince as Danson's wife, and Danson gets stuck in an insignificant and ungrateful role (he's only there to be an idiot). The film tries to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching (the role of the woman in the workplace, the TV news, the father of the family, the wife who works and the mother who wants more, the need of a woman for female friendships, et al), but nothing substantial comes from these ideas, since Burns only unenthusiastically examines the problems. As a writer, he is surprisingly free of jokes, but he is devoid of purpose as well, and the heavy conspiracy ends up getting all dirty. * 1/2 of ****
