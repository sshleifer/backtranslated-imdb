Big (and we mean bigger-sized) baddie Sebastian Cabot is trying to escape farmers' salt of land off their land in order to get oil rights. When Sterling Haden's pop is killed, how will Haden end the TERROR IN A TOWN TOWN, armed only with a harpoon? <br /> <br /> First, this is not a B-western. There are no singing cowboys, no daring acrobatics, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie - you know, those who use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general low-budget hype of events with interesting camera angles. <br /> <br /> Second, this film, to avoid compromises (would be expected) that would cause the elimination of the Important Statements of Trumbo on Justice in the United States, and the rather sickly relationship between the chief henchman and his girl , is a really low budget. The main problem that causes is that the acting is very, very bad. Sterling Haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he's the last guy you want to play a sensitive Swedish sailor who went to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make a Sydney Greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. Not a bad idea, but Cabot does not have the skills for it. The guy who plays the rented gun with the lost arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the movie. He does not do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the script really is not all that. Trumbo learns that the immigrant will not be able to get rid of the sheriff of a corrupt city, and people, when faced with real oppression, tend to retreat. This is a rather old film message in 1958 - High Noon, Bad Day in Black Rock, Devil's Doorway - are all Westerners dealing with the evils of Western society with an eye to the evils of America in the 1950s. 1959, he certainly had every personal reason to agree with these feelings, but he is not doing anything new or interesting with them. <br /> <br /> So, given all the negatives, why does this movie a 4? Mainly because there are interesting quirks throughout the film. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is fascinating.) And Trumbo, although a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affections, is very good at creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Only when someone is ready to faint from boredom Indy film, will come a simple dialogue or quirkiness exchange that one realizes that guy writing the script was not simply a hack. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Trumbo or westerns, give this one a present. Otherwise try. You may like it more than I do.
