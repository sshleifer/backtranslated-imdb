It's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. Geoffrey Sax attempted to remove Othello from Shakespeare, bringing him into the modern context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to achieve this. There were extra bodies to help put everything into perspective, however John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, reacted a lot in this film, causing the fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, eventually ending in Dessie's death. <br /> <br /> Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. He did not give enough evidence for Dessie to be betraying Othello, with Michael Cass played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just threw a friend at everyone and gave a reason why she "was" cheating. In the piece, it took much more of the Iago to convince Othello to suspect something. This change made the film more about anger for the wrong reasons, than the book was based off. However, the movie had some good points. He transformed the scenes of the army into a more racist group for the blacks, where Othello is the chief chief of the police squad. These scenes are made credible by the raging and burning crowds. You are able to feel the amount of racism in the movie, more than you can in the book. This book reproduces the scenes of modern day, making it much easier to understand, than the Shakespearean times in which it was written. In the play, Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets Othello's work. position. He never gets what he deserves and never gets caught by telling the lie to Othello until it's too late. I've seen this as a fall in the movie because I feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the lie promotion, and in the book he is discovered by Rodrigo. Overall, the film could have done a better job based on the game than what it did. I feel that the director of the film left out some of the most important parts of the piece that were mentioned or there to make the play flow or make it more of a tragedy. I would say that you should read the book first in order to understand all the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you may find yourself lost and confused.
