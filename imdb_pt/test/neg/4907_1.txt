This was one of the most planned, tedious and cliche movies I've ever seen ... and yes, I saw Pearl Harbor. Even the likes of Gina McKee could not get out of the frightening dialogue. It has been described as 'art-house', this can only be a euphemism for dull, terrible and, frankly, no art. Why is it that when a movie is devoid of plot, critics think it deserves to be called art? But much more disconcerting, why did America love it? Without you, this movie would have remained on the shelf where, perhaps, it belonged.
