I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and I really enjoyed it. I do not know what happened to the movie version because it was terrible. Maybe some dialogue that works on the stage sounds inconsistent on the screen. Anyway, I could not wait for this movie to end. The performance is universally above the top. Only Kevin Spacey has it all together, and it looks like he knows he's in a bad movie and can barely wait to leave.
