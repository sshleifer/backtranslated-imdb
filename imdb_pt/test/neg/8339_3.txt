When I saw this movie, all I could think was: what a mess! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I've seen a lot of movies, but this is certainly one of the worst of all time. I do not care about the fact that a volcano erupts below the center of LA to be possible or not. Maybe it is not, but even though this could have been a good movie ... but it sure is not and I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much lava flow out of an ordinary volcano, but what I do know is that the volcano in this film makes Vesuvius, Mount Etna and Mount Pinatubo together look like a small barbeque. I do not think there has ever been as much lava coming out of a volcano as we see in this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his film, but I really wonder why he spent it all on special effects and not on screenplay and actors. I'm not saying he should have hired a main cast, but that's exactly the opposite of what I'd call acting. Their performances are so incredibly poor that they make the whole movie even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script you probably ask yourself? Well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea of ​​people standing a few feet or even a few feet away from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for health? Or people sinking in the ground when the lava flow is not even two feet high? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you would not be proud to write such a script, but there are apparently Hollywood script writers who do not care about credibility as long as they pay good money! VERY good money !!! <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you'll probably agree with me that this is one of the worst Hollywood disaster movies, worth no more than 3/10.
