This is a B-movie barrel-like background from one of the poverty line studios, Monogram, in the mid-1940s, the type that filled a double bill. <br /> <br /> Only reason I watched It was to see how JACKIE MORAN was in a leading role as a page boy on a radio station trying to solve a murder. He played Phil Meade in GONE WITH THE WIND just two years earlier and this was one of his last teen roles. He's no Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The script is as unfortunate as production values ​​and is full of cliché situations with a cast of evenly untalented individuals. WANDA McKAY is the girl who is "discovered" by a radio producer and SIDNEY MILLER is the nerdy friend of the hero who is afraid of his own shadow. <br /> <br /> Mercifully, it ended in an hour when the murder is resolved after a survey of all the suspects. Terribly outdated, the only silent performance of any interest is given by JON GILBREATH as Tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust after a very brief appearance. <br /> <br /> There are several songs but all of them are forgettable as well as the jokes and dialogues.
