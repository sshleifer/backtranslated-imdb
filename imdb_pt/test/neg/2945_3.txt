TWINS EFFECT is a poor movie in many ways. The only good thing is that you do not take yourself seriously. Other than that, this is not really a movie, but rather a merchandising tool for the two stars of the movie, pop idols popular in their native Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is poorly built and acted. The direction offers some silly martial arts, which is strange since the director of action (and supposedly co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong teen-oriented movies, big fans of "actors" like the Twins (the two girls who play this movie) and Ekin Cheng, there's so much bad music that it makes the audience believe that certain scenes are funny , smart, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: it's all for nothing. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, this is a bad movie. It's not funny enough, it's not serious enough, and usually it's also fake chewing gum for its own good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (Go to nixflix.com for a more in-depth look at this film and other foreign films)
