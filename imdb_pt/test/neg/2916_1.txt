Possible spoiler alert, although there is not much to spoil about this movie. I saw the project Part II not having seen the first movie. I do not think I've lost much. Project A Part Two is not only Jackie Chan's worst movie I've ever seen (yes worse than 'Fantasy Mission Force'), this movie is one of the most uncontested films the world has ever seen. It's upstairs with the 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' on the sleep-inducing scale. The plot is twisted and tied up like a 50 foot ball with which the cat is playing and finally left to die. The 'humor', if you can call it that, seems to have been written by an irritating freshman from High School, who despite how many people say he is not funny, is determined to have his manic mood, no matter how painful a movie is made . And this movie is painfully bad. The plot involves Jackie Chan as a Navy officer recruited by the police force to gather "all known criminals". He fills them in the first half hour of the movie, and I prayed for a quick end that I could not. Why the movie bothers to progress from this point I have no idea. The film continues and continues without purpose, without plot and mood attempts that fail so miserably that they make the Carrot Top seem like a comic genius. The Kung Fu in this movie is lame and forgettable. There is better Kung Fu in this movie about the 3 ninjas. Project Part II is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, but it is a complete waste of the talents of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung, who have made worlds films beyond this. As Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes from certain death, I enter into 'Blair Witch' mode asking (and wishing) 'He's going to die NOW, so the movie can end? `. An example of how ridiculous this film is: Jackie Chan is handcuffed to another man. A gang of pirates (who look nothing like pirates) throw axes at Jackie. Jackie takes one of the rebellious axes and breaks the chain in the shackles? Not! You see it would spoil his "hilarious" gag being handcuffed to someone else. If you have a friend who laughs at everything, I encourage you to watch this movie with him or her, and see how even they will not laugh at this movie. If you are an insomniac, this movie will surely put you to sleep. Do not operate heavy machinery while watching Part II. Possible side effects include headache, retinal tension and death from boredom. 0/5 stars
