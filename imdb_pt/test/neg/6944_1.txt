This is the worst movie I've seen this year from Bollywood so far. I can not lie, my wife really liked this movie. It was not Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal that made this movie unbelievable, but it was Amisha Patel. She plays a blind woman who gets into trouble when she almost falls from a mountain where (fortunately for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to rescue her (in the middle of nowhere). It amazes me here how a blind girl is aware of danger when she is about to fall from a mountain because she can not see her surroundings. From this scene, I began to watch the film closely and in all the scenes there was a flaw in the acting of Amisha Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is very bad. The only way to do this is to not look into the eyes of the person you are talking to. When I saw this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with his performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach that level by performing as an actress. <br /> <br /> In any case, she falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's the cliche story. Sudden Arjun is killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is desperate, but then Bobby enters the movie. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor from my point of view, but he can not pull the movie to a higher level where Amisha Patel buries him deep into the ground. I must say that Bobby deserves better roles in better movies than he has so far. Bobby grew up in the first movie his adorable father gave him. He was so bad at acting in Barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you feel shivers and believe every word he says. Only a movie with such high potential as a Yash Copra movie has to find its way. <br /> <br /> Okay, when Amisha also falls in love with Bobby, someone comes into your life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes in this crap? I do not. Why did not they give their role to one of the ugly faces of the movie family (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and gave Bobby a role in one of the blockbusters with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a shout to an actor like Bobby giving him a big role, but he deserves much better than a movie with Amisha (big and main face) Patel. This movie was so horrible that I regret having bought it.
