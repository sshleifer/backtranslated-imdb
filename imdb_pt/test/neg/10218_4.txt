This stereotyped movie (the hero's girlfriend marries the villain) simply did not move fast enough, given some of the circumstances of the story. Scott seems too old in this, and often his character moves away from a decisive action, emptying the scenes. He responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes Knox's gang hiding in a barrel of rain; his escape to the high country and pursuit by John Russell seems superfluous, much like much of the film. The plot could have been tight. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film: seeing "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without a mustache singing "Man in the Saddle"; The brief scenes of Alfonso Bedoya as a cook; colorful photograph of the High Country and the fighting scene with John Russell.
