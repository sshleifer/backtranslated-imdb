A low-budget horror actor, John Carradine's more animated roles as an implied Nazi scientist who is turning humans into zombies to serve the Reich. Brainless mind, only able to obey the simplest of orders ... as personal at McDonalds. <br /> <br /> Hitler is not mentioned by name, since America was not at war at the time. they were filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for! <br /> <br /> There seem to be two types of zombies in the movies, the traditional type of voodoo popular in the old black and white films of the 1930s and '40s. Empty eyes and just following someone else's commands as they stumble. And then there's the kind we know from later movies like "The Night of the Living Dead" and "The Bad Dead." Still wandering, but only with the intention of killing and eating the flesh and the brain of its victims. Both have their moments in several movies over the years. <br /> <br /> "Revenge" features the old zombie type, though, they are particularly funny and more comfortable in old freak shows, like nerds who bite the heads of chickens. A black zombie named Lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young Don King. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake. Even though he lets her keep his strap-heels as a nice feminine touch when he turns her into one of the undead, she's not happy about it. <br /> <br /> Everything goes very wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the story must be, never, never, turn your wife into a zombie, just ask for trouble ... <br /> /> The film is interesting enough and it rolls quickly to an end, but never rises above its poverty line origins. It's not a patch on any true zombie classic, but fun in the same way.
