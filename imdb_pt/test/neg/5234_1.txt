** May contain spoilers ** Horrible. Just awful. I loved Stephen King's novel, and this is just a horrible adaptation of it. They change the ending. They change the plot. They changed Alan Pangborne's character from a bereaved husband to a happy fiance. If you are a fan of Stephen King's novel, stay away. Even if you do not go, stay away. <br /> <br /> The book was incredibly dark, even for Steve King. An 11-year-old kills himself in the novel. A high school principal is found with child pornography in the novel. This is far from as good as romance. <br /> <br /> This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I hate this movie with a vengeance.
