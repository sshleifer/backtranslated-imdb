There is no way to put into words how bad, how deformed, without patience and without laughter these "Vice-Academy" movies really are. You have to try one for yourself. For the third consecutive time, screenwriter and director Rick Sloane shows neither a gram of writing or talent direction. There is nothing here that a person over 5 years of age believes or laughs, but nudity (very brief) and other elements of "plot" make movies unsuitable for children. Which leads me to believe that they are actually meant for adults with the mental abilities of 5 year old children. Elizabeth Kaitan makes a more than welcome substitute for Linnea Quigley - she is victorious and cute, and her wonderful smile is about the only thing that can make the spectator smile too. But watching her and the other girls in this movie is like seeing a bouquet of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure. (*)
