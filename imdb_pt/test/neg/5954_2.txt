This movie has a lot in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all described abundantly ... without a single word spoken !!! And how bad is it? This movie will make you rethink the origin of humanity. If this were the product of anthropology, you would rather defy Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis altogether. You can not bear to watch this even with your brain off. And now you're thinking, "I have to see this." I warned you. I do not blame myself in any way if you regret spending more than an hour staring at this work of art. Well, I warned you. This must be forgotten and buried forever.
