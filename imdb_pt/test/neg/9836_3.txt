A young man named Danny has run away from home and meets a bum named Bix, who agrees to stay with Danny and take care of him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie - a shy and na√Øve girl who works at her father's restaurant. Bix starts to see Carrie, but he plans to leave soon (because he's a bum, see?) He's no good! Meanwhile, the town was crawling, Jesse (played by a perfectly trained Jack Elam), keeps popping up in the diner and bothering Carrie. Bix has to steadily get away (there are many ambiguous implications between Danny and Bix in that movie). Danny continues to inadvertently pick up whores left and right (because he is full of money, he has almost a hundred dollars!). Eventually, Bix and Danny decide to leave town, but the problem is a beer, due to Jesse the creep. <br /> <br /> My review of the movie itself: a terrible movie, dated from the Troubled Youth of the 50's. My review of the MST3K version of the movie: I have to say that this is one of the best episodes of MST3K of all time. The riffing is dead all the time. Except for the somewhat pessimistic ending, this movie is easy material for Joel and the Bots, especially the constant failures of Danny that Bix has to rescue him. The host segments are also very good, especially the segment with the 'Train Song'. I hope Rhino will release this episode for a homemade video one day.
