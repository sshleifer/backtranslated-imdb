In addition to Frankie Muniz blabbering too fast to understand (Malcolm in the Middle flashbacks?) This movie still can not evoke a scare. The idea with the "Countess" and the history surrounding her was amusing, but the plot and many subplots did not match. Plot Synopsis: The murderous ghost attracts victims through the video game. Shoot some bloodstains and special effects and you have another bombed would be horror movie. The ghosts look very much like the ghost in "The Ring Two". The acting and constant and dramatic change in the emotions of all is unbelievable. Save your money.
