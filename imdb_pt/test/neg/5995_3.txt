That should have rocked. VH1 moved away from traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) that made the 2003 show so obsolete. Unfortunately, the movement backfired. The show did not have MC keeping the show together. Queen Latifah made a fantastic show at the 2003 Divas. The show began with a horrendous version of Lady Marmalade featuring Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Okay, in the studio, with some control, everything might sound great. <br /> <br /> However, when they are competing with each other (why?) it sounds torturing! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings I've ever witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also featured Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. This was not so bad, but it was hardly impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle teamed up to play Cyndi's success, Time After Time. It was acoustic, and did not fit in with the rest of the show. Still, it might be okay if the two had not insisted on shouting like pets. It was just terrible. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (of Blondie) is always cool. She has a style of her own and although she may not be able to compete vocally with many of the divas, though she certainly can sing very well. Debbie left and introduced Blondie's hit # 1, 'Rapture'. With some lovely vocals. She really hit the grades perfectly. She looked dazzling. Rapper Eve provided a new but sadly inferior rap. Was good. Debbie's next performance was a team with rookie Joss Stone. They sang the hit "One Way Or Another". I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just screamed for Debbie. A little sad was when Debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style that spoiled a bit. She should have let Joss carry on with his totally inadequate warballing. Blondie's whole performed that track. The last track Debbie played was Blondie's huge hit, 'Call Me.' It was very poor. It's not Debbie's fault, because you just could not hear her. The sound was atrocious throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also played some songs on his own. They were very nicely done. Ashanti also appeared to perform two unexplained cover versions. First she made Diana Ross 'I'm Coming Out' and then 'Is not Nobody' by Chaka Khan. She's not a diva! She can sing to some extent, but she has no presence at all. Why not just put the real singers. Chaka was even interviewed on the show .... Gladys Knight appeared and did a medley. Was very good. She was probably the best part of the show. I do not know much about her than she is an experienced artist in Las Vegas and her experience and class really shone. Patti Labelle fit in another performance, this time in his 80's hit 'New Attitude'. It was the end and everything was fine, but it was too late. This was a big failure. Better luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a 55min heavy edition that was shown on VH1 in the UK. If these were the best bits .....
