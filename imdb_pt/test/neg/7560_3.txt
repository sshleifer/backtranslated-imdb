The film has no connection to real life in Bosnia in those days. It should be more realistic and show the viewer real traumas that were happening to ordinary people during the war. Please see some films by Yugoslav authors (Emir Kusturica, Ljubisa Samardzic, ... for example, Bure baruta (A barrel of gunpowder), Tito i ja (Tito and me), Lepa sela lepo gore (Beautiful Villages burn Beautiful) , etc. This is only the real way of knowing about the so-called Bosnian problem, Hollywood is not the right address for making films about the Balkan Peninsula, perhaps Vietnam, World War II, but not the Slavs living in the former Yugoslavia .
