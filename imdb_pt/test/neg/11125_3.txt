First and foremost, I discuss the title of this movie. 'Chupacabra' is not a word in Spanish. The name they are referring to is 'Chupacabras'. I imagine they abandoned the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but I guarantee it's singular in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Then I thought this movie had been made years ago. It came out as one of those B horror movies I watched when I was a teenager at home when my stepfather was out of town. Then it would be kind of scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important "effect" is the costume worn for the Chupacabras. Since you are the main character, you would think that some money would be put into it, but it is not so. The shape, color, and texture were all idiots like a haunted house at Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when Chupacabras walked where no one could walk. His movement was uneven and strange in those times, but moving on the floor looked like any normal man. <br /> <br /> Another thing I discuss is that there is no animal in the world that is out there killing everything. he sees no consideration to actually eating it. The chupacabras killed one, then the other, but they never really seemed to eat the victim. You say, "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so distant that it is stupid. <br /> <br /> What country is Dr. Pena from? He looks like Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think he should be Latino. The problem is that his accent is so bad that even a Russian could say he was not Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers fired round after round on this thing, and did nothing but continue to shoot. I am not military, but soldiers, especially special tactical forces like this, do not have to have some intelligence about them to perform their duties? Would not they find it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? They did not. They just kept shooting while the Chupacabras continued to shoot down and not eat them. <br /> <br /> Did they have to kill the puppy? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this movie because it was bad. Why did I watch the whole thing? I'm sure you did the same now and then, so do not give me a chance. ;)
