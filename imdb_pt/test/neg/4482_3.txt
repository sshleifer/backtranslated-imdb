Today, being President's Day, my wife and I had the "The Notebook" DVD at our local library. It is a movie released in 2004 that fell below our radar, as we are great movie goers. I am a published author with screen hopes playing my first book. I noticed references to "The Notebook" in reviews of other movies, and that's why I talked about watching us and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. We both enjoyed it very much. It made my wife cry; we could relate to many things with our own continuous love affair and even I struggled to choke. <br /> <br /> This afternoon, after many tasks, gardening and food, we decided to take a matinee. When we got to the theater, having seen most of the current films, we chose to see "Victoria Day", which for some reason was not in the theater, although the IMDb movies and my cell phone show that it was playing there. So, instead, we looked at the "Dear John" poster and it was written by the same writer as "The Notebook", making it the obvious choice, since we both like 'TN'. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same credibility or sense of 'TN' empathy; and we kept commenting through all the similarities - two dozen or more - quickly making us realize that this movie was nothing but, as another reviewer commented, "Poor man's notebook!" He had a real 'cow money' feel, which means the Sparks simply played a story together, based on the exact 'TN' model, simply to make quick money. Not only that, after Johnny-John's unlikely improvisation for the cancer patient, we ridiculed the film with each of them, passing a stupid and lathered line to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45 pm monday matinee and my wife even told me to keep it down so I would not ruin everything for the others ... it was so bad. Seeing this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that the similarities of theft were vividly recognizable and blatant Sparks, inexpensive attempt at painfully obvious written model. We just wished we could have seen "Victoria Day" instead ... no matter how bad it might have been after seeing such poor entry in the movies. And oh ... for the last 30 minutes, I kept saying "... do not give that cow the coins ... do not give that cow the coins?"
