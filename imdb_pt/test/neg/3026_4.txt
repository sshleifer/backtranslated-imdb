Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Generated" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that are not successful in what they were trying to do. The film is an ultra slow, dubious, questioning and irritating 76-minute experience that attempts to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> She opens with god presented as a psychopath attached to the chair. man who rips his stomach using a knife. From the guts, blood and human waste, Mother Nature emerges. It begins to impregnate itself with the semen of the dead god. Later, she gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A retard who is constantly abused by a group of cannibal people whom I believe to be the representation of humanity. <br /> <br /> "Generated" gives a distorted and disturbing look at the origin of life. Demonstrating the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a hallmark for humanity. The problem in the film comes from two points. One is that the movie is very slow in its display. What we have are a good thirty minutes spent in showing how the Son of the Earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind. This insipid prolongation becomes boring very fast and does not offer a blow to the observer's senses. <br /> <br /> Another point is the visual appearance and the sound of "Beggoten". Granulated, inverted, black and white, low-frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot, but these novelties usually work in short periods of time. Then gradually it begins to lose its effect when the audience gets used to the visual. Audio suffers from the same problems. It's constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast that I had the urge to turn the volume down. "Generated" loses the charm shortly after it begins. He tries to be original and creative but fails to expand the ideas suggested by the vague plot, instead he repeats the same scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "Begotten" is stuck in a moment. . Even if the plot tries to move forward, the visuals and audio remain the same everywhere. Showing the same action in a slightly different way with just a slightly different sound. A trick can not alone make a movie. It also needs rhythm and variety, something Merhige seems to have forgotten.
