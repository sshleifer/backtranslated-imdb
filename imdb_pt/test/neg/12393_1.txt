I was shocked, there were 18 pages of good reviews. This has to be one of the worst movies, especially considering it was recommended. I must admit that comedies are not my favorite genre, but this movie made him try so hard to be smart that made me squirm to watch him. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is comparable to the week of audition on American Idol. You watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings. But we knew that this movie had no bad actors. So how fun would it be to have good singers trying to convince them that they should not get close to an American Idol test? It would be useless as this movie was. <br /> <br /> The use of improvisation is overestimated. We've all been in that scene where a group of friends comes into action and everyone has tears in their eyes. I feel like it's improvisation. Improv can not be turned on just because the camera is rolling as the movie proves. If you like that Drew Carey hosted an improvisational show, you'll probably like this movie. In general, the jokes were bad, the improvisation was exaggerated, and the over-performance of Guest and company was exaggerated. ..and these are my compliments of this drivel. If a guy playing trumpet And the kettle drum at the same time is funny to you, fine. For me, I prefer more impetuous things like "I Love Lucy" or "Hee-Haw". <br /> <br /> But remember, I think SNL lost its temper in the 80's, so maybe you like it. -Good mood. I kept waiting for a person to identify himself as guardian of the zoo and then told us that there was no zoo in town. This is the mood you can expect. <br /> <br /> My only wish was to give a negative note.
