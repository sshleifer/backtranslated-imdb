This film has neither heart nor soul; is an attempt to create a cult movie from other better directors, notably David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads a kind of rotten visual style and fills the street with garbage and garbage, he is making a statement. But it's not a statement ABOUT ANYTHING - except the shrill scream of the director of "HEY LOOK AT ME! I'm an artist, too." But he does not have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for the things that worked - like some of the actors caught up in it - for other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this film were not a boring and tedious job of sitting down.
