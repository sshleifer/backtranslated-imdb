This sounds like a long-lasting treatment of a comedy routine that could also have been told in a ten minute short. In addition, technical credits are superfluous. The film really looks like a film school diploma project. <br /> <br /> The cast is a mix of experienced stage professionals and talented novices, but the problems are the surface scripts. Its lines seem built, just like the material of a TV show. <br /> <br /> The director does not take his protagonists seriously, so we are not touched by his problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film was marketed cleverly and offers a unique selling point, but in the end the movie disappoints on all levels.
