One only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but alas! How much great acting and directional talent could have turned one of the richest stories of literature into such a monumental BORE, is totally beyond me. It is beautiful to see with a beautiful photograph, particularly the sequences of Yarmouth, but, ONLY COLA DOLA !!! No need to continue! Hop on and check out the Selznick or the wonderful BBC miniseries of the 80s.
