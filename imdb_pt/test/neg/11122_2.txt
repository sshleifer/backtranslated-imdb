Well, Sci-Fi channel keeps stirring those turkeys ... and they seem to get worse all the time. When normally good actors like John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Esposto stand out as rank amateurs, you can imagine how bad the BREATH of the cast in this wasted effort is. The only decent thing is the creature's rubber outfit (which is glimpsed in flashes so fast you really do not have time to see how fake it really is). The dialogue ... the plot ... if this "movie" (and I use the term loosely) was food, Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet meal compared to that. Watch a re-run of "The Munsters" for the 372nd viewing, your time would be better spent (and much more scary too)!
