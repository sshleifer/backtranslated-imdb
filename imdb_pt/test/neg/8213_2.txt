Buyer beware. The Alpha Video version uses an impression that defies description. The film was filmed in color, but you do not know for the first 25 minutes. The print used is so faded and decrepit that it looks almost sepia. After 30 minutes, some color re-enters the impression, but from there to the conclusion the color comes and goes. Keep in mind, even the best is the pale and faded color. It looks like the impression was recorded on a television that was not receiving the best reception. Adding to this farce is the most laborious delivery of the lines I can remember. Even voice-over is an inducement of stupor. Each line is delivered in this annoying and cumbersome behavior. I found myself wishing they would hurry and spread the word. For that reason, I could not wait for this movie to end. It's one of those bad movies - it's good - but I wish someone would find a decent impression.
