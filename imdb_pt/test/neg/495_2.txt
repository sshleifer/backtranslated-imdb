Emotionless. Bad music (and I'm a retired 80's guy, so I'd be vulnerable to some good things.) It's all kind of done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us except to see what horror of the eighties they will pull up. The manager of the tour tries to bring a mankind to the thing, but is not given enough time. Wahlberg is well and Aniston is slumming. We know she did not need the money. Is this the only role she could fit into her summer vacation? Surely she should slap her forehead every time she shows up on VH1 - which is just a little less than Ozzy does. It barely qualifies as a TV movie. It's hard to believe that it was actually released in theaters.
