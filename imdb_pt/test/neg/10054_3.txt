The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most absurd wartime scripts I've ever seen. In addition to the performance, which is made of wood, no tank commander attacks with its tanks parked in neat rows in the middle of the roads, and with the troops stacked together, with the arms not in a position of readiness. The constant suicidal behavior triggered my "tilt switch" so often that I found it impossible to enjoy the movie. Apparently, screenwriters and filmmakers never went through the real war and never bothered to bring in a specialist. This film is the antithesis of the excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan. Unless you are under 7 years old, I recommend watching something else. <br /> <br />
