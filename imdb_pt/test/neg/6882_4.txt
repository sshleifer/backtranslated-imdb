I have to admit, I love horror movies ... especially horror movies from the 80's. Hell, I even love cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Night of the Demons. But I did not think much of that movie. The death scenes were not very well done, the CGI was terrible and the acting was discouraging. Worst of all was the story that made no sense at all. I would say save your money, but chances are, if you want to see this movie ... you will anyway. I did not hate it ... not very good. Overall, it's just another vile, lifeless, lifeless horror movie (not surprisingly it's on Dimension's shelf for over a year after completion).
