A very bad movie, an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: in an initial scene, the Soviet infantry is attacked by the Germans; instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them, they advance in the open to fight them, unlike all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the central characters, is supposed to be the daughter of a white Russian obsessed with her Russian spirit, but she does not speak Russian; a guilty German airman attacks an antiaircraft weapon - the weapon, however, does not fire shrapnel shells, but hits directly on his "World War II" airplane, which does not look like a German plane. To be fair, when they have managed to escape the absurd plot and consequent absurdities, there are some genuinely powerful moments - the depiction of people dying of hunger slowly is convincingly made and moving, but they only appear the rest even more. A movie to be avoided.
