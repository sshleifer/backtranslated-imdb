I saw this movie on Blockbuster and thought it might be a good movie on Sunday night when there is nothing else to do. So I bought used, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot. <br /> <br /> The movie started well. Kind of dark and mysterious. I've always been fascinated with vampire and samurai movies as a child. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first fight scene was pretty cool. I was excited for the rest of the movie. So the movie took a serious nose job. <br /> <br /> I understand this was a big hit in the East. I think because of the twins. I do not see that. This film, beyond the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many films in this genre have the potential to be great and spoil everything. This is just another victim. <br /> <br /> The role of Jacki Chan in this movie does not make any sense. Whyyyyyyyy Complete foolishness. It probably made a few bucks though. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is the swords they use. Good idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
