I knew it would be a bad movie when I rented it, but I was expecting a good bad movie. Oh, well, I had fun making fun of the endless crossing of sand, eating camel dung (well, actually, eggplant) and making funny faces, I think there were about five actors. The DVD needs a comment from the director so I can find out what he was thinking ... or if he really was. I can not believe they actually went to England, Austrialia and where to shoot this ... could have been done anywhere. It would have been better if they'd gotten her naked. The best line in the movie? "He's waiting for your updates." "Yes, he's still waiting." Now that was funny! If someone has more than 3 pages of dialogue (besides the narrator ... CLOSE NOW), then I watch again.
