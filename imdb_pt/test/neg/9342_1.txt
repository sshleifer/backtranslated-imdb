I will not comment too much, what is it for ??? Stereotyped character, absolute ignorance about Colombian reality, mise en horrible scene, bad color choice, NOT funny (supposedly it's a comedy and they expect you to laugh because some distorted music is next to the senseless scenes) if you see Somewhere these people, I mean the interpreters, you will know they are at least good, but seeing this to call the movie, it is impossible to guess), you get tired of the music ... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, is rap singing in the final credits ... pathetic, is not it? etc ... etc ... It has been a long time since I have seen such a bad movie !!
