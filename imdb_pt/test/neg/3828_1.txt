I can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of junk has offended me. Why do American filmmakers always find a way to portray Jamaicans as a bunch of skinny babies, and what's worse, to make people play Jamaicans who sound totally ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent? Not all of us are extremely dark, not everyone is carrying machetes for work or protection, we do not walk naked in our homes and we do not practice VOODOO !! We are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and collectors. I'm sick of watching all these portraits of Jamaicans like a bunch of dreadlocks wearing rastafarians who do nothing but sit around all day smoking marijuana on a beach or shooting guns in the air (when we're not living in our tree houses) . Yes, we wear clothes. Yes, we have electricity. No, weed is not cool on the island AND THE CHANCES ARE SPEAKING BETTER English THAN YOU! The worst part is that it's not just me being angry and bitter, these are the real answers to the questions that most Jamaicans who have traveled abroad have been questioned at some point. Read a book before assuming what it's like in another country, and worse still, decide to make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> WELCOME TO JAMAICA! The land where all we do is kill white people and beat our bongos drums ... Tales from the Crypt officially made me sick, along with all the crew of people who worked on that garbage, especially the writer.
