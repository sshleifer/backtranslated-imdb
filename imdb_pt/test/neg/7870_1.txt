This movie sucks. The acting is worse than in the movies we did when we were 10 years old with a camcorder, the effects look like some eighties computer game and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst Van Damme movies make that shit look. The rhythm of the bandits' accent and speech is so bad it's funny ... <br /> <br /> I would not recommend watching it unless you're a big fan of one of the actors. 1 out of 10.
