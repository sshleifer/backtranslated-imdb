The Big Knife, a movie about the dark side of the Hollywood film industry, is ironically much more like a movie than a movie itself. In addition to some very brief expository scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the film's hero, played by Jack Palance. He is a movie actor who wants to get out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the movies they publish. The wife again (Ida Lupino) is also fed up with the studio, not to mention her husband's flirting. Unfortunately for both, the studio boss (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He has blackmail to force the increasingly tormented actor to sign a new contract. But it's only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This movie is not, I repeat NO, a movie noir. On the contrary, it is an exceptionally theatrical living room melodrama. The plot proceeds in the rhythm of a snail, and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static configuration and carefully planned blocking of the actual scenes. The acting is exaggerated to the extreme, and it turns sharply between histrionics out and out, and softer but no less subtle soliloquies, which are obviously meant to be poignant, but which seem pretentious nonsense, especially in the hands of the lamentably scrawled and miscado. Aldrich was obviously doing a stylized "something" here, but I doubt he knew what it was, and certainly the audience never does. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson here is that movies and plays are very different mediums. What might have worked in one play did not seem even remotely natural or plausible in the film. The result? A great waste of time. There is little to enjoy here.
