So this guy goes to a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment. After finishing the paperwork, the psychiatrist says, "I'll show you ink stains. Tell me what you see in them." "Well," says the patient, "looking at the first," I see a man and a woman having sex. " Seeing the second, he says, "I see two women having sex." Upon seeing the third, he says "I see two men having sex." Upon seeing the next one, he says, "I see two men and two women having sex." The psychiatrist places the ink blots. "So," he says, "we will begin by discussing your monomania." "MY monomania?" says the guy. "And you with all those dirty pictures!" This is how this film strikes me.
