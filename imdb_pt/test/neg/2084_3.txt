I did not see this movie when it originally came out, but it has some songs sharing the title and the term is still used from time to time and I thought there must be something in the movie so I dug it in and gave it a shot. Now I would like the approximate hour and forty-five minutes of my life back (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad about the film, the acting was good, there were no big holes in the plot, of course there was not much plot to make holes. There simply was not much for the film. There was some chemistry between them, but nothing convincing about their relationship; Nothing interesting about their story. Towards the end, when he tries to chase the train to get his romance on the run, neither my wife nor I wanted him to take it. Honestly we figured they were better off each other and if they came back together we really did not care. So what does this say about this love story, when even a 25 year old romantic, like my wife, had no emotional investment in the relationship. I should have left this in the "lost" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
