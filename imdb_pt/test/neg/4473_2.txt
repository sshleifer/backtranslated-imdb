Hollywood will stop at nothing to make money on a movie, even if it has to keep dragging stereotypes and putting them in the most impossible and stupid situations. This effort is a clear example of this and I really believe in my heart that such a film is racially irresponsible. Story is about a divorced lawyer named Peter Sanderson (Steve Martin) who has talked to a lady on his computer and when he finally meets her, she ends up being the opposite of what he was expecting. Charlene Morton (Queen Latifah) is a squat black woman who has no intention of dating Peter, but wants him to look at her case where she was convicted of robbery. He wants her to leave forever, but she keeps appearing at inappropriate times and, to save her job, he reluctantly agrees to analyze the facts surrounding her case. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT *** *** Peter has his children staying with him and Charlene ends up being helpful in raising them, but suddenly a bulletin announces that a convicted fugitive named Charlene Morton has been released from prison. Peter tells her to leave when the FBI comes snooping, but he finds out she's actually innocent when her former boyfriend appears and threatens him. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Adam Shankman, who keeps things moving. at a good pace and is a good-looking film technically speaking, but the script is so unlikely and each character is a stereotype to the point that a 1970 movie called "The Landlord" is clearly more in tune with race relations than this mess . I've always been a big fan of Martin and I think he's one of the most talented people around, but he likes to work constantly and sometimes seems to choose any script delivered to him. On the other hand, I've always had a problem with Latifah and the way she invades Martin's life is so exaggerated that it instantly becomes insinuating. The basic premise that Hollywood loves to use is the black, laid-back person who is white and firm to relax and then convey a street logic that will help them with their lives. That's basically what the story is here, but of course they have to let Martin dress in black and exaggerate like a retarded Eminem because Hollywood knows this is what viewers want. Well, I was quite insulted by everything in this movie and it's not because I have no sense of humor, but unfortunately (for Hollywood, at least) I use logic and common sense when I watch a movie. Yes, I liked the talk of Eugene Levy, but did we really believe he would be instantly attracted to Latifah? I think strangest things happened and how many times does a lead actor get shot just to be saved by something in his pocket? Would not a cell phone break if hit by a bullet? Even if you're the best fan of Martin and Latifah, I would not recommend it. I know I've said it before but this is not an attempt to make a good movie, it's an excuse to try to make money!
