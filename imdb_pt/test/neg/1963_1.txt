Okay, we started at a psychiatrist's office and apparently it's not very good. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in the shrinks office, dropping random rhymes about Jack Frost. Damn, it's okay, my brother is screaming, '' Turn it off! ''. Anyway, let's go back to the low quality movie. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist has his voice and is letting his secretary and his friends listen to this heroic and insane sheriff. I suppose he should be the hero of the first movie, but he does not look anything like him! Yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some kind of personal doctor .. I do not see well how this has to do anything but they nudge the antifreeze / Evil mutant killer snowman with needles, warming him, shocking him, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to him, the whole nine meters. Anything. All right, they give up and leave it in an aquarium. One of the doctors leaves the coffee on top of the tank. The janitor enters, cleans the material, hits the aquarium and coffee spills the tank that makes Jack alive. <br /> Contemplate the power of the mocha! Now somehow he's in..uh .. I believe in the Bahamas ... but it looked more like Hawaii .. But it could not be Hawaii! Unless they spent their entire budget on the bloody airline tickets. Bah .. I will not ruin the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch yourself ... Er ... I would not suggest doing it though .... Sheesh ..
