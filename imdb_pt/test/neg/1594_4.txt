I've seen most of John Waters' movies. With the exception of several of their early ones that are not available, I've actually seen almost all of them so it's obvious that I'm a big fan and it's true that I have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in your movies. . Despite being a little overdone and disgusting, I loved FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental tributes to bad taste and overeating that are very funny movies. So I'm certainly not scrupulous and I can get most of what Waters has to offer. However, in PINK FLAMINGOS he created a film so repellent, so bland and so offensive that I could not bear it. In his other films, he did before becoming more mainstream, they were funny. However, here, humor simply does not exist, as it seems that the intention is to shock viewers and not entertain them anyway. I'm glad that after making this film, Waters' sense of humor has improved, as dog-eaters who consume divine (as in this movie) are shocking but not at all funny. My advice is to skip this movie and pretend it never happened and watch your infinitely better movies of the 70s and 80s.
