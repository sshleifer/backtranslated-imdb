Oh dear. Oh dear. What were they thinking? Terrible script, terrible acting. I do not even feel sorry for the actors ... they took their checks to the bank and smiled cheerfully. <br /> <br /> Since when did an aerial axis of Charing Cross appear on Bank? Why do the vehicles cross the Tower Bridge heading toward the city when the outbreak occurred? Why is not Tower Bridge crowded when the city is being evacuated? How the Carlyle plunges into a raging torrent ... and survives? I could go on ... and continue. <br /> <br /> There is no real sense of urgency in the command room. They may well be waiting for the English to return to the pitch after the tea break in Lords. <br /> <br /> It says something when I'm waiting for ad breaks to learn more about treating diarrhea with great anticipation. Totally abominable garbage!
