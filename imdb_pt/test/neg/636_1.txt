It is far beyond me as this script was sold and produced and distributed much less. The dialogue was so bad that it was revolting. The train and helicopter scenes seem to have been made on memory cards by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this "movie"? was shown at a private screening after which he probably went out the back door. The only emotion that aroused in me was pity the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to pass through this. I could not bear to watch all this, it was so predictable that it was funny. Who knows maybe it will be chosen by one of the networks as a situation comedy.
