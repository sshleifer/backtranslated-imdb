OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane, but you have to love a movie where women are always topless. There are some cat fights and bizarre sex as well. On the other hand, I hope they do not overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here's a great example. After one of the captive girls dies: "This is terrible. It reminds me of the day Zenobia died." "A relative?" "No, my favorite cow." I think they saved some money on the script and did it in great special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that I took three sessions to go through this beautiful work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a while when everything seems the same. I hope the people who are waiting to rent it do not get too impatient. Do not worry, you're on your way.
