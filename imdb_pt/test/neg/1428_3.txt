Strangeland is a terrible horror / technological thriller. Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks, a nasty freak who prays at girls through the chat rooms. Their ridiculous philosophies about pain and suffering are misguided and totally unfounded. There is no draw in reality with the ideas that are presented in this film, it is more like Dee Snider sat down and tried to think of the strangest things possible to impress the horror fans and perhaps some of his former fans, but the end result is Just awful. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and immediately caught the eye, which is the main reason why I was fooled to watch it. I assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. It's a disturbing and boring attempt to suggest what might happen in the minds of people who are dealing with the way Carleton Hendricks did in that movie. The sad part is that nobody does it for themselves. Marilyn freakin 'Manson does not go that far, and having a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film should not make fun of its kind of music (that would be a stab at Snider itself), it's more like Dee Snider was trying get up from his death row and present himself as a sick-minded individual once again. Dee, it seems like the time has come to let it all die ...
