Well, I've seen a lot of criticism about it, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. But this movie is difficult. And I mean it in every way. It is hard to find a copy because it was an independent low-budget version and because the MPAA was looking for every copy on VHS, it went unrated but had to be rated for the MPAA. Then the copies disappeared on the underground scene. Everyone involved in this movie has never done anything else in the business. So it made this movie unique. VHS copies almost never show up on ebay or other sites, and if they do, you'll pay more than $ 100 to get one. But due to US connections, I was able to watch a DVD release sold worldwide. Limited, but it should be some sort of official. From time to time there are still some exhibits of this splatterfest festival. But is it worth all the hype around it? As said earlier, it is difficult to understand, but also to sit. There are bloody killings, there is necrophilia, there is nudity, but there is also a lot of talk between the cops. And to be honest, if you'd like to see the movie in 5 minutes watching the end, it's a flashback in the killer's mind. The blood flows and, in fact, is a splatterfest, but not the full 80 minutes, splashing in abundance for 10 minutes. The quality of the film is good, sounds good, no hissing, colors ok, black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. No problem watching, but you'll never be scared, but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza, I think. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
