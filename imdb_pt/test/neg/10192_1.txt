Christian Propaganda ... Many fears of fear ... <br /> <br /> This is not SciFi, this is ChriFi (Christian fiction). The film started well but gave a sharp Christian turn. From then on, it was all about god, the sacred bible and the devil. UFOs are really just a demonic mistake to deceive people and believe that there is another intelligent life in the universe. The idea of ​​Satan is to deceive him into thinking that there could be more to life than in the Bible. <br /> <br /> The kidnappings could be used to explain the rapture. The people left behind would believe it was a mass kidnapping instead of God taking all Christians to heaven. No reason to regret it if your aliens. The deeper message in the film is that if you do not believe in god and have jc in your life, you do not believe in anything and your life has no purpose.
