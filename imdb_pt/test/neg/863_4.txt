I happened to get this movie on TV late at night. I saw the opening credits and thought that sounds good. Well, I was very wrong. Although not terribly bad (had some funny moments and suits), he had no sense of cohesion. <br /> <br /> She started off well enough with Kathy Bates having a middle-aged crisis when her husband abandoned her and her singing idol is murdered. But Kathy played those disgruntled women so well before - think of Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, it was the clueless script that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers were wondering what to do next. The script also seemed very artificial. <br /> <br /> Some others who posted comments about this movie wondered why he did not get a movie release. The main reason I think it would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it. <br /> <br /> All that I thought, the little woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.
