Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some truly wonderful films were made from his novels ("Far from the Crowd Madding", "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", "The Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had high hopes for this. The Hallmark Hall of Fame-ification of "Return of the Native" totally destroyed. The cast was fantastic, the photography excellent, but the script was bleak and the direction positively ruinous. People walked up to people, they said lines, they left. Strenuous excitement developed when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very handsome) exchanged a little pressure, but even Clive, who is an excellent actor, could not save him. It was awash with the usual "romantic" Hallmark string music and pretends bumpkins that offer batch exposure, and what could have been dynamite turned out to be awful. The wealth of the three films above was totally absent.
