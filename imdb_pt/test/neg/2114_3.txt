Right after watching the first one and is very dumb. I watched an episode of Bones first and then the 11th hour. The eleventh hour should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> It's so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. No mention of what kind of scientist just general science stuff. In a cloning program, they bring in a caretaker, who was paid to undo unsuccessful embryos, to a church and made him kneel before the statue of Jesus on the cross and ask for forgiveness ... and also tell them where the thug is as much as they can move the plot. Now it's science at work :( <br /> <br /> There's a stupid, not a nice ass, where Picard rages on a TV that announces screams of skin that make you look younger, shouting "It's a lie" , as his female assistant Randy gets groped by the warm local bobbie next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon, where the bad old woman, named after Daddy Pinnochios in order to move the clumsy plot along, beckons in Picard from the street when she gets into a cab Picard is one floor above and he looks out the window wistfully going ... she ran away ... He could enjoy trying to get away ... or maybe call police ... Or maybe take the taxi number and call or maybe have something other than ... I'm waving and getting into a taxi now and there's nothing you can do about it until next week ends ... mahhahahahah. At one point, a father in mourning is persuaded by Picard that even a replica of the son clone was born, would never be his son, since his son had a soul. the right people in the hat. The general scientist argues against cloning based on the fact that every soul is unique and sure of what else you would like to clone. While general scientist Picard thinks cloning is a bit sticky, he is ready for stem cell research and goes so far as to say that the calamity will come to mankind if it is not allowed. He has a rather raucous speech about how important he is. Of course he does not mention a single example. That sums up the show. Words of buzz and tawdriness.
