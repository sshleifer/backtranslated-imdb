I've watched a number of Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies lately, and found a lot to like them. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed much lighter than all the others I've seen. Maybe it's because this is a comedy / horror movie, rather than direct horror, and maybe it's also because the humor did not register very well. <br /> <br /> It's just under seventy minutes, and credits start when the last ten minutes are starting. There are some outaskes, goofs, and backstage things going on while these credits roll. <br /> <br /> SRE movies tend to be short, and tend to feel padded nonetheless. This is no exception, with some scenes that tend to last a long time. <br /> <br /> The story involves a poor child in Christmastown, California, who was chosen by all his colleagues. He had stolen a shoe and, unable to replace it, he was dubbed "Oneshoe McGroo." Due to an obsession with the pirates, his parents gave him an eyepatch for Christmas with a Christmas tree stamped on the eye patch. <br /> <br /> Many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather to decide what they do. They are chosen one by one by McGroo, who walks from side to side to the sound of the sledges. <br /> <br /> The characters are basically all broad stereotypes, like the nerd called Dorkus, etc. scene in which a perverted couple has sex; the woman is cuffed and bandaged, the man wears a large slice of watermelon paper on his head. It reminded me of some of the strangest sex scenes of director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> The picture quality is good, and there are many extras. But basically a very silly movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, well, I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Still, there are many other needy holidays.
