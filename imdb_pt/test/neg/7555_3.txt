I've never watched a movie that frustrated me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could have been fantastic. Frustrated because the dance may have been amazing. Frustrated because women could have been beautiful. How could I know ?! As your eyes move to the area of ​​interest on the screen and focus properly on the spot to be admired, the insane editor has changed the photo! I completely agree with the other reviews here about low quality lighting and terrible camera / editor work. This makes me sick just watching ten minutes of it would be a spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> Give me a chance to get a place in front of the live show and I'd be there in one shot! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
