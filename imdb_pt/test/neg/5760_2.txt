this movie really SMOKES, IT REALLY HARDLY DIFFICULT, this movie must be in Bottom 100, but it is so bad that almost nobody saw him vote for it so many times that it should be at the same time as "Hands - the Hands of Destiny". I should have it in position 1 (horrible), but the reason I put it 2 was for Eve, the city girl who, in addition to some nudity scenes, in addition, I thought about voting in 3, but how they killed Eve, I came back at 2. is that movies like this should not be funded by anyone, since they did not even lead to fame or other productions to the main actors, great falsehood, haha, the story of a ghost miner who kills the "Mansalva "and after they put an end to their errors, he reappears, because by the end they have kept him very ugly. FINAL SCORE (VOTE): 2 (for the nudity and performance of the beautiful Eva)
