Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a convicted member. King used to be a fair bit and unbiased and had a variety of guests. The Party used to be centrist too, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it's far left. <br /> <br /> At least 90% of all the guests at the King show in the last two years are liberals who sit there and crush President Bush and all the conservatives who can think ..... night after night . Bill Mahar, one of the most viscous, is - and you can see that - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show. You can count on other sincere leftists to be on the King's show every week, but do not hold your breath waiting for a conservative. They are few and far between. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the innovators of excess media. It all started with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night is all you've seen in the mid-1990s. Whatever the latest gossip about Anna Nicole Smith, or the case of Petersen's murder, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject, you can bet Larry will beat him to death. Unfortunately, all other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in this regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the courage to sometimes give advice, as in marriage. I'm not kidding; I heard you say that. The joke is that he got married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has few scruples, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is clueless. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil, to explain some facts of life to him regularly. Larry will agree, but he understands no more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him. <br /> <br /> King is also becoming famous for the "softball" interview, which means he does not ask tough questions. This is greatly due to the fact that most of your guests are of your political persuasion. People know that being in the King show is enjoying having a one-hour public relations show. <br /> <br /> What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings over the past five years. People see through him and his liberal and tabloid TV mentality and switched from King and CNN to Fox News.
