Adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone is wrong. She needs to be the center of attention and she will act stupidly to do it. With her attitude, she is sent to enchant the school. <br /> <br /> There she meets the typical movie characters of today; the nerd, the clumsy, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. Things happen and in the end Adela "learns her lesson" so to speak. The plot tries to take a deeper meaning to the state in which Adela is, but can not deliver (at least I did not buy it). So what's left is a shallow interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. In addition, the director seems to have a fixation in the womb, Adela flashes her breasts a few times too, at least I can not see that they are relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> So the movie is OK, but if you're like me and do not like to see a teenager pissing people off and doing a behavioral turnaround in a flash, which I found unbelievable, think twice before to watch.
