this is a movie that reminds me of the avatar-rajesh khanna of the 80's. The question of the division between parents and children is interesting, but it was treated in an unoriginal way. The characters were not completely developed and the children seemed not to be very affectionate (in the first 15 minutes of the movie), but totally unconcerned with the theme. parents, this transformation was not credible to say the least. They have explored this a bit more. amitabh and jaya were miscast as this couple of old helpless .. at first amit was not very convincing in this paper because it simply did not look like he should be helpless, I mean why not just go back to work where he is sought instead to be w / kids who didnt want them .. hema was not convincing as 60 year old wants ... she did not look like one day over 50 .. so the entire isssue of the book baghban win the booker prize begged credibility .. all in all, a movie that deals with an important issue but cld was made better, I give 5/10
