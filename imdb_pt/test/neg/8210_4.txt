"Dungeon of Harrow" had many things that could have made a good horror movie. A scary house, a torture chamber, a paranoid army, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, and so on. But unfortunately, to say that this was not done very well. <br /> <br /> A writer and a captain are shipwrecked on an island belonging to an earl in a castle, his slave and a dumb maid. The count becomes increasingly suspicious that the two castaways are pirates (of all things) and are more inclined to bind them and subject them, and to the mute maid who befriends them, to torture and imprison. Sound not bad right? <br /> <br /> Well, not quite. I used to call it one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because it has so much potential, it can not be called "one of the worst". However, seeing all this potential wasted is a great success against this film. In short, it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very gothic scene of suspense when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotten bride, adorned in a tattered. wedding dress. This was both chilling and disturbing the first time I saw the horror unfold in this scene. Dude, I wish this was a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the right stuff to make this a grumpy late-night chiller, but in the end it took all the wrong turns. I suggest someone else redo this.
