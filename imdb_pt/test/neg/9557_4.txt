The film was to be released in 2002 and was highly anticipated due to the promos, but was finally released in 2003 after the producer died. <br /> <br /> The movie is good in parts but overall not great <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are fine, but the other scenes are not well treated <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and although this was planned before it was first released, originality was lost <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria disappoints after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> /> The music is good but many songs Ajay Devgan looks tired and his appearance shows that the film was delayed and his acting seems boring too Rani is good Sonali is too good rest are well
