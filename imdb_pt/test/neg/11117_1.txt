In case you're wondering, Loren C ***** n (Criptozoologia Inafame) is a living idiot and any information he provides is discarded with garbage. The guy is just a journalist. As for the plot, it was a predictable train accident, the actors were mechanical, the lighting was horrible and the accessories / clothes were cheap. Bobcat Goldwait should have starred the clowns in this movie. I was physically sick after seeing ten minutes of it. <br /> <br /> There are insane / retarded monkeys still in charge of the movies I see. <br /> <br /> Dan
