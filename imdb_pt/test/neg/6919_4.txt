Start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a similar one. Add your scientific knowledge of a deforming disease (this is not the thing that Leo G. Carroll contracted from the venom of the spider in "Tarantula"). Add in the fact that the main character, instead of finding some way to lure the young woman, engages in heavy chase until he totally draws attention to himself and has to shock this insane plot: if he can father of the sick girl, then help him to recover, she will marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half the brain would have seen things. There is a third person, a woman whom the doctor, interpreted by J. Carroll Naish, treated with great insensitivity. You know she's going to be a factor. There is also a gorilla kept in a cage that is occasionally used for the sky. Oh well. There is so little sense to it that it repeats itself and people get their fair desserts.
