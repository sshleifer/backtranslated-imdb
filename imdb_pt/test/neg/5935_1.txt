I first read about the Left Behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since I have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our increasingly hateful world, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left Behind: World at War in my local library, nestled innocently among the big budget action movies. <br /> <br /> Now, like a movie, it's extremely poor. The acting is directly from a primary school production and the "special effects" would have looked dated in the early 1990s. Being the third part of a series, the story would be unintelligible to anyone who had not seen or read about the other films of Left Behind, and even with my previous knowledge, it was still quite laughable. <br /> <br /> Religious front, I do not think anyone who was not already filled with the Lord's spirit would find something in the movie to convince them to change their ways. How should you fear the Antichrist when he has a Russian comedy accent, and the worst of his powers are some deplorable CGI? <br /> <br /> However, my main problem with this film is the blatant attempt to fool people into believing it to be a big-budget action movie. As I picked up the box and read the speech, I immediately noticed something strange ... nowhere in the packaging was there any mention of the true nature of this film. For someone you do not know, it seems that, for all intents and purposes, Left Behind: World at War was no different than the last Tom Clancey. Not even in the copy I rented did he say anything about being the third in a series. Whereas the whole premise of the series is that Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that the filmmakers tried to deceive me twice before I could even counterattack! If you are so firm in your beliefs, why not be honest about it? <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that if this was not a "Christian" movie with the accompanying fan base, I seriously doubt that I had ever seen the light of day. If Cloud Ten was expecting me to see the error of my ways and give myself to God, I am afraid to say that I would have died of boredom and / or laughed myself to death before I had the chance.
