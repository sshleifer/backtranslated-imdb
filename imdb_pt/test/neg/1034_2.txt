Some strange stranger who had three families, betrayed and neglected all of them, built useless useless buildings everywhere that are now devalued and crumbling. His half-Jewish, bastard son walks around randomly interviewing senile people who do not interest us and shows his awful skills of narration and writing as tragic piano plays. This continues for almost two hours boring and does not work. <br /> <br /> All you superficial hippie people watching these stupid documentaries, eating salads and yogurt, I think all this crap is so important. It is not. Save the whales. Nobody cares.
