The most generic and superficial level biography you could expect. Busey's portrayal of Holly is accurate - but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing "Maybe Baby"? Usually members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) rather than as people or even characters. When Holly wears a string section, the old Jewish-looking guys coming in say that he's using the same techniques as Mozart. It's just that kind of insolent statement that makes such movie biographies (and "Amadeus", about the aforementioned Mozart) so useless. Some entertainments can be derived from the excellent styles and songs of Holly made in a variation B.
