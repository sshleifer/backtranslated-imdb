I've always loved horror movies. From some of the usual ones known as "The Exorcist" to some of the most underrated ones like "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who are the people who are joking, even call this trash a movie b. It's the Z line from the bottom up. The acting is the worst thing ever in the movies. Really, I've seen better in an episode of "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Look when the woman comes to tell about the legend of Jack-o. She pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds, as if someone is flashing her suggestion cards and she is struggling to read her lines. A riot! <br /> <br /> Oh, and besides the bad acting, absolutely no blood or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a plastic pumpkin lit up. Watch Linnea Quigley on "Night of the Demons," or "Silent Night, Dead Night," much higher films.
