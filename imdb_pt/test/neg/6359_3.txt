Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But does it really matter? We all know the basics for the story, and that's nothing new. But I love low budget classics and science fiction ... so I forgive this one. About the only thing anyone remembers this movie, is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> He did everything right. The part did not demand great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him any chance to provide one anyway ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and the girl too. The movie is fun if you like horror and science fiction camp classics and have experience watching them.
