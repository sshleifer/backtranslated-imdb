I watched this world premiere on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a bit confusing. There is a narration in the introduction about an 800 year old war, and I did not quite understand it. The movie is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I do not think the movie specifies). The couple have an argument and Meredith Monroe flees and is kidnapped by a gang of Vampires motorcyclists. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires who do not kill humans and enter into a battle with motorcyclists. A human group of killers somehow gets involved, and the final sequence of the fight takes place during a solar eclipse. This movie is not related to either Vampires or Vampires: The Dead. Action confusing, but decent. Four out of ten stars.
