We've all seen bad movies, well, that's the cake. I saw that box of Jessica movies looking many times from my many trips to the horror section at the local store, and I was a little interested, it looks like it's a tribute to the Saw Massacre, so I thought I understand. Error! Junior is a difficult, long and committed drug. In other words, it's too bad. Although I win my prize for the most creative use of a bikini top. AVOID!!
