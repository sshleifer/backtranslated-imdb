[Warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I did not feel sympathy for any of the characters, including the main one, who overcomes the death of his girlfriend v.quickly, (but it's okay when he stumbles upon ex-prostitute of the casino in which he works). The main character is portrayed as this wonderful clever writer who is drawn to a web of deception while the monologue is running the book he is writing. I can not say that I would buy the book, a much better premise, perhaps it would have been if the voice-over (which incorporates annoyingly to narrate any part of the movie that you may not have understood through your book) would have had 52 different personailties ... to represent each card in the deck, but I digress. In the end, there was a turnaround, in which the main character was set up by someone close to him, but since I did not like his character so much by that point (I found it impossible to like anyone in this movie, the characters are all one-dimensional). zombies) that I did not really care, and I was glad that the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Most points: The English actress of ER making a dubious South African accent Negative points: An annoying movie
