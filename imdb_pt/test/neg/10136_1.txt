Damn, where should I start ... First of all; this show is just another stupid non-funny American comedy that has a pathetic acting and a really bad mood. The American way of laughing is what makes it even worse. How can I hear laughter, but is not anything funny going on? Pretty stupid, huh? This show is only for American people who have never heard that there are much funnier, better and more interesting comedies - not just in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons, for example). I just can not understand what's so good about "Reba" that has been on TV for a long time. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in many ways and it's just not funny at all. I could have lived with the fact that there are such bad shows as "Reba", but why the hell did they have to run here in Finland. If I see a few seconds of this awful show the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sucks even more than this kind of American "comedy" usually does. This is just awful. Do yourself a favor; I never watch that peace of shit. <br /> <br /> Well I leave the comment for those who now this language better. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
