Okay, that's about 30 minutes without any reports. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitles, no real characters. You see three people in the entire movie (who are alive) and two are there for very little reason. The main guy has no emotion and only mutilates corpses for no apparent reason. This is the whole movie. I love watching very bloody movies, especially since in America the actual blood is not very common in modern movies. So yeah, the bloody effects were pretty cool. But this is not really disturbing. Why does everyone find it so disturbing? There are no characters, there are only 3 people alive and 3 corpses. No one has personality or background story. You see three corpses being dismembered and you can not identify with it unless you identify with your own death and how it might very well happen (though the guy loses his job and goes to jail shortly after). viewer has to care and care if they have to identify with the victim. For example, in a good horror movie, you should be concerned about the main character. This is just a guy and a corpse. It's as deep as a puddle made with only a single drop of rain. They never give you any reason to worry about anyone in the movie. All this is a guy hacking some bodies, so he has sex with a body. Now with the sex scene here is a strange thing about this, he makes sure to wear gloves, but does not use a condom. So he could not care less about picking up some strange STDs from having sex with a corpse, but as long as his hands do not get messy, no problem, now that's really logical. I really do not like the movie, I liked it was very bloody, but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again, there is no reason to care, and this is not a very attractive film. I say if you can find it for less than 10 dollars then you can also get it, but if it is more than that, it just is not worth it.
