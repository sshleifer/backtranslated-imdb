and it's only January, I'm still sure of it! <br /> <br /> By far, this is one of the worst Swedish films I've ever seen and to be honest, Swedish films are not as good overall. It has been claimed to be "original" and may perhaps be seen as the one for people who have never seen a film that speaks English, for us who went to the movies the last 10 years can not help but feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein sat in a weekend to the most successful films of recent years and tried to put it all together into a Swedish package. What can I say that the result may just be ... poor. First of all the story is only weak to begin with, even worse when it's not just a poor story is a desire to combine very poor stories - first a failed attempt to do Swedish Action to the Matrix and then combine it with a bad moral story. And if you thought it could not be worse, you'll notice all the "cool things" that have just been released for absolutely no reason other than in a bad way trying to show that Sweden can also make Hollywood movies - which they do not we can not even try. For example, the main plot is tried to do deeper, allowing the young to play a computer game called Storm having absolutely nothing to do with the story or for example, as there is a side of the internet about "Storm", while suddenly it's just the main characters awareness - really I do not think neither Stein nor Mårlind can see a point with three quarters of the film, more than just trying to show poor extra effects. For the actors, I have to admit that Eric Ericson does a good job, except that he does the same job throughout the film, even if Storm tries to be a film about DD's personal development, he does not change anything in his life. way of acting. Jonas Karlsson, well, to be honest I thought he was a respected actor, but judging by Storm ... really he just has to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. Finally, Eva Röse is just beyond the critic, both her character and her acting. The only reason Storm can not get 1/10 is Eric Ericson, and what can I say, at least try.
