With the little respect it deserves, I would like to state that this film was horrible. The filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and value of production was obviously losing a lot. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and then wasted another two hours of their life, enduring a truly painful experience. I'm surprised to have found this movie in the $ 1 DVD rack where it was properly placed. I thought maybe it was good and that I could discover some incredible independent movie - I was wrong. I wish I had never seen this movie. My 3-year-old cousin could not make a movie worse. I'm happy to see the movie because I can finally tell people I've seen the worst movie ever, and make sure of it.
