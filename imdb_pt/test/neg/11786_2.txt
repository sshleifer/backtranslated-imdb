Only a very small child could ignore the absurdities of this bomb; the first difficulty faced by the submarine "Seaview" is what seems to be rock pieces? falling through the water and colliding with the hull. But it's not rock, they're under the North Pole - it's ICE! All except possibly hitherto mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS. <br /> <br /> So, a disaster happens - that damn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around the Earth catch fire! No one knows how this happened, they tell us, which is understandable, because it is absolutely impossible for the radiation to "catch fire," and even if it could, there is NO SPACE IN THE AIR for it to burn. <br /> <br /> There is literally no good reason to ignore the basic scientific concepts of grade 2 textbooks when making a movie; however, Irwin Allen can do it again and again; perhaps the goal is to focus on "people", which is quite easy, since they are CARDBOARD. The cast struggles hard not to look embarrassed at this ridiculous sub-kiddie joke, much like later episodes of their TV series "Lost in Space," whose concept was taken from the writer Ib Melchior and then rushed to production. <br /> <br /> The sub looks pretty good, which is why it gets a "2".
