Movie without value. A complete waste of time and nothing I expected it to be. The packaging makes it look like it is of the American Pie genre (it is not). instead, it's a ridiculous coincidence chaining that makes the movie look like more of a writing exercise (let's try to see how many mix ups we can write to do what should have been a bad SNL in a long-running presentation). What is remarkable is that the directors (based on their comments on the DVD) take themselves completely seriously. I've been a big fan of the films that National Lampoon lends its name to and including Van Wilder. With this, I feel completely cheated. In fact, I feel DUPED. I was expecting a Van Wilder as a farce to relive my college days, but instead it was served an hour and a half of junk. What led to my unfulfilled expectations? Well, for starters, the cast is all naked (with a huge sausage covering what should be covered) on the DVD cover. Add to that the pictures on the back of the case as well as the description and you fool people into thinking this is a movie that it is not. To make matters worse, the film begins as one might expect too with half-drunk college students trying out a photo bang, but in the end this has nothing to do with the film. In fact, I did not even realize that the people in that opening sequence should be the characters in the movie until I was told by the directors in the commentary. Do not get me wrong, I love twists and be surprised by movies, but I hate the fact that this movie tries to stand out as something it is not. Ultimately, this does a huge disservice (artistically, though probably not financially) because it leaves the audience confused and disappointed simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, do not rent this movie based on what you see in the case. It's not your usual National Lampoon movie. The funny thing about this is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and TV shows that make their involvement here fun.
