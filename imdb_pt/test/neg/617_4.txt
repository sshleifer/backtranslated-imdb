'Felony' is a B movie. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you take a look at the cast's schedule, you may have high hopes for your entertainment potential. This movie is packed with all those wonderful character actors you've grown up with, the ones with the faces you recognize immediately, even though you probably do not know their names. It's incredible that the filmmakers could bring all these people together on a project, almost as if they decided to hold a B movie actor's meeting. The cast still includes some really top-notch actors: David Warner, who most people will recognize from 'Titanic (although my favorite role is Jack the Ripper in Time After Time) and Lance Henriksen, who many will remember as bishop in 'Aliens'. These two actors did a great job on their long careers and made some very good movies. <br /> <br /> However impressive as this collection of actors is, their talent is never fully displayed on the screen. The Felony writers spent a lot of money to set up a dream team cast and then lost their golden opportunity because of one important factor, the common denominator of all B movies: a silly script. <br /> <br /> We start with a silly premise. The bad guys are caught on tape committing a horrible murder and relentlessly pursuing the film crew to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? In the time it takes to track down the film crew, a thousand copies of that tape can be made and distributed to all law enforcement agencies and media outlets. Criminals do not seem to realize how futile their effort is, and they talk as if stealing and destroying the only original video would solve the whole problem. Bobo ... but I suppose if bandits were so logical there would not be any movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is the dialogue. Sometimes it's silly, sometimes clich√©d, and sometimes unbelievable ... everything you expect from a B movie. Of course, I've always believed that strong performances can overcome many weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although some of the cast members are not good actors and have achieved B movie status well deservedly, it is still possible to hope that the strongest part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into its parts. However, it is disappointing to see that some of the actors in this film really seem to take the film seriously enough to give it their best shot. Not much inspiration is evident in these performances, but again, it's a rather uninspiring script. Now, I admit that some of the cast's most colorful actors can add a bit of enthusiasm to delivering their lines, but honestly, even the very good actors I mentioned earlier seem, for the most part, disinterested and uninterested. involved history. Speaking of the story ... even if the acting had been of a caliber high enough to make the dialogue seem a little less extravagant, it would still not redeem 'Felony' from the fact that his writer commits the the latest deception of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still will not find out how everything fits. In an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer throws in all sorts of unexpected surprises and twists in his screenplay and ends with a puzzle, but when you reach the end you discover that there are a lot of pieces which simply do not fit anywhere and others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that leaves me guessing, but creating twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish. There were so many things that was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated in the end. If you decide to watch it, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I did not even mention all kinds of other silly things about this movie, but I will not bother. The funny thing is that, despite everything I said, I have to admit that I can not give 1/10 of 'Felony'. Although I can not exactly explain why, I actually found this film a bit enjoyable. Foolishness can be fun sometimes, if you're in the mood for it. Also, I really like some of these character actors, and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents, I still have a kick to see them. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that I have rated this movie from the viewpoint of a serious viewer. It is entirely possible that I have completely missed the point. It could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a B movie. Perhaps the nonsense is completely intentional. If that is the case, and if I were to categorize it in those terms, I would have to say that "Felony" is a classic in the genre of ironic action movies. B movie buffs will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in a movie, have a few laughs from the screenplay and have fun with a good dose of weapons, explosions and chases.
