If you've ever heard any of James Lee Burke's books on tape or CD and the reader was Will Patton, you can agree with me that Will is the embodiment of Dave R. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones is a native Texan (or so I heard) and no one portrays a better Texan IMHO, but he is not a cajun. Your delivery is wrong. I have lived in the state for several years and can still hear the strange dialect that a Louisiana accent contains. TLJ does not have any of that. I thought Marry Steenbergen was a good choice for Bootsy, but I missed seeing Cletus (who will be cast for this role? Rock? Mickey Rourke? Who, he will have to be great). <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought the movie was only a 4 - the plot flopped like a fish out of water and it did not have the normal interesting but not linear continuity that the book usually has. <br /> <br /> I hope Hollywood will try another JLB book, "Last Car to Elysican Fields" would be a good choice. We could see some of JLB's best villains.
