Bad political action. Badly photographed, represented and directed. All scenes are highlighted, including those that are shot during the day. It does not matter what the location is. At a major White House conference, there are no lights on and the only available lighting is a murky blue that is filtered through some windows. China's eldest son conducts a devastating telephone conversation under such intense chiaroscuro conditions that he should be contemplating a bust of Homer in a Rembrandt painting. Honest. It is as if he had a small spotlight on his face and was in total darkness. Slow-motion deaths are already mandatory in any badly planned movie. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo do their roles well, but Scheider rarely appears onscreen. The other performances are disposable. There's a beautiful Oriental woman in a short, tight skirt who holds a gun and pulls out of a James Bond movie whose accent suggests a past childhood in Basset, Nebraska, and which should have remained the model she probably started. Whoever plays the surviving Secret Service agent aboard the cruise ship was probably chosen for the part because he looked more like Johnny Depp, not because of any show of talent. Chinese villains, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, whistle and smile as they threaten the heroes. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty horrible, recycled from other better movies. There is a lot of footage on board the ship and pretty much everyone ends up with minced meat. Two-thirds of the way, the ship explodes in the expected series of fireballs. So the movie splits into two related parts. First part, another shooting, this time in a warehouse by the sea. The second part, an exchange between the vice president, now acting president, and the oily Chinese debut, taken from "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe." We inadvertently launched our missiles. They throw theirs in retaliation. We can not convince them that our launch was accidental, even though we offered help to destroy our own missiles. There is even General George C. Scott / Walter Matthau who argues that his "nucular" arsenal can not match ours, so we must hit them with everything we have. More balls of fire. <br /> <br /> The end does not come too soon.
