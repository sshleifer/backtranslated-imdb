I'm not much of a fan of Abbott and Costello (though I do like "Who's On First") and to be honest, there was not much in this movie that inspired me to watch his work. It was not too bad. He had some mildly entertaining scenes and actually a very convincing giant played by Buddy Baer, ​​but somehow, given the duo's fame and the esteem in which they are generally held, I have to say that I was expecting more. As the story goes, the couple stumble on a babysitting job, and while reading Jack & The Beanstalk as a lullaby (with the child reading to Costello), Costello's Jack falls asleep and dreams of the story. There is a type of "Wizard of Oz" in the story, in which the characters in the dream are all equivalent to Jack's real life acquaintances, and the film opens in black and white and changes color during the dream sequence. The fight scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the fun parts of the film. Polly, of course, also leads to one of the questions in the movie - what happened to her? Jack and gang seem to have left her behind in the giant's castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares? Still, I wondered. There were also some cute music and dance routines. My 4 year old laughed a bit during this so she was able to enjoy some of the humor. I thought it was a good timewaster time, but certainly not anything that would convince him of Abbott and Costello as comic geniuses. 4/10
