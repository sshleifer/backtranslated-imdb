The quality you will probably remember after seeing The Big Knife is how claustrophobic it is. The rhythm is sacrificed for a seamless texture of dialogue. He is talky in the extreme. Modern viewers will feel that all points have been made (and then some), but the film still will not go forward, or it will do the spectator a favor and change the scenery. It is very inert. At the 45-minute mark, I was sure I had seen two very slow hours. My response was, "My God, where is it going?" It seems Odets was paid for by the word ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to note the decline of the drama from its high point in the 1940s through the loaded projects of vanity from the 50s and 60s to The True cinematographic merit was rediscovered in the 1970s, only to disappear again. Here we have conventional and conventional emotional explosions of Steiger, Lupino et al. and camera movements preconfigured to meet the overly-practiced blocking. This is due to increased method; the unfortunate tendency to sacrifice all the other merits of the cinema, to give the actors their most selfish desires. "Great acting," ho-hum, killed the thought in movies. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance's forehead and tuft retract and push forward every time he reacts to something. It's disturbing. <br /> <br /> This is very annoying.
