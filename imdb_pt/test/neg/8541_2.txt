A group of adventurers travel to the "black continent" to try to locate a lost heiress named Diana, who disappeared years earlier in a plane crash, and who is now believed to be living with a wild tribe who considers her to be his goddess. Once again, my search for films of European cannibals took me to the territory of Jess Franco - a seemingly endless cinematic desert, full of sub-par scripts, crawling with the camera's heavy work, and abundant with a horrible performance (Lina Romay, the regular of Franco, receiving the award this time for her regrettable performance as an elderly and sick woman). It is here, in this hellish place, that I finally came across the Kilimanjaro Diamonds, an abysmal jungle-based explorer so stupidly evil that it took me three successive nights to finish watching. <br /> <br /> Tawdry and relentlessly dull, even by Franco's standards, this tiresome junk fails on almost every level: the story is a terrible derivation of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan, though with a feminine touch; the film appears to have been filmed at the local botanical gardens, although grainy footage is poorly integrated into the film in a futile effort to convince viewers that the action is actually taking place in Africa; and the death scenes are virtually bloodless (Franco can usually be summoned by a few spatters, but despite the initial appearances, this is not a cannibal movie and is not as bloody). <br /> <br /> Where the success director, however, is in his cast of sexy young Katja Bienert as Diana Diana. Running and leaping through the undergrowth into nothing but a tattered tunic, her curvaceous body belittling the fact that she was only sixteen at the time, that nubile beauty makes a good impression. Franco also launches even greater nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as the treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions), and Aline Mess as the topless warrior woman Noba, thus avoiding narrowing another rating by 1/10 (although I'm sure he'll be getting a lot more in the future? I have a lot of his movies yet to see).
