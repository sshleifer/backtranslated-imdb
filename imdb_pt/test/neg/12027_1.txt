I bought this movie without being seen at a science fiction convention and I got what I deserved for doing something so silly. Simply put this movie is implausible, boring and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted by the lack of plot development that I hung up to watch a replay of Mythbusters. I understand that this was a very low budget move, or at least it seemed a very low budget move, but that does not excuse the horrible acting, terrible plot and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of college students did between classes and getting drunk. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the villain was not so laughable and the plot was something that could really happen in real life in relation to the law. application can become so bad that it's funny. This movie is not funny, it's bad.
