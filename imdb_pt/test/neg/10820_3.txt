The mission to see the movie "The Cave" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. It's a shame that the movie has not changed much more than the trailer did. <br /> <br /> The immediate fascination of a movie like this is the creature. How will it look? Why does he live in a cave? How is this supposed to be different from the other creatures that have been shown in films like Alien and Predator and the Relic? The "demons" cave does not look far from the skeletal creature in Alien: Resurrection and even has Predator's vision. It's a total shame ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's take a look at the plot: very confused and jump to increasingly improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its inhabitants. in the Carpathian mountains. The cast was very clear that we want youngsters, hips, tough girls, chiseled faces, and girls who have brains also have to be hot. We also have to have one of all racial origins if the public thinks that the filmmakers are biased towards a certain point of view. Completely done, and I'm totally tired of it. <br /> <br /> The other big problem was the ending, as if to say there may be a sequel. Please, shoot me if there is one. The tag at the end made me unhappy. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he got were more or less points of appreciation for creature creators for their high-quality work spent on costumes and design for the monsters they inhabit even when they looked totally stolen. And there's an interesting (still worked) documentary on the DVD about underwater cave diving. Go take a look only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you have probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.
