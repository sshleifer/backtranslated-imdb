Fortunately, I watched this movie alone, allowing me to advance in the worst scenes (most of the movie, actually). OK, some of them are not all bad, with partially good shots (even some of the underwater scenes) and sometimes not too bad. But it still does not save the script incredibly poor and acting worse. Also, when I do not find the movie "hot" as all this, even the love scenes that make the sexy wannabe go monotonous. Really bland! And for the drama: You know it's always a bad sign when you do not like all the characters so much that you really do not care who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you still can not get tired of the Survivor reality series, you can find something to your liking in this movie. If not, be clear!
