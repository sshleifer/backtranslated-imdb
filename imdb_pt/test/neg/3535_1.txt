Why would a filmmaker with a track record like Wes Craven like to lend his name to a tedious collection of clichés as this is anyone's guess. And if he paid any money for it - all 50 £ judging by the looks - he should have knocked on the director's door for a refund the minute the movie was released. There are many "Alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. Even the trusty Lance Henriksen, burdened with a character stupid enough to allow his children to pass a dangerous government laboratory, can not save him. As a cure for insomnia, this indicates a 10+. Like a quality piece of film - forget it.
