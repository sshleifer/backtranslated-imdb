... said the announcer of continuity as TATICO ASSAULT was about to be broadcast. After seeing the first two minutes, I began to think that Rutger might want a new agent. After seeing the next ten minutes, I began to think that Rutger might want to retire, thus saving a potential audience from more of his performances. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a really terrible movie. I was not expecting much and why should the name Rutget Hauer appear in the credits, but within a few seconds of the opening credits showing the NATO planes with the USSR insignia bombing Bosnia I realized I was going to be forced to eat three months after Christmas. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail is nonexistent. NATO aircraft carrying USSR markings were then informed of Hauer's character spent six years in an Iraqi prison that would make the scenario of 1997. What NATO was bombing the Serbs in 1997! I think the producers did not think the public would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know they did. The producers also hoped the public would not notice the lack of continuity, like dogfights with Iraqi jets that suddenly switched from Migs to F-4 Phantoms and back, but I did. Even stranger characters would take off on F-16, so when they get back to base, the jet turned into a Soviet built Mig <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're expecting an idiot action movie, you it's only half because it's dumb, but most of the plotting revolves around a revenge plot of BASIC INSTINCT. I would give the producers some credit (maybe credit is a very strong word) because after seeing plots with hell babysitters, hell cops, hell apartment mates we now have a hell hunt pilot that means every occupation of the 20th century has featured in a hell-like plot with maybe TATICAL ASSUALT being the worst movie in the batch
