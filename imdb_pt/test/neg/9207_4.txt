The first half of the movie is not so bad. Although there is not much depth in the characters, the story is somehow funny and is generally OK with potential to improve, which does not happen. <br /> <br /> In the second half, things start to get worse. , not only for the characters in the film, but also for the viewer, who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end. <br /> <br /> The previous reviewer mentioned: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of mistakes, an 80's movie and, above all, it's a Jonathan Demme. "<br /> <br /> Well, please allow me to rephrase this:" It's a girl's story of girls, by the way they're driving in cars, the excitement is gone, since it's all very clear how things are going to evolve, there's been no scene in this movie where anyone can laugh out loud, there's some light '80s feeling and yes, Jonathan Demme really was the director.
