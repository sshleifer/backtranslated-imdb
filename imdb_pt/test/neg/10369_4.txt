A serious step back to the puppets in this tedious and boring ride. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three, barely presents this time and the fantastic song of Richard Band appears with the puppets within minutes of the film. For the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) caretaker and some of his younger friends (many of the cast are Canadians and are all very good at roles that are unfortunately not very demanding - Teresa Hill is very hot). Totems, minions of the Egyptian god Sutek want the secret of the animated life back and the puppets (when they arise) act with unprecedented intelligence to try to destroy the ugly computer game and very much like Totens. The Totems merely complicate the series and distract the things that once made the series so unique - they do not share the strange beauty of the dolls and therefore do not fit well. The highest scene is Pinhead using a cloth to wipe the blood from classic, drill and classic Tunnelers of this movie goes. The fifth film was filmed concomitantly with this, so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era (or even galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and fans of the series certainly deserve it. Grrrrrrr.
