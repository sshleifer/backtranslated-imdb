If you feel that Reshammiya is too painful to watch on TV, try to watch it in the movie for 2 hours in a row. His face is dull throughout the movie, and it's very funny to see him perform in the demanding and intense scenes. This is far from being a true love story (Get the correct spelling, Reshammiya - not love or re-reign), and is complete with him doing a Mithun dance, self-rickety fight scenes, Himesh being imprisoned, Himesh accused of murder, he escapes from prison, etc ... If you want a good laugh, there is nothing like this, especially the scenes in which he howls at Mehbooba. If you despise the nasal vibrations, and want to know out of curiosity that two hours of Reshammiya can do with you, then do not miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not stop laughing from beginning to end myself. The only saving grace that this movie has is the cinematography, the places and some songs. Even so, until you are a diehard Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
