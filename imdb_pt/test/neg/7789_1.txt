This was only the second version of the classic Charles Dickens story I had seen, and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst. The film begins with a quick live action where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and then, of course, it goes to the story itself lively. You probably already know this, Ebenezer Scrooge is the cranky businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage), who tells him about the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future / Yet To Come. After all this, he obviously realizes the true magic of Christmas and promises to be more enjoyable in the future. The only changes I noticed in the story were Scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's ex-lover Belle (Kate Winslet) needing to see him to help out at the orphanage, the Ghost of Christmas Present showing the two children "want" and "ignorance," Scrooge is still haunted after being well, and he is worried that he will not keep his promise to stay cool. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew, Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not of great quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a useless piece of garbage. The only good thing that comes from this movie is the good voice of Kate Winslet, singing the closing song "What If", as for the rest, is horribly awful. Very poor!
