Relentless as one of those high action movies. The whole cast seems to be at high speed. I do not quite understand the director's intentions, if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is a hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes of unfavorable photography - unfavorable to the actors, but loving to the locals) The only thing that makes everything bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with your friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) thinks of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the movie Altman and you will understand what I was hoping for. I was particularly embarrassed by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to like this, so it's probably just me.
