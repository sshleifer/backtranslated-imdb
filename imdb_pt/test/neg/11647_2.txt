What was I thinking when I rented this one? What did the distributor find when he copied the tape and sent it to Holland? That someone really wanted to see this shit ?! <br /> <br /> It's about some astronauts getting into trouble in outer space (Apollo 13, but never in the shadow of this movie) and they want to go back home. If you act on a movie like this, you should be glad you will get away from Earth as much as possible! <br /> <br /> This one wants to surf in the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this fails everywhere. The Deep Impact and Armageddon were also not perfect (far from it), but at least they were worth watching once (and maybe again, when we're all old). They gave a bit of fun. Max Q does not. It gives you irritation. All right, all right. It's a TV movie, but does that mean you can create a mess? <br /> <br /> If you have not choked on your own vomit at the end (for all the cheap and useless drama) dialogue you must have bored yourself to death with such a waste of time. <br /> <br /> It gets worse at the end when the space shuttle lands ... No, I can not 'spoil' this one (the IMDb guidelines prohibit this). So you have to see for yourself. NOT! DO NOT SEE (sorry), but rent a movie that is worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
