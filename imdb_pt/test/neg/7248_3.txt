Yes, Edward G. gives us a retro look at the world of criminal defense. First he is an overzealous promoter who sends the wrong man to the chair (touched passionately, though briefly by DeForrest Kelly), so he is so full of remorse that his only consolation is the bottle. Play in a weary romance, a genuinely quick descent into penury and no doubt about who he stands for, and the next thing you know - Shazam! Black leg lawyer (God I love that phrase). He sees the light just in time to save his weary loved one from his chair. Yawn. <br /> <br /> But, in fact, the court action is pure melodrama. Watch him punch a witness, watch him drink poison, watch him argue with passion as he grabs a bullet hole in his chest. Be prepared for the melodrama. <br /> <br /> The joke of the movie, however, is Jayne Russell. With curves defying the laws of gravity and an approximate IQ of absolute zero, it's something to see. Even sings a little.
