Almost immediately, Mr. Coburn hosts beautiful nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (as Georgia Hightower). While sleeping with O'Neill, Coburn is awakened by an emergency involving a poorly done abortion - the 15-year-old bleeding to death is the daughter of hospital donor Dan O'Herlihy (as JD Randall). .

While trying to clean his friend, Coburn walks through a heavier plot? <br /> <br /> **** The Carey Treatment (3/29/72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
