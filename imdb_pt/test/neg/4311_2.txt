What a clunker! <br /> <br /> It must have been made for TV or cable. <br /> <br /> Look: forget the script - forget the bunch of forgettable actors. Excuse me? Continuity? The NSA / NIA / Whatever it is or whoever it is (an agent) takes off on an F16 - it is shown on an F18 that throws up and later, the aircraft shown taxiing is an F4 Phantom! Oooh, I wish I could be such a gentleman. <br /> <br /> Beyond the male actors (!?) Women are WASPS: blue-eyed and long legs and eventually start crying over the heroes who save them. Even when a solid weld can save most cosmo-astro-nauts, the blonde loosens the welding tool. Duh! Like an SF movie, one in ten. Like a movie itself: 1/2 (that's half a point). They should have left the space station and headed for Mars. <br /> <br /> Main raspberries.
