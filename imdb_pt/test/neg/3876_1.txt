I'm not sure if this movie could match the first, even if it starred the original seven (despite the fact that four of them were killed). Just do not have the spark and the chemistry. All the actors seem tired and they seem to be just going through the motions to receive their payments. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Yul Brynner is "magnificent" in the original film, but stiff and unconvincing in this sequence. However, when he starred Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s, his character (in the same black pants, T-shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and presence of Chris Adams's 1960 film. there is nothing in it. 1966 film to make it worth watching even on the cable.
