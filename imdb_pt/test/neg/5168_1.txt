Of all the bad reviews about this movie and adding them I feel the same way. It may seem that Australians are weak rather than brave soldiers. In this movie was very terrible and very graphic. I have not seen enough heroism just more cowardice that is ashame because it is not anything I read. We do not need the edge of violence as we can use our vivid imagination of what they have gone through. It's like saving private Ryan, where the Nazi is slowly pushing his knife at the soldier. For example, Mel Gibson is an extreme director for his films, not because of violence but because of the level of historical inaccuracy. Letters from Iwo Jima was one of the war movies that was close enough to the story (though I might be wrong) except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. You'd better read this is an insult to the victims and the victims if you do not tell right, and the film drags on for long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the Australians to kill Japanese soldiers. Just read the history on the internet, magazines and books. Movies always kill the sense of accomplishment. What they did to prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was terrible for civilians. It just makes me proud to see goodies beat the bad guys, but movies like that ruin everything.
