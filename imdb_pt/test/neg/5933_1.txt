Lou Gossett, Jr. is an excellent and engaging actor, but for him to take on the role of a "president" and make him act like James Bond, running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to find a plan for kill Christians. and then be able to escape the Supposedly High Security Facility to live another day, does not do it justice - this movie has so many unresolved problems <br /> <br /> I will try to list only a few: 1 - what was the purpose of "stocking" a vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "tribulation force" had Vaccine already in hand - later, Buck Williams' wife will keep the preacher sick and herself become ill; So, was the virus contagious? "If it was contagious, then why did Ray and his wife walk into the church without proper protection?" "Why did not they become sick, too?" - and when Chloe drank the wine and was "cured", how suddenly did she know that wine was the "antidote"? - Was it Californian wine, common red wine? "Red Grape Juice might be appropriate-and if the preacher had received" fellowship "at least every time he preached, perhaps he had already had the antidote flowing through his body? "Buck and Chloe have been given a" heavy "vaccine box that has never been used-what mysterious message should we see in this? <br /> <br /> 2 - the presentation of "evil" forces that are working with the Antichrist Nicolai to destroy the world, such as Russian, Chinese, etc., is really a Relic of the 50s and the beginning of the years 50. It was James Bond, and shows an ignorance of modern society and humanity - should we believe that the Russians and the Chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, mere destruction? - this was a Narrow Mind vision of this world and it was so Cliche it was Worthy of Surrender. <br /> <br /> 3 - The main objective of this film was the scene near the end, where Kirk Cameron and Lou Gossett, Jr. are proselytizing with the non-believers in the audience (showing Kirk proselytizing with Lou) - it was a meaningless plot, lots of disconnections with reality and a plot completely inadequate for a great actor <br /> <br /> I therefore classify this as 1 because Zero is not available
