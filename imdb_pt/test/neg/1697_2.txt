Forced, cloying, stereotyped. Do these adjectives make you want to rush to rent his? Miriam Hopkins was brilliant at the original "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde". Some of her other old films, notably "The Story of the Drake Temple", are never shown, but are said to be excellent. <br /> <br /> Here, she's cute, authoritarian, and completely unpleasant. Ray Milland as a bohemian from Greeniwch Village, unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The two children's artists are scary and also have no relation to the Village as it was then. <br /> <br /> Speaking as Born in Greenwich Village, I find the ersatz setting, generic and false. Not that I'd been around for generations, but my relatives were there in 1937. It's not funny. It is not remotely authentic. We do not care about the characters. <br /> <br /> So many films were made about the masses that fight against the capitalists right now, and made with elan. "Easy Living" comes to mind. It did not happen in the village. But this sounds very true. It rings with a thud.
