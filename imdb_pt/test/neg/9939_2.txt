Frightening masks and horror movies have been put together like cheese and chives throughout the long lifespan of the cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter who started the trend, but as is the case with many of the clich√©s of the genre - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the creators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a couple of pre-Halloween American slashers that deserve a mention. Classroom massacre, keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly pre-dated 1978, while The Town That Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the earliest films of teenage slayers. Carpenter's seminal film may not have been the first masqueraded nightmare, but it certainly kicked off the competitive battle between directors to unveil the most frightening disguise for their spirits. Over the years, we've seen a few memorable candidates, but my favorites would have to be: Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier, and the copper-faced killer of Wicked Games. I also like many of the murderous clowns that have appeared in all of the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row has to be listed as one of the best and The Clown of Midnight is also among the biggest crazy costumes. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a horror movie, probably because they are largely tied to sexual perversion, which, of course, is not exactly a scary disguise. But in later years, Blackout and this obscurity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a gimp suit. See how the end of the two left? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up with the wave of blue sirens as police officers rush to the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed man may have had enough to be cast as an extra in rudimentary turkeys, so he decided to keep his wife and son under fire from a gun. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight the shooter but unfortunately he loses the fight to get a loose pistol and looks like it's the end of the road for the gray-haired police officer. Fortunately, he is saved in the nick of time by a precision shot of Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the hottest police officer in the California Police Department. <br /> <br /> Her heroic encounter causes the brunette to be promoted to first class detective, and is a feat that is strongly envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile, a leather maniac is traveling through the city killing prostitutes and throwing their bloody corpses at the corners of the streets. Ryder and Shine are placed in the case of the gimp killer and their first questioning call is a street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is a first-class inspector who does not seem to apply to her, so in a short time she is dating the videographer, despite being a suspect number one. When bodies continue to pile up around the city, does she decide to disguise herself in an attempt to drive out the crazy S & M? <br /> <br /> If anything, Zipperface effortlessly summarizes everything that went wrong with the slasher genre at the end of its reign. What began as a major springboard for filmmakers and emerging actors has been reduced to a sewer of film feces by films with flat direction, zero suspense or shocks and mediocre actors without talent. The boom years of the early '80s, splatter flicks, have managed to hide the lack of strong dramatic line-ups with sticky special effects and thrilling direction flourishes. Unfortunately, at this point in the cycle, titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes seemed to have been produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the characters in the feature film ended. In a premature tomb Donnie Adams is not even vaguely convinced as a law enforcement officer and his inexplicably stupid behavior - which includes stripping a suspect in a national murder investigation - is more pathetic mind numbing than you might expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could not direct traffic, and the vast majority of cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing here of merit or note. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you can keep the TV on until the end, then you might be quite surprised at the identity of the killer. To be honest, I doubt if you mind until then. And another good point? Well, erm .... the disk is perfectly symmetrical, which means you could use it as a mate to put your cup of tea on top? In addition, there is no other reason to go out and buy the Zipperface. Bad, bad and not in a good way, that's 90 minutes of my life that I could have spent in a more constructive way, ripping my hair out of my chest. Abysmal
