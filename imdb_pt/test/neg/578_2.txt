Single divorced mother in the picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows her to stimulate her sleeping love life. Pet project for actress and co-producer Kate Capshaw, who gives a warm and well modulated performance, but this story is so small and the direction and editing so erratic that a dissatisfaction infiltrates. Initially, Helen de Capshaw imagines several of her friends reading her love letter (an interesting visual joke), but the first person with whom they do this trick is Ellen DeGeneres, who does not play a lesbian, but stands out because of that trick. Different ideas are flayed in the hope that the person will stand firm, and continuity is extremely unstable. The supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who usually acts with the shirt) is very good, but they can not save the last act, which is disappointing. Discreet, in a peculiar and pleasant way, but humorous, nothing more. ** 1/2 of ****
