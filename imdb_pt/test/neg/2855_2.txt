This movie is just plain stupid. Do not bother watching it; Believe me, you're better. <br /> <br /> Long and short storyline: A defense lawyer represents a man who murdered his son and other children. In defending it, she is faced with a wooden doll of Pinnochio. She takes the doll home. Pinnochio is possessed and begins to kill people. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly just to have such a weak end. The plot is very bad and the musical score of Dennis Michael Tenney is unfortunate. The story, written by Kevin S. Tenney, is just useless and does not conjure terror or fear. This is a far cry from his work on Night of the Devils and Witchboard, which are decent rides but nothing to write home about. His direction is good, but with such a bad story, no one could have made this movie good. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: 2 out of 10, maybe the most boring and tedious movie I've seen all year.
