This silent experimental film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is mainly remembered as the first Paul Robeson film. It's very artistic, with often meaningless shots for history, which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of sufficient inter-titles. From what I understand, Robeson's wife, Adah, is in an interracial love affair with a white man named Thorne. It does not bother the owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a waitress), but an old lady expresses the city's point of view in an inter-title: "If I were my way, we would not allow blacks here. "Thorne is also called a" nigger lover "by someone at the bar. Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson), but eventually leaves him. Thorne's wife, Astrid, emerges from the bottom of the well, brandishes a knife, cuts off Thorne's arm and cheek, and somehow dies. Thorne must have been charged with murder because we learned he was acquitted. As for Pete, he receives a letter from the mayor telling him that it is better for everyone to leave town. So the movie is more about racism than anything, but on a note, the owner tells Pete "The sad thing is they think they're right. That's just the way we are." The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to Adah being light-skinned (a frontier black) or the borderline behavior of the main characters.
