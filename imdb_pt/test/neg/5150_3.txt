This movie started to be worthy of joke - but it was made for, with a domineering mother, a witch from a rival, and a queen of hesitant beauty constantly coming in second place. There have been some pathetic exaggerations, and some implausible plot points (It comes in second place in EVERY single contest? EVERYONE?) Unfortunately, the movie suffers horribly from its need to, well, be a TV movie. Instead of ending at the end of the film, a fun twist on the killer being (semi-plausible) revealed, the film continues for another twenty minutes just to make sure justice is done. Of course, now that the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality change - her character is completely rewritten because writers no longer need to keep their identity a secret. The cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a passively fun movie.
