This would probably be a good movie to watch ... since you've already seen all the other existing movies, and thoroughly explored the navels of yourself and those around you. God, this movie was incredibly tasteless, with some of the worst (or nonexistent) writings ever captured in movies. There is no saving grace for this movie; even animatronics are kind of lame, and it's just a complete waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Run. Fast. It is beyond horrible. <br /> <br />
