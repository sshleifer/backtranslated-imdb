I was looking forward to watching this movie, and it contains very interesting insights from Iraqis across the country, not just in key areas. <br /> <br /> However, as the film continued, and as it seemed increasingly unilateral, I began to wonder who had edited the film. To reach several hundred hours for only 80 minutes, obviously the decisions had to be made. <br /> <br /> I really liked a movie that showed how all Iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with newspaper headlines in contrast to what people were saying, and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end, I thought it was obvious that the issue was made with a preconceived bias. <br /> <br /> It could have been a great movie.
