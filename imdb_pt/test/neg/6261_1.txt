A film like that makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do. I think moviegoers are a bit too much for professional actors, and they're ready to criticize them for the tiniest reasons. Just watch a few minutes of "Cheerlader Massacre" and, believe me, you will change your views. A razzie would be almost a compliment to these untalented actors. But again, it's a Jim Wynorski movie. Wynorski is a popular director of these low budget B movies (having worked with Roger Corman on many occasions). The problem with this movie is that it really tries to develop a plot. And when you have actors delivering sentences as if they were reading one-eyed cards, how should I care? In Wynorski's "Bare Wench 2," he did not attempt to develop a plot. He simply tried to make a softcore porn / goofy takeoff on the "Blair Witch Project". It was fun and it was exciting. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are some obligatory female nudity scenes, but they are few and far between. So neither is it worth to enjoy an erotic level. I must say that the worst scene is the one where Nikki Fritz crosses a bridge that is about to collapse. First of all, your character did not have to cross the bridge. Second, when the bridge begins to creak, instead of trying its best to cross, it stands there and acts helpless. And besides, we do not see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers did it with a budget of 2 dollars !!! Unlike many horror movies, this one is really annoying. And that's what makes the worst of all bad movies. One of the few positives was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (though it's certainly no more than a decent medium). He was funny on "Bare Wench 2" and had some funny scenes in this movie as well.
