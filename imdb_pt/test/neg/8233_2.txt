This movie has been a classic in my part of the country because it was filmed in my own small town. I now have many friends who are Dixon Correctional guards, and I even worked for 3 years at the SuperAmerica store next to the Krogers store where the old lady was. However, this is still the most stupid movie ever made, intended to be presented by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it was not already. A bit of trivia, Illinois does not even have parole hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium security facility that houses burglars and vandals from vending machines. The classic cackle / seduce scene is perhaps the most fun part of writing I've ever seen, especially with the development of suspense
