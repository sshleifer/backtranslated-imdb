This movie was one of the few that really caused me pain. It can be enjoyed by anyone who thinks it would be funny to see their mother in a crowded nightclub full of people half their age "inventing" a totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be "hippy" (in jargon). of that age). Seeing Ingrid Bergman lowering herself to such a regrettable performance on the dance floor was hard to watch. I was embarrassed. To make matters worse, the music at the disco was unrealistic - it's the fake idea of ​​some Hollywood director about how pop music was at the time. This is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era - the surrogate music is canned and has only a painful resemblance to the music that was really popular in the 1960s. Mathau is irretrievably misused as some type of womanizer; he just seems ludicrously grotesque. Hawn's wide-eyed innocence is simply too silly. The handsome neighbor in his apartment is portrayed very seriously and seriously. He looks like a Brady boy who got lost in this farce. A painful and unfortunate mess.
