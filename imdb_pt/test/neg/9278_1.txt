This has to be the most terrible abuse of the word comedy ever witnessed. It's simply not funny and the writers obviously just tried to use the name of the TV series in order to make a few pounds at the box office. This film makes a continuation seems subtle to the extent that sexual innuendos happen (no feat), and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. A complete wash I'm scared !!
