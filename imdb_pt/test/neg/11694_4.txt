From the acclaim I received, I was expecting more of a Korean horror, if it will be seen in the same caliber as A Tale of Two Sisters, as some other reviews have stated. This film is not of the same caliber, except in the budget spent on special effects. Think horror Amytiville. With a tree and a scarce dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you are going to have a movie with limited dialogues, the plot and the characters have to load the movie. This movie could have been counted very well in a 30-minute, 2-hour short concept with a lot of look at the trees and scary scenes that make you not only not scare but misrepresent in a "what kind ... "It does not make a good horror movie. <br /> <br /> Those people who are claiming that this film gave them lasting impressions should literally have heart attacks when decent horror films put it.
