Carlos Mencia is not funny. From his stand-up specialties to this train crash of a TV series, Carlos Mencia is not funny. I've been trying to convince people for two years that he steals the jokes of other comedians, and as far as his comedy material is concerned, he's a regular "Johnny-eat-lately" with much less than below average results. Astronaut psychopath? Britney Spears breaks jokes? I hope this is just a scheduling mistake, but come to Carlos and Comedy Central, these topics, and many others, have the range of opening night monologues, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many, many others. Crushing ethnic and racial stereotypes? Comedy has no chance to evolve with Carlos Mencia out there. Perhaps people, especially Comedy Central viewers and executives, can understand the subject, since this week's issue of New York magazine accurately labeled it: "Carlos Mencia, puppy of jokes without regret."
