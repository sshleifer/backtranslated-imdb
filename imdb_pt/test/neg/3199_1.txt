Quite possibly one of the biggest waste of celluloid in the last 100 years. Not only does it suffer from an uncomfortable (and enormously predictable) script, but it's clearly a carbon copy of Alien II. In five minutes, I correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). Special effects are laughable; there is a scene in which a team member is beaten (not convincingly) by two Krites who look like a pair of teddy bears, and the sparse humor is misplaced and terrible. There are better things to do with a remote VCR than using it to watch this movie.
