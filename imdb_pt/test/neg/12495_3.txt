CyberTracker takes place in Los Angeles sometime in the near future, where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) saves Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt on a group known as UHR, the Union of Human Rights. Rights, who are angry at Dilly for leading the Computerized Judicial System, in which robots called CyberTrackers are sent to determine and distribute justice to the culprits. Anyway, Eric saves Dilly, who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his obscure activities like the cold-blooded murder of a traitor, the guy who is Eric is not impressed when Dilly kills a woman he is asked to keep it quiet. Eric escapes and proposes to bring Dilly down, however Dilly has many powerful friends and he uses his influence to frame Eric and have his CyberTrackers sent in search of him ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give the movies a bad name, I did not like it very much. Jacobsen Hart's script is fairly predictable, non-exciting, it steals most of his ideas and themes from other better science fiction films and the heady mix of martial arts and science fiction does not suit very well. There are some fights, some car chases and a couple of shootings, but it's all fairly bland and forgettable. The film lacks imagination, considering that the film is set in the future and deals with robots, technology and the way society is directed and its judicial system in particular. Talking about it, the fantastic Robocop (1987) brilliantly mixed violent action and clever social commentary, but CyberTracker does not even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any significant moral message about law enforcement, the script basically uses the concept to have robots and shoot outs that Robocop did as well, but also managed to include a good story. There is very little on CyberTracker so I can say it was fun and this is what the movies are about what is right? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin does everything well, but nothing stands out, it's quite forgettable and not particularly exciting. The elements of science fiction are nothing more than the robotic side of things and, as a whole, the film does not look so futuristic. The action scenes are fine, there are some cars exploding and some shootings, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> Technically CyberTracker is medium, for a supposedly defined movie in the future, it already looks dated and the special effects are bad. The acting was poor, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signs checks with that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing here original or exciting and the action is instantly forgettable. Poor and that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.
