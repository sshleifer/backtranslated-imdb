Throughout his career, Hitchcock has made great films; this was not one of them. <br /> <br /> A man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to ensure his silence, and in the end everything is solved with the accompaniment of a shooting and a drama on the terrace. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen Fritz Lang's 1930s films - "M" comes to mind - will know how far this urban narrative of crime and consciousness falls short of what had already been done in that genre in that time. There is a totally amateurish air about much of the staging and acting that subverts any sense of threat, darkness and depravity that Hitchcock might be trying to instill. <br /> <br /> What worth paying attention to, however. is the sequence associated with the shooting at Albert Hall. Once this begins, it is as if the film had received a blood transfusion. The camera work is lively, the cuts are interesting and the way it all goes with the climax is masterful. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock effortlessly orchestrates all the features for an impressive and memorable effect: when the scream arrives you really feel and hear it.
