I have not seen this for many years. The performance was as good as I started this time, I thought: "Great! Another movie I thought was wrong as a young fool." But then the theme started to be clear and I felt the same. <br /> <br /> It was Hollywood, the seat of glamor; then the concept should not come as a surprise. But it's so condescending a concept that I feel like I need to take a shower after watching it. In short, this tells us that even physically ugly people can look beautiful with each other and even feel attractive. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McGuire is nice as the homemade heroine. She seems to have been filmed using minimal makeup. Robert Young is wounded in the war and feels scars. His parents can not bear to look at him either. He seems to have all of his faculties and, in part, the notions of disability are out of fashion. <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall is in the hand like a blind pianist. His character speaks quietly and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best performance is given by Mildred Natwick as the owner of the title residence. It is bitter and sisuda, but it is not made of ice. His story is far more interesting and believable than that of McGuire and Young.
