This show had a promising start as the opposite of 'Oceans 11', but turned into a perfunctory T & A performance. In fact, according to my younger brother this is the only good part of the show. <br /> <br /> The first season was by far the best, it was something new and interesting that just happened after that. The only redeeming point for this show is JamesCaan, The other actors are dull. The characters have no depth and appear to be incredibly selfish and generally unfriendly people. <br /> <br /> To quote a friend "Las Vegas is like Baywaych in a casino" In my opinion, is generous, Baywatch was much better and much more realistic.
