I'm watching this horrible movie as we speak. is possibly one of the worst movies ever shown in my house. I'm sitting here with 3 friends and they agree. it is not scary. it's not funny. it is not dramatic. contains nothing attractive. we're 49 minutes into the movie. we only saw 2 creatures. only one person died. this movie is a big disappointment. Nothing about this horrible, horrible movie made me want to see the rest. I'm getting a movie. I hope everyone who had something to do with the making of this movie die. I'm not just referring to the actors. I mean the director, producers, the presidents of the studio that funded this movie. is in full, the worst movie of all time. must make the worst 100 IMDb movies of all time. in number 1.
