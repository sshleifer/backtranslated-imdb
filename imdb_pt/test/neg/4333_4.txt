The author of "Prince" manages to lead an excellent cast, a decent story, a mediocre script and carefully assemble them into a monotonous and amateurish mess. Despite a strong central performance of Frank Nasso, the prince, this disjointed movie wanders aimlessly from scene to scene, disintegrating painfully into hash. The result brings a sigh of relief at the end, where tears of joy must be. A sad loss of time and talent and a good example of how NOT to direct a movie. <br /> <br />
