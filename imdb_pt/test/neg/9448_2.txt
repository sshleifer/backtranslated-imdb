I watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional movie B, but this movie was horrible. Aside from the "homemade" quality of the film, it was very slow and seemed to make no sense. I'm just commenting b / c of another review I saw here that said it was great! WOW! It may be good to watch on a rainy day, when nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were disjointed and did not fit into any discernible pattern of reality. The dialogue between the characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I think if you were very much in area 51 and understood some of the nuances that other reviews refer to, it might be good - but for me - the average Joe - I do not understand!
