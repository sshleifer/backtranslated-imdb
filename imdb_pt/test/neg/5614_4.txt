"Kicked in the Head" is about the character of Corrigan, a twenty-something man in search of finding himself, and his engagements with a handful of quirky characters. This fine, ambiguous story, which was written by Corrigan, has an impromptu feel and script that smells like an uninspired low budget indie. Despite this and some uncomfortable interjections on the Hindenburg scene, the film has a kind of quirky charm, which can somehow attract people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe it's fun for some. (D +)
