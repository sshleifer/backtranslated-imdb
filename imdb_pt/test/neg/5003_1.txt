This movie was terrible. It was very terrible. <br /> <br /> The most annoying was the way the trial was conducted. A defense lawyer is allowed to ramble when questioning a witness without the prosecution objecting. He attacks the children brought to bear witness with cruel ferocity and repeatedly yells at them that they are lying. These are simply not things that they subject children who have been sexually abused. The trial is silly and spoils the whole movie ... (Law & Order spoiled the court's accuracy).
