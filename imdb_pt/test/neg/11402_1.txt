One of the movies I just did not want to see. I got in the preview, but damn, the acting was really bad! At the end of the movie (I'm still surprised that I watched the whole movie ..) I wondered why I watched the movie. Also here in Holland, the writer of this film (it is filmed from a book by Giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his film went like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.
