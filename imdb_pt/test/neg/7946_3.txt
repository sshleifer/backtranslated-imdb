It's New Year's Eve, a police killer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne), who ends up in an enclosure that is closing due to snow. When people are besieged, police officers have to join the cons to survive. This reprint of John Carpenter's classic just had to add some in addition to stupid twists, take all the strain and add a horrible John Lequizamo to the cast, did not it? The first film was thrilling, courageous and a joy to watch. This is more Hollywood, clich√© and painful to see. The only thing I took from this film was OCD can be very annoying ... MUCH. The final song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delet scenes with optional comments; 5 minutes "Armed and Dangerous" featurette on the weapons specialist; 7 and a half minutes "behind the walls of the police station"; "Plan of Attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 minutes and a half behind the scenes, trailers for "Unleashed", "White Noise": Seed of Chucky "<br /> <br /> Miscelanious: Bought at Best Buy and it came with a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of "Cry Wolf," a first 10-minute look at "Unleashed," the movie trailer, and an interview with Fuzion John Leguizamo
