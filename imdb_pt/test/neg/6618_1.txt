Why was not this voted Best Picture of 1998? This has to be the best movie ever. Does something like Citzen Kane seem like total crap, come on, Citzen Kane was not even in color! I love this movie, it has to be the best movie I've ever put money in. I'm still shocked that it was not named for ANYTHING! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the greatest you can give, I give 20!
