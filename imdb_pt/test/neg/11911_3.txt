Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors who ever graced the screen. He could easily switch dramatic roles to comics with ease, making most of his colleagues green with envy. While his performance in "Save the Tiger" is Oscar-honored, I feel it was given to him as he had missed his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one. <BR> This is also one of those pretentious movies that basically show the talent of the cast, or in this case, a particular member. It's very bad that the scriptwriter's output does not match Lemmon's. Do not waste your time on this one.
