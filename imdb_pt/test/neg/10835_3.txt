What a horrible movie. The effects were poor, especially by today's standards, but this was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible repetition of all the floods / dams that break the film about disasters that have already been done in this piece of garbage. The acting was horrible and I mean AWFUL. The point of the story in which Michelle Green stopped to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and running through their lives. (By the way, they had to find a fat old dog not to make Miss Green look inappropriate). They can overcome the water for some time before taking refuge. What speed! Later, a car at high speed is not fast enough to escape the torrent. God, she and that dog ran fast! If you want to watch a good movie about breaking a dam - that's not it. Porchlight Entertainment produces some good movies for the family, but this time they have lost the mark.
