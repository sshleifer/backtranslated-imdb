This movie has to qualify with "Welcome to the Jungle" and "The Hitcher" and "Dream Catcher" for pure horror. You have the most annoying heroine in gore history who spends most of the time crying and crying - all the time in the most awful bathroom bathroom ever put on the movie. Why she spends so much time in this horrible bathroom from hell is never explained. Even when the driver of the usual killer truck is trying to assassinate her, she refuses to let the shit go. When a motorcycle cop comes to his rescue, the driver of the killer truck runs over the cop's legs while the heroine just looks. Instead of picking up her gun for protection, she drags the poor guy into the crap and locks the door. Then the police officer orders her to explode the brain because of the pain. She does this - whimpering and crying and whining - and blows the back of her head. So - the cop, still alive, begs her to shoot him again because he's still in pain. He says this while the whole back of the head is on the ground. The heroine crying and whining throws him again. The movie goes on like this, none of it makes sense. The heroine is so unpleasant that you really want the killer to leave early. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, so it did not cost me anything to watch, but I still watched, out of sheer fascination as a movie could end up so terribly bad.
