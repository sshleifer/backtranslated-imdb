Let's see ... a couple of dozen jokes from Gary Larson, as well as his style of illustration, a legally difficult appropriation of an Aardman character, more than a generous sprinkling of art direction from several Pixar films, positively the villains of King Lion King in what amounts to an elephant cemetery IN THE MIDDLE OF FARM COUNTRY, oh, and a stinking Riverdance joke ten years after any possible relevance. The kids (three and five) liked it, but, boy, it was something for Dad. Just another weak attempt from Nickelodean Films to participate in the animation explosion. I really wish they had spent a little more money on character design, rendering, a script, a director.
