Yes it's true. This movie is a horrible part of ... you know what. Almost every fan of Sapkowski's books in Poland thinks the same. The truth is that Polish cinematography can not allow the production of fantasy films. It's a pity when you compare "Wiedzmin" and "Conan the Barbarian", for example. I hope no one outside of Poland can see this nightmare.
