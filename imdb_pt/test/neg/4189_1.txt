This is by far the worst 'horror' movie ever, no, make any movie I've ever watched. Shame on Block Buster for having that kind of crap. I never ask for a refund on any movie, but I think this will be the first. <br /> <br /> The movie is so bad that I had to stop after only 15 minutes watching. <br /> <br /> I had more fun watching any of the YouTube movies that watched this fall. The marketing guy for this movie must have some sort of silver tongue to put this thing into an establishment like Blockbuster.
