Like the previous poster, I'm from northern Vermont, and I was inclined to like this movie. However, not since "Red Zone Cuba" I have seen such a confusing plot. The things people do on bootleg does not make sense. Two members of the class cross the border and send a second person in a car. Uhm, why? Then they meet up with two others and head off into the packard's hideout at night in a luxurious Packard. "Just two people on a platform truck no longer make sense?" Then, parked outside the garage that holds the target, the four sleep! When they wake up in the morning and begin to carry the whiskey out, it is clear that they are seen and shot, losing part of their precious cargo in the process. Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and put it on the border. Again, why? I was informed by someone whose great-uncle really did smuggle in the area, all that was needed was to drive a vehicle that could be faster than the Canadian Border Patrol, which at that time had a fraction of the resources it had now. <br /> <br /> And do not make me start in the last half hour, which did not make any sense <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about the movie is that Kris Kristopherson has actually, has grown a little charisma over the years.
