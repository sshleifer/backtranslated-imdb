This is not the true story. It is the blackest fiction possible derived from events. It endorses suicide, the dark obsession with death, a wholly gratuitous stroke in organized religion in general (and in the Anglican Church in particular), and generally provides a nihilistic and meaningless worldview from which viewers intend to depart, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness. Absolute garbage, though attractively accomplished by a capable cast. That someone would suggest that this is a true translation, however, is very false propaganda. Do you want the real story? Rent 'fairy tale'. This is the real story. See if you can find some correspondence between the facts presented in both cases. I only found one: the girls who made the original photos were pre-pubescent.
