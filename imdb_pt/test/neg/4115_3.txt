In a future where a diligent travel agency uses time travel technology to send rich customers back in time to explorations in the era of dinosaurs, the future is inexplicably modified when one of their customers breaches the main rule of not deflecting from way. In an attempt to repair the damage done, an experienced scout (Edward Burns) joins the inventor of technology (Catherine McCormack). <br /> <br /> The premise is very good and engaging. It may have some flaws, but it can still make an interesting movie. Unfortunately, The Sound of Thunder can not attract audiences. He suffers from a lot of problems and takes himself too seriously, so it's hard to have fun while watching the movie. Personally, I thought the script was the film's biggest problem. The holes were more than expected and the film was kind of lazy in explaining things. I was hoping for a deeper look at "the butterfly effect," but the film was more fun escapist than anything else. Okay with me since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a good way to spend an evening. However, all the fun this movie offered was unintentional and lame. There were some scenes that kept me entertained, but I was very bored. <br /> <br /> The acting is not much better, since most of them seem more interested in a salary than anything else. The only person who did well was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the movie enjoyable and he seemed to be enjoying himself as well. Edwards Burns was very pale and bland. I do not think he has what it takes to be a protagonist. However, he could make a decent supporting actor. Catherine McCormack was very irritating and unconvincing. I did not really see her in anything else, but she could have potential. The rest of the actors also do poor performances, although most of them are relatively unknown, so it should not affect their careers much. <br /> <br /> Looking at the message boards, most people are complaining about the special effects. There is no way to sweeten them and they are terrible. All dinosaurs look really bad. The gecko lizards (part monkey, part dino) as a creative idea, become rancid after a while and are more likely to stimulate laughter than fear. The green screen work looks awful and unprofessional. I was actually wondering what director Peter Hyams was trying to accomplish here. He fails to deliver the suspense, action and thrills and makes this movie a long sit. Most of the time, the film is quite harmless and is far from the worst movie of 2005. I hope they remake this movie in the future. There is potential in this project, but for now this is the best we can get. In the end, unless curiosity gets the better of you, there's no reason to see The Sound of Thunder. Overall Rating 4/10
