I recently was in a theatrical version of this piece. And on the last day of the race, I was excited to see that it was going to be shown on TV. I tucked a tape in the middle of the night and watched the next day. I have to say that I was very disappointed. The actors in the film have made some of the discoveries that are in the script. This is understandable, since the resersivo process is probably different, but it was disturbing to see. Much of the original script was changed to the movie, to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure if it helped the movie. I gave this 4 stars just because I know the script and the writing are much better than what this movie portrays.
