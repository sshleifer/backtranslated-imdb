It's not always that I feel strong enough to post something about a movie. This was, however, simply the worst movie I have ever seen. The performances were laughable at best, at worst they were, well, there is no other word for it, horrible. Especially the main woman who is random sexual has to be seen and heard to be believed. Honestly, the plot is absurd, the dialogue terrible and the characterization ... there is none. I'm surprised it's not a Alan Smithee movie. I can not emphasize this strongly enough ... avoid at all costs. How are movies like this made? This is not a budget movie at its worst.
