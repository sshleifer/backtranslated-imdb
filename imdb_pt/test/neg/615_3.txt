This is a movie that really makes me shudder. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons were doing some of their best cartoons - with incredible animations, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, in the late 1940s, a new style of animation began to appear (like the "Crusader Rabbit" series on TV) - animation with extremely simplistic works of art in order to save money. Unfortunately, the Columbia Pictures cynic stratagem worked !! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should), many accepted them and the Oscar staff (AMPAS) actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Short Film - giving legitimacy to an inferior product. Unfortunately, in the world of dollars and the sense of Hollywood, this soon began to infiltrate the products of legitimate studios - resulting in somewhat bad cartoons. Later, it got even worse, as well as bad animations and origins, the stories themselves became unbearable for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the classic drawings disappeared. And because of this tragedy, I blame, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the cheap cartoon grandparents. The story is not so bad, but the animation is a horror and listening to the boy saying "boing-boing" incessantly is a pain.
