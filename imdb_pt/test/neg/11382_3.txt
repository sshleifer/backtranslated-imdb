Unfortunately, it seems that the golden age of elegant Italian cinema has fallen by the wayside. And the recent idea of ​​the famous filmmaker Lamberto Bava is yet another obvious proof of this assumption. <br /> <br /> I felt lucky to watch many of this prolific director's films (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and the two Demons). Although not entirely satisfactory, they have never been so boring. <br /> <br /> The suspicion that this new entry for my DVD collection was money released to the winds came just after the scene of the car accident, exhibiting a strange and improbable situation. position of the body under the carriage. <br /> <br /> And the sense of superficiality grew in the course of the weighted chain of events that followed. <br /> <br /> Dumb talks, a script without suspense and a total waste of talent from the international cast. The only character who provided a more or less passable performance was Mark's son, the marauder, absorbing all the boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the work of Mario's son on all accounts could hardly be greeted. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing your Murder House hopefully expected to be an improvement.
