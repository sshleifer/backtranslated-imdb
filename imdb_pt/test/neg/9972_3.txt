This movie is about a woman falling in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From there, she has to split her time for the two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph at night. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to have been done on a minimal budget. Most of the movie is set in an apartment with minimal furniture. There are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits make only momentary appearances. The costume designer does not seem to have much to do, since the actors wear very heavy clothes, and in fact most of the time they are naked anyway. <br /> <br /> The film is very heavy on dialogues, which should have made up for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialogues sound very clumsy and clumsy. At the beginning of the movie, most of the dialogue is for a person saying a very long sentence, and then the person says "Me too." After the frenzy of agreement, the dialogue descends into a mess of salad of confused and disconnected words. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film that I can think of is that it serves as a feminist outlet that conveys that it is not just men who can be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This movie is a big disappointment.
