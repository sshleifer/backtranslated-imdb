We found this movie almost impossible to watch. With a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and the direction have been so terrible. The excruciating rhythm in which the story was told was maddening. The flashbacks were awkward. The characters were one-dimensional. Heavy metaphors-the river, the cat-were repeated too often. <br /> <br /> The film Nobody's Fool, based on another Russian novel, was infinitely better, probably because it was better written and directed. The photograph in Empire Falls was lovely. Too bad it was not a travel diary. I read the novel and I liked the style of writing, but I had some complaints about the novel itself. I would give the romance 4 out of 5 stars. Perhaps the writers and director were so impressed by the novel's reputation that they felt they needed to include every detail of the film. This was to be a television movie, folks, not Books on Tape.
