Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team that made the balance swing from bad to bad. Until then there was a lot of bad movie luggage but the Stamps ?? They are wearing bicycle helmets painted black. You know the ones with air holes that make all adults who use them look like a complete tool. Of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship could have been another clue (would not this do for Tampa Bay let alone an ocean)? and his tactics would not be approved in a third-rate XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Does director John Shepphird have photos of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with a Hobbit? Because I can not think of any other reason why he's in this movie. The other actors have a great excuse. They are untapped hacks that could not be hired for an infomercial. The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (love saying that name) aboard a cruise ship and get loose. <br /> <br /> The sets consist of horrible cruise ship forgery (complete with airsters the size of a small apartment), the murders of monsters are the bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity, and many very bad actors become refuse to finish their death scenes. Of particular hassle is a gigolo character from a 60's Doris Day movie. The cast bleeds the ketchup while the Chupacabra bleeds the green glow of the day into the dark blood. (Why a goat eating a Mexican mammal would bleed anything but red is beyond me.) Every B movie has an inflection point that makes it fun (Hey, it's a shower scene lesbian, OMG this guy ate his own eyeballs) or not so fun (Do they just call those forty guys overweight wearing overalls and cyclist helmets Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls on the side of the movie B not so fun with a hit
