The worst part about this movie is that it does not have to be so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, although many movies are made; they made it look stylish and handsome, and best of all, they had the 21st-century audience with lesbian experience who embraced a positive lesbian film ... and yet the writer and director did everything to make each movie reworked about lesbian torment and confusion in boarding schools, (you know, the place that all lesbian love lives and dies). <br /> <br /> This is a theme that has been done over and over again in the cinema, but something that viewers - if someone uses this voting forum as a clue - does not seem to get enough. Each element of this story was so exaggerated, overly false and fabricated that it was painful to sit down. The main characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, genius, rebellious hardcore lesbian girl (well, they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to mess with her but she did not stick much) seduces a rich girl who is destined to betray her, over there. <br /> <br /> Watching them every step of the way is character 3, a doped, well-meaning observer, wide-eyed and good-looking. I say "every step" because she shares all her thoughts with the audience through the hardest and most idiotic monologues. <br /> <br /> Your lines seem to have been written by a fifteen-year-old boy, though they're trying. It's as hard to sound like a fifteen-year-old really, um, you know, well ... Speak. "Listening to them (making love) with their noises was one, you know, well ... ok!" she says about her 2 roommates, who roll on the bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later, she asks Graham Greene, the talented Native American actor who is completely wasted on a gardener's roll (!). "Is it wrong to care what people think?" <br /> <br /> Sorry, but is she a teenager, or is she 7 years old? <br /> <br /> Granted, Piper Perabo (as Polly, the tortured dyke) and others do a good job at the horrible lines that they are forced to utter. Perabo has a good level of energy and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. It would do well on a decent project, so this is by no means a criticism of acting. <br /> <br /> But this story is SHAMELESS in perpetuating all stereotypes about lesbians, all brought together in one character. They could not stop her (Polly) being an angry, crazy-passionate secret genius who ended math problems for the wordless teacher. Oh, but that's after she argues with the teacher who dares accuse her of "blabbering." <br /> <br /> "That's a word they (men) use against the US (women)!" she says, coming out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is that all the writer could invent? Or maybe we should ask why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole and co. continued and made of Polly a poetic and somber child who communicates with wild hawks screaming his name in the forest. <br /> <br /> Cue the slow motion, the science fiction, the atmosphere of Xena! <br /> <br /> So we sent her to her biological mother ... (most lesbians are hungry for love, in case you're in the dark). <br /> <br /> So we have two teachers (one tense, one crazy guy with loose neck ties) hanging around all the action (the school looks too big for only 2 teachers) ... and give the child dark / seductive / tense girl bird seems. Hmmmm I wonder if anything well, you know ... um, FUNNY is happening between these TWO TEACHERS ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for something badly done. Heartbreak happens, but certainly the writer and director knows that lesbians exist in times much more sophisticated than this schlock. <br /> <br /> I can not reveal the end in respect to those who force themselves to sit to the end, but if you're not laughing, I can only imagine that you're crying. And not for the right reason. And I do not mean the complicated scenes.
