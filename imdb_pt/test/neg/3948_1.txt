The plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus and October) are reunited by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend, Loomis. After the funeral, they decide to share their deceased friend's belongings. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better way to show their sadness than to participate in a small virtual bloodbath. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor Loomis. <br /> <br /> The Production: This movie is just another entry to the latest low budget Hollywood madness. Horror PG-13 intended to cash in on the high school crowd. The direction is sloppy, to put it mildly, with quick cuts in the style of video clips that hinder action. The dialogue is so bad it actually kills the brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we do not even learn where the game came from or because those who play it die. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this movie, though not entirely original, had some promise. But poor execution on both sides of the camera makes this a big flop. <br /> <br /> If you've ever had a desire to "kill someone on a video game, make them dead in real life" horror movie follow my advice and skip Stay Alive to the top Brainscan.
