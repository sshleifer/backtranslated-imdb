I've heard that New was compared to Memento for the simple fact that they both rely on leading characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, it's like comparing The Silence of the Innocents and Friday the 13th as both involved a character who killed several people. They could not be further apart in ideas. <br /> <br /> New deals with a copier man in a company that has short term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a temporary who also gets involved with it and can / can not use it for sex. Needless to say, he has a lot of sex on screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there's more. There is a boy running to the bruised amnesia and it is obvious that there is more to this boy who runs into him. And there's a notebook the man keeps trying to remember important clues. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am not from foreign films. I do not mind reading the subtitles, but I remember that sometimes it takes one of my favorite aspects of a movie: a great dialogue. As they have to translate, or I would not be able to understand for the most part, I truly believe they simplify what the characters have to say. This movie was no exception; the dialogue was just, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me going for 98 minutes. Strange, yes, but again, I do not live in France, so I'm not as familiar with their likes / dislikes or lifestyles. (How, I think it's acceptable for a father to lie and play with his son on the beach? That should be a cultural thing.) Fortunately it was not two hours of time invested in seeing this man compose himself. your past and progressively progress to your healing. For when the "secret" is learned, was I really? Well ok then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend for a decent performance, pretty people and soft-porn sex situations (like every 2-4 minutes), however, if you do not like that kind of scene, I sincerely skip that slow movement and recover the memory.
