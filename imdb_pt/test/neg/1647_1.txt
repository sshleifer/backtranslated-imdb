In her recent smeared reality show, Shore admitted that her cinematographic work is more appreciated than stoned. No, he must have said "best attended." While a healthy toke can see you through the final credits, there is little pleasure in being found, except for a few sporadic laughs in the photo, not with it. The absence of proprietary hyphenate is the least complaint. Another hyphenate, healthy Tiffani-Amber Thiessen (I dare you to rub that patina of purity "Except for the Bell") is mischievous as a rural vampire; she is very round of face for treason. Mr. Shore, himself, occasionally exhibits the odd talent for mimicry (I thought I recognized a Jimmy Stewart there), however, it is never used properly. The banal fish-out-of-water formula has not yet been presented with less grace. Our hero, Crawl, has a precious little intelligence to explain expeditiously his charming agrarian antagonists. Ultimately, I had to announce that it was confirmed: THE WORST FILM EVER. P.S. Like another fish, Adam Sandler did better with "Mr. Deeds". You can take a beach to enjoy a Sandler.
