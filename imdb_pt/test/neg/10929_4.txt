This is a rather simplistic novel. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl meets boy. Colleen Moore is the hallmark ingredient in this recipe, delivering a dramatically / dramatically varied romantic performance, worthy of an Oscar name. Equally good are the special effects of aerial combat. <br /> <br /> Moore plays a French girl whose mother delivered her field to a British air squad during World War One. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. In this mix comes a filling of a collapsed pamphlet, Gary Cooper. At first they hate each other, so they love each other, so the whole squad is sent on a suicide mission. Cooper returns, but falls in the village and a red cross unit removes him. Moore searches for him, is told in a hospital that he is dead, then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are gathered. <br /> <br /> It's a cool little novel, but little more than that. Recommended for fans of Mrs. Moore and Mr. Cooper
