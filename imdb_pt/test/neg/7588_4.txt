It turns out that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II, had entries in Harry Medved's 50 Worst Movies. Now, I think declaring them to be among the worst films of all time is an exaggeration, even though they are still both very bad movies - particularly the first, since it has more roll eyes and "wide-eyed" than I already I saw it before !! Director Eisenstein and many other people out there thought this made the movie "artistic and profound" - and as I am legally they are, I must say I hated this first movie !! The second, although still very incomplete, is a great improvement, since the movements of the eyes are minimal, although exaggerated scenes and long and annoying are present in this film, as in part 1! While part 2 seems pretty incomplete and needs at least another hour (especially because it never comes to Ivan's insane behavior later in life - like killing his son and heir in a fit of rage). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it is no surprise that Ivan's life story is left too incomplete. Even without all of Ivan's truly horrible behaviors, apparently the supremely evil Stalin STILL did not like the film and did not allow his release during his life. Maybe he would not allow it because he was more worried that people would see the enormous waste of money and resources that the movie was, instead of seeing Stalin as crazy as Ivan! <br /> <br /> By the way, there was a segment of this tedious movie that was so cool that the movie deserved a 4 (without it, a 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet! It's well done and very funny in a somber way. And the scene was made in a Russian version of Technicolor in two colors. This is very strange, by the way, because in the mid-1930s, a truly improved color process was developed by Technicolor that did not look all over red-orange and blue-green anymore. So this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or initial color film. Very odd even for the 1940s.
