This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of for the good reviews I received from some here is that they were written by cast people. It was really painful watching this movie. Even my grandchildren (ages 6 to 13) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. It's as if some people were sitting around drinking beer and saying, "Hey, let's make a movie. It's so bad. In addition to Luke Perry, who is in only a small part of the movie, I did not recognize any other actor. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case. I liked Sandlot and I usually like stupid and silly movies, but this movie does not have a unique quality of ransom. The people who wrote it have no idea how children think, speak or act, and the film is a disjointed mess of terribly cheeky lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but this is the worst movie I've seen since man's best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you rent, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people regard this movie as good is a sad comment about their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerating.
