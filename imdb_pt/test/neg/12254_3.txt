Although this has to be the low point of the sixth season, this episode schmaltzy is not badly written or acted. It was just that most of us were looking at the X-Files for the tense, thrilling terrorists who ended up with no easy answers and moving toward obscure but complicated conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a series of ironic comedies that undermined the continuity of the show and, frankly, made the Simpsons Halloween specials look like a great suspense story. <br /> <br /> In this episode, SNL's Victoria Jackson plays the suffering girlfriend of a man who poses as a rainmaker. However, her weatherman boss is the one who really loves her and Mulder ends up having to provide dating advice in order to get out of town. <br /> <br /> There's fun fun with the chemistry between the agents and some fun stuff. but rather unsophisticated characterization of the American midwesterners. It's nothing you want to see more than once! <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine the sixth season. X-File creator Chris Carter seems bored with the story arc of the 'Union Conspiracy' and abandons black comedy writers responsibility.
