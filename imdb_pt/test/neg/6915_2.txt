Nobody in this movie has much to do. This is probably the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. The makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps her from being rated as 1. The doctor's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was next scene. The director put together many of the right ingredients for a crazy doctor movie, but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them. Unless you know someone from the cast or crew, I would not recommend even a sample of that.
