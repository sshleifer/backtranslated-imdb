Topical? Certainly. Entertainment? Probably - but only in removing any fragment of the viewer's common sense. Reality? Only it was made on this planet. <br /> <br /> How thousands of people were supposed to have died as a result of a 5-meter wall of water in a city filled with buildings as well as others. 25 meters high is well beyond me. Carlyle's line to the effect of "How could anyone survive this?" when the shot shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable. Also, if someone commits themselves to an area (underwater) where a cylinder of air is not enough (ie, they will die), why not use the simple expedient of picking up more than one cylinder? Clearly, the writer finds that people in stressful situations can not count beyond one (a cylinder, a floor). <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this complaint, you'd be more informed and entertained by throwing the DVD out and reading the pricing information on the cellophane outer casing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunate, truly pitiful, and a terrible waste of talent on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be made by dispensable men: even more PC 'tosh'. No wonder that First Blood, Delta Force, Navy Seals and other films of little or no merit always have followers while this ostensibly politically motivated basement is sold.
