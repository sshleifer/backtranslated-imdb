During an eight-year period in the 1980s, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: "The Evil That Men Do," a pickup from ITC Entertainment's TriStar Films. Bronson was already in the middle of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, who went through countless actions until "Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects" in 1989. Expectations must be very high with Bronson and Thompson working for better funded equipment like ITC, but "The evil that man does" is a big disappointment on many levels. Although still from the low budget, the cast of B movie of the 1980s, "Evil" has a tempting potential for a great movie. Everyone in the production department, however, opted for an easier path and sold the work of hacking, not deserving the Bronson brand. 'The evil that men do' had a concept and technical features that could have been used to make one of the best films of Bronson and Thompson, but instead will fall as one of its more average. <br /> <br /> This 1984 political / action thriller opens brutally with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British physician with his special training class for political leaders in Suriname. Molloch, gray-haired and passive, is a specialist in methods of torture that is employed by numerous political regimes. In the first seven minutes, we witnessed Molloch using electric current to inflict unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you might expect, the scene is horrible to watch and has been cut from the original VHS release. Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of Molloch, but declined the offer. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer) visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to convince the Netherlands to finish the work, bringing videos of testimonies of the victims of the Doctor. While in denial at the beginning, the Netherlands finally agrees to the dirty work, targeting Molloch and his sister owl Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. <br /> <br /> The Netherlands enters Guatemala City with the help of an adviser, Max Ortiz (René Enríquez); poses as a tourist with Hidalgo's widow, Rhiana (Theresa Saldana), and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas). As with most of Bronson's later production, his character overthrows Molloch's henchmen one by one, crossing paths with an American diplomat (John Glover) and his successful companion (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal ending occurs in the cracks of a mine of opals, where the Doctor has just deserted several of his victims. <br /> <br /> "The evil that men do" is based on a novel forgotten by R. Lance. Hill and jumps to American political affairs in Latin America during the 1980s. In fact, 'Evil' is difficult in every way, as it uses sensationalism and brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in the development of plot and character. No matter how much this film has, there are three or four drawbacks, resulting from the craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> Although 'The evil that men do' has a great concept, the film is never really more than an excuse for Bronson to do away with the foreign scum. In bad police fiction style, 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. Holland, despite being heavily played by Bronson, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a rental killer. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, repudiates the Netherlands for much of the way, but then feels affection for him. Where does her love come from, especially after seeing Holland killing several people and wanting to go home only a few times before? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are Molloch and her sister Claire, because many questions can be asked of them. Of course, we never find out what brought them so intimately together, how and where the torture negotiations began, what is the exact role of Claire in her affairs? These holes can last forever, especially with the plot-by-numbers plot that seems to get things done as it progresses. Why is Hidalgo's daughter brought into such a perilous situation, besides being conveniently taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the arena of the cockfight, why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwards? Is your memory so short? And what was really the purpose besides the cheap theatricality of the Holland playing Molloch's chauffeur, Cillero (George Luke), out of a window, when the murder could have been treated more discreetly in Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> The overall performance is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. The direction of J. Lee Thompson is missing in points, but may have been compromised for limited time in place. In addition to filming Evil in Mexico, ITC's presence is clear through better production, cinematography, and music scores. Rural places are well used to convey the hot, dusty atmosphere of Latin America, and the director of photography Xavier Cruz offers rich color and clarity. The orchestral score of Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in a synth era era. Incredibly, these positive aspects only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than usual, albeit with more laughable continuity errors. "The evil of what men do" was perfect for the early '80s and I find it hard to recommend for 21st century fans. Columbia's TriStar Entertainment DVD is a great presentation, offering widescreen and standard format with subtitles in four languages. While video quality is well above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in simple mono audio. The theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and diffused sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
