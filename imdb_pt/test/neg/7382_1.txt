I found Super Troopers only mildly entertaining at best (it seemed like a glorified beheading from the Police Academy to me), and I rented this movie hoping it would be better. It was not. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely horrible and the pace of this movie is even worse. It does not seem like much happens in this movie, or that it really gives us a reason to care about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Felix is ​​totally uninspired, though possibly due in part to the dialogue with which he had to work. In short, this movie simply went wrong in many places. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that since films like Clerks, independent filmmakers seem to think that they can make movies like this with long and disconnected dialogue scenes. where the characters are trying to be funny. But where the dialogue in Clerks pushes the story forward in this film, it weighs irreparably. Movies should have a decent balance of action and dialogue, and tempting as it is for filmmakers to try to have a lot of fun and funny dialogues, this does not always work. Especially if they are not good at writing dialogues. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and this movie has such a low budget it was filmed on video.
