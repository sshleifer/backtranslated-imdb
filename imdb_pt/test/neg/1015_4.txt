As Paul Kersey was running out of kin to get his revenge, the third part of the "Death Wish" saga revolves around him returning to New York to visit an old friend of war. He arrives only to discover that Brooklyn has completely transformed into a pauperized gang and that young thugs killed his friend and continually terrorized all the other tenants of a dilapidated apartment building. Kersey makes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blonde lawyer, knocks out numerous villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum weapon and gradually trains and inspires the petrified New Yorkers to defend themselves. Okay, there's no point in defending the series "Death Wish" after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved in social drama as much as in retribution, and although it was pure exploration, part two still had some redeeming qualities and at least the events were logically linked to those that occurred first. Number three often looks like a totally separate franchise. Apparently Kersey is no longer an architect, he is ten times more social and talkative than he used to be, and suddenly no one, not even the police, is more against the vigilantes' actions? All of these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson have reduced their success from "Death Wish" to being a purely brainless and exploitative action series with a number of deaths that increases gigantically each episode, arsenal who becomes more and more explosive and criminal who become more unpleasant, sordid, more evil and much more difficult to kill. However, you do not seem to realize that the continuous fire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, that is, extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. This description could not be more accurate as the script moves with fatigue from one repugnant execution sequence to the next. Particularly the final twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of shots, explosions and executions carried out through makeshift homemakers. Yi-Haaa! This entry into the series has a rather compelling supporting cast, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the neighbor of fatigue who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot", "The Longest Yard ") as unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from" Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure! ") in his debut role as one of the bandits.
