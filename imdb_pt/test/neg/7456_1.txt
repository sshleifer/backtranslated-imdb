I do not know where to start. Dragon Hunt may be the worst movie in film history. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this because it was intentionally bad. Showgirls? No, it had kitsch value and was technically a well done movie. But Dragon Hunt grabs the cake and eats it, then vomits it and feeds it to a homeless man. It's a big hoax. <br /> <br /> Performance, if it can be called, is difficult. It does not have the charm of the improvised performance, so it should be scripted, but it is recited with an almost malicious tone of low quality. Several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically those people on the screen) either regretted being connected to this movie or was thinking of a particularly humorous Saturday Night Live joke that they watched before they got in front the camera. I could write three more paragraphs about the quality of acting in this movie, but you and I do not want to hear it. <br /> <br /> Make-up and special effects (which, with most movies, is the only good thing) was ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous I can not remember, has a mohawk glued to the top of his head. Yes, stuck to his head. And you can say it's glued too, if you look at the spot where it meets your skull with dot marks, you can see a plastic strip, not unlike those of false eyelashes. Luckily he's pretty much the only example of makeup on us in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrible character development, to be lighter. Women, who are strangely ill-cared for by supposedly benevolent brethren (and I mean, they really are pushed), are not just ugly, but ... breathless ... they do not know what they're doing! In one scene they call their apparent lovers, join an ugly face even uglier, and then they smell some cocaine. Apparently, they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine, because they began to shake and laugh EVEN first of all to rise through their nostrils. Great timing girls! In addition, they use some really horrible things, clothes that belong only in the late 80's and early 90's. Overall, this movie, this movie, that wasted film, I must say, it is also a waste of time. Watching this will hurt you and will require the suspension not only of your belief but also of your entire brain. If you want to get stuck with your friends and have a good laugh, see if you can make this movie (you'll probably have to download it), otherwise, do not even think about it. I hope it was helpful.
