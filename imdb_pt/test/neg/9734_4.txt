Oh boy. Movies like that really bother me. If this movie is supposed to be close to the truth, then I suppose Rommel met Hitler for a while before World War II began. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler had changed before. Well, I can not imagine that Rommel would not have known anything about the policies of Hitler's government, so Rommel must share some blame for the German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life in the end tragic. He made his choices and we have to feel bad for him? I can not do it. Nor can I buy the theory that if the most competent generals could fight the war, the allies would have a harder time winning it. If more competent people were in charge, World War II may never have started in the first place. From the point of view of a movie, the film jumps from one place to another and, for the most part, seems like a special story, with actors' big names interpreting historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has some good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that they all spoke English without their ridiculous accents. But different from that is not very essential.
