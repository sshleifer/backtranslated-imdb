Not to be confused with the nasty parody of Michael Ritchie's beauty pageant in 1975, this "smile" is an example of the good intentions that paved the way to hell. <br /> <br /> The film parallels two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to create a facially deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a family of Malibu, danced on TV, plays " Gidget Get Birth Control ". Katie (Mika Booram, the third twin of Olsen) plays a spoiled and selfish student, distanced from reality. His teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China to show students how to work with deformed children. <br /> <br /> The film uses the deformity as a suspense medium treating Ling as the monster Frankenstein. . Kramer continually masks his deformity through hats, hoods and placement of cameras. This approach explores the quality of the aberration sample inherent in the material. She may feel uncomfortable with the way society sees her and Kramer's response is to cover her up to the great revelation. Why disrupt your audience with such displeasure? We see her face briefly at the end and only a few minutes before her credit snapshots after surgery reveal a swan under her cleft lip. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is that Ling is as hot and popular as Katie. <br /> <br /> The funding for the film came from a trust established by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They imagined an inheritance of quality family movies. Give me "Son of Paleface" any day.
