With a name like "10 commandments," you would expect a movie to be representative of the Bible narrative, specifically the Exodus. Not so here. This is standard procedure with any Biblical film made by Hallmark. Remember "Noah"? This was an absolute fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this movie had "some" truth in the original story. However, Menerith, who was an important character in this film - half brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were missing, not to mention that important events were completely eliminated. So you might ask? Because this must be representative of real history; otherwise, some may and believe that this is how it happened. In today's age, people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the Bible. Besides, it's a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script is already written. Why change that? In addition to the Exodus account itself (which should be the main focus), you have Cecil B. DeMille's movie to compare it, which is clearly a much better presentation. <br /> <br /> The night it first aired My wife was eager to see. I told her not to hope, because it was a Hallmark movie. She seemed puzzled and said, "Why? Hallmark makes good movies." That may be true, but they kill the Bible. Sorry to say that was correct. Not just history, but also acting. With today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful Bible movie. I am still waiting...
