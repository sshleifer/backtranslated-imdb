A waste of time, talent and shelf space, this is a truly abysmal movie. What is it that great leaguers like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd squander their time on such junk? The small criminal Reeves appears at the marriage of his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) and ends up going out with the bride. A comedy, suspense, romance? I honestly do not know! Reeves is wooden in the lead and throwing Dan Aykroyd as a cop is so terrible that it has to be seen to be believed! Only a bright spot in a dark and dark tunnel is Diaz and neither is she so good. Rent something else. All those involved in this mess should be ashamed and trapped, losing themselves in oblivion for years to come.
