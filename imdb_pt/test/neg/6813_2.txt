After reading the reviews, I decided to rent the DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I think I do not know enough about Bach's music and the reviews were not enough for me to understand the importance or what song was being played. <br /> <br /> It may be appropriate, under the guidance of a Bach music expert, to explain the film. <br /> <br /> I really tried and saw the whole movie jumping that I would be able to enjoy at least part of it, but I could not. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk.
