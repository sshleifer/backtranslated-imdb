I have been reading comments on the IMDb for some time. An average of 8.3 for this movie just freaks me out. I do not want to pull one of those "I just signed up for an account so I can post in this movie" bits ..... but I just did. The only theme you'll get from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that many people who love to film love this movie; however, sucks. What really appeals to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the "villain" of the film. If you have sex with your sister, you should probably be an outcast of society. Just my personal feelings, I guess. However, I sat for 2 hours in this * expletive * expecting a really deep rationale behind Dae-Soo's imprisonment. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean. film and put them last in my book. Oh ... I feel better after a little ventilation.
