** Spoiler * It gives the final very irrelevant ** At the beginning of this film, there was a brief introduction to the world of blood by the master of the gore films, H.G. Lewis. He talked about how this movie was lost and then found years after the director's death. He also talked about how bloody movies were measured by the amount of blood used on the stage. Blood feast was a 2 gallon, 10,000 Maniacs was a 5 gallon. But then he claims that Dr. Gore had 15 gallons. I wonder where half of the 15 gallons went. Watching the movie, I've seen very close to 15 gallons. All right, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but not nearly 15 gallons. Some of the break-up scenes were definitely pretty bloody and realistic, ropes of meat and everything, but I would not say 15 gallons. <br /> <br /> "ENOUGH !!! ENNNNNNNNNDDDDDD !!!" Does this sound familiar? This is what you should have said near the last half of this movie. After the character Igor was thrown into the acid bath, the movie declined to a painful trail. There was no coherent end, as it did not fit into the 90 minutes before being supplied. She left in a van with a strange total, big deal! This is what happens when you keep an individual (I do not say person because she does not qualify as a person) very innocent about the world around you. The doctor teaches the girl that a man should be loved, so every man she knows, she loves. Even though HG Lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting, the direction, or even the blood ... I will go with choices A and B. Both were terrible! ! It was enough to give me bad dreams of editing cutouts and people with shifty eyes while talking to a person. But I got through the movie and I got stronger. Too bad I could not say the same after finishing ROBO C.H.I.C. <br /> <br /> This was a bad movie. I can usually take my doses of vinegar at a good pace, but every once in a while, you get a movie that bites back. I guess this movie took off an arm or a leg (haha ... * sigh *) I admit, I took the look down scenes where the good doctor looked at his future victims and opened his eyes REALLY wide and just looked. He was very similar to Fuad Ramseys in Blood Feast, when he looked at that lady in her caterer, and did not use her power after that. I think this movie picks up where Fuad's powers have stopped. <br /> <br /> * Final Judgment * The movie should have been lost. Good morning. <br /> -Scott-
