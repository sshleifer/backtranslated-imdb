This adorable dog (named several names during the movie) is apparently loved all over town ... but he is alone. He is friends with two children (Cindy and Paul played terribly bad), but the father does not let them have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - ANOTHER lovely dog. They (instantly) fall in love and this leads to a hysterical assemblage of the two playing on the grass, drinking from a fountain ... in slow motion no less! Benji also lives in the cleanest and most abandoned house I have ever seen. So the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept, unassertive hijackers I've ever seen and - you do not know it - they hide the brats in the exact house where Benji lives! <br /> <br /> WOW was so bad! A huge success (for some reason) in 1974, which led to many sequences (which I will not see). The movie is just terribly hectic with "humor" so bland and poorly done that you just look at the TV in amazement. The movie also has a song that is played NONSTOP during the movie - so much that you want to scream. It was inexplicably nominated for Best Song at the Oscars - it did not win. Yes - dogs are adorable and much better than human actors - but I need more than cute dogs to keep me interested. <br /> <br /> You may think I'm being a little rough with a children's movie but I saw it with my 5-year-old nephew. Within 20 minutes he was bored and basically stopped watching. I continued to watch, hoping it would improve-it did not. Really lousy - but very patient children or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note to parents: It is rated G but a dog is kicked violently a few times. You do not see it - you just listen and the dog survives, but it can really annoy kids.
