the movie is a complete disaster. I do not know who writes scripts for movies like this, but I'd love to meet one of them and talk to him a little bit. Maybe the writers really do not know about the situation in foreign countries in the past or recent past? or they just do not give a shit and write down whatever they find interesting. <br /> <br /> A great and eternal formula with a mad dictator + 1 lone hero (an American, of course) might seem like a good idea, but let's go? we had a tyrant like that in Serbia (Milosevic) who did a lot of bad things with people, but I just can not imagine him screaming "shoot them, shoot 'em with a passion as barbaric as in medieval times. maybe they wanted to show how bad he was, but it was a stupid idea. a much better impression would be if he did it in cold blood, as the real monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of absurdities is very long, but the funniest is: no matter how many national TV stations are in Russia, the Russian president watch SNN (CNN) American news? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Give me some time! <br /> <br /> burn this piece of ruby, please! <br /> <br /> HORRIBLE!
