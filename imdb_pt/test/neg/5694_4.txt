I am willing to tolerate almost everything in a science fiction movie, but this was almost intolerable. While some of the special effects are very cool (landscapes), this is not a 'battlefield', but a weird mother / daughter relationship with science fiction concepts. The acting (wood), framing and shooting (film school) and with hand-to-hand combat scenes funnier than any chopsocky movie from Hong Kong, this movie bores. The plot is complicated and the devices used to move the storyline along (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your love of science fiction for something different, instead of losing some of it here.
