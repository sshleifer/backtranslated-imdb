First the fede premise ... little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. This reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are old and thighs, you saw them in a dozen movies of the 50s and 60s. The whole cast is wasted. I bet the people just signed to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, someone would tell Shirley that she did her best comedy on TW MULES FOR SARA SISTER. Look ... if there are no reruns from Andy Griffith.
