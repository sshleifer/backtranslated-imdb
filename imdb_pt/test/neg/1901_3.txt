Sorry, that was an unfortunate excuse for a movie .. such a holey plot that resembled a block of Swiss cheese and a lot of characters that seemed to me to be totally devoid of interpersonal relations .. Well, except, of course, to Carlyle and Lee-Miller, whom I might have sworn, should be in love ... Unlike the union of Tyler and Miller, who for the most part, like the rest of the film, was not convincing ... although the final product would wake up and fun all the wrong reasons, the production values ​​were high and deserve some recognition .. but unfortunately the end result was rubbish .. what were all involved thinking ..? they definitely should have packed their bags earlier in this ...
