I'm not sure who recommended Surveillance, but I think I have an idea: one of "Fat Guys At The Movies". The person said they were surprised at how big it was and said it was one of the most gluttonous / upsetting movies. (I am paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if I quote wrongly.) Anyway, I made the decision to watch it. So I take all the blame for my miscalculation by watching one of the most horrible, predictable, and stupid movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt I ever called it a "stupid" movie, but that was the first word that came to mind about a third and stayed in my mind to the end. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? Unbelievable assumptions and reactions, incredibly crazed characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or simply blame both) and extremely poor acting. I'd rather believe in Bill Pullman as US president than an FBI agent here. (Of course, there's a reason for that, and I'm going to partially enter into that.) And on top of that, if you can not imagine the shocking "distortion" call in the first 5 minutes, then you must have Arrived late at the theater or entered the room to watch late. Do not worry, they will tell you the "turnaround" every five minutes thereafter. <br /> <br /> There's been some serial killer on the loose in the most depressing county town, or the world. But there is more to the story! Some idiot and corrupt cops like to blow up tires for their own fun. Could there be more? Oh yes, there is a family, maybe not, but there are four humans, a boy, a girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with far less conviction than Cole sees dead people in The Sixth Sense. There has to be more to it than I mentioned! That's what makes an interesting movie! Adding so many subframes that may or may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, so I'll continue. We have goofy FBI agents that made me laugh. A pair of laughing junkies who, at first, were shocked by the OD dealer, but then resorted to robbery. An eccentric policeman who must have been put to comic relief who is always struggling with an angry / suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who not only phoned for his performance, he just typed the text. <br /> <br /> None of these works. They are all counted in various forms of presence or flashbacks, and believe me, you will lose all sense of affection after the first of many subplots begin. In addition, the reaction of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. I think I'm referring mainly to the cops, but mainly the girl who has lost or not just her family and almost does not blink. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's bloody bad as the person who recommended it said it was, unless your exposure has been limited to Goosebumps stories. And what's the title? Surveillance? Oh I understood; is because it was used in 1/5 subplots only for interviews in movies. As this is so random, it could also be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Just stay away from this horrible mess.
