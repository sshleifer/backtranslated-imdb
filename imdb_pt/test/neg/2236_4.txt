Is this "realism"? If Rivette was looking to give us a ground-level study of a woman in a certain place and time and how she was able to influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he failed miserably. Most prominent because we never have a clue why thousands of men would have followed her into battle. Certainly there is not enough exposure of the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and, God knows, there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan as she is presented here. Unless the posture of Bonnaire wood and the flat line readings indicate transcendental faith and determination. The use of the landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling that we are watching twentieth-century actors wandering in a supposedly medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which, unlike some commentators, occupy a good 15% of screentime) - they look like a History Club from their local school recreating a medieval siege, although the kids no doubt put more passion into it . I will give Rivette credit, however, for imagining a side of Joan left out by other films: that of a petulant, naive and narcissistic teenager (played by a woman clearly at least twice the age of the character she was supposed to play) . obviously unable to understand its place within the movement it is helping to create or the world that exists outside of its own passions. Joanna's indignation against her own soldiers, who curse and scare the enemy out of their lack of respect and obedience to her, are spontaneously believable and convincing notes (you suddenly realize that such moments must have occurred) in a historical "representation" that does not is engaging. Unfortunately they also serve to indicate precisely what is not covered on the screen - what did Joan SPECIAL do? I must say that I also remained intrigued and frustrated with certain lovers of foreign films who compared boredom and the lack of dramatic involvement with "art" and "seriousness." Does this movie really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject? Or with anything for that matter? 4/10
