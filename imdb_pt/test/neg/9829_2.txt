A day in the life of a moody taxi driver around Christmas: the taxi driver picks up a fare ... they have a "really insightful" interlude ... he drops the fare ... he picks up another fare. Another interlude ... and so on for 90 damn minutes ... none of that convincing (or interesting) for a minute ... SKIP IT!
