As much as we get a movie that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of ​​romance, I can not get rid of the feeling that this movie was intended as a C-grade direct-to-video porn movie in which either A) the actors gave up make the scenes explicit or B) the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts (an incredible thing if it were true). <br /> <br /> I had to go back to Blockbuster to find out why the hell I rented it, which was due to an admittedly amateur credulity about the cover ads, which seemed to imply a seditious humorous festivities in the style of John Waters, with a sexual theme. Ok, I laughed a few times and definitely have a sexual theme (though most can not be described as stimulating anyway). But in some movies, you can step back to make sure you have heard the dialogue correctly - in this, you move forward because you already know what you are about to say. But there is nothing to move forward, so just move quickly on the shelf.
