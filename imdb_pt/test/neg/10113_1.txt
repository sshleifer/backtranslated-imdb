I do not even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, I mean really. You got this guy running from a bunch of cats because he's dead, but in order to be really dead, does this girl have to shoot them? And they leave a corpse even if normal people can not see them because they're dead? The script already has a hole the size of Nebraska, so you have the main character played by Susan Paterno, who just talks her lines in a monotonous, boring voice with so little emotion in her face that she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot. It's absolutely horrible and I do not even understand how I managed to see it until the end of the movie. The ending is as stupid as the whole movie, and with absolutely no reward for the viewer. They could also have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo".
