Everything that made the original so fun seems to be missing here. This is simply a "run of the mill demons in loose destruction" slasher, but without the passion that graced the original. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in the story, it actually seems like they ignore the first one completely. Here the demons run loose in a high-security apartment building and, of course, kill most of the villagers macabre. The makeup effects, in fact, seem less convincing than the first time. Although the actors were not exactly brilliant in Demons, in Demons 2 they are actually much worse. You do not care about these characters at all. The plot is non-existent, the music is poor (except for a song by Simon Boswell), it's not at all scary; not so good. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst film in which Dario Argento was involved and also of Lamberto Bava (Bava has a special participation in this film, not very funny). <br /> /> Maybe 3 is a very high rating, but at least I could watch everything and did not think about stopping halfway. My advice; Stick to the original.
