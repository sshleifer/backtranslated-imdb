I'm in a movie class and I know I do not know everything about film, but honestly that's one of the worst, most stupid, retarded and wasted films I've ever seen and I've seen NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE. both are equally terrible. Conrack is annoying and nothing interesting even happens in the movie is not really a heart warming story and Pat Conroy does not beat anything! I'm not saying there should be fights and fucking exploding, but that would make this movie more than bland. the children they liked to play in this movie may have been the real boys on the island of yammacraux, they looked stupid and could not act, since I'm in doubt that this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie that I do not know why this movie was made, deviously the five worst films of all time.
