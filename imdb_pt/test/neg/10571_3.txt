This movie is funny if you are the gentleman who was sitting three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on the screen, and emitting a haaaa in all scenes involving a computer or mobile device) <br /> For all the others, it is a moody and confusing "comedy." The film strictly follows the formula of later "Scary Movie" films, as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans," though without the onslaught of inhuman references to pop culture that made the latter two so annoying. Still, the speculation of intellectual and peacemaking figures around the world makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy intelligence. "Superhero Movie" is particularly and consistently unpleasant for Stephen Hawking, portraying him as a hungry junkie for sex and using his disability as a vehicle for comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on "Spider-Man". with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" played just to make some physical comedy. Much of the film is clownish, but not invigorating or interesting. The longest joke is a fart joke, and at first the writers seem to believe that having the main character being played on ostentatious piles of fake animal poo automatically encourages an uninspired replay of the Spider-Man's " . Perhaps the only redeeming feature of this trait is the energy in it, notably absent in other recent parodies. Filmmakers act as if they are doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence on the way the actors jump on the screen. An extremely short duration (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the enthusiasm of the presentation makes "Superhero Movie" more tolerable than horrifying.
