I love B movies, but I like to be aware from the start that I'm watching one. I can not believe anyone can mess up a movie about aliens and such bad predators. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predators are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke with them. The creators did not take this movie seriously. I'm completely disappointed in how Strauss's idiots dealt with this movie. They mocked incredible characters. It's as if they were trying to be serious in the beginning, so their writers stood up and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were terrible and were NOT aliens or predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this film have shown no respect for the original films. They should not be able to make money from the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves
