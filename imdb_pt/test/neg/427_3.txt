An American werewolf in London had some funny parts, but this is not so good. The computer werewolves are simply horrible: the perspective is all out, it's like seeing them through a distorted mirror. Writers tread on the throat of many of their gags. American boy says to the Parisian girl, "Is there a cafe around here?" Instead of simply leaving him like this, they have to make the girl sigh and reply, "This is Paris."
