This is the third movie in a month that I watched that did not go the way I expected. The first two are The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland, none of which gave new insights about who committed the crimes. <br /> <br /> I've always had a fascination for UFOs and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of UFO research that it was not a comedy. But after 30 minutes, everything went very wrong. <br /> <br /> I could have represented the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if there was a good story about chasing UFOs, but none here. I'm not saying there was something wrong with the subject, but Netflix pushed this movie as a UFO skeptic and a UFO believer investigating various sitings. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching half way. I can not believe I wasted so much time on this one. Please do not make the same mistake I did.
