The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old western bustle. Too bad the Producers and Director / Writer, Michael Cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts about what the Johnson County war really was. Much of the war was about how public lands should be used for pasture. Ranchers did not want the poor shepherds on the land competing for fodder on this cold, wind-swept plateau. The whole epic makes no mention of sheep grazing, which was one of the most important reasons for the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the rent killers. Peasants are shown circling the snipers as a bunch of Indians would do in previous Hollywood films. The real fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a squad of 200-300 men, intercepted the gunmen and arrested them in a barn on the TA ranch. I doubt that any woman has participated in the siege. Ellen (Ella, also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged by a crowd of lynchers about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Producers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit it. The fact that the plot to make her a brothel lady only serves the interests of WSGA. <br /> <br /> I object to the use of real people's names in a plot that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. Why would Michael Cimino use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County War (and events that led to it) is beyond me. The film could have been much more interesting if it had lived on the political ramifications of Federal Government intervention in the affairs of a state government and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by Calvary. Some effort was made to sue the ranchers who were responsible for Johnson County's attorney. But since Johnson County could not afford the court costs and Wyoming Governor Amos W. Barber supported the WSGA, the charges were eventually dismissed. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the film was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of runtime on the DVD version.
