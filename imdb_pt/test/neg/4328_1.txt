Extremely boring ... I do not care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby sucks ... and do not go see it because I mentioned it, save it to Warhol's "Empire" , it's far more fun !! I've seen other hard films that were much better, so I'm puzzled because this is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I had to consider radical works by Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and in these artists I can still see artistic intent, up to quality, and a fun aspect in the interpretation of their art. As for "India Song" - not even soft porn - Anias Nin was almost here - sex slide show and a narration that does not relate to the slide show / movie ...... sheer crap and not even exaggerated. .. sadly just a hole and a waste of 2 hours. To add insult to injury, the impression I saw was faded and scratched to hell !!! (Harvard Film Archive), If I want to see "boring fun" I watch Bunuel !! Yes "India Song" - keep your head up until late modernism and be truly bored !! Watch a 70's porn movie with all the good parts cut and turn off the sound, you will have "India Song" but with better picture and none of the annoying songs or the shouts of the vice consul !!!.
