What a self-indulgent mess! Duncan Roy's film is apparently autobiographical, yet it is impossible to find any glimpse of emotional truth in this chaotic fiasco, misrepresented and woefully amateurish. <br /> <br /> In a way, you have to admire the balls of a man who through a grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a movie about his own rise and fall - of the abused working class boy to the English criminal lord. However, the tone is so self-pitying or so arched, that it is impossible to interact with characters or entanglements. The raw material is potentially a great thing, however Roy seems unable to tear out the kind of story that must grab by the throat, then lead him to tears. And it is a complete mystery why it was ever made to be displayed as a triptych of images - presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watch. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see so many good actors - Bill Nighy, Diana Quick, Lindsay Coulson - giving worse career performances.
