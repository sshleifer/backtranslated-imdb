Yes, I had the misfortune to watch this movie when I was younger at a friends' house, because his mother was a teacher and she wanted to see the movie and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that her parents could object to. Well, besides the bland jokes, I think that was pretty clear, as well as the bland jokes and the strange scene in which Ernest's gaze touches a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into prison thanks to an appearance and tries to escape and there are other things as if he was magnetized at one point, shooting electricity, and in a very painful way to watch final flight. There are a few jokes, but there is not much to mention except for the soap-etched weapon ... I think this is the only scene where me or my friend's mother laughed out loud. This and the camp are the only two Ernest movies I've ever seen and from what I've seen in them I'm not going to track down the other films. Ernest was good in small doses, but a movie is a lot, even when it's as short as this. I think the films made money mainly because all you need is Varney, a location, a theme and your movie.
