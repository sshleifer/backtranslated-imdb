Originally played as a sequel to the series "The Slumber Party Massacre," this movie falls flat on the floor with a new title. First, if you include the word "massacre" in your movie title, you better deliver. This certainly is not. There is no gore, no murder on the screen and no chainsaw, as box art would lead you to believe. Instead, we have an exaggerated plot of paper on a group of cheerleaders who get stuck in an abandoned hut on the way to a football game, only to be slaughtered one by one. Again, this movie might have been good if the blood quotient had increased slightly. Why directors, especially those who make direct movies for the video, are afraid to show ANY bleeding is beyond me. Now, I'm not a big fan of excessive gore, but come on ... why else would someone rent a movie called "Massacre Cheerleader ??" In addition to this problem, the film suffers from the low cost of a home video camera. It seems cheap, seems cheap and the actors are not that good. He tries to divert us to who the killer might be, but even that fails. The ending turns out to be a ridiculous mess. Guys, if you come across this movie, go away and find the original "Youth Party Massacre". 2 out of 10.
