Really, REALLY ... What appeals to the audience (American!) In this called show is totally beyond me. What we can learn from these series: 1. Each casino spends about 2 to 3 billion dollars a year to rent a satellite and a huge amount of high-resolution high-tech cameras for its team of security. Let the FBI bite their dust. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security employee should have voluptuous, naturally natural breasts. Breasts should be shown all the time, otherwise they will lose their jobs. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee is a man, he needs to put the implanted breasts and then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood is it possible to steal blatantly the ideas of other programs and then implement them as theirs and call all this crap "original" and "art." <br /> <br /> 5. All security with breasts larger than 39D is considered immortal and can not die. <br /> <br /> I would really like to have the opportunity to vote with negative values. -10/10 for this one!
