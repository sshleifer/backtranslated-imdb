Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. Love them. I get involved. The jobs. I want to get involved. I'm wasting time watching the thing. I watched the Emmy last night on TV. How in the infinite world has the TV movie Empire Falls (great name) been awarded? He really had a wonderful talent. Clear. And they tried admirably. But how can someone pretend that it was an OK script (TV, for God's sake)? Direction OK? You know, I wish you all the best. Same. But I thought it was totally mind-blowing that Hollywood was putting this movie really bad for so many honors. Awards? For me, it was kind of a warning that Hollywood is such a small island community. Being cynical is not really my thing. But wow --xptyngi
