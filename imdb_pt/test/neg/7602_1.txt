This movie was so bad and so cheap and so tacky, I found this movie to be one of the most boring movies of the early 80's I've ever seen. I like most of the cheap horror movies of the '80s, but I would never rent it again. It did not make the slightest sense. A family that lives in the woods invites their son, wife and daughter to spend time with them on holidays and during the film, for some reason the mother and daughter-in-law do not get along. We never figure out why until almost the end of the movie, but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of PES and the daughter-in-law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen. for unfortunate victims of this "thing" we have no idea what "it" looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling their approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of the voices of Darth Vadar and a soundtrack stolen from several horror movies. So when we finally figured out what and who it was all I did was laugh. This "assassin" turns out to be some kind of Japanese warrior alien of World War II that apparently came back to the life to claim the mother and its family. And all the mother does is stand in front of the living room, shaking with her hands on fire or something like a kind of convulsion. This movie is pathetic! Avoid, nor is it worth renting.
