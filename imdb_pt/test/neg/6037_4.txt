This good-by-bad-tyrant story set in 19th-century Russia may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves' career beyond the "Hercules" films. However, despite the different costumes, it is still a movie "Hercules" with the usual flickering dialogue, random dubbing and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there is a lot of action, the rhythm rarely signals, and Reeves begins to do one more of those scenes in which he is stripped to the waist, tied with ropes and given a vigorous whip which, needless to say, has little effect on his challenging character.
