After having endured this movie last night, I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the energy needed to the end. Throughout the film, I felt that I was watching the plot of the story that you get in a high budget porn movie. the acting was tough and tense, the camera work was terrible, and the locations and scenarios were so bad it looked like they had borrowed it from the local "Amateur Dramatic's Society" high school. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in their credits, plus it was pure dribble.
