Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you? The Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers, and yet they were murdered by a couple of college bums and a seventy-year-old lawman with a whip! But before you see this, however, you have to fight for over 40 minutes of pure boredom, childish play and despicable sequences that do not contain any real sleaze. If I still have not made myself completely clear: "The Dark Power" is an indescribably indecent and inept piece of horror from the crap of terror of the 80's that can still be fun because of its total and rather charming factor of stupidity. The intentions of writer / director Phil Smoot were obviously admirable, but he? as well as the rest of the cast and crew? it lacked the talent and financial means to deliver something half decent. Smoot watched closely "The Evil Dead" and other demonic-like movies, and somehow must have thought he could do that too. The film begins with an old Indian dying in his isolated house in the countryside; barely speaking his last word over a whisper? Toltecs. Her grandson immediately rents the house to a group of college girls, including a typically 80s aerobic girl, a cute black girl, and a brave racist girl. Soon they will discover why the old Indian lived exactly like a hermit, since he was actually the guardian of an old Toltec cemetery. The Toltec wizards buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And, honestly, is there meat that tastes better than bimbos? As previously suggested, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and sleep inducing. The clich√©d pranks, delayed dialogues and the ridiculously long Lash LaRue filming swinging around his whip seem to last forever. So the movie loses its last ounce of credibility when the Toltec wizards emerge from the ground. Instead of menacing, they seem to be hard rock stars drugged with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. Exactly a bloody moment is worth mentioning, when a guy's lips are stretched all over the skull, but overall even the carnage aspect of this movie is disappointing. The only worthwhile remote moments are totally meaningless, like when a 9-year-old (called Cletus!) Will play with his uncle's truck or when the vulgar naked girl takes a sip of beer in the tub after working out. Seriously, unless you get excited at the sight of a 1940s western veteran swinging around your whip at anything, I advise you to ignore this movie.
