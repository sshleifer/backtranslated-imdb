After a meteorite lands in "Boston" (somewhere in the Isle of Man), a horrible alien monster is released and is released at a local girl's school, causing clutter and turning students into zombie-like creatures. This movie is apparently a loose remake of the 1986 film of the same name as it features the same monster but a different storyline. Both films are terrible, but for the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable. That is not. Let's start with all the problems - the acting, especially the main teacher, was very, very bad. This movie is supposed to happen in Boston (we know this because the filmmakers had the ingenious idea of ​​putting "Boston police" or "Boston gas company" at all), but everyone seems to have rather confused British accents (at least I have not tried use Boston accents, thank God). The script is a big mess. The best example of how dumb writing is when it is established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of meteorite. Is that what our brave heroes do? No, they run around shooting zombie students. Nice. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the faint 1995 film "Grim," clearly does not know how to walk with his films. The movie is terribly annoying in some places. The lighting is awful. The movie looks cheap and bland. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of remarkable blood. 99% of the death scenes involve the creature emerging from a dark corner and dragging someone away while we hear that they are screams "horrified" in the distance. This convention has never worked well in the past and certainly does not work here. The visual effects were terrible. The CG opening sequence in space looked like it might have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake! The "explosion" of the gas tanks at the end was equally horrible. Ok, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit is due - the effects of the creatures were actually pretty cool. You have to love those close-ups of slippery teeth, drooling! <br /> <br /> To summarize the film, "Breeders" is a terrible and cheap horror film that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
