One of the most prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A woman in a red shirt falls in love with Khan (instead of falling dead - for a change) and then betrays Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a character trait nonexistent on the ship. It makes a wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye" when a red-collared male gets on the enemy's side just because he falls in love! The same as in SS. (However, in this episode the betrayal has a minuscule role in the overall plot.) This is too silly because it again makes Kirk's crew look like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress-imbeciles, who - once fallen in love by the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. The fact that McGivers returns to Kirk's side does not improve the illogical in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan behind a normal door when they know he has superior strength? This is one of several ST plot devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is of such superior intelligence, then one would expect him to be more astute with the way he behaves. And what about a Sikh being played with a Latin accent? Montalban should have received a vocal coach. I was kind of hoping to hear "the plaaain! The plaaaain!" in the background at any time. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship captain) provide unlimited use of the ship's library in relation to the Enterprise's most intimate technical details for ANYONE? Is Starfleet an institution made up of idiots? <br /> <br /> SS is a very caricature and silly episode so it's no wonder the Trekkies love it. It does not have many elements of science fiction, which is what the Trekkies most hate. He also thinks the ST franchise chose to revive this boring character for the second film, appealing to the Trekkies, who were very disappointed in the first movie that - you guessed it - had a lot of science fiction for the minuscule average. Trekkie Brain.
