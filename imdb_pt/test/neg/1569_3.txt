George & Mildred - The movie does not have the talent of its TV writer, John Mortimer, who ends the fourth quarter of George's class war with the Fourmiles alive. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut from the standard cloth - Hitman / Identity Error - and has as much tension as laughter. Producers should have picked up a Rising Damp sheet (also from 1980) that was also bought for the big screen after the TV series ended, and kept much of the story in a familiar setting. <br /> <br /> Yootha Joyce is dead. in 1980, but she should not be reminded of this heavy work, overwhelmed by her illness. Mildred does not have the sharpness of her incarnation on TV; cut apart and wilt seems largely directed to the lack of libido of Georges. George's disbelief is also lost in the more expansive sets. That does not mean they have much to shout at. The budget for this movie seems pathetically small; a restaurant wherever they go is clearly a semi-starched new house with some Christmas lights adorning the front door. <br /> <br /> For fans of the British comedy of the 70s or those who just want to revisit an old TV companion of their youth this movie can not add anything to the experience and they should stick with the first four TV series released now on DVD.
