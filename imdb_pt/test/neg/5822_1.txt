Terrible direction of a horrible script. Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus. Ridiculous accents across the map. Unlike most other commentators, I had no idea it was about boys in love with mud, but this fact became immediately obvious in the opening scene and in all the photos of nude or semi-naked young people, usually wet or shining with sweat , looking anxiously at each other.
