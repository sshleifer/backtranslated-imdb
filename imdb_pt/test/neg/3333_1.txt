A ridiculous movie, a terrible editing job, a bad script, a ridiculous performance, a story that is not understandable ... <br /> <br /> If God decides if the films should continue to be made, judging by this whole the world film industry would now be dead ... <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie to show that movies should not be made by people who "think" to be able to make movies. <br /> <br /> I'm still wondering who are those two gypsy girls who appear in the movie for over half an hour, and are never introduced to us ... <br /> <br />
