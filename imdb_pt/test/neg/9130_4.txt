What I expected (or even expected) was the well-known "stop motion" image and extremely slow movements, extreme zooms and all fish-eye shots. In short: The art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way that the human eye can not reproduce so that the human eye can see. The things that made Qatsi's other successes. <br /> <br /> I just wondered how the whole creation would fit into the title. <br /> <br /> Having watched the film, I have the feeling that the focus on this third part was in the message and not in the package. That's fine, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew the message and there seemed to be nothing left for me. More than half of the film was solarized or colored or posterized or transformed through some other filter. It looked a lot like the effects that your camcorder does but you never use it. Many of the images would have been more beautiful without the filters, like the giraffe and the zebra chase. You could say that "technology or any malicious source based on humans disfigured our beautiful nature," but why use these seventies effects to symbolize this? By the time there was more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap effect, I was ready to leave. The hope that the rest was not so bad made me stay. But then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives time to analyze the moving image. But if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then there is not enough movement to slow down. Please record the motion to be delayed faster, as was done with the beautiful photos of the sparkling water and splashing (some) of the laughing people and the music singers. I recognize that archive photos can not be redone, but I've seen many of these recordings anyway, it could have been done without them. It must have been a lot of work searching the archive images, and the effects may not have been so easy to apply and organize as well. In addition, much of the work was mixed with each other. This shows that the creator did not want to extend the film or spare it. But I did not like a little of the mixed stuff ... The idea behind it was sometimes cool or clever, but the implementation was insufficient. The computer generated images did not bother me so much, but outdated. The 'bits' transmitted along the circuits (in the first part of the film) seemed newer and were good. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was smaller. I had the pleasure of listening to a cello playing an important part in music. A little less vibrato at certain times would have been appropriate with Glass's music, but that's a matter of taste. Like all of the above, of course. I hope there is another story of Qatsi to tell shortly, where computer images will play a less significant role and this will inspire someone to get on the field again. <br /> <br />
