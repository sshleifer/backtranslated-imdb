Without redeeming features, this movie is garbage. Your jokes do not start to be funny. Humor for children is pathetic, and attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky dark to any miserable package. Sitting with my children only made me uncomfortable with what might come next. I could not enjoy the movie. Although my son for whom the DVD was purchased appreciated the fact that she owns a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing him again, unlike Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. receive frequent replay requests.
