I just saw Princess Raccoon at the Asian Film Festival in New York. The gentleman who presented the film congratulated the audience for its good taste. "You could be in Herbie: Fully Loaded," he said with a satisfied smile, "but instead you're here to watch Seijun Suzuki's Racoon Princess." The audience applauded and applauded. Well, let me tell you, I'd rather see Herbie: Fully Loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, a supposedly whimsical musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. It's so unfortunate that his disgrace really makes me dislike other Seijun Suzuki movies, which is a great feat. <br /> <br /> There is such a big stretch of things wrong with Princess Racoon that I hardly know where to start. Perhaps their worst defects are aggressively unintelligible and incomprehensibly monotonous. If the reels were mixed or if half of them were lost in transport, the audience would not know the difference. If you do not believe me, I dare you to steal a copy and have someone roll the reels in random order. If you can tell me which one goes where I'm going to give you every penny I have. <br /> <br /> The first third of the movie features a mix of scenes, songs (including a number of rap inducer), and images that do not seem to be related in any way. The incredibly integrated computer animation is put into the bargain, adding yet another brick to the immense and growing wall of incomprehensibility. It would not surprise me to know that the writer wrote any Japanese folklore that came to mind on a bunch of cards, stacked them, shuffled them, distributed the letters on a table, and wrote the script according to his order. <br /> <br /> About thirty-five minutes after the movie, comes the scene of a plot. Something about a raccoon princess who changes shape (in human form) and a normal human falling in love. I hoped this was a portent for the movie to be something different from a bewildering series of scenes, but it was not that lucky. The film continues in the same absolutely disconcerting way. I wish I had left then, but I was stuck in the middle of a narrow row. In retrospect, it would have been worth the strange scene. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted just thinking about the last two reels. I spent every moment waiting and praying that everything would end. Every great move of dolly, swell in the music, or scene that seemed remotely as if it were concluding things renewed my hopes that the credits were about to roll. For an agonizing minute after an agonizing minute, he continued. And so on. Finally, after dozens of fake alarms, I cut what I was sure should be an abstract pattern on which the credits were about to appear. Then, defying all reason, cut to another scene. How could I forget? The completely unrelated subplot regarding a ninja being captured, pissed and cooked in a soup had not yet been wrapped. <br /> <br /> I'll never get those 111 minutes back, but you can save yourself the pain. Unless you want to smear your memory or the future enjoyment of great Seijun Suzuki movies like Beast Couple and the Tokyo Drifter, do not see Princess Racoon. I'd rather spend my time vomiting.
