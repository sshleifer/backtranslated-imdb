Oh my. Poor Jane must have done the old thing rolling over the grave. Even allowing bad production values ​​for time (1971) and format (some kind of miniseries), that's baaaaaad. Whatever you do with Austen, the dialogue should shine (even in this, perhaps your most serious work), and the melodrama must be strictly off limits. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this production. By the time you reach Anna's "Frederick, Frederick, Frederick", you will be laughing or crying. Unless you're just "visually" collecting all the movies from Austen's work, you can skip this one. If you watch, however, there are little consolations: the actresses who play Anne's sisters do a wonderful job with their roles.
