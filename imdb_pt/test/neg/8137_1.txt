Barbara Payton is the supposedly sexy young and sexy Chickie woman of the old owner of a plantation somewhere in jungley at a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his work shirt with the upstairs button undone like the sturdy plantation foreman Mrs. Payton wants to blow up. There's another girl, some sort of peasant slave girl with whom Burr used to play, but he gave her the old idiot so that the obligatory old doo-doo bitch was casting a good spell to cast on him and Payton the bum. I watched it only halfway because it's really horrible so I could not even see the star of the show - which I think is a gorilla that the hag flight-doo turned into someone or whatever ... Who cares . I give this half a star of ten possible. It's neither exaggerated, just too bad.
