The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and terrifying story. Ed was really a confused character and his legacy came to inspire such great names as The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How, then, did such a fascinating man inspire such a melodramatic play? Ed Gein made belts with nipples, bowls with skulls, lamps without skin, danced under the moon in suits of human skin. None of this got into the movie because they needed to tell us a fictional story of a ridiculously horrible deputy and his rather homely and sex-hungry girlfriend. This movie seemed to get out of the way to fake the story. What puzzles me is that most movies deviate from the path of truth to exaggerate the story; this seems to do this to minimize it. I just do not understand.
