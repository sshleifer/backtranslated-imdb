So lame is not even funny. A zombie infection beats a small university campus and a squad of government secret agents supports some scientists sent to find out the source of the outbreak. Collecting zombie DNA is certainly not easy. Once bitten, you're one of them. The whole university was completely infected by the undead. <br /> <br /> This sequel does not even rescue the terrible CASA DOS MORTOS (2003). Noise is accomplished though. Some glimpses of female nudity added to a bunch of gore and exploding heads should keep any zombie aberration happy. Cast: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The word "F" unites a little imaginative script.
