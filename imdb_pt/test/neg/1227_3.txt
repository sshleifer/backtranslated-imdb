I rarely feel motivated to write a review, unless it is inspired by the quality of the film. In the case of Comanche Moon I was so uninspired that I felt the need to alert others about how bad this TV miniseries is. Here are some thoughts. <br /> <br /> The Indians: They came across as if they were on a Saturday Night Live Skit, making fun of how the Indians talk. When McMurtry writes the dialogue in his novels, this is very interesting; I do not know how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: Sounds like Festus from the old Gunsmoke series. Acting is OK and Robert Duvall's McCrae mannerisms are right, but the look is pure comedy hunter. <br /> Clara: Maybe you could use some dirt or sweat on your next time. Been to Austin in the summer before air conditioning? I promise you that women do not look like that. Do you think they've never seen any episodes of Dearwood? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Again, whenever they are in the Governor's office, it looks like a Saturday Night Live Skit, and the skit is bombing. <br /> <br /> Call of Woodrow: The Call is the most reasonable character, of course He talks so little how can you ruin it? But hey, and that hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and include the fact that it is not at all scary at all. They should have gotten Javier Bardem to play the part. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: From "The Brother, Where Art Thou" I expected George Cloony to ride and they would break a song. Maybe I'm premature because the miniseries is not complete, but I doubt I'll watch anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate Lonesome Dove's mesmerizing feel, but I see this and it seems like they have no idea for the old west at all.
