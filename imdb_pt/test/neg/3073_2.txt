Some movies are so poorly done that they are purely watched by the cringe factor. The disciples made me shudder so much that it was uncomfortable. I watched everything unbelievable from what I was watching, did anyone know how bad this was while they were filming? Mix the most striking performances of the most wooden actors, an abysmal script was every comment of all the 'actors' sounded as if it came from the same character and the most rushed edition that tried (and failed in bigtime) give the film a forced rhythm. All this combined into a movie that will rob you a few hours of your life and will not give anything in return. Avoid EVERY cost.
