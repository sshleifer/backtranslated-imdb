This movie is highly unlikely. Read the other reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they did not even do well in that little luxury; they just act like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to have real surfers for the surfing contest papers, so sucks if they can act. At least Occy did not give a shit and went with him. But "Lance" ??? Fuhgeddaboutit. <br /> <br /> The only character he touched was portrayed by Gerry Lopez, who did not really act, he was very handsome. He is quite accustomed to trampling people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because I was putting a newsletter on my laptop when it arrived on some cable channel late at night. It saved me from having to pay full attention to this little waste of time. No way would I go out of my way to watch.
