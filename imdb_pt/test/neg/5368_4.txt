The atmosphere in this show is great. There is plenty of excellent buildup, but that's where the show fails. There is much to build for nothing. You will constantly see a scary setup that makes it look like something really weird is coming from the corner and then ... nothing. Again and again nothing. You hear lots of stories of people talking about strange events, but you do not see any. They appear in the doors of these people, talk about their deep and emotional past, assemble lame equipment and find nothing! There is nothing in this show that leads me to believe in something paranormal. I laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" that we, as a public, have not seen. They get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put into a small package. A show that looked so weird and had such potential that leads to one thing ... Nothing!
