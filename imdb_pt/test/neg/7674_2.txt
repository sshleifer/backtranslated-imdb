This is what happens when a franchise gets lazy, and no one can think of a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were interpreted as horror films, with genuine (although predictable) scares that remained true to the theme of the film. So they ended up with people for the chase doll, and they decided to play to laugh, with the next two being black comedies ..... Well, that's what happened here, but I think it was not meant to be. Like saying, "I wanted to make dessert pancakes! I did it on purpose!" when his soufflé accidentally fails. But the milk was shed, and had some value in the theaters as a joke. <br /> <br /> When the ground was plucked under the passenger seats, I expected the passengers to stretch their legs through the hole. , start running the Flintstones-Style, to safely land the plane in the Alps. I made. That would fit into the foolish theme of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of pointing out the film's obvious physical impossibilities, and social implausibilities? As if George Kennedy's character reacted calmly to the news that his date was a prostitute? Even in 1979, a man would not readily accept the idea that he had just poured his heart into a paid companion. He supposedly felt that he made a connection with a kindred spirit, who is subsequently shown to be a mercenary sex worker with a turning line. Who would not feel cheated by experience? And yet he laughs and wraps his arms around his friend's waist as they walk happily. What a cheap wrapping of a scumbag scene. There. <br /> <br /> I had an appetite for soufflé and received insipid cliché pancakes. And no, you did not do it on purpose!
