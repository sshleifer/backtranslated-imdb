Naach is part of a lethally monotonous venture, Naach is about that dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali) who considers herself a sort of author, in addition to the small commercial engagements that the people around her, including her beau actor (Abhishek Bachchan) build their careers in . Good idea, only she has the most malicious concepts about costumes and dance moves, things rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap South Indian steelmakers shrink with shame. <br /> <br /> The story follows a predictable pattern that induces yawning ... dancer and boyfriend meet and have a case (yes, sex included) ... the boyfriend succeeds, but she rejects his attempts to help her ... the boyfriend throws attitude and they walk one on the other ... dancer meets an unlikely director who wants her to 'do what she wants' ... incongruous effort bags even more incongruous ... Beau's attempts to arrive are rejected until a climax where he explodes on how he can not live without her ... D-uh final. <br /> <br /> In fact, I really did not expect this movie to be very good. So, why did I watch? Because I have an Antara Mali fetish. She is an actress with enough IMO talent to reach great heights as long as she has the opportunity. Unfortunately, his role in the film looks much better in the role than in the actual, ironic execution for a movie that should be about an uncompromising character. To give credit to her, she makes a gaming effort, shining in the few scenes that really make her an actress. I just wanted the movie to have been more worthy of it. Abhishek Bachchan also does some good punches, the last scene recovered a bit by a twist that pleasantly reminds his father. <br /> <br /> Recommended only if you can sit through huge piles of dogcrap for the return of a few grains of good times courtesy of the leading actors.
