When the Legends Die is a powerful and moving story of an Indian ute orphan who becomes Tom Black Bull, a bronze champion pilot. Created in the old habits, Tom receives the name of a white man and needs to adopt the language and manners of the white man to live in this world. Bitter about the role he was forced into, Tom finds accomplishment by doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, at the rodeo. The film has Richard Widmark in the role of Red, the man who befriends Tom and acts as his manager. Red is a drunk who ends up dying in the story, which is where the movie ends. The real story is completely ignored, the dark side of Tom Black Bull, who develops a reputation as a killer in the rodeo arena. Well, you should read the book, this movie does not come close to doing justice to the story.
