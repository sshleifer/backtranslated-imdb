Not bad performances. Whoopi plays the wise / hot role very well. Still, the plot and situations can not be believed (forced PC stereotypes). Sometimes they are good Jews and blacks against bad white Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The movie has its moments, but it is not one I recommend going out of your way to see.
