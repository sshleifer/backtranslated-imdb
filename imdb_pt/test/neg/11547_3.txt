This movie really gets very interesting, but to my taste, it has degenerated too fast into a dull and predictable melodrama. None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard TV movies, so there's really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they're as fans of Jeff Bridges as I think. <br /> <bridges bridges Mike Olson, a young man announcing at a family picnic that he is leaving college to go on the road. His parents believe he is "just pretending" and talk about "he has no plans". He guarantees that he has a plan and needs to discover his true self and his place in the world. So much so that he actually invites them to go on the road with him and buy an old bus to travel, that he and his dad fix the true father-son bonding fashion. Up until that point in the movie, I was a bit interested in the plot and the characters and wanted to see how his mother (Vera Miles) would react to life on the road. There's a funny scene at the beginning, where the father and son need to convince her to make the trip with them. They show you the interior of the bus and it gradually becomes more and more interested, finally departing in a huff with some sort of talk about curtains versus curtains in the windows. Bridges marvels at her father (Carl Betz, equipped with the voice of the radio announcer) that she changed her mind. Dad guarantees him "electric oven ... works every time!". <br /> <br /> But the movie goes down as soon as they hit the road. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some of his "friends" who end up becoming random people they meet at a hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a bit disappointed ... particularly when it became obvious that the rest of the film would happen at the festival camp and not on the road. But at least I thought there might be a decent band like, well, if they could not afford Hendrix or the Stones maybe they would have at least Canned Heat or Little Feat or something. No data - apparently the only song at this festival is a horrible choral group with orchestra that sounds like a poor imitation of Fifth Dimension, along with an annoying announcer who should be humorous. <br /> <br /> They are also presented at a set of hippie festivals and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a pretty blonde girl with existentialism and nature in mind who falls in love with Mike before revealing the fact that she needs kidney dialysis to live and ran away to the festival to die. And two other campers are determined to have a baby in their rustic tent, introducing the struggle between modern medicine and hippie ignorance (or something like that). In spite of everything, the longer it lasts, the more painful the film becomes for anyone who expects some element of surprise or real drama. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is a waste of time, although it's probably fun whoever it is. is actually the time period in the late 60's, early 70's and the films of the time. I would be so happy if I never see it again.
