This movie is a waste of time. I hope an action movie has more than 2 blasts and some shooting scenes. Van Damme's acting is horrible. He's never been much of an actor, but here he's worse. It was definitely better in his previous films. Your part of the screenplay for the entire movie was probably no more than a page of mindless stupid nonsense. All the dialogue in the movie is a disaster, just like the plot. The title "The Shepherd" does not make sense. Why do not they call it "border patrol"? The fight scenes might have been better, but they could not afford it, or the fight choreographer was suffering from a lack of ideas. This is a cheap kind of action movie.
