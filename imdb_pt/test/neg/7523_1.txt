It's a time machine, that's fine. It runs in "real-time" for 96 minutes but looked like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were totally superfluous. Massive amounts of "dead" time everywhere. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently, the film was done on a tight budget, I noticed for its edification the following: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money, reusing the scenarios and costumes from the Lord of the Rings, huh? The "scary guy" in charge of controlling the Morlochs ... The scariest thing these guys could think of was someone wearing one of Gene Simmons: (from the band Kiss) old costumes ??? Little known fact: the crazy ones of the future have well-groomed nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Go through this one.
