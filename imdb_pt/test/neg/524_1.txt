Among the many compliments here for this production, there was an individual whose comments asked if he / she was the only one (who was not so fascinated by it) - that is, giving this movie 3 stars. However, the commentary came to indicate a general appreciation of the story and another production of it. Well, that person is not the "one", who did not like this production (include me!), But then I separate the company even with it. If you put a gun in my head and ask me to make a choice between you filming me or watching that movie again, I certainly watched - but I would probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I would much rather be locked in solitary, or having to watch paint dry on a wall, however. Also, I would not want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like the "brown pair of comedian George Gobel when the rest of the world is a tuxedo," and that's one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, "Long Hot Summer," and although she was not a big fan of the show, she liked Murder, She Wrote. But HERE - I not only did not care about the story or other aspects, but I found Angela screaming, screaming, singing, and everything else about her exaggerated performance, perhaps the most IRRITANT presence in any movie (or presentation on any other media) which I have already experienced. It was like an endless continuation of Rex Harrison's cockney cockney, also Audrey Hepburn's "over-the-top" - in the first few portions of "My Fair Lady." But this was incident to the plot, presented by light, comic effect and (fortunately) brief. Without mercy, that was all but less brief, and to me it seemed that it had happened for about 10 hours (Einstein's lay explanation of "relativity" at work). If I had not been with friends, with the need to stay, My vision would have been brief. I laughed, in the episode of "Seinfeld," in which Elaine annoys everyone because she tells them how much she did not like "The English Patient." My friends somehow considered me the same way when I interrupted their epilation in ecstasy about this movie. Give me some nails crawling high on a chalkboard at any time.
