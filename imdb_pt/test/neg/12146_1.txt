This is a joke, right? Can not this be a real movie? Is not that a real video? Give any child at Harvey Milk High School a video camera and they could make a movie better than that. The filmmaker can not be serious ... right? Is that satire? Comedy? Was drama terribly wrong? The script is as sincere and monotonous as it is conceivable. Ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could create a better script. Dialogue is not cliche. Clich√© dialogue can elevate this holiday mess to something like the fun of the camp - but that does not happen and it's not. Worst of the Worst - a landlady enters a dramatic scene in a private apartment wearing a bathrobe carrying a frying pan as something out of an episode of "Honeymoon". Whaaa ??? I have seen better acting in high school theater clubs. One of the leads is attractive, the other is not. Both can not even get a convincing kiss. So much for romance. Support players are jaw-dropping. <br /> <br /> Everything is underlined by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back bathroom. Most of the dialogue is (mercifully) unintelligible. <br /> <br /> This obsolete cinematic fruit cake is not even worthy of being the next ROCKY HORROR or a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 gay holiday party. It's just plain bad. In all senses. SUGAR VISIONS will not dance in your head - they will trample all your expectations. Have a eggnog and look distractedly at the lights of the neighbor's holiday - it will be a better time spent.
