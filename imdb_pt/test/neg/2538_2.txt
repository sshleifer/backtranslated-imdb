Anyone who pays to watch Troma movies knows and appreciates what they will get. Having said that, I did not think it was possible to make such a bad movie and still be convincing. I found myself watching just to see how much worse it could be before the end. First, it is an Indonesian action movie with an American main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of Christopher Lloyd and Rambo of "Taxi". He puts up posters of himself dressed as Sly's "Cobra" all over the place and even has a customized shooting range (with action clips from his biggest enemies) in Jakarta, even though he's in the CIA and has just arrived days before . There is a lot of action involving firearms (no muzzle flashes on those M-16s, just sound effects), motorcycles (that break walls), karate (where no one makes physical contact) and even sex (where all actors are ugly). The main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. It involves the most dangerous drug cartel in the world, going in search of a "drug-detecting device." Why would they need that? This is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? It does not make sense, but it's taken seriously. Actors should be praised because they really seemed to think this movie would make them famous and would strive to "act." Better line? "Now dance to your grave your naughty bitch!" Best scene? Rambo jumps on the flying helicopter, pulls the machine gun out of the villain's hand, come on, falls, shoots the helicopter while it's falling, explodes a helicopter, cuts on the dummy thrown in the water. F ** king genius! If you can not enjoy the trash, do not watch. If you can, it's incredible. One last thing, did I mention that it was run by the three Punjabi brothers?
