You know, as you get older, you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger may have been because of your youth and inexperience. For example, when I saw The Godfather at 14, I found it boring. 20 years later, it's an incredible movie for me. In other words, I grew up and started to enjoy great movies. <br /> <br /> So I rented Dirty Dancing with my girlfriend last night at her request, as she loved it at age 14 and I hated it at the same time. it was. But I expected, because I was young and stupid at age 14, maybe that would be a new experience for me. So I sat with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened. <br /> <br /> Well, the night after watching Dirty Dancing, I feel a rape. I feel like someone has come into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from attending this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Patrick Swayze plays a 20-year-old but looks like he's 35. And the premise of the movie is he seduces some underage teens by wooing her with their dance moves . Really scary. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is the clich√© plot where the guy "wrong side of the tracks" and the "smart and rich girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. Of course, her novel is fueled by the fact that the "rich girl" can not dance a lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become a specialist dancer for the grand finale of the holiday show, or something like that <br /> <br /> But you guessed it: the disapproving parent soon walks in and forbids the two to see each other, and the movie moves on to secret dance and love class meetings. This all culminates in the final scene, where the entire resort gathers around the two young lovers, while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35-year-old dancer as the new man of his teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> Even my girlfriend whimpered in the end. of the film as she admitted that it was nothing like she remembered. I did not press her, but I smiled a bit and put the godfather part II in the DVD player.
