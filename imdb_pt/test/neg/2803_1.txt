Rent this movie only if you're in the mood to laugh (out of sheer stupidity), as this movie would not scare a lot of kindergartners into a Halloween party! The problem is that there is too much blood for children, so definitely do not put this on your VCR for kids. It starts with a bit of promise, giving the impression that the cover artist may have started watching this film before drawing the cover, but then descends quickly to epic stupidity. The "murderous scarecrows" are awkward that are as scary as the Wizard of Oz, but not so smart. If they only had a brain ...? I have this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / closure store, and even then, I feel a little cheated. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you really pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.
