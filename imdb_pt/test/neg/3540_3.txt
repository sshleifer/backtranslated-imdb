I really was disappointed by this movie that I had high hopes. He seems to have been in a hurry to take advantage of the hit crazy comedies at the time (including MGM's own "Libeled Lady" featuring two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years after the pairing, they were still enticing to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but a weak script and a hasty premise destroyed any chance of being a major continuation of the previous year's "Libeled Lady" and the two "Thin ". "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing store maker, Myrna Loy, who intends to dominate the life of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beal) and his own servants (who include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon) .When independent William Powell comes into his life, having distracted Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy finds his match. interesting premise is short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so one-dimensional that it's hard to like her let alone see Powell fall in love with her, which we know will soon happen. It's yet another attempt to put a her place by changing her views on her what kind of life she has led, something that Hollywood did many times during her golden age.When Loy says she does not have time to take care of her business and have a man in her life It's a moan. Happy Mind, besides Powell, there's Jessie Ralph on board. A rich and salty older woman who helped Loy start her business, she knows Powell and can immediately see Loy's allegations that she loathes him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and the whole premise of Powell getting between them is nonsense. So an ex-wife of Powell's appears, which is not really necessary at that end of the story, and the final scene of the wedding (where a crowd of people tries to get into Powell's little trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce . (It's funny, though, that Powell is hit by items that Loy used to hit Edgar Kennedy.) These are welcome laughter, as they are few.) Powell and Loy would do better in two later comedies: "I Love You Again "and" Love Crazy, "which are sophisticated, witty and fun. This movie tries to be all three, but ends up being a sophisticated tedium.
