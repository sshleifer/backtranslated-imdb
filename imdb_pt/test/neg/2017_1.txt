This may very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew it was a B movie before I watched it (actually was the reason to watch it), but I never thought it could be that bad. The title promises Dracula in space and does deliver, however, the story does not make real use of the fact that the character of Casper van Dien is a descendant of Van Helsing. And watch out for the end of the movie, it comes fast. I've never seen an end shout "And now we're over budget!" in a clearer way. His resolution of the film was rather comical, but the story had obviously turned into a chant. If you think you need to watch it, watch a friend who shares your love for B movies. If it did not, it would not have come to an end.
