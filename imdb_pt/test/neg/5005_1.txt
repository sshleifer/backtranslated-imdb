Ugh Yeah, it's exactly like the McMartin mess or the horrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother continues to aggressively question her son, repeatedly, until he finally tells her what she obviously wants to hear. Court investigators and "therapists" repeat the pattern. The questioning itself is sexually frightening, a repeatedly ruthless attack in its own way. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers present a doctor talking about physical evidence of abuse, perhaps to justify the point of view of the film: Four-year-olds never do "stuff like that." Well, they'll do if all the adults they know ask them. The way this piece endorses such discredited interrogation techniques makes watching it a frustrating exercise for anyone who knows what it takes to get a successful process in real life. <br /> <br /> (They also added a special arrest incident at the end to "prove" their case - no parallel to this fictional incident occurred in real life.I can not say more here without turning it into a spoiler, but you'll know when to come.) <br /> <br /> Yes, children are abused, sometimes by paid caregivers. But watch a movie that claims ridiculous and hysterical accusations against so many totally innocent people, watch re-enactments of the trials that ruined the lives of countless children, as well as the lives of the accused - I do not think I lasted to the end. It is very sad, and even more so by the apparent endorsement of the writers' team to the abusive, paranoid and obsessive questioning techniques that have begun - how can we call it? The fire of the healings? <br /> <br /> No one I know has ever been accused of child abuse, thank God, but my 12-times grandmother was accused of witchcraft and killed by her. Crowds filled with what they think is holy wrath are as dangerous now as three hundred years ago. Sensational drivel like this - "These accusations of satanic abuse are springing up all over the country, there must be something there!" "Then tell the jury that!" - only eggs. <br /> <br /> And who thought it was a good idea to have children under the age of ten, some under the age of five, play those roles? It is traumatic to see them delivering their speeches; How much more traumatic was it to act with these parts? The filmmakers' commitment to combat child abuse apparently does not apply to themselves. And what were the parents of children's actors THINKING? "Melinda" (uncredited, at least in the A & E Network version in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were great. Professional or not, however, were too young to be exposed to this material, much less to be paid to represent it. Despite ruthlessly exploiting these real-life children, "You Know the Muffin Man" received an Emmy nomination for directing-which serves to show how things went insane in 1989.
