This is the movie that practically sounded like the author's death sentence in Hollywood. With over 40 million dollars, Heaven's Gate is so poorly designed and executed that it would take a lifetime to break all areas of failure. What irritates me the most is that, technically, it is very bad, an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it. John Hurt's graduation speech at Harvard is inaudible, as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people seem to think that Cimino intended this as a "style." He did not do that. It's just a bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well-designed except for the four or five tracks; in the climactic battle scene, it's hard to tell who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. Even at this level, it is impossible to enjoy the film. The cast of Isabelle Huppert as the lady of the town is a joke, her French accent makes the whole character a fraud. The acting is usually rigid, without any range or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. The character of John Hurt is the only one with any arrogance or vitality (although Hurt, in his 40s, playing a recent Harvard graduate with bags under his eyes, is patently ridiculous). <br /> <br /> I think saying that it's overlong is an exaggeration. The sequence of skates could have been easily cut, the cockfight scene is quickly becoming a movie clich√©, and the final scene aboard the transatlantic is to the right of the Twilight Zone. Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just saw would be the perfect ending. In fact, these scenes in themselves are not bad, but Cimino has not earned the right to include them, because what he has given us as "flesh" of the image is so incompetently bad. The editing is poor, especially at the climax of the great battle. At one point, the same explosion with the same flying cartwright flying from the blast is used three different times. I wish I could say something - anything - cool about this movie: a great scene, a great performance, even a memorable line of dialogue, but I can not. It's all just a big unholy mess. About the only thing I liked was the cinematography and the local Montana, which are impressive. Even Cimino could not ruin everything. This is a long, boring and bad movie for all standards. And the people who say they are only hit because of the surplus costs are fooling themselves. 1/2 * of 4
