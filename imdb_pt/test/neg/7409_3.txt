This is the premiere of Jonas Quastel as director and, to be honest, it shows. It seems that he played every kind of camera trick he learned in film school to try to add some style to a poorly written script, he helped write! Film has Lance Henriksen and a group of others looking for the Pacific Northwest by a plane that crashed that her daughter was on and also a special machine built his company and he also wants to recover. The first 5 minutes of the movie are blurry or shaky or out of focus! Quastel attempts to capture "Blair Witch" mode with this type of shots and they become tiring very quickly. And there are also POV shots that are certain of "Wolfen" and "Predator." These photos are from the point of view (POV) of Sasquatch. The edit is very unstable at times as a scene seems to change right in the middle. I heard that this film was shot in about 12 days and I suppose that instead of "Get back to one," they just started again without stopping and edited the scene together. And the rest of the movie is fade-outs from one scene to another. There are so many scenes that disappear that I lost count. Now the nude scene with Andrea Roth. It's not her. You can easily see your double body. And you know you're watching a movie "B" bad when, in the middle of the Pacific Northwest, a hot decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathing! ******** ******** SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> And the Sasquatch itself is not bad when you do not really see it and it's just a blurry image behind some trees or shrubs, but when you finally see it in the end, of course you are disappointed. First of all, it's not that loud. The actor who is playing Sasquatch is only hairy on certain points of his body. It's a partial suit! And he's bald! I heard that a makeup person died during filming and maybe that explains why the costumes seem to be in a hurry. Some of the sound effects that come from the Sasquatch are nothing more than the familiar lion's roar that we have all heard in other films. I have to admit that Henriksen is not bad. Yes, he's working with bad stuff, but he has one of those cool faces that can actually enhance certain moments in the movie. People keep saying that a good Bigfoot movie was never made, but I disagree. I always said "The Creature From Black Lake" is a good movie and I highly recommend it. I'm a sucker for a Sasquatch movie, but this one is just for amateurs.
