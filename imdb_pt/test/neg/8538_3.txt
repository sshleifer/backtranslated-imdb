First of all, the editing of this movie consisted of a major flaw that I do not understand how it was lost - you always see the aerial microphones coming in and out of the movie. The first time I saw him, he just said "well, mistakes happen" and erased. After the tenth time, it started to get incredibly annoying and distractingly funny. If you have not seen the movie yet, try to count how many times you see the microphone; can make a very interesting game. <br /> <br /> Now, about the movie. This movie started with the ingredients of a very solid "ghost" story; however, the turnaround in the end eventually ruined it completely. You start watching the movie under the assumption, alluded to by TV commercials, that the haunted house consists of ghosts that can only be seen by children; particularly small children, which makes it even more strange as it will not be able to effectively alert the family of the imminent danger. The opening scene did a good job of fooling the public that this would remain the premise of the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The movie begins with the family being chased and finally killed by an "invisible" force at home. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter at the beginning of the movie asks her little brother to tell her where she is "before" she "catches" her and drags her screaming in the basement. . The boy also witnesses this supposed "invisible force" killing his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. After his family is dead, the boy tries to escape and hide only to be taken away. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie began with the ingredients of a very scary movie in which the family would be pursued by an "invisible force" with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a child of two years old. This began to be ruined less than half of the film, when the daughter began to see the ghosts too; completely ruining the illusion that "children can only see" established by the commercials and the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Regardless, the film was not really "ruined" until the plot twist in the end. In that the man who helped the family to farm the farm turned out to be the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man grabs and tries to kill his mother, daughter and son while suffering a psychotic collapse in which he believes they are his family; which he killed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The whole turnaround in the end just created a complete list of unresolved issues and left me going to wtf. First, why were the souls of the family locked up in a house? If the director was going for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach in which the family, after dying in a fit of rage, would haunt the house and kill anyone who came in, why the haunting stopped after the father was "captured" for the ghosts of your family? If the ghosts only wanted to kill the man who killed them, why were they attacking the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the time you sow the seeds until the plants bloom completely at harvest time. It tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man that the ghosts apparently resented the whole movie, had been living on the estate for months. All this time, why the ghosts did not kill him? <br /> <br /> This film included many clich√©s of "horror films" as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror films. However, I'm telling you, this movie could still have gone well if it were not for the turnaround in the end. It's as if they've finished their budget and just put something together for an end. For this film to have been a success, they should have been left with the premise that "the children can only see" them and ended up with the family barely retreating or being killed as the family at the beginning (would have opened the door to possible sequel also).
