Screenwriter Steve Tesich's second work (following the wildly out-of-control BREAKING AWAY) is a compendium of clich√©s, coincidences and austere melodrama. Perhaps he has lived some of it; if so, I am sorry to say that he was inexplicably unable to dramatize anything convincingly. <br /> <br /> To be fair, he did not help much here by Arthur Penn, a talented director who did a remarkable job in the past. (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE GREAT MAN), but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into Tesich's narrative. <br /> <br /> The cast tries its best, but it is overloaded with weak motivations and dialogues. The sympathies should be reserved especially for Craig Wasson, whose melancholy performance foreshadows the rapid demise of his starring career, as well as the embarrassingly unleashed Jodi Thelen, considered the film's unlikely femme fatale. <br /> <br /> Everything seems longer than it is, and any points made are heavy and obvious. See Arthur Penn's previous on the 60s theme, the droll and elegiac ALICE'S RESTAURANT; that's all this is not.
