I respect Mike Hodges, and I enjoyed getting Carter immensely for his gloomy outlook, but The Croupier looks like a particularly annoying ITV drama. <br /> <br /> Cold and reserved acting is not just the reserve of the main character. , it has spread to the entire cast, which means there is nothing to contrast Owen's character. <br /> <br /> Neither character evokes any kind of feeling except boredom. The end of the movie is also messy, at best. <br /> <br /> Camera work etc is pretty good, but if you want to see Hodges better watch Get Carter, do not bother with this uninteresting, uninteresting trawl through emotions he covered better 20+ years ago
