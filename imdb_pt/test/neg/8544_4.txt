An expedition consisting of constantly quarreling and unpleasant brigadistas trekks through the dangerous African jungle in search of a fortune in diamonds and a missing young woman named Diana (the luxurious brunette Katja Biernet, wearing only a thong that shows a lot of her body well turned and hot) who is worshiped as a goddess by a primitive mortal tribe called Mabutos. Director / writer Jess Franco fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and sinuous procedures, allowing the slow rhythm to crawl into a clip often agonizingly slow and staging infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and coolness. The awful dubbing, the excessive amount of photographic material resembling that of "National Geographic," groovy, jazzy lounge score, terrible acting, talky, uncomplicated narrative, tepid sex scenes and still photography do not help at all. . Fortunately, there is an abundance of free nudity available to relieve boredom to a reasonable degree: in addition to the delightful Biernert, Aline Mess as the fierce and venerated priestess Noba and Mari Carmen Nieto as the conniving and treacherous Lita are also really eye-catching. The beautiful jungle scenery is very nice, too. But in general, this image is so barely visible and therefore instantly forgotten.
