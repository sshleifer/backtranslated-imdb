Bled begins when the young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham) and they end up back in his studio where he gives him the bark of some kind of tree that is used as a hallucinogenic drug . when melted. Sai quickly becomes addicted when taken to an alternative fantasy reality involving vampiric creatures. Sai's friend Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic) worries about her as she distances herself from reality when she becomes addicted to drugs, can Royce kick the drug or end up ruining her life and why did the mysterious Renfield vitiate her? to the material first and make the fantasy dream elaborated as travels have any meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson this anemic artistic vampire movie is practically 95 minutes of boredom and is throughly deserving of all the bad reviews. The script was written by the interesting Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell did you even pronounce it?), Who is also credited as a production designer and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that happens in Bled, I would say. that the creators set out to make a very serious fantasy-based horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and drug rape at its core. Most of the film is spent on the drug issue with Sai's initial introduction to the drug, how great it was the first time and how she became hopelessly addicted that eventually destroys her, her life and her friends' lives. It's never explained where she's taking this drug, since Renfield only gives her a little while during the initial meeting, but hey, who cares? The first twenty odd minutes of Bled are really boring and boring, the next hour is not much better before a final ten-minute mess involving a vampire monster and Renfield making a comeback. The moral elements are paternalistic, the elements of fantasy seem a belated reflection and the horror does not exist. There is also dialogue that is horrible, every sentence tries to be deep, has a lot of hidden depth and just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes tiring to hear. <br /> <br /> The concept of the movie is terrible and so is the execution as there is absolutely no gore or violence to speak and the whole thing is set inside an apartment that does not seem to have lights. The fantasy scene looks a bit better, but it's barely seen and underused. There are no fuss here, no atmosphere and to make matters even worse the manufacturers decided to use very faded soft colors that I hate and find annoying, what's wrong with a beautiful color image? It seems to me to be a fad with current filmmakers who seem to think that this automatically makes a movie cool or adds an atmosphere that it certainly does not do, most of the time just makes their movie look monotonous and monotonous as evidenced here with Bled. <br /> <br /> This probably had a low budget and was filmed in Los Angeles and has reasonable production figures, but it's all so annoying. The performance did not impress me, I did not care about anyone, which is never a good sign. <br /> <br /> Bled is a terrible vampire movie that goes to psychological and physical horror with all sorts. parallels with real life dug addiction and what it can do with little or no effect because the whole thing is so monotonous. There might be an audience for a movie like this, but considering the other not-so-great reviews.
