I'll give you the following: I did not stop watching, and it's not corporate, which is cool. But my inner critic cut it all to pieces - I suppose I see a lot of movies. Wood script, the slang simply comes out of their mouths without any kind of flow. Editing, mentioned before, is hit and miss; sometimes evokes a good sense of ghetto, but especially its irritating angles, peculiar and really dull. The actors were marginal, although Letisha had her moments. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the public should care about Curtis, he's a complete cheater and the actor is totally blank and not particularly funny or captivating. The direction does not help you to love it or even hate it; I just wanted him to shut up and get shot already. I did not care about his impotent revenge when that happened. The completely predictable end is not credible at all. I do not know why we should believe that some of his former successful drug dealers are stupid enough to fall in love with his little punches. "Oh, you just got out of jail and you're on parole? Here are a thousand dollars in cocaine, run around the corner for me, now do not steal from me, etc." <br /> <br /> A good sex scene at first gave me hope but was disappointed in the end. The handling of a rape scene was slightly disconcerting, yet slightly interesting. There are better films in this genre that do not insult your intelligence by trying some kind of authentic ghetto realism, while resembling more of a film school offer. 4/10, a F.
