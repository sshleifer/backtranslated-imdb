This little theme is a remake of 1942's "The Matador?" Film, about the boys' trip to Mexico and their bullfighting adventures. Although the original short was made during the peak period of the Stooges, it is not so memorable and I believe it is one of the more mediocre films with Curly Howard. Having established this, I believe that "Sappy Bullfighters" is just pathetically awful, like all other shorts with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry should never have hired Besser, because her weeping, almost feminine character was completely wrong for the Stooges' violent comedy. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked the team's low point, and those shorts are embarrassing to watch. This short was released in 1959 and was the song of the Columbia team. Maybe Besser was a nice guy, but he was wrong as the third sycophant. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to review any more short Besser's because I would be giving the same review negatively over and over. Do yourself a great favor and do not watch it. Instead, try catching "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" or "Hoi Polloi".
