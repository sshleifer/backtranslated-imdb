Jude's law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as the most famous actor, Renee Z's character is direct from the Beverly Hillbillies, and the two leaders have as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. "Bandits" are the worst kind of clich√©, and there is not a subtle moment in the movie. Amazing that some critics really liked this movie.
