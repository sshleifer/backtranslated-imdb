I do not see why anyone would make such a movie. From beginning to end, this movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are all superficial, terribly agitated and frankly annoying. There is absolutely nothing going on beneath the surface in every character or plot. <br /> <br /> The 'humor' if you can call it that is intended for an adult audience (I presume the language and nudity) although it is mostly bathroom humor and would have problems even drawing a smile of a disgraceful 16-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. There is nothing that can appeal to a movie fan. Laughter nonexistent and a plot that almost does not lead me to ask "Why was this film made, why, why, why?" <br /> <br /> I hope that, in the fullness of time, this film will reach the top of the film. top 100 worst movies.
