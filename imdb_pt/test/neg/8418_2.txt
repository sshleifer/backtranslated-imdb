What bird is that? A Maltese Falcon. The only remotely funny thing about this movie is Michael Caines' hair. Who has more depth and character than the man under it. <br /> <br /> Malta's settings are as dry and as sterile as dialogue. Greetings to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc ... seem dull and simply foolish without the salvation of any humor or pertinence. The reason this movie has no "longevity" and is almost forgotten is so empty, an hour and a half of useless time in the company of actors and second-rate filmmakers - This movie is what the title suggests ...
