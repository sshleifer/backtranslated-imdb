This program can be more accurately described as "Bubble-Gum" on TV: it is chewing, has good taste and lasts for a long time. But like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after chewing too much. <br /> <br /> This program presents very simple questions that take the form of simple games such as Hangman, guessing simple phrase or guessing items in a short list. Callers are the competitors, and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> The questions, however, are terribly easy. There are some techno music pumped into the background that is formed in a continuous loop. It never seems to age, but it never adds much to the show anyway. The hostess, however, regardless of which one, is extremely gentle, pleasant enough to watch and can make some very entertaining facial expressions. I really like this British woman. <br /> <br /> But there's nothing for this show. It's simplistic and incomparable, though it can be fun if absolutely nothing else is happening.
