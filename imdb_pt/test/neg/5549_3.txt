Low-budget schlockmeister Herschell Gordon Lewis hits a new low (even for him) with "The Gore Gore Girls", a "snicker" that has all its technical marks: poorly recorded sound, poor lighting and OTT gore. That would be tolerable, even a little charming, if at least the movie had an interesting plot ("Blood Feast" in all its ridiculous glory, it's a good example), but "Girls" is a total snooze. Completely nasty pompous-private investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who is murdering strippers out of shape (you will stop caring who is to blame long before these two are closing the case). As before, the appeal is not the plot, but the creative methods of bleeding (including the buttock of a girl being softened with a wooden hammer) and the occasional flashes of skin then risky ... but that is not enough to raise the material above boredom.
