Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress, and I really enjoyed all of her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "She's the Man". Just for that reason, "Sydney White" was a big disappointment to me. The real reason for my dislike of this movie is the misuse of the characters. In a fun teen comedy, it's perfectly okay to have a cast of all teen characters based on reality. In "Sydney White," this idea is thrown out the window. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes does a beautiful Sydney, but she's really lacking in much of what usually makes her shine as an actress. I blame this on the screenplay, which makes her character very soft and contained, and in the hair / makeup department, which gives her an obnoxious plastic look and an annoying hair style. The seven "idiots" Sydney eventually make friends with are far worse. They are so stupid that it is impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. They are essentially repulsive gag fodder. As is the story of the "Prince Charming" which is completely unbelievable as a character and is as tacky as it can be. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest star of the movie (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who is actually very good as conniving Rachel Witchburn. Too bad the writers have not left her a little gray rather than black. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically that of "Snow White." What kills is that it is a very abrupt and obvious re-imagining. The connections with "Snow White" are thrown at us both throughout the film that they are annoying and exaggerated. The Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is very despicable witch, the seven "idiots" are very stupid, and Sydney is too pure-hearted. Now, that does not mean that the movie is all bad. Although Bynes is forced by the script, she still has her moments. So does Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes. Sydney's roommate named "Dinky" is also a lot of fun as a character. It's a rather funny movie in parts that ultimately is just plain tacky and clich√© to recommend.
