My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The cover looked pretty scary I thought I would watch. What a blood error. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends. <br /> <br /> The first is about a guy buying a car that talks to him. The second is about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his refrigerator. And the third is about a woman who does online dating, but it turns out he has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD ranks this movie 18, but even a 5 year old boy can watch and not be scarded or entertained. The film should be rated 12 for light fright and the swear word is bloody. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie sucks, do not go near it.
