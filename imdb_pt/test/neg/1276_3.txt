If you are a child who enjoys fairy-tale "real life" adventures, watch it. If you are a youngster who likes children's movies, why not watch it? :) If you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids, it's best to opt for the squirrel! <br /> <br /> The beginning of this movie was kind of funny premises for events to happen. But after the kind of funny introduction of characters, scenarios and potential conflicts, the story was kind of embarrassing. When more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" comes to mind repeatedly as parts of a crumpled LP or those commercials that you really hate. And the culmination of the plot ... * oh sigh * ... poor, poor, poor!
