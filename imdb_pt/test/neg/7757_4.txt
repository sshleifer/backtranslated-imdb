From what I understand, Mr. Bava abandoned this project before the conclusion ... AND SO CERTAINLY SO !!! If I were him, I would definitely have made sure that ALL copies were burned and if anyone in the future asked me about this movie ... NEVER HAPPENED AND NEVER EXISTED ... end of story. <br /> <br /> Despite great scenery and good photography, this is a horrible movie ... is it scary? (not the least) is supposed to be funny? (puh-leese) A total waste of time ... and I really do not like having to say that !!
