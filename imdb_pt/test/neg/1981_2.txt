First I will say that I will be as subjective as possible. <br /> <br /> There will be some potential spoilers ahead, so beware. <br /> <br /> I almost never review movies, but this one in particular felt like I had to revisit. This Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children movie, based off of the ultra popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII) for ps1 has been in the works for quite some time. After years of hype and dozens of trailers (none of which I've seen, I've only seen stills) this movie has the legion of fans really excited to see their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself played and completed the game a few times, like any good fan, and being so obsessed with movies, I was quite excited. So I thought to myself, "WHAT COULD I GO WRONG?" <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started well in the first 20 minutes, but then things got out of control as the movie progressed. Undoubtedly, this is the best CGI animation, but it will not help in a weak plot, undeveloped characters and indulgent action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here's basically the story. These three nancy silvery-haired boys who have nothing to do with the game are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he's the villain in the game who supposedly murdered all his supposed clones) are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason who was really not explained all this well, probably to make an army (of children?) They also center a bit of history on a boy named Denzel, I do not know who this boy is, or what is his point of view, he just seems depressed all the time. Thus, clones of sephiroth are also involved in some kind of scheme involving a disease called geostigma, which affects only children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> So now Cloud must save those guys' day. Apparently Cloud and his teammates learned the ability to fly, I felt a bit insulted because these characters were flying in a town fighting a dragon and landing there all the time. Maybe if the movie was not so overdone, then the view would relax and then they might be surprised by something incredible. The real problem with this movie is logic. Now I know what you're going to say: "But it's called Final FANTASY! You must have these ideas!" well, this is a foolish way of thinking, the game is based on some kind of reality and the film must follow in this CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, I could explain everything, but if I did, I would end up writing the script. <br /> <br /> Also some scenes in this movie were extremely planned and banal. like when all the characters in the game appear just at the right time for their mandatory screen time so as not to bother the fans. They appear, do little and have practically no meaning in history. <br /> <br /> If this is too long, here's the simplest review - <br /> <br /> The pros, the first 20 minutes of high-level CGI animation decent action- > <br /> action conspicits on indulgent / unbalanced action (leaves the spectator tired at climax) weak plot super human characters = no suspense the j-rock soundtrack / soundtrack (what happened to the orchestra?) horrible end /> <br /> BIO TIME SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Now the end of this movie really let me down. they could have gone to the very cool and sweet end where the cloud dies and finds aeris in the afterlife, but after the great battle in the final cloud is shot in the back, the kind of wound where the bullet explodes in the chest. Then the cloud has its 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now I remember the lifestream in the game, but it had no resuscitating properties, if that happened, they could have brought the aeris back to life, creating a completely different story) so that the cloud is brought back to life and everyone does a party and plunges into the pool and we have a moment of ultra chic brand / shelf life. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie does not have moments. Worth seeing for your visuals. but that's all. <br /> <br /> different from what is not really a good movie. is strictly for blind game fans. not for people who care about plots, characters and stories.
