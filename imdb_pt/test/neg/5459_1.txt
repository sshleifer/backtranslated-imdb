The success of Anna Kokkinos with 'Head On' now begins to seem that depended entirely on the script and the great performance of Alex Dimitriades. The degree to which the latter, "The Book of Revelation" is both derivative, pretentious and totally unoriginal (except for the good cinematography of Tristan Milani) seems to confirm this. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately there have been a few Australian films dealing with these themes, some criticized for 'sexism' (and / or sexually explicit scenes) in the 1970s and '80s and beyond, and maybe they are worth it look again after this piece of fluff. Of course, setting everything in the ballet world and making it painfully slow (and in your choreography, as a Dutch Experiment number from the '60s Ballet) suggests Great Art if you have not traveled much - and only if you have never progressed beyond Theory of Art 101. Add to the pretense, the frighteningly arched dialogue ("you will do as we command ...") and the whole shebang falls into its well-funded face. Then there are the sexy excerpts: direct from Dario Argento. Given the lovely but truncated performance of Colin Friels - how about a primitive thriller from a real city? <br /> <br /> All in with the book of Revelation, the feminist project receded another decade - and with the will and deeply imitative (from male writers such as Henry Miller, William Burroughs, to Bukowski) the collaboration of some collective in Melbourne, Oz, suffering from a form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelation awaits us here.
