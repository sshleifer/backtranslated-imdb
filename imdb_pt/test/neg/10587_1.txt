I hoped this movie was absolutely horrible. Like "What Dreams May Come" or "The Truman Show" or something. Well, they were selling for Â£ 3.99 on my local HMV and had Giovanni Ribisi on the cover, you know you can not help but love him, and then my friends challenged me to buy it. and I was sure it was going to be crap. maybe that's the only reason I could watch this movie, because my standards have never been so high.
