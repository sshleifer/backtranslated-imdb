I saw this movie purely based on the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and while I'm glad I saw it because it's now 'Nasty Video Down' - by its own merits, Andy Milligan's movie really is not worth It's worth bothering. There are, of course, much worse movies on the infamous list; but that does not make the pain easier to see it. The film was obviously filmed at an extremely low budget, and that translates into the script; as Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror movies, and does nothing new with it. Basically, the plot focuses on three couples who are in a house waiting for the results of a will. It was not long before they began to be chosen ... blah blah blah. In most of the film, nothing happens; and then when we finally get to the scenes that justify banning the film, they are so amateurish and silly that it's impossible to take it seriously at any level. It is a very good thing that this film does not have a long period of time, otherwise it could have been used as a particularly unpleasant method of torture. It all comes down to an appropriately tedious ending, which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions. Apparently this film is still banned here in the UK; but somehow I doubt it is because of its shock value. Basically, Blood Rites are not worth seeing and I personally see no reason to recommend it. Unless, of course, you've made a point of seeing everything on the Video Nasty list ...
