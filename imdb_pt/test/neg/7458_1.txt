Everything about this movie is bad. all. Ridiculous haircuts from the 80s. Ridiculous mustaches. Ridiculous action and fight scenes where you can actually see that opponents do not even beat up. Bad, bad, bad 80's music. Repeated scenes of people running through the forest. A bad guy with a silvery plastic hand and silly hair. Stupid dialogue. The performance is non-existent. Everything seems extremely cheap. This film even surpasses the "Plan 9 of outer space" in its absolute evil. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny bad," it's just bad.
