Barney and friends ... Dora, the exploiter of the 90s. OK, I'll admit. As a kid, Barney was my ultimate hero. I had my stuffed toy barney and I used to watch the same barney episodes repeatedly on video. perhaps because it was so sugary and numbing. <br /> <br /> However, when I was 7 years old, I started to hate barney. everyone at school would dis disney, and I went along with him (mostly because it was funny) and that's what the boys do. but a few years later, I discovered something else about barney that I will never forget. A person known to IMDb as Angel_meiru did an essay for school, explaining the dangers of attending barney, and he or she posted on the bulletin boards. many of these dangers made sense. <br /> <br /> Barney is a dinosaur that can magically make a living during a day at school. he is supposedly educated, or so Sheryl Leach (Barney's Creator) says, but in fact, all I can remember of him teaching me, is that magic can solve anything, which is not true. <br /> <br /> Comment, I would like to tell you a little story. There was once a boy who watched a particular episode of Barney. One day he was alone when a stranger pulled him into his car and drove away with him. I do not know the outcome (but it is safe to assume that the child died) but why was he kidnapped in the first place? because he watched the episode of Barney and Friends entitled "A stranger is a friend you have not met yet." <br /> <br /> 0/10
