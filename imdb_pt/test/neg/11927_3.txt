MTV's animated science fiction series "Ã†on Flux" is brought to life with Charlize Theron as the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of Bregna, 400,000 years into the future. For her most recent mission, she was sent to kill city leader Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), but she reveals secrets along the way. <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. Interesting story yet the movie was a little boring. Many people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and this is not true. It may be a disappointing movie, but it's an average movie at best. I've never seen the cartoon version of the movie so I can not compare the two. It's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. The movie is not so confusing, but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. The acting was good, nothing special. Charlize Theron does a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. The rest of the cast also offers decent performances, including Jonny Lee Miller, Frances McDormand and Marton Csokas. There are also more than a few interesting characters in the film, including Sithandra, Aeon's friend. <br /> <br /> The problem with Aeon Flux is that it takes itself very seriously. It bears the same serious tone throughout the film and gets a little tiring. There is no humor and the film becomes a little annoying at times. This is the same problem that Elektra had. Because the movie is so serious, the dialogue box looks tacky and the serious scenes seem forced. The action scenes are very good, but it's not about that, so do not expect just an action movie. The turnaround at the end is not mind-boggling, but it's still a good and better end than other thrillers who came out last year (Hide and Seek). The costumes are a bit freaky, but still look cute and interesting. The visuals are also well-made to make the film look beautiful. So the film can be a case of style over substance. Interesting to look at, but can not hold your attention for long. In the end, it's not the best movie out there, but it can be a decent rental. Overall Rating 4/10
