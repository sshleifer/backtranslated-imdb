Fred Williamson, one of the two or three main stars of blaxploitation. Cynthia Rothrock, one of two or three major American female action stars. Imagine a movie with these two together for the first time! Now imagine the worst movie that could be done with these two together for the first time. Welcome to "Night Vision". Of course this movie was made in 1997 and both were at their peak, but that does not mean they did not have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and directing. They do not even have it here. Rothrock manages to throw some kicks near the end, but this movie is so atrocious that you probably will not be awake to see them. (*)
