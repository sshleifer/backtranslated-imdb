I have seen many movies in my time and this really stands out as being the absolute worst film ever made in film history anywhere in the world. It took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, possibly because I was already tired as it was late at night. The second effort managed to pass 35 minutes, but once again I found myself asleep. I can continue like this, but I think you're understanding ... nothing happens in this movie. A complete waste of time and money. This movie really sucks. Watch and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you get 40 minutes in that movie without shaking your head and wondering what the sense of it all is, then you are indeed a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option. I just thought the world needed to be warned before hiring or worse yet ... buy this junk. LATER!
