Making a movie for less than 1 million can be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant, but it does nothing for the public. The swing might have been beautiful, but the viewing experience was poor. <br /> <br /> What will be a triumph for Irish cinema is when people realize that the values ​​of production and the script can not be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why people spend the energy they need to put together a movie when production quality is worse than a poor quality TV show. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the plot were mentioned. in another comment on this site and I totally agree with what was written. What I would like to add is that the film touched the surface of several genres without establishing itself in one of them. The film would have benefited from directing a comedy or social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the movie was rushed, thematically underdeveloped, and visually out of standard. On a positive note, the performances and the music were very good.
