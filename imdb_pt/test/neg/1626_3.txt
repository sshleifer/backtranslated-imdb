This movie has some of the worst production and editing values ​​I've ever seen. There are several examples of actors stopping when trying to remember their lines, actors walking in front of actors who are talking and a point where the film jumps about seven pictures. Not to mention the heroine taking a shot in the chest but she starts limping! Oh, and on the secret passageway that is well lit and open. Terrible. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent, something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and some kind of war between cavemen. Actor pulls a hang glider at one point at the most idiotic moment of the movie. The dialogue is stupid, containing jewelry like "It's all and nothing". and "I can feel it here." <br /> <br /> The movie is a mess, a confusing and insipid mess. Actor is a dull hero, sword fights are absurd and the plot moves slowly. All in all, this is a movie to avoid.
