Here is a decidedly average apocalyptic Italian post about the humans who hunt / kill for sport themed ala The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man. <br /> <br /> Certainly the reviewed film here is far from being as near entertaining as the other entries listed and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over the job, usually bland action sequences, a number of totally tasteless scenes, like an extended sequence of rape and some truly stupid and illogical points. <br /> <br /> Take for example to the end of the movie, when our hero manages to infiltrate the complex of villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. After the discovery of the said corpse, the response of the villains? (taking into account that our hero came to kill them brutally)? They decide to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, I suppose it is only fair that the film remains, however, on watchable if you can suspend. his disbelief during these stupid scenes and immensely benefits from the presence of the always excellent Woody Strode (even if his time on the screen is very limited) <br /> <br /> It is not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but still only about worthy of a watch for Italian B-Movie enthusiasts.
