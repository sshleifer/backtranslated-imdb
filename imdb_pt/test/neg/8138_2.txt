This movie was tacky and it was more than that. It was about this guy who has a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because she was not the bride of a gorilla: now she's the gorilla's wife. She should have married him when he was a gorilla, so the title would have made more sense. There are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and everyone wants to leave. This is not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. I have not even seen bananas for a wedding present. Oh, right, he was not cursed yet.
