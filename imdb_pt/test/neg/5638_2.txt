Come now. How did all those talented actors end up in this mess? Was it some kind of blackmail / lost bet? Vinnie, you're a muscular man. Be what you were born to be. <br /> <br /> The scene of the whirlpool? The Scrabble Scene? I was hoping to hear the sound "dragging the needle over the disc" at any time. <br /> <br /> And what was with him carrying Dickens's invaluable manuscript with him? Let's see, I'm drunk in a bar, why not pull out Dickens's invaluable manuscript? I will find some questionable thugs on the edge of the Thames, why not get my invaluable Dickens manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. Avoid.
