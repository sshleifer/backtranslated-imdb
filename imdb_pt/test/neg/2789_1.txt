According to the budget information provided on this site, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where that money was spent, I'm not sure. Let me see .... costumes ... no ... location and sets ... hmmm, do not think .... special f / x ... NO ... acting classes ... ah, no . Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the West Virginia hills. His girlfriend talks to him to take his friends there to check out the place. Once there, our intrepid hero learns that his great-grandfather used a unique method to make his crops grow and now it's time for revenge. Assassin scarecrows for revenge !!! Ewww scary. Well, no, not really. We all know there have been some wonderful movies made with very little money but this is not one of them. This movie contains pretty much some of the worst acting and dialogue I've ever seen. Terrible cliches with terrible birth. All in all, do not be fooled by the half decent cover and avoid at all costs. I'd like to give the filmmakers at least a D-to try, but I'm afraid they have not even done a good job with it. DEGREE: F
