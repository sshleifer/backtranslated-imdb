I have to confess right away that I did not watch this whole movie. I missed the first hour during a broadcast of the Sci Fi Channel. Or was I spared in the first hour? The other reviewers add this one as well. It was poorly designed. Badly scripted. It acted badly. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire movie, which seemed to have been dubbed, seemed to have been made in someone's garage. There was a voluminous echo to the words, which only served to make the bad conversation fall. And hang on. And hang on. Even a TV movie should have recognized that. <br /> <br /> And the idea that alternative dimensions are differentiated by color saturation came out in the 80's, personal.
