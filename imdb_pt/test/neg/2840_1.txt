Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate broker who is threatened with death by a crazed maniac who kills people in her profession and who thinks house prices are too high. As the motives go, this is very retarded. Lisa's boyfriend is a talk show host the killer keeps calling in the air. At first I was sure this was supposed to be a comedy or satire of some sort, but as the endless minutes went by, I realized it was not and the movie was simply grossly incompetent in every way, form and form . . I'm just surprised that something horrible was not directed by Jeff Lieberman (yes, send me an email again, Jeff hack) Anyway, back to the movie, poor and poor Barbeau, you can CHECK EXACTLY when your career in cinema went down in flames and it all started here. <br /> <br /> My Notes: F <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: The Movie Channel
