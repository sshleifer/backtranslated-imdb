Six stars for General Groves' Paul Newman portrait, four negatives for the inclusion of a highly fictional event where the truth is well documented. Michael Merriman did not really exist. His character - or at least his fate - is loosely based on that of Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. He conducted his lethal "dragon's tail" experiment in May 1946. This is a critical point. The effects of severe radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in the victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions. If someone had died of radiation poisoning in Los Alamos before the Trinity test, it is very possible that the scientists abruptly stopped their work, and the story would have changed. Whether for good or ill, we can only speculate. One should ask the producers and the director whether they have added Merriman's character to dramatic effect or to deliver an anti-nuclear message. For a more precise and accurate treatment of events in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project, watch the TV movie, "First Day," or better yet, read Peter Wyden's book on which it is based.
