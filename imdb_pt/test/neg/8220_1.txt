For those who can send me nasty emails, stick it. There is a trend in Hollywood, where those who create overly quirky movies are instantly impenetrable to criticism. Garden State tends to be one of those movies. Of course, Zach Braff, an overrated comedy star, surprises people with some talent behind the cameras, but that does not guarantee the kind of compliment a movie like that has been receiving. The story is often too thin and shallow to provide real insight. People compared this movie to The Graduate, but these kinds of people are the guys who try to sell independent film. Indie movies are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that usually hits studio movies, but people seem to have forgotten that there are many more bad indie films than good ones. Garden State is not atrocious, but not great. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is very fast, resulting in a fairly rapid resurgence of Large in his previous life. After ten years, people tend to act as if he has never left. Where is the embarrassment? Of course, the situation is always resolved by a quick scene of drug tasting (which I would say was fairly accurately portrayed). The film seems to present many emotional inequalities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come later, in a deeper and well thought out way. However, he fails to deliver these fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments was quickly resolved (such as Peter Saarsgard's grave robbery tendencies). It was not completely abysmal, but perhaps we should stop praising the film as something it is not.
