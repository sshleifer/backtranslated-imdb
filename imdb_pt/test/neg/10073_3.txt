How sad it is when a movie as marvelous as "Jurassic Park" slowly creeps into banal and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. The newest sequel, Jurassic Park III, paid no attention to characters, a storyline or virtually a screenplay, and instead relies on uninterrupted dinosaur action, which is neither exciting nor very interesting to watch. The dinosaurs looked incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of CGI advances, it only gives you more the feeling that the film was pumped for the summer counting on only its name. The introduction of a pterodactyl does not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Go see "Shrek" again. <br /> <br />
