Sorry, after watching the credits, I thought this would be at least a decent tribute to retire the SF actors. <br /> <br /> The boy was wrong. <br /> <br /> The direction and story telling POS are terrible. I've never been so insulted by a production. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect and love for many of the actors in this "movie", but I have to say they were cheated. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this disaster, do yourself a favor and stay away. It's not just two hours that you will not return, but it will also ruin your respect for some actors you may have appreciated.
