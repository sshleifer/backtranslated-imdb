Don Wilson stars as a cop who likes virtual reality games, but things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game, okay, they make the cybersex models as a prototype, but the main villain of the video game awakens and begins to kill people and now the only man who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who in the meantime falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, with all things considered, my biggest confusion was trying to figure out whether people brought in from virtual reality were robots, humans, cyborgs, or just some kind of unidentified computer program. It does not matter, since all this is just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors of all time shake the dialogue as if he was driving a delicatessen. Don Wilson's complete lack of charisma is the biggest flaw in the movie, since one does not like the guy, he's very good, his voice is very loud and he does not look very impressive in the action sequences. What saves this bore-fest from my lowest rating is Athenia Massey, who looks super hot in high cut clothes and who occasionally gets naked. Also on board is Loren Avedon, Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the villain's lead voice, but their efforts are in vain, as they are all hidden by Wilson's very poor acting. Another flaw that is the biggest mistake of the film is the lack of action, as we are asked to watch the story unfold, but outside Massey's nudity and perhaps some unintentional amusements due to ridiculously unconvincing acting, there really is nothing of interest . This also extends to sequences of action in which they are choreographed, misdirected and completely drained of all possible excitement. Making this virtually unwatchable. <br /> <br /> * Out of 4- (Bad)
