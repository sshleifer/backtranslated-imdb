This show, Paranormal State, has an almost "Blairwitch Project" to feel this. As in, you're watching a 'documentary' that is actually just a scripted film, made to look and feel like a documentary. My biggest problem with the show is the 'go to' Warren outside consultants, who became famous for their 'investigations' into the Amityville murders, which proved to be completely fraudulent, based only on police reports of family deaths! (like the eldest daughter, actually having been involved in the whole thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) So there's the way they constantly jump to blame the demons for everything. Not to mention how the group is arrogant about the cases they take. They do not want to help those who need it most, they just want the strangest cases, which will give them more attention and attention. <br /> <br /> They are complete, clear and simple frauds.
