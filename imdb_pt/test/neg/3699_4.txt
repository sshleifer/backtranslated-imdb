This is a fair movie, good for a one-off screening. The plot itself is fairly well crafted for an image of this type which is a pleasant surprise as is the acting, which despite a bit hammy, is better than normal for these types of film. <br /> <br /> The special effects are hilarious - a translucent giant and a hand of polystyrene / papier mache flagrantly dangling unconvincingly on a string. <br /> <br /> Definitely to watch once the value of kitsch entertainment. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
