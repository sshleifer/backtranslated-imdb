Usually the political messages are made on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental correction, watch the content of your hearts. Most people go to the movies to have fun, not sold some absurd political poppycock. The hook here is the cast of the big name. Unfortunately the sum of the performances amounts to a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal time on the screen. In short, "Silver City" should be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a non-documentary political exposition, disconnected about illegal immigration, pollution and various other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen. - MERK
