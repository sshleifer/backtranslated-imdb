A professional production with quality actors who simply never touched the heart or funny bone, no matter how hard it tried. The cast of quality, austere and excellent cinemetography made you wait for Fargo or High Plains Drifter, but sorry, the soup had no seasoning ... or meat for that matter. A 3 (out of 10) for effort.
