Before accepting a job as a reviewer, I've never been to movies like this and thus remained happily unaware that in the soul of the Hollywood movie there is a spirit deeply hated by women striving to put their knees on the silver screen all to empathize or insult. Or is this just a particularly bad year? An ugly trend? <br /> <br /> Here we have another apparently sweet, innocent and beautiful woman turned deadly weapon. The kind who warns us that beneath every pair of bulging eyes and nesting instincts there is a wide-eyed beast guaranteed to make everyone's life within 50 miles a hell. <br /> <br /> This month's issue is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams include having her own little house, a fountain in the backyard, and a home entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first film in 3 years), the bartender bulb bulb that she picks up at McCool's one night with the intention of stealing, is less materially oriented. The kind of guy who drinks beer in a toilet, he prefers to crouch in the house of his dead mother with few comforts except his collection of snow glasses. <br /> <br /> In that same cheap rental bar, the Devil in the Red Dress also meets Randy's cousin, Carl (the very fun Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis. When things go south in a few hours, get into the widowed detective with a heart of gold (John Goodman). The result? Three men hold great and bad passions over Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell-crushed progeny that make them do things that common sense normally counterindicates. How to get involved in the first place. <br /> <br /> Multiple views and flashbacks bring together the front page news about how easy it is to be a libido victim, especially if you are male. While each of these men relates his perspective to a confidant, his desire to possess The Jewel colors the "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things come together in a reasonably fun way. But it's fun from the same source that says things in popcorn really tastes like butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian commercial and musical director Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear. during some of the fancy segments, including one on a car wash, soap and a hose that you can probably extrapolate. It is also the debut project of the property producer of Michael Douglas, who found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo hall. <br /> <br /> Dillon and Tyler should not win any gold statue Given the unidimensionality of their exaggerated Noir characters, you can not blame them. Several smaller roles draw unexpected guests - Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay is also both Utah and his brother even more scary. (Finally, an outlet for all this aggressiveness.) <br /> <br /> This movie unintentionally talks a lot about the dynamics between men and women - or men and their moms. But, after all, you'll probably find more enduring psychological truths in an episode of Bugs Bunny. I'm going to say that it's better, funnier, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really choose what to see based on what is at a lower level on the misogynism scale?
