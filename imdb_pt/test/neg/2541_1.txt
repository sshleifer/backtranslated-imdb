First, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. This may make you want to see but not bad in a good way. It's boring, implausible, poorly filmed, ridiculously scripted, and devoid of disaster effects. <br /> <br /> Worse, it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or amusement, wallowing in a sense of Japanese exclusivity and victimization. Everybody abandons the Japanese in their hour of need. Particularly the Koreans. The noblest characters choose seppaku - descending with their ship as their beloved island sinks. "Only Japanese would think so," says the prime minister. <br /> <br /> If this movie somehow reflects Japanese opinion of its place in world opinion, the first thing they must do to correct the problem is to stop making movies like that.
