Based on a novel by Stephen King, NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep him in his place. A mysterious man (Max von Sydow) arrives in town and soon becomes the most talked-about citizen. Did the devil himself establish himself as an antiquarian in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Also starring are Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris stands firm and Bedelia deserves his attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best, nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen.
