Being a fan of history, I rented this movie because of the subject. The idea of ​​the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century, focused on a small group, is intriguing. Unfortunately, the movie falls. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing happens for long periods. The director uses funny pictures (offered in the form of dreamy sequences) in an apparent attempt to break the glacial rhythm, but instead, clashes with the film's authentic appearance. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end, we do not care as much about them as we should. It's a pity that this was not what it might have been. I still would like to see a good movie about the experience of the American immigrant, but that is not the case.
