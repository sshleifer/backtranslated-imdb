I had the misfortune to see this movie at a friend's house. What a total loss of time. What a complete and complete piece of crap this movie is! Absolutely nothing is funny, from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading portrayal of the Germans. No plot, the acting made me choke and in the end, I personally wanted to beat John Leguizamo with a stick. I thought John Woo's movies were bad ... this movie is officially the worst movie I've ever seen.
