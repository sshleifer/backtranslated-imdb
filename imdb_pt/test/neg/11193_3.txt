First separate the story from the movie. The story of a second continuous war in heaven is good, very good. Religious themed films are not the main choice for many people, but angels in the war. I really loved the story, and some of the pictures provided to support it as the field of angels on peaks .... stunning images. The actual movie, however, was just poor, I can not find any reason for the main character - the priest-cop-cop being there at all. The main female too ... there is no reason to be there, the dialogue of the main characters was just empty, had no substance, history could have been told without them. Now some sterling acts really do appear, Walken, Stoltz and Mortensen have taken some wings, though their scenes are most often with lifeless leads. <br /> <br /> Another thing I'm not getting with this movie is because it features Native American rituals to purify the dark soul. The child who carries it is clearly of Native American origin, but beyond the final scenario, there is nothing that connects with that heritage. The plot about the black soul itself barely counted, considering it strange that the dark soul is the driver of the whole premise of the film. The story of its original owner (the colonel) is briefly touched, but not enough to allow one to understand why his soul is special. <br /> <br /> I can not find a justification for the shots of the moving scene. in this film too, several of the plains around 'chimneys'. I have the feeling that they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it, since none of the shots have any relevance, nor do they agree with the mood -> Horror. The film falls into the category of science fiction more than horror. There was no real shock or scary scenes, some blood and bleeding soft, but no element of fear. <br /> <br /> So, in addition to three roles that have been very well interpreted, this movie is a great scam. Unfortunately, the failure factor outweighs the good acting factor, only many weekend actors.
