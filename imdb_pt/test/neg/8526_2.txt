This movie was trying something, but failed miserably. All attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired tricks and plot holes that I laughed and mocked him all the time. At least I was entertained. <br /> <br /> Ghosts are trying to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name I do not mind remembering. And what was with the black and white at the beginning? I know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. And where the hell did this guy (John Corbett's character) come from? He just waltzes from nowhere in a vast field. And why did he suddenly lose again when the crows arrived? And if the crows were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if he tried to kill the family? Does not make sense. So many things in this movie just do not make sense, and the acting is not very pretty from the girl's main character. It's not terrible, just a bit like your days of children's movies. <br /> <br /> So in all this movie was not brilliant, but I have a lot of fun with it, and sometimes it's all a horror movie needs to do. Rent for not quality entertainment.
