I feel terribly sorry! Where the photo of Lubitsch was charming, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, this one is just - colorful! Lana looks like 51 (actually she was 31 at the time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and bland girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the widow's role a double depth by "playing" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta though unable to sing - crazy! She sings only one song - the title role of a Lehar-operetta, that's very funny! The only really good thing is the big waltz scene at the end: glamorous! And - after watching this scene - take a look at introducing the waltz scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Any resemblance?
