I had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on Broadway with Kathy Bates in the lead. I only saw another piece in the years 1970-1990 which had an emotional impact as this game did. I really craved the piece to be turned into a film, but I was very disappointed when I heard that Kathy Bates was not going to reprise her role in the film - she was not very well known on Broadway at the time and the producers must have wished for star power I suppose and conjure Sissy Spacek instead. Sissy did a proper job in the lead role, but did not equate to Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft, but she seemed too young for this role. The plot of the film was true to the game. Anyone who ever contemplates suicide should watch this movie to realize the devastation of those who are left behind.
