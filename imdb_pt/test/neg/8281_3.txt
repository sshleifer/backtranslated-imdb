This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This movie makes Friday look like an Oscar nominee for Best Picture. The acting sucks. Special effects suck. No one dies for about 40 minutes and all the people do wrong. The only thing that saves you is the ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on. The funniest part is watching the heroine "fight" the attacker. She should be trained, but she fights like a 70-year-old. They pass senseless scenes about people who do not die and no scene about people who die to the point of you or know why they are dying. I love slashers, but that's just crap.
