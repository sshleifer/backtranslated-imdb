Jesus Christ, what the hell happened here? This is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen, how is it possible that they spoiled such a good idea for a movie. To tell you the truth, I was so hyped for this, I thought it was like the Blair Witch, but with real alien creatures chasing the camera guy. Damn, I've been reduced to moving fast on this pile of stuff, and I never do this while watching movies. The high rating here on IMDb makes me believe that real aliens are giving 10 for this crap. <br /> <br /> Invasion is well, an invasion. The movie begins by saying that everything you are about to see is real, blahblahblah. So they told me about a special camera system used on cars, as if I needed to believe their bullshit to enjoy this movie. The next thing you know, I'm seeing the most annoying driving car ever filmed, in a forest at night, worry about you. Is this a movie or a trip in the Disney theme park? The first 20 minutes are all boring dialogue between policemen while seeing grass and a straight road with a flashlight. Where the hell were the aliens? They were sleeping clear! Then we learned that bad acting is not just reduced to high school plays, as the cop behind the camera gets out of his car to look for a missing man who was 'nightfishing' and ran into a mysterious meteor. I wonder what happens to him? From nowhere, we see the face of 'night fishing' walking like a zombie. The cop is apparently too dumb to realize that something is wrong with this man. Apparently, he was really dumb, as the zombie / alien guy injects into the cop's ear some kind of alien parasite, thus turning him into an alien. Then the cop / alien returns to his car, looks for a young couple who has been having sex for some time in the forest, reaches them, turns the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the police car and escapes. If this quick introduction to the plot does not put in your head that this movie was bad, then the next 40 minutes will be. Watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, while it may seem interesting on the back of the DVD box, is misdirected and unfortunately we are left with another annoying straight to DVD atrocities. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me awake was the intermittent constant and loud sound effects (regrettably). If it is not enough to see the same trail in the forest for 63 minutes, we must endure low quality techniques to "scare" the viewer and the constant lament of a bad actress who gets old and annoying very fast. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you should rent this, I say to you, why? There are better science fiction / horror films out there. Even the dreaded remake of the Body Thieves Invasion is more fun than that. For the love of all good things, do not bother with your crap. My eyes bled, and for the first time I wanted suicide. A 1/10, avoid this as a disease.
