How uninteresting confusion. It could have been something else, but no imagination seems to have entered the script or the direction. A man is framed for murder by his wife and his lover. The conspirators do a very thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "unimaginative," manages to escape from prison, beat him at the conspirator's beach house and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal his guilt. Then he accidentally drops the recorder with all the evidence in the seawater, but manages to retrieve it. It shows a lot of creativity and improvisation ability to an unimaginative guy, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The tape is now damaged, but it is enough to break the wife's lover and he hiccups confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> The footage is amazing. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior erected on the grounds of Fort Fisher Battlefield on the Cape Fear peninsula. The house was demolished immediately after the wrapped production. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful place. Unfortunately it's a bit difficult to see because someone seems to have filmed each scene through a pair of tights stretched over the camera lens. Everything is very confusing. And for all the natural splendor of the place, the spectator never gets a real feel of place, of how the sand is, of the texture of the gray bark on the atrophied evergreens. <br /> <br /> The acting is fine but the artists do not have much to work with. The best performance, as is often the case, is given by Dick Olsen as a despicable but not unfriendly defense lawyer. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every beat of her eyelashes. Ted McGinley is within your reach as an immoral weakling. <br /> <br /> The musical score perfectly combines the sinister with the mysterious and is effective. If you want to hear the original, from which it was stolen, rent Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and listen to Bernard Hermann's suspenseful theme. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any specific reason to take this one except total boredom.
