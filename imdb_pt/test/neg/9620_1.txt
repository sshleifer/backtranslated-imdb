I saw this movie when it debuted in Los Angeles. I think I laugh two or three times. The rest of the time I was in shock at how ridiculous / poorly recorded and poorly written it was. Kirby is actually the only saving grace in the movie. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby, whom I generally find amusing. If you enjoy watching your friend's short home movies they filmed on your mother's 8mm camera, then there's a small chance you'll enjoy this movie. So again, part of what makes these movies enjoyable is that they are your friends playing all the parts. You do not know these people, so you'll probably find it as boring and stupid as I am. Dear Mr. Nelson, go back to film school, stagnate for a while as an education assistant, or a low-level job so you can see how things are done correctly in the film. Then look for the time you need to find a director of photography who knows what f. Stop means, make sure it has the ND filter in hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
