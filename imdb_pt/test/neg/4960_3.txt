It's horrible crap. I liked 'How Do You Want Me', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey, but I filed it with 'Hippies' and 'Planets Of The Apes' under Great Pedigree, was very wrong '. My guess is that it appeals to the same people who like 'Withnail and me'. It is overwritten, but with a small end, a luvvie-ish air pervades and Bernard Black is simply a smaller field withnail. And I thought it was self-indulgent * before * Dylan Moran became the writer. But the montage has such great comedic potential that in the first two episodes I did not even realize that it was not worthy of a little boy. The things they're saying / doing * should * be funny, but somehow they can not register as anything more than fun or "I can see how someone who wrote this could have thought that would be funny. " What I'm trying to say is that the situations / observations are mildly humorous and at the same time very mundane / soft / consciously surreal to be worth creating and portraying on a sitcom. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. Avoid.
