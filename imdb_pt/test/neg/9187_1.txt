Jeff Fahey has such alert eyes and an insidious smile that every character he plays looks villainous; so it really does not work to put you as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for your character to break down and start to blow people up. Drew Barrymore, just released from his acclaimed role of "Poison Ivy", must have made this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the director of photography for "Ivy"); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!), she bade farewell immediately, which leaves us with no one to look past Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who has not had a single subtle moment in the camera since "Blade Runner"). This foolish script by Michael Angeli concerns a police draftsman who draws the face of his own wife from the testimony of a witness, and although this is not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much more fitting for a series of TV for an hour. This cable movie is short on inspiration (starting with the cast) and less on surprises. * in ****
