<br /> <br /> This movie really has nothing to do with it. With the Reverend played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman complaining of his constipation and other moody touches in a 2.5 hour movie, you know they did not cut and left the crap, literally. It is a waste of good talent and a total embarrassment. Terrible! <br /> <br />
