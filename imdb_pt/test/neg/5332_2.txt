This movie is bad as we all knew it would be. Most of the time I usually love the bad 80s / early 90s dump-comedy (haha no pun intended). I listo Ski School, Career Opportunities, Hot Shots, Summer School and many others made at that time. This still has the classic but forgotten comedy of Dean Cameron (also known as .. ski school section 8 instructor and Party Maniac for Summer School). But this movie is just to slow down. It takes almost 30 minutes to get started and we have to sit through meaningless dialogues between the Sheen boys (E & C). And yeah, I can hear the bloggers dying to fool me with "obviously you do not watch 2 and 1/2 men." Well, Charlie was not at the level he is now during this movie ... not that he's anything worth Charlie is only glittering when his co-protagonists support him and Emilio is no more than a wonder bra that offers little support.In fact, this movie was written by Emilio and it shows.It does not have a real ending (come Emilio , even the Writers of Ski School 2 made an end.) No idea how any problem was solved, no hot girls, no swearing to illuminate the bad plot, characters, acting ... Now I'm tired of this speech and watch the movies I listed above. You'll enjoy them a lot more.
