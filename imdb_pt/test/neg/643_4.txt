After watching this movie on TV, I looked in IMDB and I imagine, to my surprise, a user rating of 7.6! This is not a good movie. Especially bad is the issue; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction. Not very fluent. I agree that the acting was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that story was intriguing enough.
