For reasons I can not begin to imagine, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins injecting wolf blood into his intrepid do-it-all, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro is transformed into a heinous one (as horrible as someone with a bad wig and pointed teeth can be) a killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to take revenge on those in the scientific community who mocked and ridiculed his ideas (and why would not they, Dr. Cameron more than a fruitcake). The Mad Monster is a Poverty Row thriller. There's really only one positive thing I can invent to write in The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch while he plays the crazy scientist on as well as anyone. Your Dr. Cameron is a normal nut. He has no scruples about killing; he has whole conversations with people who are not there; and, like most crazy scientists, he stirs up "God's dominion" (actually, I'm not sure anyone accuses him of it, but it fits). But beyond Zucco, there is nothing here to recommend. Everything else, from the monstrous effects to the supporting music cast, is simply bad. There are far better examples of Poverty Row horror from the 1940s than The Mad Monster.
