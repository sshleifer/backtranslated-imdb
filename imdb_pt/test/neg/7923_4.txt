Movies like these do not need sequels. Part of Don Bluth's advantage away from Disney is that he did not need to undergo his endless discourse of direct and badly animated video cash-in sequences. But apparently it was the brilliant idea of ​​someone doing a continuation of "All Dogs Go to Heaven," so we took that. <br /> <br /> Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he is not that good. Most of the film is just an excuse for a sequel and is not as somber, different or fun as the original. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for future generations that are going to have to suffer such sequences without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood did not depend entirely on successful movies as a crutch to throw nasty crap. <br /> <br /> Please, there are no more continuations for children's films that they do not need them.
