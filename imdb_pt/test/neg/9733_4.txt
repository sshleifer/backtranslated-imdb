Basic Summary: Ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped from the witch hunts of Salem, forming a pact of secrecy. The first male descendants of these families have supernatural powers, and must accept the seductive and addictive nature of using these powers. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give the movies the benefit of the doubt and start from a 5, going from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for very obvious audio out of sync, + 1 for special effects well done, the darkling really gave me chills, +0.5 for nice colorization (I like the opaque blue), -0.5 for the stupid soundtrack, +0.5 for the opening sequence - I'm a sucker for elegant compositions and flashy title design. <br /> <br /> Story / Script: +1 for decent people main idea, -0.5 for ripoff / pastiche of DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter, -1 for not explaining very well some topics of the plot (spiders, Darkling) , -1 for boring and predictable ending, -1 for free exposure, both as words on the screen and as a soft monologue <br /> <br /> Performance / Characterization: -0.5 for poor performance, although slightly better As the movie progresses, -1 for lac k for character development, especially among all females. <br /> <br /> Other: +1 free male and female nudity, which is fun to watch, and + 0.5 without sex scenes, which for this genre are usually done very poorly and ends up being boring rather than hot, +1 for reaching their target audience, teenage fans of science fiction / horror / suspense, even if this movie is not exclusively one of these genres. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This is not a "movie", this is a MOVIE. There's really nothing to look at, it's just good fun (relatively) clean. Many really attractive actors and actresses. Lots of boys fighting in the style of DBZ and Street Fighter. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or fun plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer cinematographic masterpieces worthy of being produced at the Oscars with tons of multi-layered allegorical plot and innovative visualization techniques, you probably will not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Using my distorted logic, movie gets a 4/10.
