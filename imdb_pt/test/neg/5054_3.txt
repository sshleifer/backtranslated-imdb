This absurd movie was about a teenage girl "Goodie-two-shoe", who really wanted to be a speaker, but finds her obstacle in the name of teacher, Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", is faced with "the biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when her classmate comes along with the final test that should help them to take Ms. Tingle. Mrs. Tingle appears, picks up Holmes, her classmate and her best friend with her final exam sample. Convinced that all three planned to take the exam here, Mrs. Tingle is excited about the opportunity to ruin Holmes once and for all with allegations that may take any chance of Holmes passing the class. And the classmate, who apparently has his eye on Holmes, always wondered why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? Feeling desperate, Holmes and his friends visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her, believing Holmes was planning to cheat. It all works out somehow when his colleague points a bow and arrow to Mrs. Tingle, threatening her to do the right things for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle reacts, but eventually becomes a prisoner of Holmes and her friend. During Mrs. Tingle's captivity under Holmes, they do everything to tie her up in her own bed to blackmail her with fake photos that have taken away from the unconscious Coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I found myself shrinking when the children were feeling at home in Mrs. Tingle's house, eating her food and going to private work. At one point, Holmes found Mrs. Tingle's note book and purposely changed the grade in her favor, lessening the degree of her challenge to the final class speaker. The ending unfolded as a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was parsimonious at the beginning of the film, solving sheer irony, clowning and absurdity. <br /> <br /> This has to be the most unpleasant and wicked evil. Holmes's character would never play in his entire life. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle free herself to actually dig a tomb for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and conniving. She even slept with her classmate despite her best friend's great interest in him ... and she did not like him. From trying to ruin your challenger's notes by taking Mrs. Tingle's note book to pick up your best friend's man, you'd think Holmes would have what he deserves in the end, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything her heart desires, showing that being wicked, manipulative, selfish, and whining can give you what you want. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Tingle should be the character you did not like. They did not bring me up to that point once to believe that she was this woman who needed to be "taught in this lesson." She was like any other rigorous teacher who even gave valid reasons for the resentment of the next generation. Personally, I felt that her views on young people were validated by the actions of Holmes and her friends every time. I kept waiting for her to be free to call the police and preach Holmes. They kept her tied up in bed, ate her food like a pack of pigs, drank the woman's wine, tampered with her personal belongings, and we must believe she did not deserve to carry a staff for each of her heads? And the classmate has to be one of the most unfriendly characters in movie history. Forget the idiot, we need a new word for him that is not in Webster's dictionary. He brought the biggest problem to Holme's life, made it worse when he entered Mrs. Tingle's house, uninvited by Holmes, and cornered Mrs. Tingle with a bow and arrow. I was thrilled every time Mrs. Tingle had the chance to fire him, or choke the aspiring actress's best friend. <br /> <br /> If you're a teenager out there and want to see when manipulating a teenager and doing the wrong things can make him or her the world, watch this bland, cartoon-filled noir movie intentional.
