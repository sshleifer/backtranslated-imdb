A plot that is mute beyond belief. However, having said that, it must be admitted that the main actors assume their roles as if it were Shakespeare. And that's how it should be. It's not their fault the writer seems to be in a coma. <br /> <br /> We took the hat for what is really a very smart performance by Joanna Kerns. It proves that just because it is not on the page does not mean that a role can not be tapped. And she does it with enthusiasm. Good for her. <br /> <br /> Said to Christine Elise, who is called to be little more than confused and tearful, but goes far beyond what is asked by the script. <br /> <br /> And to Grant Show too. Formed in daytime and prime time soaps (Ryan's Hope, Melrose Place). He is always versatile and underestimated. Its main disadvantage seems to be its impossible to ignore appearance. He is a robust, well-grounded actor, capable of much more than is usually given the opportunity to do. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is basically the look of the window. <br /> <br /> The direction is appropriate and the script, as I alluded, is quite stupid. <br /> <br /> Watch this to enjoy three good actors in leads, taking pleasure in performing a scene of much needed chewing. It's fun.
