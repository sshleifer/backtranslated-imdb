Cult begins 20 years ago in the 'Quinling Range, Southern China' as a guy named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds an ancient amulet that claims to have magic powers, cut to California where Quinlin set up a cult and members are about to sacrifice Mindy (Rachael Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel) Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) are researching the events of twenty years ago that have become known as the 'Quinling Massacre' for a school project. Unfortunately Morgan decides to kill himself, which unleashes the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for reasons that are quite fragile, he sets out on what he started all those years ago claiming souls so he can finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own bad use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Knee, this is not a good movie and that's good for it. Benjamin Oren's script, which seems to take itself very seriously, is a dark and supernatural tale about a cult leader who comes back from the dead to finish what he started a few years ago, as you would expect the character involved now to have connections with what happened all those years ago and is as monotonous as it sounds. The characters are dull and forgettable, the dialogue is like this, there is no horror or exploitation appropriate, it is slow sometimes, it is predictable, it is clich√©, it is completely out of bounds at the end and it does not work very well. sense when you think about it. The story never grabs or envelops you, is never exciting or particularly interesting and I struggle to call the average. There is very little here that I could recommend Cult, do not bother with this. <br /> <br /> Director Knee does well, but the film has that dull look made for TV is completely forgettable and annoying everywhere. There are no fuss, no atmosphere and no voltage at all. Also there is no blood, of course there is a reasonable amount of blood splatters, but no real special makeup effect. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 950,000 The cult seems cheap, though not as badly done as some low-budget horror movies I've seen recently. The performance is not even worthy of mention. <br /> <br /> The cult is a bad movie that did nothing for me, I would struggle to call that average. There are much better horror films out there.
