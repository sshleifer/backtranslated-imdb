I really enjoyed Flesh and I'm looking forward to Heat, but I could not help feeling that Morrissey grossly exploited most of the performers featured here. Stumbling naked in a narcotic stupor seems to be all Dallesandro was able to do in this feature - a huge and moving contrast to Flesh. His semi-erection in some scenes is the only indication that he may be acting; mostly looks like something he did to buy drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation, all right - she's the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But hers is a show of a woman - she rarely gets involved with other artists, but it should be said, her sex scene with a bottle of beer definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to cinematographic exhibits of raw passion. When she jumps on a young lover, it is with the ferocity of a vampire. Two of the female artists, Andrea and Jane, have such annoying voices that you will have to mute the sound to go through the scenes. The fact that several of these artists committed suicide or were murdered a few years later only increases the air of exploitation. But they were probably desperate to get in front of the Morrissey camera anyway. There is probably no worse way to spend a Saturday night, but at least it brings a specific time and place vividly to life.
