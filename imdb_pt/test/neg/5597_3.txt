After seeing the movie in a class of mine and talking to the filmmaker, I found out exactly why the movie bombarded how it happened. The creators of the film had no intention of calling the film "8MM 2". Originally the movie was called "The Velvet Side of Hell," but it was changed at the last minute by Sony Pictures to 8MM 2 without letting the filmmakers have any opinion on the subject. In doing so, this took them out of the releases and sentenced them to a direct release for the video, with a minimum of publicity. <br /> <br /> Once again, this is from the mouth of the filmmaker, not mine, so I really can not. Tell me what's true and what's hype. <br /> <br /> If you look at the movie as "Velvet Side of Hell", it's not that bad. Not great, but not horrible. Basically it would just be a B movie that likes to show breasts. But as a sequel to "8MM", the movie fails terribly.
