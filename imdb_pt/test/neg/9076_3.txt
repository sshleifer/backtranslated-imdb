Other reviews talked about how frank this movie is, especially in terms of male frontal nudity. Well, those who have seen the Grande Ecole with their often naked actors and expect something similar are in for a big disappointment. In addition to a few seconds in the judo team's locker room, the side-by-side shower lasts for a total of 15 seconds. Female leadership has comparatively brief frontal moments. Much of the marketing of this film is aimed at the gay male audience, but those who expect even a hint of homoeroticism between the two male leaders (best friends who have a trio with one of their girlfriends) will be very disappointed. There is not even the hint that one is interested in the other, or even aware that the other is part of the menage a trois. As a film, Douches Froides is curiously non-engaging; the viewer has very little sense of who these three young people are, how they are feeling, why they behave like them. About an hour from the original cut was deleted; maybe that's why the finished film seems frustratingly underdeveloped. Staying with Grande Ecole, a French film that more than meets its promises.
