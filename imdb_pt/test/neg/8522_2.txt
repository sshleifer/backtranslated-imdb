The Messengers is a bad, generic and boring horror film. The film has a big problem: it does not scare. The performances and the script are totally stupid. He uses ancient tricks to scare and all supernatural events do. I would not call The Messengers a bad movie ... I'd say it's an accidental comedy because it's so bad it makes you laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it's short, so this crap will not stay with us for long. There are many horror masterpieces that count on a low budget (such as Subject Two, Lucky or May) that are sadly ignored while that crap is a blockbuster. So, I do not do that. I recommend this weak and pathetic horror film that is called The Messengers.
