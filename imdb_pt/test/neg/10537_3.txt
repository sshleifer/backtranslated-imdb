This is, for different reasons, a very bad action movie. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and fat, plays as if he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or simple replacement. Second, your opponent is a very weak villain. It is a smart and evil masterbrain and Chestnut does not deliver. So what about action? Well, the two parts are filmed permanently in different places of the prison of Alcatraz. They shoot wild and evil, because compared to the amount of ammunition required, the body weight is quite low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not a single good line and not one good joke. The small psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So, what does that have? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion, bullet-riddled doors and 1000-watt lights shining through the holes, characters jumping through the air as they shoot, heaps of weapons coming out of nowhere, a long black coat containing a bold and a box of fine wood containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the last take, a hopeless approach to relieving the final credits. The Californian sailor Don Michael Paul was writing and driving. At least this mountain of boredom comes from just a simple mind.
