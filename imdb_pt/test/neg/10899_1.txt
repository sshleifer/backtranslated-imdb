If you just want blood, and nothing but blood and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want at least a little good acting, logic, history, consistencies, or even a good face ending, go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I could not help but think of myself, "Jeeeez, are these people mentally challenged?" Example, after being chased and seeing other mutilated people, the lead actress meets a police officer and conveys the story to the policeman with tears and everything and tells about the psychopath who drives on a yellow truck. The yellow truck parks and the officer just walks over to him, talks to the guy and the truck leaves without a problem. The actress leaves and says why did not you arrest him? And then the truck runs over the cop ... after being hit, the truck stops on the road about 6 feet away, standing there while the actress tries to drag the cop away, but he's too heavy. (At the time) At that moment the truck backs down and runs over the policemen's leg twice. The truck then moves away. Why the actress did not pick up the gun is beyond me? (Which later she shoots the cop in the head twice because the psychopath was about to burn him alive) Once through the mouth, she did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * Roll eyes * Soon after that, she walks away to escape the bathroom that was going to explode and when she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the cop is no longer there ... OK ... * > Another example, the lead actress finds a woman trapped in the bathroom, she spits like a gallon of blood on the floor, covering about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress goes out to get a towel, she comes back and everything disappears. : / They do not explain why everyone keeps disappearing too. Dumb ass dumb. <br /> <br /> I like horror movies / thriller / gore, but this one was really dumb. I lost brain cells watching this dribble and you should not either.
