What a bad movie, the premise was all there, the actors were all there. And yet, a plausible plot, a good dialogue, characters to relate to were a little absent. <br /> <br /> The typical assumption of wrong assault was against a backdrop of every man being hit by the system. The main character Tye and his younger brother were unlucky and their home will be recovered, along with godfather Matt Dillon (who does not look much older than Tye, so does not know exactly how it happened) to the rescue with a plan steal money from an armored van in which they work as security guards. Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience, but decides to go along with her. And so begins a really horrible hole set up 30 minutes of unbelievable crap. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic, but let me point out the main ones: <br /> <br /> Because Tye decides to be a cool guy because a homeless has become a collateral damage, all his close friends, including his godfather, die. His godfather is supposed to be the family and the man who brought him to the last minute trap to help him die because of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and the godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house. And yet he chose Matt Dillon's supposed family. <br /> <br /> There are many more, needless to say that this movie was foolish and I sincerely hope no one else sees it.
