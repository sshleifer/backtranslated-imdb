I was a fan of the movie AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and so I was curious to know if a later sequence of 16 years could be made with the French language and with the main, secondary and secondary characters. Tonight I watched the version "edited for the FOX Network" which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequences. The writers and directors honor some of the main concepts of the plot: The tourist gets the wolf bite, the full moon leaves, the boy meets the girl, the boy becomes a beast, the boy dies heroically after the help of the ghost victim . For me, the strangest aspect of this "formula" teen horror special-ride effect was the cast of teacher-love interest in TV comedy "ED" as one of the baseless victims of the werewolf who is more or less totally unfriendly in the lines of script that they delivered to her. I have not seen another horror movie that this movie is sequelling, but I think parts of it must explain how werewolves villains (they are paranormal) are threatening the "good" werewolf couple for a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict on a Paris subway train, at SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a strange hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes, but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely mined, in my opinion. Such a strange rewrite of the werewolves legend and the "cinema mythology"!?! My suggestion to those who are considering this at the video store - choose a classic "top of the line" thriller: Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
