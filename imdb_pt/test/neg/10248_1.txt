For bad moviegoers, Galaxina is a real gem. With a truly horrific dialogue, acting and direction, there is no choice for people looking for a suitable film. But as one of the most intentionally hilarious films of its kind, it's invaluable for a good laugh. In particular, scenes involving the Harley Davidson motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten really fail, but since she's playing an android, I suppose someone might excuse her for acting out of wood. <br /> <br /> Bad movie lovers, do not go through this!
