Of course, I'm not a fan of Monogram Chan movies. . The plot, involving radio theft of a bank vault, is a bit far and far from the atmospheric mysteries that Fox produced. Manteland Moreland and Benson Fong (as the third son Tommy) give a few laughs as usual. But on the other hand there is not much here. Great title that is wasted.
