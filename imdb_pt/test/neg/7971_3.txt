First I have to say I read all about it and I know it from the inside out, and I was excited to finally see it too. But you have to read only the book in which this mini-series is based to realize that it is not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is vaguely based on facts, the rest is taken from the screenwriter's imagination. And, unfortunately, these changes are anything but successful and almost totally unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names Mitya and Lushka until the romance began, and during the film Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet who chased Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The scene of "seduction" when their romance began, Violet was much more passive than depicted here and certainly did not kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, all these examples were included when the series was just beginning. In addition to all these changes of the facts, the characterizations are also wrong. Sometimes Vita behaves like a crazy woman. Especially the scene she saw in the Violet newspaper engagement announcement is just ridiculous. Vita kept her outbursts of emotion inside. It was Violet who was moody and let her feelings (good or bad) show up. All Vita did when she read was that she almost fainted, that's all. Being a gentle nature, Harold avoided clashes in real life, but here he is sometimes very stern and accusatory. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know this series has focused purposefully on Vita and Harold, but that does not mean that all other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. Here she is a totally one-dimensional character, and the lines given to her are, most of the time, embarrassingly superficial. In fact, she was intelligent, talented, an extraordinary woman who rarely gave her the credit she deserved. I always thought she was a much more interesting person than Vita. In this series, his unhappiness, loneliness and his problems with his mother are totally ignored. The viewer also has little notion of his past and family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how much she fought against Vita. Vita was the only love of his life, his reason for being, and if Harold suffered during the case, Violet too. After that, her life was in ruins and it took time for her to be able to recover again. Statue could have acted like Denys, the depth his character has. Lady Sackville-West is just a poorly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with an exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series ends with the scene totally badly written in Amiens, and that was the end of this case, according to the writer. No, it continued a whole year after that, and the ending was much more persistent and sad than what was presented here. But what do you care about the stupid end, if the whole series was stupid from the beginning. I have to give some credit to the actors, they tried to make the best of these roles given to them, although Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one that really shines. We also can not claim the settings. All complaints go to the director and, above all, screenwriter. Instead of insightful character studies, there are many sex scenes and bland talk. Many of the scenes are very long, some are useless and do not bring anything to the story line. On the other hand, many details are shortened or omitted altogether. Especially there should have been more information about the youth of Vita and Violet, and how their friendship developed. This is a fascinating story that would have deserved a much better adaptation. Maybe some day somebody will do that. At the moment you can do much more of this story by reading the book itself or the letters from Violet to Vita, which are brilliant things.
