I suggest that if you've seen the original American Graffiti, do not watch this movie. If you have not seen the original, I still do not recommend it, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. The characters in the first movie are great and, in the end, you connect to them. This movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. It is a difficult task to watch! <br /> <br /> On New Year's Eve in 1964, 65, 66 and 67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film. In 1964, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat), who is now a professional driver. He meets a foreign girl, Eva, and although his plot is not going anywhere, it's the best of the four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith) who is stuck in Vietnam and, more than anything, wants to leave. He tries to find ways to get hurt or do stupid things to get out. At 66, we have Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl that Toad got in the first movie. Now she's a hippie smoking marijuana, and I'm really not sure what her plot was. It was her going to a concert ... not much happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) are having marriage problems that end in an anti-war rally and police action. <br /> <br /> None of these stories are very good. The script in some parts presents a very, very bad dialogue. These poor characters that I liked so much in the first movie, ended up where they are here ... why? Why was this sequel made? I think if a sequel was made, it would have to display the Vietnam War, and hippies and police action, but the real thing is that this movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The direction was stylish, but this ends up in a huge headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is just a regular wide screen (depending on how you watch it), and it's filmed like the rest of the movie should be. The plot of the frog was filmed in 16mm, and that equates to a poor-looking photo that is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen. Debbie's plot is filmed on multiple screens. At one point, there may have been a screen, but for the good majority, it's two to twenty screens at a time. Do not bother trying to follow the screens as long as there is nothing going on anyway. The plot of Steve and Laurie has the weirdest filming style. It's style really means nothing and it's dull and tasteless. Instead of just a full widescreen, it's a widescreen condensed that looks like a widescreen full-screen version. Although I do not like the others, at least I understand what they were wanting, this one just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Music is the saving grace of this movie, not that it can save it. ! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have cool songs here. They do not save the feature, they just make it a bit better than it is. It's still bad! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a meaningless sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this dull sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 110 min. PG for language, drug use and violence
