Now, I'll do this without spoilers if I can. My cousin and I were renting movies the other weekend, and we stumbled on it, with the big astonished 'scarecrow on the cover. It seemed cool, so we rented next to Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Just ... Wow. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the movie was horrible. Now the box art, the opening scenes and the music have been decently done, but the movie itself is awful. The acting is insignificant (Sean, the leader, shows almost no emotion and / or effort in his character), the scarecrows look nothing like the cover (False advertising, maybe?), And the camera's photos and angles were that of a bad wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a fan of wrestling. I know bad camera angles. And honestly, that's right there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's so bad it amuses me. That makes me laugh. So somehow, this movie takes its place as a good comedy for me. <br /> <br /> But to be fair, it serves as what to do and what not to do in the movies, especially in the slasher. genre. I recommend that people watch this, just to get a good sense of what to avoid.
