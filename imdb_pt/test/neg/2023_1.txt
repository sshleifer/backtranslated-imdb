Considering they wanted to make a vampire movie in space, I thought, "Well, it will probably be very tacky, but at least interesting enough to see a different version of the entire genre." Oops I do not care what kind of movies you like; even if you're the biggest fan of vampires, horror, suspense or suspense in the world, or adversely, if you've never seen a horror movie before and would expect your first to be awesome anyway ... you're wrong. I do not think I've ever seen a "made for TV movie" or special after-school so bad. I've never seen a TV show show it so badly. I've never seen pictures of animals sleeping or shitting that is as bad as that. This is by far the biggest waste of hours you could spend contemplating the importance of dish towels and their effects on your life. I'd rather be stuck in a bathroom for weeks with nothing to consume except my own urine and excrement than watching a single clip of that movie again. Watching this made me long for the fates that the characters fell instead of dealing with knowing that I paid money to watch it. It was, however, like a train accident: so bad that you just could not stop watching, hoping something good could happen. This did not happened. Please, for God's sake, if you or your friends - even using illicit substances while doing this - even consider watching this movie, choose a contest to see who can shoot farther on a rocket. It will bring much more pleasure and entertainment.
