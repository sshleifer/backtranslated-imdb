I have seen many Japanese horrors and I have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are pretty much the same. this is no exception. the ghost is a black-haired girl who scares her victims, doing nothing but walking and looking dead ... the difference is only the reason for the haunting. the rest is the same all the time: black haired girl, strange things happening with some media (photos), weird acting. While watching this movie I always wondered why I was wasting my time watching things that someone did a lot better before. some really cool scenes, I'm going to give 3 out of 10
