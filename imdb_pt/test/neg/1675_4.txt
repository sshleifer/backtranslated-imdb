When this movie was made in 1980, I was a teenager at the football stands playing as part of the audience. This was done in Mooseheart, Illinois. The large letters spelling "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the bleachers were covered with a banner in the film. The director would tell us to say loudly at certain points, as if a touchdown was being made. The St. Charles Juvenile Correctional Center is a real place less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, though I think it has closed recently. During a scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Just below them, you can see the head of my sister Noel (she was 11 at the time). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of her head, but when I saw her on TV in 1981 I could see her whole head and my sister Jacqui as well. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie itself was OK for one made for the TV movie. Since there is already a description of the film here, I do not need to repeat it. Worth seeing at least once.
