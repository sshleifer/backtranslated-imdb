It turns out that I got this on TV and wanted to watch it because I remembered the Spin magazine article the movie is based on. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the lead actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it is not exactly a first-rate production. Gregory Hines was a world class dancer, but unfortunately he is not a great actor. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the acting in this film is flat or obscure, which can only be attributed to the director, who is the weakest link in this film. Charles Carner seemed to be trying to imitate Oliver Stone's "JFK" by portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the "real" killer of children, but without the benefit of a good script, a cast from a list or, it must be said the talent. It just does not work. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that such a valuable topic for a movie has not been better treated.
