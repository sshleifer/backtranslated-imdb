I'm sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this show at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's decent in terms of music, but the presentation is just boring - great time. Most of the songs sound the same and chief screenwriter Jeff Lynne is as excited as a store mannequin. He has a nice voice, but he is not much to watch. He stands in one place and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. All the songs sound like chewing gum music from the 1970s and 1980s: pleasant but not exciting. <br /> <br /> Lynn is accompanied by a very beautiful woman, Rosie Vela, but she is also not very excited. The only song - of 23 - that creates some emotion is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven". Now if only a few of the other 22 songs had this excitement, it could have been a much better concert DVD.
