A blackface man lands on a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some kind of cabin with a monkey. He connects her with a telephone and she teaches Charleston. Then they fly into the spacecraft, leaving the monkey behind. Indifferent blackface inducer aside, this short film does not make sense. I think it's the plot, but I'm not sure for a long shot. You can not say that this is Renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. Good slow motion usage, though. It can be found in the 18 Film Experimental Film series of the NY Film Annex, I believe.
