If you want to truly experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, then check out "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not this. Alien Factor is really quite imaginative considering the low budget and it's quite scary, but "Nightbeast", which I think is sort of an Alien Factor update, is just plain dumb. Actors sleep through their roles, especially Sheriff Monotone, and the monster is an idiot type of Halloween mask instead of the bizarre (but stupid) creatures of the Alien Factor. A spaceship falls to Earth and there is a bug inside, of course, that runs around steaming people. And ripping off his arms, etc. And he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too, until it is fired from his hand. And that's really about it. "Alien Factor" overcomes this mess, if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, check it out. E RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
