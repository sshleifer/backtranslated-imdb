OK, when I was little (and I mean like 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) Barney was one of my favorite shows. I grew up with that and played all my old Barney tapes. So one day while I'm flipping through channels, I see that Barney now happens in a wagon, and I thought, "Um, is this the right show?" When I realized I was, I was scared. Why did they change the scenery from a school show to a CABOOSE? Since then, the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason I'm giving it a 2 is a) because I'm cool, b) because of Riff, and c) because in the old days the show was tolerable. Now I hate it. HATE. <br /> <br /> 2/10
