A new wrestling show clears the way for the most feared fighter ever imagined, the giant Zeus. Network president Brell does everything in his power to entice WWF Rip champion to the square circle to face Zeus in the "Battle of the Hard Faces" championship. But Zeus is unlike any competitor Rip has ever faced. <br /> <br /> Normally I would give Hogan some freedom as a wrestler in a movie role, however this movie did not ask the Hulkster to do much of the movie. For a while, he simply asked Hogan to play alone, which he failed miserably. 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort like the mighty Zeus, but even his work left the movie without something, that is, acting! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you want with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes on.
