This movie about a man on the run for killing a mafioso is the kind of movie that you can watch totally in rapid advance, once you know who is who, and you do not lose anything. It has a compelling cast, but the plot is a virtual writer's guide to cliche movies, and the kid makes the clunk dialogue!
