Usual horrible movie ... I will not bother you about the synopsis, just join The Core, Armageddon, a bad military planner and one or two Solve-All Nukes and you'll get the movie if I can call it that way. <br /> <br /> Seriously, nuclear weapons in this type of film are more useful than the knives of the Swiss army: the Big One is approaching? Nuke a few places and it's over ... A tornado wants to destroy "Enter the important city name here"? Nuke "Insert another important city here" ... A volcano erupts? Nuke this! Is a nuke about to explode? Nuke this! Coffee is cold? Nuke this! Did not you like Transformers? Nuke yourself, but I can not guarantee that it will fix things ... In the end, how many movies like this can be made before you start copying each other? I doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke ...
