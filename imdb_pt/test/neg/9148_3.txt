The positives: it's very well filmed. It has some interesting peripheral characters. Main character (although weak). <br /> <br /> The bad: Plot / story. Wasted characters. Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of silly movies, but this movie is unmistakably bad. I do not understand how anyone can hand $ 12M to this Guy Jenkin. And before continuing, I just want to say that I do not dislike Jessica Alba - I really wanted to like her in this movie. However, Jessica Alba in her fake accent and her poses model made me miserable. She has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she spoils every scene she's in. Needless to say, the novel is not so believable (not a bit). <br /> <br /> All I saw was The actors were flapping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with the little bit given them - but unfortunately, all this movie does is sink. There is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing is gained. It's a very empty movie.
