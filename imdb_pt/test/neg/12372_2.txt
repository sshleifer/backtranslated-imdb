This terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the obvious moost is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet that floats around the cheap games without ever flapping wings (as if on a string, perhaps?) While attacking model trains and toy cars. Is "science" asinine - an atomic Masonic weapon? And what about the huge amount of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I think the '50s were the decade of Slimeball! Well, this bird puppet apparently comes from "some antimatter universe abandoned by God," and is here to build a nest and lay eggs in New York. Seriously. That they can kill the doll is almost a shame. I give you 1 pound of 4 - it's silly and stupid, but a lot of fun than Armageddon. : = 8)
