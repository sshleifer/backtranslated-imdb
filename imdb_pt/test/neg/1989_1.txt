This movie is worse than "sky gate" or "outer space plane 9". I do not know why he won an Oscar, he should have gotten a million raspberries, just like the audience that left or did not show up in the first place. The hospital was a top-notch financial flop, but I'm sure that the elite classes of left-wing and hard-nosed intellectuals complained that the American public was too plebeian to enjoy biting social commentaries when they saw it and in it. George C Scott, in one of the most naive and embarrassing roles, along with the aged sexual symbol, Diana Rigg, spends most of the film trying to curse more and more blas√© as they advance on a foolish plane. Poor George is impotent and is crushed by the event, but after much dirty language between him and Rigg, he rapes her several times on a lovely night in a NYC hospital that looks so disgusting that I would not want a pet rat dying treated in it. There is also some sacrilegious junk food dialogue thrown from side to side, full of swearing as well. He concludes by portraying the erroneous notion that unusual stress without physical effort always causes cardiac arrest. I never want to see another minute of this horrible movie again.
