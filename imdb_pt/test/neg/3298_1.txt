What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of malicious, hateful and spoiled children, and parents who are determined to be cool, as opposed to being parents? Sorry, I do not understand. The only episode I could barely catch the eye involved was one of the children demanding a Bar Mitzvah, intent on getting thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course, the idiot mother decides that her precious junior has to have the biggest party of all and it's okay to lose 20 grand at the big event. The mad, brain-dead, crazy teenage daughter goes back and forth between wanting to be Jewish and then Catholic when she sees "cute" religious tutors. The only "comforting" moment on the entire episode frontier was when the father of a father, who was convinced all along that the Bar Mitzvah is merely a scheme to make money, is the son studying his lessons from Hebrew, and momentarily led to think that perhaps their conniving offspring would be to be sincere about the right of passage to masculinity. This hot, diffused sensation is immediately ripped from his chest when he informs Junior that since he has not had bris yet, a certain "procedure" needs to be performed. The Bar Mitzvah is canceled, and the mother leaves with several thousand dollars when the boy refuses to obey. <br /> <br /> This show is rubbish, and I'm sad to never go back to the 23 minutes of my life I lost watching this piece of crap, because nothing else was on TV ...
