All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like the Jim Wynorski movies, I really like it. I mean, the Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies that tried to be good. But that was hardly funny ... I mean, I think it was because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, horrible CGI. It seems ... terrible. And the film has no blood or nudity as redeeming qualities. It is classified as PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater" that you know will not be a blockbuster movie, you know you probably will not have a clever script. A movie like that may depend on gore ... but no. It does not depend on anything, it's just ... crap. Check it out, if you want to laugh, though. But do not expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski goes back to films like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV, because that's Komodo vs.. Cobra is not cutting.
