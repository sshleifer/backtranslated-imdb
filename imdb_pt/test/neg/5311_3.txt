The first 10 minutes of the movie make fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the two reasons why the film is so bad. They constantly refer to a movie called "Get Leo," which is the movie version of a short film. Every time they do that, you will be really angry. Travolta is not very cool nor Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are hilarious. They are not the kind of funny you'd expect to see in a Elmore Leonard movie. If you have not seen being short, you'll probably like being cool. If you like to keep quiet, you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
