SPOILERS ALL: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film completely differed from the book (not that the book was exactly a classic, but really it was very good). <br /> <br /> I think Demi Moore was fine. In fact, I do not remember much of his performance one way or another. However, the big disappointment was not with Mrs. Moore. <br /> <br /> Why did anyone who did the rewrite suddenly decide to make the millionaire have a heart? (I'm referring to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the movie and then in the book version - just another change). <br /> <br /> People who have not read the book obviously won, I do not know that something is different, but in the BOOK version this guy is much more ruthless and complex in general. He is also fascinating. The fact that such a big change has been made in the movie alters the whole plot. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> I know that MANY movies vary a lot from books. But I also thought that Redford's character was a bit of a coward. This is not Redford's fault (He is a great actor and could have played quite relentlessly) but without these qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love, so the story becomes just another clich√© love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. This was not really the purpose of the book. <br /> <br /> This could have been so much better. Even if I had not read the version of the book I would not have liked it that much, but changing too much around definitely takes, for me, some points down.
