A family of dirt farmers move west. <br /> <br /> The head of the new heterogeneous brood of Walnut Grove is called 'Charles'. He works at the sawmill, but whoever in hell thinks he's cutting all the wood is a mystery, because none of the residents of the whole town have enough money to buy a barb, let alone a two-percent coin. four. Running the town is the 'Olsons', a rich but stupid clan who moved to these parts in order to collect all the mass they make by selling eggs for eleven cents a dozen. They have two sons, a boy, 'Willie', and a girl, 'Nellie', who among them has only one savior feature ... Nellie is hot and it's fun to spy on her when she bathed in cricket. town is also a village idiot because he thinks he really is something special to this bunch of country sertanejos when in reality they do not support his boring sermons and the only thing they do is pray. because on Sunday it is for him to fall from the nearest cliff as fast as possible. <br /> <br /> The town doctor is a dinosaur who saw his best days about 20 years ago, but he stays around to be able to give free breast exams to the old witches who live in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these old, hot mothers kneel is to take a piece of bread from the oven to deliver to the Doctor for his services. But it's okay with Doc because he knows these old prostitutes give him some good bread. <br /> <br /> Creating the back of this colorful collection of potato chips is the caricature wife of Charles, Carolyn, and their three girls. Mary ',' Carrie 'and' Half-Pint '. Mary is another hottie that all guys take a peek at every time they shower or crap. Carrie is an annoying child, but put a cookie in her mouth and you will not even know she's there, in fact, where is she? ... oh, there she is ... she's in the yard playing with a bunch of cigarettes ... how cute! Half-Pint is the youngest cheat in town. She may not have a brain or any body type to talk to, but she may spit further than any boy in the whole damn school. <br /> <br /> It's a big city, Walnut Grove, where someone is always falling off a roof or being hit by a wagon wheel, and it's beautiful, too, made of a building ... the church / school / city hall / pool room. Oh, it's a little hairy on the prairie, but that's fine, especially when Mary is bathing in the cricket ... that's when you can see how hairy really is.
