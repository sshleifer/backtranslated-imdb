... so where's my fucking trophy? I really hoped a banner and a confetti would drop off my ceiling to watch a full 30 minutes of that crap. Comedy Central is really missing the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by Chappelle with several seasons of a retarded man passing by retarded men. Dah duh nah !! If you pay attention to the show, you'll notice that when Mencia is not stuttering because of his jokes and laughing at his own sketches, he just makes exaggerated remarks that seem to have no sense of humor. Have you noticed how people in the Buick unit really slow down? It's like Dah duh nah! Even the dwarves and half-chicks can not distract from Mencia's lack of talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wetback" as he constantly and inflexibly proclaims that he is, which makes him a fraud at the top of everything. <br /> <br /> If anything good can be said about Mencia, it is your effort. The man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows he's trying.
