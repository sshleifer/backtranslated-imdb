My brother and I are big fans of Asian movies, so by finding this movie hidden in a store, I bought this one on DVD because it sounded very promising and I could not wait to watch it. So I watched this movie with my brother and I must say that at first it was very promising. We both really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. But I think that was all. There are some interesting fights, but it's not an action movie, as it claims to be. Instead it's a love movie ... with the love clich√© so extremely touched on over, even Shakespeare would vomit on that title. Sorry for my language. By the way: Do the characters act like being picked up from the street and given 100 ?? to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, my brother and I watch until the end, because we think, it can only get better. But that never happened. This movie challenged the # 1 place in my and my brothers' worst ever seen movies "list, followed only by" Fantasy Mission Force "- do not watch it either.
