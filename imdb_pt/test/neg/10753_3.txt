I found this movie completely and totally incomprehensible. I knew some of the facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and confused. The images were strangely interesting, but I was looking more for a biographical and / or critical account of Caravaggio's life and works, not an LSD-type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time through the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely disturbing. If it had been labeled as an "art film," I would not have bought the DVD; now I have a DVD that I never watch again and who would buy it? I prefer conventional films, not those that require translation or elucidation. Thumbs down on this one for me!
