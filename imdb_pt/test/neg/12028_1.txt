This was honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. the acting was horrible, the plot was bad too. However, it was a good idea. If this movie had better kinematics, and much better actors, I could have something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great gothic writer, and this movie just destroyed it. Why do people always have to kill good stories by making bad movies? the only good part was when the killer put his head under the ground with a tape, that was very good. the oscillating ax was simply awful, there was absolutely no suspense. and also when the killer is chasing everyone around in the end, he was going from one place to another in just a few seconds, it makes absolutely no sense.
