First of all, I would like to clarify that I consider this one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I watched almost 10 times just because I wanted to spread the deliciously tasteless bowels of this movie to other innocent victims. It has the captivating essence of a handheld camera recording of the seventh birthday of a distant nephew. It has all the writing of a WWE game. And above all, it has the consistency of a face scraped along a sidewalk. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an almost instantaneous mutilation of three drunken teenagers in the desert. This scene convinced me that I was in for something big when I chose this movie from the DVD (being pulled into the box because of a velociraptor graphic shouting the word "RAPTOR" in front of it). The scene contains treasures like tomato sauce, spaghetti intestines, vain attempts of humor and rubbery dinosaur dolls that are repeated throughout the film. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The film contains erratic scenarios and use of props that makes the mind melt with the thought that someone could have so little shame when it comes to creating a movie. An example is when a truck, in the middle of the night, is parked next to a cliff wall. The next day, they find him in an open grassy area. The driver could not have driven there since he had his face bitten by a carnivorous anonymous biped (I'll explain why he's anonymous in a second). So my only guess is that either the velociraptor drove it, the cattle that the driver was carrying did it, or Jim Wynorski does not think very well about his viewers. Hell, on one side they expect me to believe they are walking down the main street at night when the road has no gutters, the fire hydrant is precariously placed next to a telephone booth, and there is only a single street light. Still, I feel compelled to watch and watch this movie again, only to be able to find more things that will make me laugh the next time I watch it. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The direction of this movie is horrible. Long prolonged breaks. Strange cuts to characters who were not even in the general vicinity of the conversation. People argue things casually while facing the camera (and in turn, make them face the wall). They can not even give the dinosaur a coherent species, changing between calling it a baby dinosaur and using a rubber velociraptor puppet (distinguished by the disproportionate, very long, fat claw). This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The issue is prominent in this movie. This is not a good thing. I am well aware that the film is a collection of scenes from other films, masterfully crafted in a single crap, but there has to be a limit! Subdivisions end as abruptly as they began. Explanations for the sudden disappearance of characters not limited to, well, not being explained at all! And an end that seemed to drive a muscle car on a brick wall without a seat belt. You never know what will happen because the film does not follow a coherent structure. This movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Now, let me just mention a single scene (the largest one) that occurs near the end. This is a spoiler, but not really. The final scene contains a confrontation between Tyrannosaurus rex and Sheriff Tanner. It's like the clash between Sigourney Weaver and the Foreign Queen in Strangers, except without all the emotional power / budget / epic battles. It's pretty consists of Tanner forcing the dinosaur with a piece of construction machinery. A white lynx. In a span of several minutes, through a series of slippery cuts, the director manages to turn the white lynx into a yellow forklift / crane machinery. Now, as I said, I know this movie is made from scenes from other movies, but what movies do you guarantee a confrontation with a t-rex in a construction vehicle? This movie is a masterpiece. <br/> <br/> This movie earns 1/10 for the quality of the movie, but a 10/10 for how much it makes me laugh and have fun.
