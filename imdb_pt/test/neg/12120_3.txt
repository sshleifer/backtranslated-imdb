Most of the positive comments posted here are as detailed as the movie! It takes a long breath to enjoy a tedious and boring movie, it is assumed. Some have just called the film "contemplative," which means it is slow and devoid of plot, however, a Dutch reviewer has hit it right: this is a major event turned into a bland movie whose tone takes place in the first scene. Here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on. So do all the other characters! <br /> <br /> The only silences in this photo are sequences of dreams - the fragments of Soviet propaganda of 1930 - and they are also their most interesting parts. This tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is. <br /> <br /> The device to shoot most scenes in extreme close-ups - as if someone were looking through a crack in the blinds - gets old fast.
