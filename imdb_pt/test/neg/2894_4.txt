This is a very annoying movie, with poorly developed characters, subplots that lead to nothing, and only act tolerably. It appears as an ill-conceived fraud of "2001". <br /> <br /> The only thing worthwhile are the scenery, costumes and visual effects. But even that was not enough to keep me from slumbering. I would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the space flight sequence, for the nights when I have difficulty falling asleep.
