Two things are always signs that you will be watching a bad movie: 1) If you are immediately reminded of other movies like THE FINISHER, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If there is a death during a sex scene right after the title sequence <br /> <br /> There is actually a third sign of warning and this is a caption that indicates a lazy exposition alerting the poor ignorant public naive of the dangers of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 begins with a caption alerting us to corporate greed in the future, followed by a sequence of titles that reminded me of TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER, followed by a death during a sex scene! Hey, do not you think I'll be watching a bad movie by accident? <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this is a bad movie. It's basically a series of action scenes written around a nude plot of a cyborg escaping from a greedy corporate company. It is poorly written, directed and acted out and most especially it is poorly lit, which means it is very difficult to see what is happening on the screen, although I am not entirely sure that this is really a bad thing. The only interest we have is that it is the film premiere of Angelina Jolie, who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line "They are lovely, I wonder if they are real?", Which is something I I always ask when I see one of your movies.
