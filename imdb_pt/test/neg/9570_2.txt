What I miss most about this movie is that it leaves no room for imagination, everything is said. It's like a documentary, but not as good as a documentary, because it's not a documentary. A patchwork movie without a continuous story. Very superficial, nothing to think about, because the movie already tells you what you should think. Many different problems are touched, but none is solved to make you think. I do not even know if it's a funny movie that wants to be serious or a serious movie that wants to be funny. Many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is rather poor. The movie is very annoying.
