! SOFT SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I do not think Arnie's action / adventure movies are good. They're better than your comedies for sure, but that hardly says much. The problem I have with all of their action blockbusters is that they are exaggerated and without any kind of morality. Morality? I mentioned in my review of TERMINATOR 2 the scene where the good guy Terminator rips out the SWAT team's kneecaps. We should think that, as the hero lets people do their work, instead of killing them, let's somehow admire him? This is the problem with ERASER, when the character of James Cann is revealed as a traitor within the US Marshal's department, Arnie's character, John Kruger, runs away with a witness he is protecting, but in several subsequent sequences, Kruger kills a fairly large one. number of marshals working with the villain. Are we all traitors too? Surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop Kruger because the bad guy told them that Kruger was the traitor? It is a rather uncomfortable thought that Kruger killed several people who were actually trying to keep the law. <br /> <br /> Despite costing a hundred million dollars, the special effects are not so impressive. See the scene in which Kruger loosens the jet's wing and shuffles to place a parachute. It's obvious how the action interweaves that it's a stunt double making the free fall sequence while Arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a movie that features unnecessary CGI with killer alligators, not just unnecessary computer graphics, but unconvincing CGI as well. There are also some plot holes like in the opening scene, involving a couple of witness protection people that the mafia has achieved. Kruger opens a suitcase and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire, thus throwing the perfume mafia. Kruger is then seen rearranging the dental records via computer of the couple he saved. Would it be logical to do this, but would ALL the dental records of couples be kept on the computer? And the most important of all is that we believe that the US Marshal's Department will keep a freezer full of bodies for such events? <br /> <br /> So, you go, a typical Arnie thriller for a long time, with improbable parts and insufficient intelligence. and it is interesting to note that ERASER did not make much of a profit at the box office, as production costs far outstripped potential audiences. After ERASER, Arnie did not do much more at the box office, except for TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES which was an event movie and it will be interesting to see if he will be remembered as a politician instead of a movie star.
