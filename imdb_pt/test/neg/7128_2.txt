All the way though I was thinking to myself "Oh god why!" Right at the beginning I thought, "Okay, it could be medium," but the acting and storyline were mostly atrocious. <br /> <br /> Each part was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed bare. great resemblance to the ring, was a half decent movie, but that seemed to take all the good things about the first one and made them terrible. Some pieces made everyone in the audience get wet, Eg. The part where Geller fell from the building made me stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to calm down. I kept talking about what was about to happen next, and more often than not I was right. <br /> <br /> Why does entering the house make you come after you? does not make sense. It was a lousy excuse for many murders, and no depth was seen. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that comes, which ends up leaving you feeling that there was no sense in watching. Oh she's after her ... did not see a coming * yawn *. <br /> <br /> Certainly these people must have thought of ... oh I do not know, carry a knife or at least try and retaliate instead of being eaten but someone hair? At best during the movie I was a little scared (and I mean gently), I was just clamoring for the credits, as they rolled I exhaled a short "Oh, thank God". If you have not already, do not waste your time and money on it; useless, plot less excuse sorry for a sequel!
