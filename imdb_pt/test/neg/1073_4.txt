I could not relate to this movie. I'm surprised people are praising being so "realistic." How many people in your school have been victims of incest? How many homosexual athletes in the closet were there? How many quiet people you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm OK, you would not even know if they were. But in fact, these are explosive problems that many of us never deal with. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could have been exploited. But, hey, where's the 'entertainment' in that? <br /> <br /> With regard to the girl who committed suicide - I found it an exploit. In fact, I think a lot of people in High School sometime feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what does someone have to commit suicide in just one more day of being ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided that this girl would commit suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide to make it even more provocative. I did not buy this as a real-life scenario. <br /> <br /> And the problems of the other students with whom I did not completely identify myself. Bullying is exploited, but this has been done to the death, we all know it continues and it is really a matter of resolution within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft, another cliché is released. That's really one thing, lots of clichés. I guessed the ending in the beginning. There was a predictable unpredictability, if that makes sense. You have all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought, what's the point of this character, unless she's the innocent victim of suicide? And sure enough ... <br /> <br /> One thing I'm going to say, and it's the saving grace of the movie, is that it does NOT glamorize suicide. Suicide is very graphic and heart breaking to watch. It's a powerful scene (no matter how artificial it is) and one that rejects suicide as the easiest option. But the film is not really very imaginative and used stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Not bad, but certainly not innovative OR worthy of a 17-minute ovation in Cannes ???
