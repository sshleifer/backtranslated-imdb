I really did not get this movie because I'm not a pervert like you, who likes lesbian things. <br /> <br /> The girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny (her lips are so silicone!), but she is very weak and insecure. She tries to go out as a surfer (better than dressing as a bitch, but still strange and definitely out of fashion); the film does not explain why she is trying to pretend to be a man. Ah, of course, to "catch" the poor dumb girl. I forgot. She makes all those silly inventions that are not funny, and she's a terrible actress. Besides, that sloppy look is so OUTSIDE! <br /> <br /> This blonde and stupid Melrose Place girl plays (surprised) a blonde dumb. <br /> <br /> She thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! They even do! Hey! I think this part was kind of funny.
