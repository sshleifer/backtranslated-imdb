The movie of this evening's course was The Legend of the Suram Fortress and during its 87 minutes of duration, it was able to jump quickly to my five most difficult films of all time. This is difficult to watch; movies so different from everything you are seeing something totally alien. A brief synopsis would be: a group of Georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from the invaders, but every time they are about to make the finishing touches, for no apparent reason, it collapses. Then they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want the fortress to stand, they need to find a young, tall, blond-eyed boy to be buried in one of the walls during construction and their presence. will ensure that the construction work will complete without problems. And surely, in those final moments, he is happily being smeared with cement and eggs, laughing as he is buried alive, with only his mother suffering. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's a simple story. But the director, Sergo Paradjanov, working in Soviet Georgia in 1984, not long after leaving a fifteen-year prison, does not follow any of the filming rules we are accustomed to. There are very few closes. Often the action we need to follow is hidden in the lower left corner of a landscape photo, extraordinarily easy to miss. There are few closes and sometimes it's hard to say who do what to whom and why. From time to time, the film takes part in digressions that have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer. The music is totally crazy, with sounds found, screen instruments and church organ fallen in seemingly random ways. Sometimes, when nothing seems to be happening, someone will break into a template, almost playing time until the next scene appears. But annoyingly there's an obvious cinematic voice behind everything, so you're bound to try to understand the message, whatever it is. One of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you can not believe what you are seeing.
