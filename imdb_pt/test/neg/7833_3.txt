A quick resume: Almost non-existent, poorly chosen musical soundtrack, slow-motion footage made without the constant, but with a lot of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, without plot, and nothing really happens. The film goes from one dialogue to another, sounding hollow, never reaching depth, never creating the illusion that you really are inside a web of conspiracy, and everyone has a case with everyone is just a boring excuse to show the actress main in cool underwear. (which, combined with his rusty voice, is certainly good, but nothing to base a movie on) The high point for me is the opening scene, and the film eventually degenerated from there to a point where I just wanted to get out movie about 45 minutes into the story. I regret being left out.
