Yeah, I know your character should be a drunk, and he may have been just a fool. But something tells this critic that Pleasence really was drinking heavily and was intoxicated during his scenes in the movie. Basically everything he says is dragged and often unintelligible. Or maybe it was just the values ​​of poor productions ... hard to say. <br /> <br /> Anyway, The Race for the Yankee Zephyr is a movie that just does not work. It's a shame too, since the film has a great opening and a generally interesting plot. Lastly, the production figures are very low and the stock is very scarce for this adventure in New Zealand to deliver the goods. The story deals with a US warplane that is full of gold, money and medals, which falls on a lake in New Zealand during World War II. The plane remains lost for about forty years or more until it somehow washes ashore and a drunk (Pleasence) literally stumbles on it. At first, he gathers all the purple heart medals and tries to sell them in town, getting $ 75 each! Little does he know that once he sells them, the local jeweler gets on the phone and starts looking for information about the plane. Before you can blink, all the attention brings a wretched rich (Peppard) and his henchmen into town and they quickly try to force the old man to give up the location of the plane, since they know there is much more than just medals. . The old drunken business partner (Wahl) and his daughter (Warren) rush to try to claim their fortune before the bad guys can get there. The resulting action is not as much fun as you'd expect it to be. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty awful, with the exception of Pleasence. George Peppard tries to make some kind of (I think) Australian accent, but it's hardly convincing. Lesley Ann Warren is not so bad, but Ken Wahl is really bad. He is basically making his best impression of Michael Pare on his worst day. And that is saying something. I hope he made enough money in that movie to fix the front teeth that looked a bit crooked. I do not remember if he straightened them out when he was in Wiseguy. The rest of the cast has no talent. Probably mostly locals who have never done much else. I think the biggest problems for me were the lack of action during much of the film and the lack of danger. The villains are too cool and playful to be taken seriously. And honestly, there are no helicopters in the movie that look like those on the DVD cover. And none of the movie boats have teeth painted on them either. <br /> <br /> The film has its strength, however. The beginning that begins as a newscast and then becomes part of the story was a beautiful touch. Brian May's score sounds a little too much like that of Mad Max 2, but it included a little march they play for Pleasence in some scenes. Sounds like the one from the Great Escape! There are some helicopter maneuvers and a big boat chase that apparently killed three stunts during filming. The scenery, despite the grainy appearance of the photo, is still quite beautiful. But what you remember most is Donald Pleasence's drunken antics. It was almost enough to save this movie. Almost. 4 out of 5 stars. The Dog.
