It's a good idea to set aside heavy production. <br /> <br /> Some of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the background music / sound level, and that did not help the reviewer. Nor the Welsh accents, sometimes impenetrable. Toward the end, I lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie did not know if it was a fake or a black comedy - and they require different approaches. Some of the incidents were done with such force that they only deserved a moan, some were so unbelievable even for that kind of plot that they made the story not worth following. <br /> <br /> The acting was in the main part. good - although the American had just arrived as a clone of the mad scientist "Back to the Future". The little boy was very good. <br /> <br /> I watched until the end, but God knows why: I can not remember laughing once.
