After watching it for 15 minutes, I knew how it would end. It's a clich√© movie with a stupid setup. I am a big fan of thief movies, but this one does not deliver anything new, clever or special. This is an insider assault, because "grumpy guy" shoots a bum and, of course, "crazy" makes a moral trip. The reason why it is stupid and not believable is. When you've gone so far to kill a homeless man, why not kill the guy between you and 43 million? They have 45 minutes to hide the money and stage a robbery there no one right mind would hesitate to shoot Mr. "from the goody" and in this case he is a guy they met for a few days .... Everything and everything I was inclined to fast forward from the middle of it, but I duked it and boy I regret it
