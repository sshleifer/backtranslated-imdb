Starting where the last AVP stopped, an alien "rib cage" emerges from a Predator killed in a Predator spacecraft, and causes the Predator spacecraft to collide with Gunnison Colorado, where it spawns several other aliens that start wreaking havoc. The Predator race sends a solitary, highly experienced and armed Predator to "clear the mess." Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is the rhythm. This movie moves very fast. The opening credits just rolled and the Predator ship collides with Earth after the alien grows tall, a hunter character and child is introduced, but before we even learn their names, both are dead, so we see the Predator. home-world and the leader Predator flies to combat the alien infestation, and all this happens in the first five minutes. This unnatural rhythm does not leave the whole movie; the National Guard arrives in town, but within two minutes everyone is killed without even taking a good look at a single face, the manager of a pizzeria gets a character development scene only to be killed the next time we see him again , without even knowing his name, random vagabonds, a waitress and a cook kill again without learning their names. One moment, our main characters are at home, the next running around the city, the next in a gun store, the next in an APC, and this random scenario jumping again and again simply does not leave the audience with no time to settle in letting them cling to straws. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and the time period. The film is set in the modern day Gunnison Colorado. All other Alien and Predator films were filmed in fascinating settings, such as industrial spacecraft, guerrilla rainforests, alien planets and underground labyrinths. Now comes AVP-R, situated in a small modern American city with "highlights" including a sporting goods store, parking lots, pizzerias and girl rooms. I mean, were they really trying to make the movie look as monotonous, monotonous and uninteresting as possible ?! It's hard to see these monsters as scary creatures when they're next to a shelf full of Reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside the girls' quarters. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a big problem with this movie. The Alien series was created in the future, no humans had even heard of an Alien before the first movie, and Aliens had not only never been on Earth, but if they had come to Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This movie spoils the whole concept by being set in modern days, with Average Joes watching the aliens all over the place, and at the end of the film, mankind is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered a minor loss. It irks the whole concept of other films. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with huge Deus Ex Machina's. The Predator just carries a bottle of unlimited magical blue liquid that is just to melt any body with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just goes on overly drastic measures and loosens a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of existence Aliens, despite the fact that there are many survivors of the incident they are witnesses, and many other bad attempts are made to fill impossible to cover the holes of the plot. <br /> <br /> Also, for a "Versos" movie, it has ruthless prejudice in favor of predators. For most of the film, a solitary predator manages to kill dozens, if not tens, of Aliens, all while getting only a single scratch, while the aliens are slaughtered to the left and centered like clay pigeons, waiting to turn around to be killed by the Predator without making any effort to defend himself. This movie should not be called "Alien vs. Predator" as much as it should be "Massacres Predator Aliens". I mean, how can you have two species battling with suspense and tension when one is portrayed as being far superior to the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are among the biggest flaws. Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous films, Alien and Predator, but even though they are an independent film, they are insipid, sad, and sometimes even worthy. The characters in this movie consist of not cheating on you, horny couples who want to get laid, pizza delivery guys, blond bimbos, high school bullies, kids and a cheeky copy-and-paste job Rippley and Newt; the worst and most clich√©s possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all the above mentioned characters are represented by teenagers. While the teen cast is an obvious attempt to appeal to younger audiences, its only effect is to make the film look like a typical pornographic horror movie with actors who are too young to have learned to perform convincingly. , mostly with blank facial expressions delivering monotonous dialogue. Not only that, but these characters do some of the more retarded things in the movies, like using Predator weapons, commenting on powers when he's on for hours, following stupid plans to get out of town rather than just getting out of town for a bit. Quickly, and so many other idiocyes that the movie really left the audience in my theater sighing in frustration. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is just a horrible B movie, something that deserves straight to the DVD. category. The fact that this film is a theatrical version surprises me, since all parts of the film are just amateur works.
