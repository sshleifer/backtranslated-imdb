Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this movie indicates. He directed ALL QUIET ON THE WEST FRONT, THAT MINK TOUCH, AND THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON, among others. This mediocre, made for television retelling Dicken's masterpiece is so bad, even those who are not familiar with the often filmed tale, will be dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fact that the film is available from only two known vendors (Brentwood and BCI Eclipse LLC) poor transfer quality, and the scratchy and blurred soundtrack make the task of Finding this movie on video is not worth it. <br /> <br /> I've always believed that if a company is going to put a movie on video and charge the public money to buy it then they should at least have a down copy of the movie and do a good job at transfer. Unfortunately, neither supplier has this work ethic and the result is only suitable for the discount box at the local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is told mostly through flashbacks, making the movie episodic and full of sounds. Much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The Martha, Traddles, and other characters were cut off and the relationship of young David and Steerforth is not explored enough, so we wondered why David would date the guy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David the boy and the young Agnes has never developed and it is difficult to understand why she and David end up getting married. Since Martha is left out, it is a mystery as Dan Peggoty finds his niece. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely guy. <br /> <br /> Some believe that this movie did a good job at summarizing the long romance. I disagree, that's at best a hatchet job in the book. Anyone who has seen George Cukor's 1935 version will agree. <br /> <br /> The performances in this version of Fields like Micawber and Rathbone like Murdstone are definitely worth watching. And the latest versions of the Masterpiece Theater version (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are extraordinary achievements in television adaptations of classic novels. Directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak, responsible for these films, deserve the highest praise. <br /> <br /> My last comment about David Copperfield 1969 is: Do not buy, there are several much better versions of the film. accessible. If you are on television, turn the channel into something else. It's a waste of an hour and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry people, but I can not praise such a horribly bad movie.
