I just watched this movie. I could not imagine watching this on VHS, since there were scenes where I needed the subtitles to listen through an accent or sound effect, even if the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is very attractive. The few CG effects were very obvious insertions, but the prosthesis / creature effects were not bad. It is not perfect, but photography and editing (which were very good) made up for it. Acting was usually bad, though how much of that can be attributed to the director I could not tell, never having seen any of the actors before. The exception, I think, was M. Gomez (Uxia). She stole all the scenes in which she participated and not just because of a very pretty face, but there was something like an urgency in her performance that none of the others had. The writing could have been much better - the plot was still unmistakably Lovecraft, and many details of Lovecraft were written, but I personally could have done without most of the dialogues.
