Even before this movie, it is clear that Ali G became the exact character he proposed to parody. I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character, but I was curious to see how a man with so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a 1 1/2 hour feature film of a 3-minute joke. A fine plot like paper is just a torrent of jokes about penis and marijuana and I must admit that I cringed when I saw so many respected actors like Charles Dance and Michael Gambon demote to the job. Saying that I must admit (even though I'm ashamed to do this) that I've made a laugh on more than one occasion, and as bad as this movie was, it was never boring, and I never thought to change it (mainly due to the beautiful Rhona Mitra). Saying this, just watch this movie if you're a teenage boy between 14 and 17 and find funny stick jokes.
