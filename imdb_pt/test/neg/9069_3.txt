The '70s were undoubtedly the golden age of horror' made for TV '. This is one of those that was probably shaken up as an ABC movie of the week. It is the old story of a house and / or ghost that owns one of the new owners. The film is promising, but it has never been performed. Everything is too hasty. Tension and suspense need time to grow and grow. And there 's nothing new. We've seen all this before and a better one. One last thought: I do not understand why the character of Robert Wagner would fall in love with the movie star long dead when he is married to Kate Jackson for the love of God! !!
