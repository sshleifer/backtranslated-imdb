This movie is so bad that they should burn the master. You can not ruin the plot because this movie does not have one. The graphics are less than fake, they are horrendous. Then you have the wandering through the star-gazer work-a-holic field that jumps between your own madness and the crazy claims of the madman preacher. and when he finally arrives at DC, they do not even have the decency to kill him; the monster (you do not know it at the time) is already dying, but like ... who knows and of course has the last sappy ending ... everyone on the planet is dead or dying, but his family and a bunch of stragglers survive. Imagine that! This will be the movie that C Thomas Howell will go to his whining that he has already starred in. It probably gives you nightmares.
