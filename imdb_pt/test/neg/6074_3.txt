This movie is proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is awful. How can you cast an actor built like Rambo to play the "Master"? He shows no credibility and exaggerates Beethoven. Above all, long hair does not look good on your head. The lead actress is losing all the subtleties necessary for her character. The camera photos are extravagant and very conventional. The lights are to close the feelings of the characters. Bad casting and cheap steering. What a pity! The only scene worth the movie is when Beeth (I hope you do not mind me calling you by your nickname?) It's turning the girl's song into a joke. Anyway, I hope Harris can find his way back to the real movie, where he can really show off his hairless talent.
