Ho humm - - - More than nothing. If you're a long time Rush fan, you know what this video contains: disgusting songs from the past, the 1980s "BIG 3" hits and their "last try" efforts to stay contemporary. They manage to make fun of themselves, beating critics to the punch, portraying themselves as "dinosaurs." Unfortunately, they can not protect themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only increase the fact that these guys HAVE BEEN. <br /> <br /> If you're following (as much as you can digest) the band for a couple of decades of the 1970s, then you know there's no new material here. The same old man, the same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) there's no truth behind the scenes (Geddy loses his shoes ?! Give him some time!) He thinks it's absurd!) 3) No new insights. <Br /> <br /> Would a better video show CREW configuration for 3 or 4 hours ?? just let the camera work. And stop changing the camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something artistic. But then offer a full version of 2 or 3 shots that VIEWER can choose. Do we know how the band looks like? let's see what we REALLY want to see. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor: rent this movie first.
