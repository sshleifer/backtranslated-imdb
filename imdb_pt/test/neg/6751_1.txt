This was really bad. work or worse. I do not think it was homophobic, just too bad. if it's something really amateur, like when you're 14 and first discover swearing and skin magazines. <br /> <br /> The main point of this film, the novel, falls flat. I can not help but wonder if the writers have ever had any serious relationships before this movie. <br /> <br /> Plan and walk are horrible, going nowhere. One minute we're seeing these guys pick up cheaters, so we're in a gay club, so we're on a date. out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics, and then they sleep together. none of this seems real, like a Shakespearean production in primary school, if Hamlet was written by a frat boy. <br /> <br /> The ending was a kind of chilling fantasy of revenge for a loser who was abandoned by a girl. Unnecessary and really kinda disturbing. <br /> <br /> Even so, you have to watch. Because? <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the director's comment is really hilarious - what kind of professional talks about "hitting" or "hooking" up with the actresses? dialogue sucked, relationships lacked chemistry. you'll be on the floor laughing at this pretentious idiot.
