Not just the money we paid to rent it or go to the movies. I'm talking about how big production companies waste so much money on things that are actually boring and do not talk about ridiculous things. With the millions they used to make a movie like this, because I do not think the actors here actually worked for free or for an insignificant amount. With that money, imagine how many good independent films you could make, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. It's just to fool you, but not to anyone, just the majority of teens who are willing to go see an Ashton Kutcher movie just because they are fans of it. I really do not know how anyone with good sense could really act in that kind of movie. If you really look at this in perspective, the actors will have the same quality as this movie. So I guess it should not be surprising, I really could not have waited any longer.
