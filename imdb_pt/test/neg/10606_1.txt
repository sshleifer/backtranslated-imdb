Being a fan of the series, I thought: How bad can the movie be? Well, I have my answer. Some movies should never be made. Why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. Pete's character in the series was not a crying baby as portrayed in the film. The only good thing about this film besides music and that Clare Danes is beautiful is that it was short. What's with this dance scene? The only reason I did not leave this movie was because it was so bad it was funny. Maybe that was the plan! It's very bad when a cheap 60's TV show is better than a $ 20 million movie from the 90's. El Mariachi cost just $ 7,000 and it's a much better movie. Do not waste your money when it comes out on tape, nor is it worth renting.
