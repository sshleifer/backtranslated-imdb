I'm usually a gaggle of bad movies, but this thing sucks. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible effects and very little humor, what the heck was the point of making this movie? I do not have the courage to speak or act to speak. <br /> <br /> I got only 45 minutes with this mouse falling from a movie, and this is rare for me. <br /> <br /> Anything positive to say about this drivel? The artwork on the cover was OK, I'm sure the film has an ending too, even if I have not. <br /> <br /> The rats were disorganized and blew their lines constantly, they were not intense and just seemed to be going through the rhythms for their paycheque. The actors were worse.
