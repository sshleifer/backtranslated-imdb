This movie sucks beyond any limit. It's incredible - a very bad imitation of Jaws and other (best) shark films. A very bad one - everything is really pathetic. The story is the most sheer crap, actors are bad, very cheap effects, without any creativity. It seems that some really weak kids got the Jaws script and organized it randomly, then their parents grabbed their 8mm camera and recorded the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inadequate, just a bit of "elevator" music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, so a little less optimistic when the shark is around or when the children get depressed (again HEARS VERY LOUD music) . Carlo Maria (the author) should be so embarrassed that he should ask that his name be erased from the titles! The movie works like a perfect demonstration of how shit music will destroy *** ANY scene that should be exciting. There is a big difference in Jaws: At the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people trying to kill sharks with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When that does not work, the guys take a bunch of dynamite and spend like 1/4 of the film putting explosives on some sunken ship. This is really the original way of catching the fish that I have to admit! They use a lot of dynamite as if they were trying to kill a warship (I'd say it's a battle class of Bismarck) or dig another Panama Canal. That is simply incredible. I'm glad they did not try using napalm-flamethrowers or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad and bad shark about 2m. Well, there's mystic disappearing Indian (who looks like German pensioner) also in this mess. This is not a movie, this is an example of warning how movies can be bad! As a warning, it is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most Italian films are bad, but this ... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
