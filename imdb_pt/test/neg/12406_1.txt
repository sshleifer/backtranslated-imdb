Wong's direction is perhaps the worst time in movie history I've ever seen. This movie makes my worst ever film of 2000, Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Soloman looked like an Oscar winner. The flaws in this movie are beyond explanation. The biggest of them is the lack of depth. Each scene does not develop completely as if the editing room did not know how to do its job properly. It's a shame that with such a cast of talents and a popular popular popular history can be destroyed by this lack of vision. <br /> <br /> I'm so disgusted and I hope some great director like John Woo or Ang Lee decides to redo this movie and do some justice. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0/10 ??
