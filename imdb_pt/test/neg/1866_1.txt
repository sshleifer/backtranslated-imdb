The only good thing about this movie is that they managed to tie you up with the first part! But besides that, it was one of the worst movies ever! The only time you see the Ghoulies is in a flashback (and flashback is just a clip from the first part)! A must not see! In a one to ten, "Ghoulies 4" wins one!
