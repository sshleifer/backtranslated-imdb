Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist who visits England, picks up a cockerel one night. Two years later, having discovered the man's address book in his car, he returned the book to the man's opulent home only to discover that the man had been hanged for murder. No one inside or outside the family seems to care that the walker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is the man's alibi, but he arrived too late. <br /> <br /> From a guilty feeling, he traces the real killer. <br /> <br /> The mysteries of Agatha Christie often involve a number of different people, all of them with one or another motive for crime, all of them suspected, and a puzzle that depends on building a timeline strict Often, not always, there is a partner with whom the investigator can talk about things. Because of the frustration of the situation, care should be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. The redundancy is perfectly fine. We have to keep the characters and the timelines in a straight line. Christie's films are the rare type in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is really useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh, yeah, it's Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan-Globus production, with all that implies in production values, a carefully crafted script and skill behind The first few minutes, in which Sutherland discovers an innocent man hanged, are well. After that, everything is thrown to the viewer in disjointed scraps, often in flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing. The script has a sloppy quality, as if it were thrown together by two hacks at night. Few faces are familiar and this does not help at all. Everyone leaves comments on everyone else and names become a hopeless mess. The musical score consists of four instruments that make annoying atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is played to wake up the tractors in the audience. If Dame Agatha were alive, she would be among the viewers who needed to be shaken. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
