Any movie student could make a movie a thousand times better than a piece of crap. As someone who had read the book, I hoped even a direct resumption of the book would make it a fair movie. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodward's narrative and make a great movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the director went beyond Woodward's narrative. He added a Latin American angel named Velasquez who was not in the book. He had Bob Woodward interview Belushi dead in an exchange at the morgue. The film had all the insight of someone plumbing the PCP looking at your navel. <br /> <br /> If this is a spoiler for you, you will thank me for it, because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made.
