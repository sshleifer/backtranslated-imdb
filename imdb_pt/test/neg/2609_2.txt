As a child, I never understood why someone would attend this very low quality show. It was very stupid and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to suffer some kind of fatal accident (they were so annoying). <br /> <br /> Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude about the cartoon. While I still think it sucked, this is only in relation to the American version of the show. That's because I was reading a book about anime and found that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was very violent, so they cut it off from the episodes. That's bad enough, but what else they did is unbelievable - they actually split the episodes and put them together to create shows that were NOTHING like the originals! For example, an episode may consist of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really do not know if the original show really was bad - it could have been brilliant. But who can say, considering all we have to watch is this Americanized mess!
