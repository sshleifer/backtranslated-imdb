This movie was really stupid and I thought it was not so bad and I could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people. Then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie. I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sake. The brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands that were not right. Without muscles, you really can not move your hands, but it did. The brother should have bled to death before even moving his hands. The film was not great, but okay until the scene of the hand. I was laughing so hard I can not remember how it ended. It had to do with foam or something.
