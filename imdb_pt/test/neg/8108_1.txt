No spoiler needed to steer you clear ... well, bizarre movie. Canada becomes part of the US. IT'S OK. So, I think I'm unusual, but I expected something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the US. You fool me. Continue with this movie and you're out of cloud coocoo land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the movie where you (believe me) will not care about any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South have to be among the most imaginative series ever. But in this case, Paul Gross, I am sorry to say, had no idea of ​​making a coherent film and wasted many talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
