Kairo, or Pulse, as it is known among the English, takes place in Tokyo and begins when Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to ask about a computer disk in which he is working. when she gets to his place, he gives her the record, but then, inconsiderately, commits suicide in front of her. Meanwhile, a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) recently logged on to the internet and continues to receive scary messages and pictures on his monitor, so he asks the computer expert Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) what is happening, she really does not know , but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full and they need somewhere else to go. Earth is as good a place as any, right? These spirits also do not like to share, so they kind of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something, I really do not know, because the movies are a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> This Japanese production was written and directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and soon enough I have to say that I hated Kairo, I hated everything about it and proves that Asian cinema can produce something as bad as any American filmmaker. . The script is an excessive mess, it just does not make sense with scenes that seem to be from a different movie, sequences that do not make logical sense or that are not explained in any way. Kairo is also the most annoying movie I've sat for this year. With two hours in length, this is a difficult task to be solved, I really wanted to move forward quickly, but I'm honest if nothing else, so I put this to the bitter side and sincerely wished it had not. There are so many things wrong with Kairo, I suppose the filmmakers were looking for a surreally ambiguous and deliberately incoherent feeling, but these are traits that I despise in a film unless they are done correctly. Then there's the whole internet thing I could not relate to, I use the internet all day and it's not at all scary to me in any way. Then there's the fact that Kairo as a movie provided zero entertainment value to me, maybe I'm a Neanderthal, but I like the movies I watch to entertain myself, make some kind of sense and not bored me to death . > Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate cure for insomnia as far as I'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep, paste it onto the DVD and you'll be sleeping in 10 minutes, I assure you. I do not think Kairo was scary at the very least, the whole internet thing was laughable and, to scare you off, you should see some of the pop-up pen-raising ads I get, now this is scary! I hate this movie, I hate this movie, I'm sorry, I just need to do this basic point again, twice. Forget any action, tension or blood, for there is none. If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes that can drag you out, otherwise this is the PG rated child friendly material all the way. Urgh. <br /> <br /> The film seems so monotonous and annoying that it is false, the camera stays there for a long time and when it moves, it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican novel. As the Kairo is sub titled it is difficult to judge the original performances so I will not bother you, it is difficult to take care of someone when they do not even speak the same language and you do not know what they are saying. <br /> <br /> Kairo sucks, I hated it and it's as simple and straightforward as that. Just because it's an Asian movie, it does not automatically do any good and the mess of a story, the holes in the plot, the fact that it does not make sense and is an absolute hassle means that Kairo would be properly shattered by people if it were an American Production. The worst movie I've seen this year for some distance. Kairo got a Hollywood remake like Pulse (2006).
