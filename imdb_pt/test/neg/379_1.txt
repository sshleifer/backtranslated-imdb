If you feel like watching a really terrible movie, it would be difficult to find something that could be compared to that. I spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the joy I get from him, and man, this is one of the worst. This movie was so bad that I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. This was not so bad, which is incredible since it went straight to the video. This is one of those movies that is hard to comprehend as it was made in the first place. I mean, someone had to actually read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they did several drafts) and said, "Yeah, that's it.Here's some money." In fact, they probably just wanted to do a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, so they went with whatever they had. Ack, horrible. So, if you are a fan of really bad movies, watch this one. It's a real classic, and the movie does not get much worse than that. And if this happens, please let me know.
