... And it's not a very good documentary, or the American film MOVIE seems to have confused some people into thinking it's a fake documentary ("Mockumentary") and even some newspaper TV listings have described it as such. I'm not going to laugh about it because it's easy to confuse this documentary with a big wing movement. THIS IS THE SPINAL TAP SPEAVER What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary revolves around the young filmmaker Mark Borchardt, who is ... I can say: cheated, yes, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, since we would not have dreams, we'd all still be living in caves, and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies should not be taken as criticism. since both Sam Raimi (Yes that one) and Peter Jackson (yes that one) began to do low-budget horror comedies so again it is not a criticism. It is not only that Mark Borchardt (yes that one) is a parody of the American trash of the trailer <br /> <br /> Remember SOME THING ABOUT MA RY Ben Stiller gives a ride to an unsuspecting hitch hiker ("Get in my office because you're f *** in" fired ")? with that Mark looks like most of Jerry Springer's guests, so it's very easy to understand why some people thought this was not a real documentary. It's also not a very good documentary, since Mark and co give me shivers Did you know that someone thought Mark would grow up to be a serial killer? Does anyone else think it's been a long time for that to happen?
