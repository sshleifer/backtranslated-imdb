Before being acclaimed internationally with The Silence of the Lambs, director Jonathan Demme began to make peculiar comedies. This was one of them and, like some American Oscar-winning comedies, I could mention, he has a good concept, he's very rhythmic, he has great performances, a complicated romance. but it's just not very funny. Pfeiffer is a widow who moves to the backwaters of the city after her husband (Baldwin) is murdered. Pfeiffer falls in love with Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and to complicate things, Pfeiffer also falls in love with the police officer who accompanies him. All this should have been a one minute laughter. Pfeiffer, sporting a heavy wig is excellent as the widow, as is the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine is also good as the nice cop. But the script is simply devoid of direct, witty, funny lines or jokes of the verbal or physical type that this type of film demands. The result is that this generates smiles at best instead of laughter. It exudes charm, but is tediously short on humor.
