Firstly, let me clarify that I love aircraft, and generally any movie with them is worth watching - and I've watched some shocking. However, the same does not happen with this movie. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this promotional film of Strategic Air Command. The acting is mediocre and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this horrible junk in the middle of the road. This was despite some very good aerial photographs, maybe even the best ones. The problem is that even for an aviation nut like me, doing something off the shocking highlight aircraft (B-36 and B-47) just really irritates the nerves. It's a shame the film was not made when the B-52 appeared, so the superlatives used for the aircraft in this movie would be valid. So I might have been able to get through this. Maybe I'm missing the point of the movie, which may be the anguish suffered by your loved ones while your loved one is on active duty. Anyway, it could have been done a lot better. Recommendation? Worth to miss.
