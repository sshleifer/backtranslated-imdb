When I went to the video store to watch a movie, I saw this and immediately thought it would be funny. The image made it seem like a classic comedy involving teenagers (like the trip) that I thought would be worth watching. When I turned the tables on, I was disappointed as the jokes were horrible and cheesy. The only part the director might have thought would be funny was someone slipping on the wet floor. This is not a joke and it would not make people laugh. I actually considered shutting this movie down halfway. I was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it. Not enough care was taken to make this movie and not have enough time and labor for it. I found the acting very bad as well. The only time I laughed was at the extremely bad 'jokes' or actions done that really were not funny!. I rate this movie a 1/10. I hope you found this review useful.
