you will probably be very disappointed with this sequence which is not a continuation.AWIL is a classic.but this movie is as far from being a classic as you can get.that a joke.pecial effects that are not very special, horrible dialogues, no acting. and a ridiculously ridiculous, quick and unconvincing subplot (not to mention fleeting) preached with about a third of the film left. I mentioned that the story is less than lame. No way this should be a serious horror. movie, it's still the stupidity of being funny in any good way. the rating you currently have (4.8 / 10) is very generous if you ask me. my rating for An American Werewolf in Paris: a 3.5 / 10
