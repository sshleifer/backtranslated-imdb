I hoped this show was a bit realistic. It caressed me like just another mainstream show after I watched it. I did not feel the characters, is this glamorized idea of ​​the Americas how terrorism works? The main character does not act like a fundamentalist, and how he goes through a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. None of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine. One of the members, an all-white blond American boy, would never be accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a former French skinhead, does not fit into an Islamic terrorist movement. In addition, the terrorists have sex with white American housewives, which I find very strange. This is just another stupid American TV show wrong. It's almost as realistic as Prison Break.
