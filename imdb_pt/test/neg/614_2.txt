Hey ... I really do not know why this movie has been appreciated so much, maybe I missed the point. As I see it, many international filmmakers have made brilliant films that dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have informed, excited, shocked, evoked emotion and forced the public to move away from their own reality and think ... while it is true that the effort of aparna sen was ambitious, in the light of all the other films, this one is insufficient ..... miserably ...... it was very slow, there was details about nothing and the end .. . it was completely ... useless ... it was not open or anything .... just useless ..... so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted .......
