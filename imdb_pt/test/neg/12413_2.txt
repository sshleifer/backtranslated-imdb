Not so much for this movie ... either a racing driver or a stock car driver has a burning car at the beginning of the movie, goes to the bar, is approached by a biker gang that spoils his chances with a lovely lady, offer him a job, he returns to his place, if he refuses, the police asks him to accept his go !!! What is unfolding is a very annoying little movie that makes the hero not do so much and a gang of bikers who can kill and for some reason the police can not assign a crime to them. I'm not sure why the biker did what he did in the end, but hey, it's a bad movie, you always have scenes that make little sense. I'm still trying to figure out if I misheard when they said that the hero of the play was a stunt car driver. They might have told the stock car driver why, why an acrobatic rider would be running and I would not think it would be so unusual for a stunt double to hit. The actors are bad, and all the motorcyclists are very annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent ... actually this movie is not full of kicks, but it's the pits.
