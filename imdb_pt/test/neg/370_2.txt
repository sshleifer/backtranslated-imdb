If you bring the films Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you have a good idea of ​​what the film is. The only problem is that the film does not have the production values ​​of either of them and represents mostly a cheap copy of the first two. It is true that the film has a lot of action, but asks the viewer to suspend the belief. No one can shoot a Caliber 50 machine gun holding it in their hands - and lose everything, nor can they shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and lose the whole group. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus turns, it is easy to see the cannon used to do the job. And you driving the truck through it is superfluous, since it took more than enough time to stop the truck. If you're only interested in irrational action and violence, the movie is easy to watch. But do not expect anything in the paar with the Thunderdome, or even Steel Dawn, a bit cheap and tacky.
