*** SPOILERS LEVES *** This part of the Lua Cheia franchise changes the plot a bit and implements some new elements. First, a new puppet master is established. Secondly, the dolls look good in this sequence. Finally, He introduces some elements of science fiction / fantasy as well. <br /> <br /> A new tenant of the infamous bay hotel, his girlfriend, his psychic friend and that psychic boyfriend come across Andre Toulon's puppet chest. They also learn about another demon of another dimension who blames Toulon for stealing the secret to cheer the non-living. Then Sutekh (the devil) sends the totems, a bunch of dim little creatures that look like gremlins without ears. So it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the interdimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends. <br /> <br /> Like most low budget films, this movie is fraught with continuity issues. How were the dolls put back in the trunk? Why does not anyone remember the last kill feature in the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why a contractor in a building with a history of mass murders? All this and many other questions will not be answered ... ever. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this movie is acting. Actually, it's very good. The actors interpret this with unusual enthusiasm, especially for a lot of non-Full Moon names. Teresa Hill was especially impressive as the timid, nervous and psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a nice surprise as well. Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist. But Cameron was very annoying to the stomach. Thank the Norwegian god that he dies before half. <br /> <br /> The dolls are there in their usual animated mood. With some improvements too. There are emotions (especially of Jester) are much more human due to the sounds that were given to them. Blade Whistles, Pinhead Grunts and Six-Shooter snicker were improved and sounded much better. The stop-motion animation is just the best medium, especially the totems. They simply do not seem to move as smoothly as the previous installment of the series. Also Sutekh clothing is absolutely baffling. How should we be afraid of such a funny creature? <br /> <br /> The story seems a bit annoying to the series. I think Charlie Band was looking to focus on a younger demographic. The violence that is being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above problem is the main problem that this movie can not keep with many people. It does not have violence for gorewhores. The language is a bit cleaner. It is still very violent and hard for the little ones. That's why the film gets low ratings. I have to say that joint reviews are mostly just.
