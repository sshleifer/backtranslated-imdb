An epic story of hope limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. Seeing how Terrence Malick produced it, I expected something astonishing and lyrical. Instead, we have a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where - quite possibly - good intentions are destroyed by a horrible script, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. The dialogue in English between the protagonists who do not speak English is particularly credible ?? one can speculate if Nick Nolte and Tim Roth improvised their own, since they almost sound like real people. The story is loaded with implausibility: we are expected to believe that Binh can speak a little English after having spent his entire life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not his grammatical domain, rises incredibly in the refugee camp Malay). the benefit of night classes). Coincidence is abundant; I wonder if an hour or two was edited in the first third: he traces his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost immediately - after bumping into his thirty-year-old half-brother, who recognizes him indifferent! The mother gives him a gold medallion (or something similar of great value) as they separate, but this is never mentioned again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling should provide obligatory "love interest," but it seems as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "New York Gangs." <br /> <br /> The trip in a boat's rust bucket conveys a sense of the terrible conditions that human trafficking entails. In fact, the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable is the sudden hand-shooting of the bridge during rough weather conditions. (Incidentally, a boat cruise from Malaysia to New York via Cape of Good Hope and the African coast, non-stop for fuel or supplies, is certainly an epic journey.) The beautiful New York skyline echoes the use of Malick's magic hour, but I want to know why the Coast Guard did not show up. Maybe they were watching the Super Bowl, or something. Of course, Binh manages to trace his old blind father to a remote farm in Texas with the same navigational talent he exhibited in Ho Chi Minh City. I was struck by the way Nick Nolte paced digging fields and feeding horses on a large farm without the help of a guide dog or a white staff. For a demonstration of how a story about the difficulties faced by refugees could be structured and filmed on a small budget, check out Michael Winterbottom's "In This World."
