This movie, undoubtedly, is one of the worst I have ever seen. It was so annoying that I just could not wait for it to end. I talked to my girlfriend to watch her after this site got good reviews and after 30 minutes she looked at me like she said "her crazy". The scenery was as boring as the movie with nothing but driving in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of shrub around. The acting was not inspiring and the film was simply a waste of it was a good idea to lose the DVD. Guy Pierce should have stayed with the neighbors, since at least he washed his hair. All he did was talk on the phone, but he did not sell anything as a salesman. He would have been fired weeks before. His girlfriend (once in Coyote Ugly) should have stayed dancing in the bar, at least she seemed warm in it. <br /> <br /> The guy who played Vincent (those who watched him know) was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have driven to his house and hit him with a little 4 by 2. <br /> < I do not know about what anyone else liked about it. I really want people to watch this to suffer the torture I've been through.
