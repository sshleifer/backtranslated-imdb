Imagine if you want: four teenage students have a chore to spend the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to verify the existence of the paranormal. If you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a few times. Otherwise, this fictional documentary is a very lazy one from the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What it is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant enough but seem to lack genuine personality. It seems to take forever before something really scary happens. This movie is great for 'sleep overs' when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is screaming and eating.
