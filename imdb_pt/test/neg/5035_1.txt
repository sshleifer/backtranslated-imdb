This piece of tripe was (conveniently) based on a true story that involved two members of my family (played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie). <br /> <br /> This movie is offensive; besides the fact that it was not a good movie anyway, it did not capture at all what it was like to lose such a close relative and completely omit those who were really affected by the tragedy of real life. <br /> <br /> As for the director; he managed to profit from the misfortune of a family for the price of a Porsche. <br /> <br /> If I could have given a zero to this, I would have avoided it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. .
