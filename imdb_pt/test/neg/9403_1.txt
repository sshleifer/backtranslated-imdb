This is by far probably the worst movie that Al Pacino could have starred in. The movie had no real plot. It's sort of taken care of in 24 different directions. It looks like the intended audience of this movie is the player's anonymous people. The character of Mc Mcconaughey is not credible enough to be Pacino's protégé. So he won some bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline for a shit job recording on a 900 service. This supposed to convince an audience of his skills? It was just stupid to think about. The trailer promised to show us how he makes his right choice, but after going through the entire film I still have to see what skill he already had. If you want skill try to look at the character of Robert of Niro at the Casino now that is showmanship. At some point in the movie, Mat's character picks up his winning bets with a coin. Anyone could do that. Al Pacino seems to be talking a lot and I mean blabber mouth in his face dialogue. I think this style started with Scent of a Woman and worked for him because he finally won an Oscar, but now I think it's just annoying. He seems to be always lecturing. He does a wicked act of portraying a man with unstable angina (which is an imminent heart attack), typically recalling his performance in Godather, part 3, in which he plays the diabetic mafia Don Corleone, but other than that, Pacino's talent is wasted. movie. Rene Russo is just an eye opener for this movie. She keeps in shape and shows the tight clothes she wears everywhere. This movie sucks. Do not waste your money on this. It's much worse than the character characters Mats in the movie.
