There is a good story well hidden and never used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, the development of characters and stories has been forgotten. What remains is confusing and superficial. Turn off your brain and watch - you will probably find that time passes fast enough, but unless you are the type of person who finds deep and meaningful soaps, you will not get any real satisfaction with this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch only if you have nothing better to do and only if someone pays for the video rental.
