I remember Hey Hey Fuss & I saw the Jackson Jive, it was a pretty straight comedy Comic Skit But I saw this and it's free and it's out in the clear? Did I miss anything? If the black community should complain about any racist comments on a TV show, that should be it and if you've read my previous comments I'm not the easy guy to offend. The basic plot is that an African / American moves next to this white guy and they make those racist comments as the value of a house will fall just because of black neighbors and the white guy makes referrals like (if your easily offended by insults racial No Read) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I apologize, but this actually happens at this show, I really am a guy who is okay with the black community) People may say that you light up, but even when you take the racial slurrs, it's not funny There are no new jokes acting Evil And I Can Sweat In An Episode I Saw The Eyes Of Someone Focus Something Disconnected With The Situation. All In All Horrible Comedy.
