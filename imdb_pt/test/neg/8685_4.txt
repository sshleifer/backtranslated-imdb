*** Small spoilers of the batch *** I must confess to having a soft spot by Wayne Crawford. I know little about him, but he seems to have great enthusiasm to make up for his lack of talent. In his films, he usually performs multi-tasking - perm forme 3 of the lead actor, director, producer and screenwriter - addressing the story lines of the sub-basement. Despite this, the end product is generally fun for the non-picky. <br /> <br /> "The Evil Below" features Crawford as a lucky captain of a fractured boat, a bit like Bogart. in 'To Have & Have Not' - the similarities between the films end here. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers looking for a shipwreck, before being attacked by an invisible creature - a bit like the beginning of 'Jaws 2'. The shipwreck turns out to be that of the "El Diablo", which descended centuries earlier. The ship was manned by heretic priests fleeing Spain, with a load of treasures stolen from the Church. This allows the introduction of various links to supernatural forces with Lucifer and Armageddon, both taking a look. The title of the film refers to this sunken ship of the Devil, rather than any evil sea creature. <br /> <br /> Whatever the flaws the film has (and there are many) it's fun to watch and be done with competence. You can not help liking a movie that, in the final 5 minutes, copies the famous beach scene in 'From Here to Eternity' and the final line of 'Casablanca'.
