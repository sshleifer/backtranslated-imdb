This is a great example of what happened at Comedy Central after Dave Chapelle left. Here's the problem with Carlos Mencia. First, his birth name is Ned Holness, and it was known that until the age of 18, when he changed his name to Ned Arnel Mencia. He was born in Honduras, although he acts like he is from Mexico. He grew up in the United States too. <br /> <br /> I can forgive all this crap, but ... <br /> <br /> He was caught stealing other people's material. Joe Rogan has been his most vocal critic this way. The Stereotype Olympics was an idea that he got some DJs out of Miami. He stole jokes from Bill Cosby. He stole the material from George Lopez on his own HBO special (13 minutes of it). <br /> <br /> He thinks what he's doing is so original, but Dave Chapelle and Lisa Lampanelli have been competing for years before that idiot (among others). <br /> <br /> This show will crash and burn. The word Beaner does not last long before it ages. He has not done anything new since the first episode. <br /> <br /> "You want to hear a joke? A Beaner jumping a fence !! It's funny for 3 Seasons!" No. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
