I love bad movies: Showgirls, Outerspace Plan 9, etc. And this movie fits well. Do not believe anyone who tells you this is a good movie. It's absolutely awful. Tim Curry's accent passes from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There is a person in a gorilla costume who should be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the sign language of the monkey. There is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark. There are people jumping up and down Kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed in it. This thing is ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculous that I was rolling on the floor. It's totally implausible. Loved every minute.
