The first time I heard about Guest House Paridiso was in the "bathroom" after having just seen the Fight Club. A small round black circle was deposited in each urinal. When the circle came in contact with the moisture (to put it gently), it caused a colored image to form, with photographs of the two stars and the slogan "You'll fuck yourself laughing." When you finished washing your hands, the circle dried up and darkened again, waiting to awaken the surprise in the next "victim." <br /> <br /> Ok, maybe the end of the story was not very sophisticated, but you have to admit it was groundbreaking. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I have never seen anything like it in my previous life, and in these days of more than a century of film and marketing, this is a real achievement. It's a shame that the movie that accompanied him has not kept the promise. <br /> <br /> I hate working at Guest House Paridiso and am grateful to Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through his compelling television series, Be the Invention of The Young Ones (1982-1984), the living room plays Bottom (1991-1995), or even solo work, as Rik in the New Statesman. (1988-1993). In fact, this would have made a hilarious 45-minute TV special. Unfortunately, it's a 89-minute movie. <br /> <br /> There is definitely some merit to be had, and I laughed continuously during the protracted end, which tricked the Exorcist and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and involved ... well, you will have to see this for yourself same. However, often the rhythm is lead and a sterile atmosphere is everywhere. The two stars (Edmondson having his usual backseat, this time due to the fact that he drives properly) never make it to the first gear, Mayall only sporadically showing the dirty-mouth craze that makes us love him on the small screen. In fact, the writers' assumption that we are already familiar with the characters causes them to be sub-supplied to the audience. The slight hints of depth seen in the series (effeminate, socially scaled Richie, for example) are not present here, and instead we get parodies of parodies. <br /> <br /> The charge of Fawlty Towers does not pass through water. , complete with drunk and unnoticed chef, called waiter "Pasquele", who strangely rhymes with Manuel. Some of the ideas, such as a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a children's swing hanging over a cliff, are very, very funny, but in the end the frenetic pace is stolen, the two constantly looking for a studio audience that is not there , and all the "dead chuckles," areas patched with incidental "comedy" music that would have been dated in a Carry On movie two decades ago. <br /> <br /> Paridiso's puerile, sadistic, and perverse mood mark is funny, and I'm sure this will make you laugh ... just not as often as it should.
