After seeing this piece of crap, you'll know why the calys drive on the left side of the street ... this movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if this is the right word for this ...) are mostly substandard (about 98%) and do not lose any line. Save money and get drunk. You can enjoy this movie being totally wasted, perhaps!
