If you would like to watch an example of how not to make a movie, then you need to watch it. I, without experience in making movies, could do better. The script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen by any intelligent structure. In order to make up for this flaw, you'd think the action would be decent, would not it? <br /> <br /> Since the acting, editing, and general assembly of the film are scary, the only saving grace is the terrible performance of the lead actor. The reason he is saving grace is because he is so genuinely bad at acting that he should win an Oscar for it. At least some recognition for making me laugh at him so much. Shoot the body of a dead woman after a male shooting (where did it come from?), Pull the semi-automatic trigger dozens of times while the sound engineer draws two bullet effects, reflecting the crew in shades of Kool Mo Dee, one and only ONE music track for the WHOLE movie, an unoriginal script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a very, very bad movie. It's actually more fun to spot errors than actually try to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
