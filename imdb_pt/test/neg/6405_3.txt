Someone would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. Of course, it's an interesting subject-can a person become so obsessed with something marginal as a simple number that completely loses contact with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone makes a movie about it someday. This unfortunately has nothing to do with the above, no matter what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. I'd like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. It's useless. A trick. A hook for the unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> Well, what is the movie about? A dog-hunter (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a crime noir book because he thinks he somehow reflects his own life. Over there. Of course, the character in the book - detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and begins to see the number everywhere ... but it is just upholstered and totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut all 23 references and have the main character (s) obsessed with cheese or something and you will have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that all "23" things were written in waay after the story was finished, rejected, and sent to "rewrite." <br /> <br /> That would be OK .. I think .. if the movie was not monotonous, monotonous, monotonous. Half of the movie is narrated, for God's sake. You're not watching the movie, you're listening to Jim Carrey telling the movie. About a quarter of Carrey begins to read the book, and from then to the horribly clich√©d end we are required to watch real-life scenes from the life of dog-hunters (where nothing happens) interspersed with the narrative film of noir-ish art "book" scenes that will leave you laughing or just depressed. It is like the "City of Sin" of a poor man, with all the violence cut, narrated by Carrey and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> This is a simple case of a C movie script somehow being filmed with an A-movie cast .. probably because of the "number 23" hook that I think sounded intriguing the enough on paper to ensure Hollywood's premium treatment. However, as - as I have already said - the film is about number 23 as much as about cheese production in Switzerland, one can not feel anything other than being cheated. <br /> <br /> I give "Fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10 because I think it did not insult my intelligence as much as "Forsaken" did or made me absolutely suicidal as "Battlefield Earth" did and the bottom of the scale should be reserved for such abominations. But do not be afraid, this is still a very bad movie.
