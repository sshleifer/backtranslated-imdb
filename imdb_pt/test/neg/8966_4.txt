**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young Mountain Horseman Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious laundry woman. "Going at 18," she begins to attract male attention and responds by throwing stones. The arrival of a dam construction team sets off romance dreams in Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of rugged engineer Robert Young (like John Stafford), who flirts with her marital status. Supervisory engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn loves. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, the neighbors suspect that she is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it were not so serious, "Spitfire" could be more fun; is an atypical and wildly inadequate vehicle for its star, which is completely unconvincing. Of the leaders, Mr. Bellamy performs best. However, the best characterization is made by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), who appeared in the version of George Cukor, along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), "Grandpa Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected ending helps.
