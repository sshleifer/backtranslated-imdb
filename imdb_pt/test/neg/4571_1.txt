I watched Cheats a few years ago with my friend. He extolled it as a great funny movie that is one of the best comedies of all time. I think he was on crack or something. I just recently learned that this movie has not been released in theaters, I can understand why perfectly. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves a group of guys who cheat almost all their chores at school to get good grades. . That's the main problem with this movie is that morale is all bad. There are other teen comedy movies where students do bad things, but most of the time it does not happen in school. So I think the concept of having a whole movie that basically has kids cheating is all too bad. <br /> <br /> I also did not like the characters in this movie. The main character is an arrogant jerk who is not a good character. Actually I'm not sure if you could say that there is a protagonist due to the fact that they are all cheating at school, which is wrong. The other supporting characters were not funny at all and basically the cast explodes in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad message and even worse performance and characters. There are other teen movies that are a lot better than this movie. So you do not have to see this and that's a good thing because I do not recommend this movie.
