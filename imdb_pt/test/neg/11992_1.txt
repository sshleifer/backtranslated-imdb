Mr. "Uwe Fail" attacks again, turned a classic game into a cheap crap. Poor performance; Bad Direction; Terrible adaptation; I mean, the game Far-Cry was incredible, it's like a real FPS game, cool weapons and many point and shoot. In the movie we had nothing compared to the game .. Well, we had some of the "point and shoot" thing, but ... I do not know how to explain, but if you ever watched another movie "Uwe Fail" you will understand. If you do not believe me, go to the "petition online" website and make a check for a so-called "Stop Uwe Bowl". <br /> <br /> That movie made my eyes bleed, someone must stop it for the first time. Do not waste your time.
