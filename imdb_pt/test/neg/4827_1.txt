It should tell something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular currently selected. The 'square' is populated by a group of characters as miserable, unreliable, amoral, rancorous and inflexible as you can imagine. Everyone is stabbing someone in the back, everyone is trying to commit adultery, everyone is trying to fool someone. That, or they're being stabbed, betrayed, or cheated. No one is cheerful. No one laughs. No one has a blinding luck of fortune or a great day. It's hell with cockney accents. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this program should be sponsored by the Samaritans. It is a perfect sight for the depressed. It does not encourage them; what it does is present a whole community of sad terminals so discouraged that viewers are moved to believe that their situation could actually be worse - they may be living in 'Albert Square'. <br /> <br /> Beyond the above; as a representation of the far east of London, is pure hokum. The programmers have evidently never been on the other side of town. The first thing you find on Mile End Road is a colossal mosque. And that very well defines the racial majority of the population. White British Londoners are a dispersed and rapidly declining minority. A large advertising poster, currently near the Bow Road viaduct, and sponsored by Tower Hamlets Health Care, states that "eight out of ten community members can now see their doctor more quickly." Ten healthy, smiling faces approach the observer in confirmation. Eight of them are dark-skinned ... <br /> <br /> What's more, I used to work with a bunch of Anglo-Saxons - I dare say 'pukka' - cockneys a few years ago. And I can say that a more odious and racist experience than I ever had. Each day was like a rally by Oswald Moseley. They could not spend 5 minutes without denigrating some other race or nationality than theirs, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' fackin 'Maceroons' were the little change of conversation. In fact, all their inventory (and extremely limited) of adjectives fixed in sexual organs and their application. Alf Garnett was a model of liberal virtue in comparison. Any program that purported to represent the native Caucasians of East London in its true nature would be completely unsuitable for broadcasting-even after 9 o'clock. Imagine a script by Ku Klux Klan written by Quentin Tarantino and you would be somewhere near the mark. But when they were not inveterate zealots, they were at least extremely cheerful. <br /> <br /> I do not know how such a novel came to be. This imaginary island of white misery has absolutely no influence on true culture. And if you have a comparatively optimistic disposition, this will quickly reduce you to tears of regret. The comparatively common actors pretending to be comparatively common chronic depressants with cockney accents - what's the point of this? <br /> <br /> Narrative, somber, relentlessly disillusioned, and ethnically absurd. The most popular program of a nation apparently ill and dying. <br /> Avoid like the plague.
