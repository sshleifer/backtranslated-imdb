The acting was poor, and the plot, well, I do not think there was one. <br /> <br /> A fat blond guy who is always dressed in a dinner suit, hijacks a kind of club, I think he kills a copper. nonsense fights, then happen Kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat, why? Hard-hitting hard-hitting martial-arts police officer turns up, speaks bad English and does things that does not make sense. Your absolute gut. But he has a good car. Christ on a bicycle, this movie was a waste of 90 minutes.
