Although this film was not anything special as such, I'm led to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favor - that of the female lead in the film, Dyan Cannon. Despite the ridiculous plot of the film and what it passes through here, her work was the best of acting in the film, making the unbelievable seem more plausible. His shrill scene with gay photographer David Hemmings has to be seen to be believed. Good work, Dyan.
