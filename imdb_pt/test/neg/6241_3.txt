I wanted to like this movie and certainly there is room for a psychological character movie that does not go for cheap thrills. However, to enjoy a movie, it takes a plausible plot, some rhythm and editing, and a feeling of involvement. In The Clearing, which begins as an intriguing mystery, with an abduction and unknown motives, it turns into a slow dragging and senseless exercise. Nothing really happens, and so-called character-driven angles (as expressed by the director in his commentary) really do not contribute much. <br /> <br /> Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best trying to engage and overcome Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings a bit of nuance to your character, in that you may feel a little sympathetic towards him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe was labeled as a villain, he has gone to the Hall of Fame of Christopher Walken's Typecasting. Wendy Crewson is generally good, but her character's input into the film was brief and artificial, and I was wondering why they bothered to introduce their character. By far the biggest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's comment, all I heard was how fabulous a talent she is. I agree, she's a great actress. So why was not it used correctly? Only for the climax of this film can she show herself, but until then the viewer stopped caring. <br /> <br /> Too bad I liked parts of this movie, but as another reviewer wrote, once you're halfway there you know the movie is not going to get much better.
