This review contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> I was researching horror movie DVDs on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew by the name it was going to be terribly naff and probably a copy of Snakes On A Plane, but it was selling new to 69p so I realized I did not have much to lose. <br /> <br /> The music played in the opening credits did not fit, although I like the song itself, a pop-rock song that is not really suitable for appearing on the soundtrack of a movie. zombie terror It started surprisingly well, the opening scenes were not too bad, some of the performances were a little bit embarrassing, but not as bad as I initially thought it would be. <br /> <br /> All goes well until Laura Cayouette (Kill Bill's Rocket: Vol. 2) comes on the scene. She should be playing a scientist. If she is, she is not very bright. Fortunately, she finished very fast. <br /> <br /> In fact, I laughed physically as the camera touched the passengers of the plane during some turbulence. There was a nun. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun? I was surprised that she was not holding a crucifix. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 35 minutes, we come to a zombie action, and we use the word 'action' freely. Special effects are well below standard, but this is expected from a movie with that budget. Being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie, but it makes you look good fun. Using slow motion also does not work very well. I think this movie is probably to blame for trying to add a lot of history. Trying to pass on the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not an especially good measure, considering that malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film practically unfolds like any other. another zombie movie. Most of the characters are dead and eventually end up with a handful of people struggling to stay alive. Possibly the worst part of the undead flight is the absolutely inconceivable end. I know it's a movie about people coming back to life and enjoying life, but the ending was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
