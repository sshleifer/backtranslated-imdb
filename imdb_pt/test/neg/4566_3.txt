I think this is a teen movie of "alternative reality" ... More precisely, a character of the Ferris Bueller type as the leader of a fraud ring. Yes, I know it's not to be compared to Ferris Bueller, at least not in a way "oranges to oranges", but not least. <br /> <br /> Bottom-line: They are galaxies far from being a minor classic. It's watchable though only if you're not expecting too much. That said, the main character has a bit of charm, but the premise wears off because writing is not smart. The film did not produce enough laughter, twisting or tension to keep me interested. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I kept watching ... Watching with hope to see if anything suddenly clicked. This did not happened. So elegant as it is, I would not recommend this movie. BTW, it seems strange to see Mary Tyler Moore as the main. She is really miscast, I hope the paycheck was excessively large.
