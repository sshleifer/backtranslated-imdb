This movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. Do you think manos is the worst movie of all time? It does not even come close to that garbage. I do not even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the rebellious chic are the worst "actors" that appear in a movie. They make troll sister 2 look like Meryl Streep. The silly face that the chic does while she is in kung fu training has to be seen to be believed. Then there is the oompa music during the break from prison, the love scene totally out of place, the stupid music that plays during the love scene out of place, the false castro, the fact that everyone has a bandana and / or bandana part of their body, the most stupid rape scene ever filmed and the worst performance ever made in the movies. This movie deserves to be better known among fans of bad movies. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
