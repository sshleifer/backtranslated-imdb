The story was disjointed, the performance was not of any caliber that you can categorize. More of a serial pilot than a real movie. I wanted to like this movie, but I just could not find anything to like about it. Whatever made the Lost boys so friendly was obviously absent here. Though he has tried hard. The conspiracy hooks were placed awkwardly in the middle of what might have been an episode of a stream of dark-haired dawsons, and the story arc was getting nowhere. Very disappointing to me. The final scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of the story planned his entire scheme .. who was he (or she) trying to child, talk naive. Stick with such genre movies of the eighties when they had more than one idea.
