I saw this at Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and I left the movie theater in the middle of this "movie" (with a lot of other people), so maybe I'm not the right person to comment on, but I think the fact of leaving "SC "is reason enough to do so. "S.C." It's a different movie. People who need a coherent narration, characters or a plotline will find nothing in this. It's supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are so forced in their intention to simply exaggerate people, who have nothing else to say. The jargon of the off-narrator is simply annoying, the visuals are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if it's the only thing, why bother? Hussein's film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead, it's annoying and annoying in its non-creativity. Note: Not every movie without a story is art and there is no more creativity in breaking taboos - especially if everything goes as badly as in "S.C." I would suggest that director Hussein should visit a psychiatrist or film school before making art mistakes again. Note: I never want to see a baby being cut off during birth again.
