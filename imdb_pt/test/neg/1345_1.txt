Imagine a movie the complete opposite of Lawrence from Arabia, instead of having an all male cast, has an all female cast. Instead of settling in the arid deserts of Arabia, it is in the metropolis of New York City. And instead of being one of the biggest movies ever made, it's one of the most meaningless, boring and forgettable. The film concerns Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a wife and perfect mother, the envy of everyone else in her high society social circle Manhatten. She is painted as a woman who carries the weight of the world on her shoulders despite the fact that she needs to live in a nanny and maid to deal with her only child. But I do not want to be too hard on her, Mary does all this while taking a liassez-faire attitude toward the fashion design work her father gave her. This idyllic lifestyle can not last forever and things start to fall in a very real way. <br /> <br /> Mary's husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough. She is naturally disturbed and breaks a little. <br /> <br /> Mary needs to recover, because of her impressionable young daughter and herself. She does this by rehabilitating, straightening and drawing her own clothing line; although surprisingly for this type of film, not a montage. Mary is successful; your daughter loves you, your mother loves you, your friends love you and your husband decides that you love her now. She decides to take her husband to cheat her back after realizing that it was her fault that he cheated, since she did not like him enough. <br /> <br /> The movies that save grace is that it does not go down by "all men are evil way.
