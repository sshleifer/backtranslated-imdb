Gordon beats the typical Full Moon fashion, but that's to be expected. Combs is surprisingly understated, keeping its performance at a more realistic level than we are accustomed to seeing. Also gone was the usual black humor of Stuart Gordon 'ironic'. <br /> <br /> The film is quite effective in showing Combs's break and his last heroic act to save his wife and daughter. You really feel sympathy for your character, despite your shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the nudity and pornography of sex, than I was shocked by violence and visual violence. <Br> <br /> Not classic Gordon, but certainly something you can enjoy if you have seen your most famous movies.
