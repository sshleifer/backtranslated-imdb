Another sequel! Why on earth do they keep doing this? This has to be the weakest franchise of all time, but it is still being funded and generating sequences. SCARECROW GONE WILD - that I just watched so I could officially destroy the whole series - brings back the evil clown who again kills some college kids ... That's basically it. The acting is a drug (as usual), the death scenes are more than pathetic, and do not be fooled by the title, this thing does not have as much nudity as you can imagine. A couple of pretty topless girls, but no big deal squeezing their pants. Let me conclude my continued insult (or review) about this movie by saying: if I run into a SCARECROW IN SPACE or a FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the shelves of the rental companies, I will be absolutely amazed ...
