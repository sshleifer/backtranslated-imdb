My husband wanted to watch this movie because the newspaper review said it was better than Fatal Attraction. Well, not liking Michael Douglas or Glenn Close, I would have to agree. Not for conventional reasons. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that need to be watched late at night when you do not want to watch something that really requires thinking but does not want to go to bed. still. <br /> <br /> Yancy Butler is a really fun bad guy. She is not the best of the actresses, in fact she is not good, but she is perfect for that role in this film. Everyone varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who appears as a deformed Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: The end goes one or two steps too far, complete with the clich√© not completely dead. with a roar will still give you a moment and then there is a photo of Pinocchio with his frozen wooden smile that makes you wonder if they were wanting to relax or just forgot that there was botox in makeup. <br /> <br /> Regardless, it is a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad movie, you would have to be lacking the mood gene to not enjoy it a bit. Do not pay for it, but if you're in that kind of apathetic television mood, then that's just right.
