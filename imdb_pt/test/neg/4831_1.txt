Wait till you watch this ... I mean, even after reading this review. No other movie to date has sucked more than this .... One thing I do not understand is that when you're ripping out some English movie why add your own creativity? With the amount spent to make this movie, the producers should have considered the purchase rights of "Cellular" to be dubbed in Hindi and released the film. They may have made some profits that way, I guess. If there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0, I would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played Aftab's helper. I do not know if my problem is that I've seen Cellular much earlier than this movie ..... but that may not be a reason to support this movie ... I could go for hours but neither do I have time to discussing this useless crap from a movie I do not want to remember those horrible movie scenes ..... Please stay away from this movie.
