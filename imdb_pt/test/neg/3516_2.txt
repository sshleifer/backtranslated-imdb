By no means should this overly simplistic script, basically a character, be construed as resource entertainment. In fact, it has enough material for a short eighteen minutes, and even this would seriously overburden your attention. Zero characters besides the Noble Willingham are developed. The endless close-up of lips and phones is sleep-inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. In fact, this whole sad thing should not have been put on film. A tape recording would have been more than enough to put him to sleep. Definitely not recommended. - MERK
