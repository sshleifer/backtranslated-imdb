This movie is like many biopic TV movies that I've seen: stereotyped, overplayed, poorly acted and, most importantly, happening too early. What I mean by that is that the film was filmed and for that matter, it aired before Michael Jackson's acquittal of his allegations of child sexual abuse, which I think was one of the most significant periods of Jackson's life and career so far. It would probably have been a great end to this documentary. However, this movie already bites more than it can chew, filling many details in this overly ambitious project. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has perhaps led the most interesting life of any musician so far, let alone the modern pop star to this day, and his story would probably take six Behind The Music specials to tell with accuracy. This movie tried to count too much in three hours, and needless to say that it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did what he could by playing Jackson, but came out more like a SNL cartoon Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would be admittedly difficult to find someone who accurately portrayed Jackson without meeting the King of Pop himself and studying his methods of madness. With a tight budget, however, one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and these do not necessarily give an accurate representation. <br /> <br /> In addition, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely Foolish. The Caucasian make-up on Alexander's face makes it look more like a reverse minstrels show, and everyone in a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's. It is also incredible to me that the film documents Jackson going to the knife to do a cosmetic surgery, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same size nose. This kind of suspension of disbelief that the director hopes can not stand up to viewers in the 21st century. It was even more disturbing when pictures of the real Michael Jackson (ie the time he hung his infant to over a balcony in Germany) was interspersed in the movie in real time. It was a good try, but it just did not work. <br /> <br /> If this movie were released in theaters, it would only make a profit because of its grip. It still pales in comparison to "Mommie Dearest", and that's saying a lot. Above all, this was a movie that was probably made hastily, like many TV movies that are not on HBO. It could have been made much better if he had just spoken of one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it only covered the allegations of child abuse, it would probably have been made much better and would have been even more intriguing.
