I saw this movie at the 2005 Edinburgh International Film Festival. This movie was compared on the Sideways EIFF program - which I liked - so I was really looking forward to this movie. I also enjoyed Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite etc ... so I have had good recent experiences with indy slightly weird American movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I discovered that Puffy Chair does not compare favorably with any of these movies. <br /> <br /> I was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something fun, witty, insightful or even slightly interesting to happen. This did not happen - and the unstable video camera made me sick - so I left. <br /> <br /> This is just the second movie I've ever come out (the first one was "Showgirls"), which is a little disappointing. I probably could have lasted for the duration if it were not for the nauseating effects of the faltering picture - but nothing in the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I was missing out on something. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
