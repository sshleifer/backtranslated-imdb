This movie was so dumb and slow that it was always slow. The only good part of the movie was the girl in gold tights. There was no gore whatsover and what a horror movie from the 80's without a little blood. Besides, the killer was nothing scary or the murders. But if you enjoy watching the world's worst horror film, then this is for you. Do not waste your time as I watched it.
