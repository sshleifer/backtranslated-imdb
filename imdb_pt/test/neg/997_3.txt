Writer and director Robert Downey, a pioneer of the 1960s underground film movement, satirized the New York advertising world on Madison Avenue with his cutting-edge comedy "Putney Swope." Downey does not limit his ridicule to publicity, but addresses militant black culture, the dynamics of Hollywood's race portrait, the white power structure of the elite, and the character of corruption in any power struggle. As bold and ambitious as Putney Swope strives to be, he qualifies as a terrible movie, made gently on a shoe-string budget with an unnamed cast and humor that lacks joy. Everything about this movie smells like improvisation. "Putney Swope" provoked controversy during its initial launch with its politically incorrect treatment of racial issues and consumer culture. Like most of the Marx Brothers' films, the plot is small, providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal jokes, most of which are terrible. <br /> <br /> The president of a prestigious Madison Avenue advertising agency dies during a council meeting. Before the body is removed, the council holds a secret ballot to determine who will replace it. Each member understands that it is forbidden to vote for itself. A complete accident occurs when everyone votes on the symbolic black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), since no one thought anyone would vote for him. Pink Swope slides all but one of the white executives, engages with black pistol-wrapping employees and renames the company "Propaganda of Truth and Soul." Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept customers whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. Swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the CEO, and the attraction attracts a new line of customers who come into his office carrying sacks of money and preparing to suffer abuse from Swope's militant officials. Swope also explores his African American team, ruthlessly appropriating his ideas after he dismisses them and evokes a series of offensive ad campaigns, all hailed as a "new wave" of marketing genius. Unbelievably, Swope's conservatism proves successful, but the agency becomes the target of government agents who argue that Swope's propaganda tactics constitute "a threat to national security." The highlight of this 85-minute black-and-white comedy is color television commercials. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to stop these ads that consistently start out smart but exhaust their welcome. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" involves the relationship of our protagonist with the American president Mimeo in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana dwarf with a Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) giving meaningless jokes when trying to convince Swope to create a advertising campaign for his new car, Borman 6.
