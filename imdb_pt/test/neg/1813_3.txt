Despite the excellent cast and potential of the story, this film fails on many levels. I was convinced the director was a beginner. The film is very poorly edited, shows many non important and annoying flashes, has very visible goofs and has no suspense atmosphere. The question that repeatedly appeared in my mind while watching this was, "so what?" I could not care less about the protagonist and what happens to him. It is not that the story is not convincing, it is simply the way it is told. The film tells the story. PERIOD. He's like an actor who murmurs his lines, not knowing what he's saying. The film simply tells the events that happen, without any soul. And the director is to blame. He does not know how to do something interesting, suspenseful or pleasurable. (And believe me, I'm not someone who wants to see the hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crap. On the contrary, I especially like slow movies.) So I was convinced that the director was a newbie. But to my amazement, this man has years of experience and worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant on many wonderful productions. I think he had a bad year then.
