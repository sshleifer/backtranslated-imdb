A giant praying mantis is awakened from his sleep in the artic region and heads south causing havoc. Boats, airplanes and trains find their departure with the flying creature. Before releasing all of his anger in New York, the mantis finds its destruction at the hands of the military in a New York tunnel. Special effects are naturally raw by today's standards, but for a ten-year-old boy in 1957 this was very memorable. <br /> <br /> William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway all star.
