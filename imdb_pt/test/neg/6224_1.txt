There's no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience than watching Mamma Mia: Hitler must be looking up, telling pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd, 'You monster, what have you done?' <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie is wrong. Only?? Wrong! Even his success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when these shitty parody movies, like Epic Movie, make their small share of money and make a profit just because they're cheap (of course!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes $ 450 million worldwide, you think "what the hell is wrong with the world?" <br /> <br /> And to think we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest living actresses in the world, in that? What was she thinking? "I need the money," she might say. Well, then, sell one of your grandchildren, even if it's less embarrassing. Not that Meryl is good at a disastrous stretch of "movie." She's disastrous, too! When she sings, even having the vocals, it's ridiculous. Worse than she's just Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he's singing Abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Same? And when I mention Abba, not that I have anything against the band and its music. Although this does not help them when actors started to sing (badly), dance (worse) and the extras come together then (They come out of nowhere! Often!) To present one terrible musical sequence after another. You want to cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre in which you pray for the real silence. <br /> <br /> I could go on. The list goes on forever. You could write a novel by Stephen King with the full list of errors in this movie. <br /> <br /> In short: go and watch it! Same! You have to witness to understand !! And since it is already a great success, who cares if he makes a few more dollars with you? And it's not like you're selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did this before. For all mankind. And now the world must end, because we have committed the supreme evil and must be destroyed.
