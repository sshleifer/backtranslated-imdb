Two stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer looking like a young version of her father, Christopher Plummer on the street, stars in this film along with Robert Forster - who really should have put a black shoe on top of that bald spot. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. She always plays these half-crazy characters in movies that do not add up, and she does it again in one. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have two young women, sisters, who do not look the least, who allow themselves to be picked up separately by questionable men along the roads. <br /> <br /> The character of Amanda, Sandra, at least has a good reason to allow Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) to get it in the first place. She was thrown off the road, apparently by a maniac, and her car is practically destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning - Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> However, as we move on, we realize that Dr. Jake is not playing with a full deck any more than Amanda is. He makes all decisions based on the touch of a coin. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel, who do we see, but the maniac's car, and what Amanda does, but gets into his station? wagon and start snooping around. Her motive for this is never clear, considering that the man is apparently dangerous and may try to kill her. One might think that the last thing she would do would be to put herself in such a precarious situation. <br /> <br /> She not only snoops around, but also finds some money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Right after this, we have several other things that do not add up. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake, with Amanda as a passenger, runs out of gas, and the two leave the car and start walking. One would think crossing a desert, he would have checked his gas meter - this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow that to happen. Later, he is seen driving the same car. When or how did he get the car back? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda that he knows she got the money. Now how would he know that? He did not see her do this as far as I know, and she did not tell him she did it. <br /> <br /> So then we have a character named Santini (David Thewlis), the man who drove the van, give them a ride, and I'll be curious if he does not know that Amanda got the money, too. How would he know that? <br /> <br /> Lose credibility at an alarming rate the further we advance. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk), grabs the claws of the killer and decides her fate in playing a coin - someone would think she would be very, very careful that the coin she exchanges for a trick coin would definitely be the coin of the trick - but apparently it is not. <br /> <br /> It's shocking stuff like this destroys whatever credibility this movie might have had.
