This movie is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The acting is so wooden that a door could have done a better job. The plot is ridiculous and superficial and the current "rugby" shown is far from reality. I still do not understand the "haka" as portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment. I am not a Kiwi, but I know that Haka can only be interpreted by someone of Maori origin and not by an all white American boy. <br /> <br /> I'm assuming this was done for the American public. then the superficiality and the "Disney ending" is excusable, but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game except the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of a football game and makes everyone play rugby . The only good thing about this movie were the final credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into the eyes.
