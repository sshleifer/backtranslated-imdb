A very horrible movie, I'm impressed by the likes of Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave have agreed to be in it, it's like a very long episode of a series of poor TV detectives. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw has to be Vinnie Jones, he just can not act, who had the brilliant idea of ​​climbing him as a protagonist wants him to examine his head unless he puts his own money in project? He must be playing thugs, looking menacing and not talking! <br /> <br /> There was also central heating around Dickens times as there were three large radiators behind your table ?? <br /> <br /> No wonder they gave it away for free with a newspaper like no one would pay to see it.
