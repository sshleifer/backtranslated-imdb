I really have to rate "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst bits of dreck I've ever seen. The film inadvertently exhibits those who are the worst aspects of the French, or at least how stereotyped they are, narcissism, snobbery and pseudo-intellectualism. I myself am French-Canadian and feel a bit of a shame that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me, which should give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really was! One does not watch this film as much as torture, there was a total lack of humor, and it seemed to me that the entire film was a documentary that interviewed people who were neither famous nor talented, as if they wanted to celebrate. something that never happened to begin with. Instead, why not watch Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance, or Je t'aime ... a la folie, three fantastic modern French films.
