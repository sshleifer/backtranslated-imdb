That sounded like it was the Silence of the Innocents or the Zodiac or something, but it was not. It really was more like one of the Halloween movies without all the leaping scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 From Outer Space, in the sense that the main villain made futile speeches that made me want to snack non-stop. The idea of ​​a person who is so crazy that he would kidnap people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the execution was made for the TV. I have to say it was better than I expected for a movie written and starring Dee Snider. A good first effort. He may learn some lessons and his next effort will be less clumsy.
