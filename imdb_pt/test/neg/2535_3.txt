I think the problem with some reactions to this movie is that - with few exceptions - they do not focus on the main disconnect, hence the main division in the audience. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there are those who are driven by the visual design, beautiful costumes and variety of elements that enter the film. Some children's movie fans love color and animation, and all non-scary 'magical' effects, transforming animals, and so on. Some culture lovers like the complicated references, layers of different folk elements and the fact that they can watch Zhang Ziyi singing and almost imitating, in two different languages, what was really meant to be a children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point, that a mixture of folktales is not a tale, and that it is easier to believe in magic when thought and care went into technical aspects to make it look real. In other words, the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them on the stage they have to deliver. Here, they do not. <br /> <br /> A good folktale - from any country - has a clear history, a point and characters that interact strongly with each other. That lacks all of them. Some overly sophisticated gestures for opera, Western and Japanese, do not replace a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fan of fantasy, I must say that I have been through some turkeys and loved some, but this really tries to do many things - cheaper. Putting on Zhang Ziyi to try to add a little glitter smells like exotic flower syndrome. The other problem is not that there is no plot; there is half a plot, which means that you are still being pulled in, then dropped again when another number of not very well performed dance begins. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to know that they are starring in a movie. Unless you really enjoy watching amateur videos of other people, this is not good. I would like to test this on real children; I think they would play for Uproar in the Sky after 20 minutes.
