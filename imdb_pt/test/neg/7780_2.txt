The problem with this movie is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not intriguing, it's not stimulating, it's not, it's not exciting, it's not even a little interesting. I saw this movie recently on tape and was glad I did not spend money to rent it. It's basically a poor attempt at making movies. I will not even bother telling the story. Story? What story?
