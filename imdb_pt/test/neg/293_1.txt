Like a terrible cancer raining in the sky, I went into that pot on some movie channel the other night. Being a fan of bad movies, and actively participating in the purchase and viewing of bad movies, I was intrigued by the idea of ​​a genuinely terrible action movie coming from modern times. After that was over, I found my hands inexplicably turned against me, grabbing anything in range and stabbing my head and neck. Something sinister was on this tape ... err ... where I was ... anyway, this is among the most embarrassingly bad pieces of film I've ever seen. William Forsythe can not play more than one character, and this character is always a joke. Even when placed on a comic background and given things to do and say that they should be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo) he is laughable on the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is the same, having starred in her share of terrible films and done terrible jobs in them all, she does not stop helping to end this. Andrew Divoff, a villain of classic films, does a respectable job, but he can hardly imagine what to do. Even a dependable standby for movie action b Daniel Bernhardt fails to deliver anything close to entertainment. As for the film's own merits, the plot is lame, the script, as well as the action and movement of the plot, is both boring and ... stupid, for lack of a better adjective (you know they did not put it no effort at all, why should I?). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones, and anyone who has ever watched enough can learn to enjoy them, but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the meanest tolerant films and simply feel inclined to test their courage. Before you do this, take it away from me, this is neither terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike, say ... some of the most ridiculous Italian zombie movies). A fan of B-movie action would be far better checking most of Bernhardt's other films, or just about anything else that has already been filmed. America is simply not the place for action that it seems, especially not now. If you have a desire, check out anything on the seas, movies like Heroic Duo or the somewhat less normal Hakaider (along with anything else on the amazing Keita Amemiya cannon) will provide much more fun and better action than your apt find somewhere else, especially here.
