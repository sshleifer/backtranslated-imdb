Brought to you by the following among others: <br /> <br /> 1- Yigal Carmon (Hebrew יגאל כרמון) is the president and founder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) <br /> <br /> Yigal Career: <br /> <br /> Colonel, Israeli Army Intelligence from 1968-88 Acting Head and Counselor in Arab Affairs, Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria, 1977-1982 <br /> 2- Raphael Shore is a writer, producer and Israeli-Canadian rabbi worked full-time for Aish HaTorah. He is the founder of The Clarion Fund, a nonprofit organization that seeks to advance the idea that the United States faces a threat from radical Islam. Shore is also a regular critic of media coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which he claims is regularly anti-Israel. (LMAO) <br /> <br /> 3- Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Funny how the ADL supports this hateful advertisement. You can never say by reading the title of the name "Anti-Defamation". <br /> <br /> Use your mind and see how these people are objective. They have their own agenda! <br /> <br /> I think, therefore I am.
