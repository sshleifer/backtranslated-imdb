I was interested in watching it since it was cited as the all-time worst film in a 1950s science fiction movie entry in an early 1980s British newspaper entitled "The Movie" (incidentally, the Leonard Maltin Film Guide also awarded this the enviable BOMB rating). When it came out on DVD last year, I was interested in buying the "Cult Camp Classics" Box Set in which it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); however, since I recently gotten the QUEEN on DVD-R, I put the idea aside. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I just found the movie in DivX - however, the impression was not taken from the movie. Warners DVD (which is said to have a surprisingly nice download), but rather a slushy TV impression ... though not so much that the detail is lost (in other words, it was like watching the movie in sepia rather than black and -white!) . Anyway, to get to the subject in question: I have to admit that in a way, I was disappointed that the film did not prove to be the festival of laughter that I had anticipated all this time (Maltin calls it "hilariously horrible") . ; in fact, I found it very interesting - and fortunately brief in little more than an hour of duration. Some undeniably amusing bits remain however - like when the old nurse starts shouting at the 15-meter woman, and when the sheriff's deputy nearly runs over her boss and the main lady's butler in her enthusiasm to help in a case so unusual. Nor did the special effects hit me like "among the funniest" (Maltin again) in the movie - though they are certainly embarrassingly bad! <br /> <br /> OK, so the idea that an alien (in human form of giant size, dressed in caveman rags, and radioactive to kick!) coming to Earth in a large spaceship in the form of ball and, apparently, after the valued heroin necklace is totally meaningless - and its almost transparent appearance does not favor anything ... but, in fact, it is human history that catches our attention (relatively speaking). The character of the womanizing husband is not very interesting, but his two women are: the rich but annoying alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and the ambitious and violent girlfriend Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the narrative is Hayes's faithful servant (already mentioned), a pair of cops (one of them, as noted elsewhere, being kindly goofy) and so many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [!] an expert who is called when Hayes begins to grow in size after being exposed to radiation). Of course the film could be seen as the inverted female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) - although it would not be fair to compare the two more, since the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic is much more psychological / intellectual approach; in fact, Hayes does not seem to be so bothered by his "condition" and, in fact, uses it to teach a lesson to his husband! However, his fury - exaggerated in movie posters of the time - is rather old-fashioned (especially when it is thought to occur only in the last ten minutes); when the damage caused by her massive but highly unconvincing hand is not shown (especially when lifting the doll that is supposed to be her husband!), she is seen mainly walking from far and near behind (with their inconsistent size in proportion to the buildings) she goes by) !! Still, the end of Hayes by electrocution (when it hits an electric cable) is done competently. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed this with your 1993 TV remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature - which I rented specifically for this purpose.
