Yes, this movie features a girl named Jessica who says that everything is wrong and she causes the trees to fall on people too (well, she only makes a tree fall once, but she says everything is bad). This movie is about a farm that apparently rents rooms for people, but offers little more in terms of entertainment. Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil face. Of course they do not know this until the owner of the farm helpers opens the box containing the head. The head proceeds to hypnotize everyone so that she can reach out to Jessica and use her powers to find things to help search for her body. This movie has an interesting enough story, but it's really bad here. Everyone in this movie will get on your nerves at least once.
