Film based on Jacqueline Susann's bestseller. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a ruthless TV anchor that makes its way to the top. He details his love life by focusing on Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows your total inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he may have. <br /> <br /> Romance is not a work of art (nor is it good literature), but it is a quick and silly way. read. But this movie makes it look like "Gone With the Wind"! This is a classic example of how NOT to make a film adaptation. First they condense the novel terribly. In the book, Stone's inability to compromise is treated and the why is revealed. Here it is brought ... and ignored. There is also a truly revolting scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but there's a reason totally left out of the movie. And the book dealt with three women - not two. Do not even talk about homophobia. <br /> <br /> The side adaptation is very terrible. Law is horrible as Stone - VERY wooden and boring - you wonder why all these women are after him. To be fair to Law - another actor was cast, but suffered a very serious accident before filming began and Law stepped in at the last minute. Wexler is terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is truly astounding as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable like Christie Lane. Only three performances stand out: David Hemmings (having a great time) camped as a gay photographer; Cannon is really good and Robert Ryan is great. Also Dionne Warwick sings the captivating opening song ("He Moving On"). It's bad, but I watched the whole thing and it's (a bit silly) a lot of fun. I'm giving a 3. <br /> <br /> Also Jacqueline Susann has a participation as speaker.
