What is it about the French? First, they (seemingly) like Jerry Lewis a lot more than the US. Second, they (seem) like Edgar Allan Poe's work more than anyone else. It has to be the "Beaudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong ... I'm a fan of Poe. But this trilogy manages to do three of the stories below Poe's average on ... well, I'm not sure what they're made of. <br /> <br /> "Toby Dammit" is a great Fellini movie, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of the subject. It's nice at first view. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing to do with Poe or spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How were the Vadim films produced? It's just awful ... not even by the standards of amateur film school. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try ignoring it and saving your time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the most loyal segment to Poe's work. It does not have much style, however, even though it includes the strangest snowball fight I've ever seen in the movies. (It seems like the boys are throwing handkerchiefs, or perhaps handkerchiefs, that were wrapped in balls.) My advice is to jump "Metzergenstein", watch "William Wilson", and then, if you are a fan of Fellini (I'm not) keep "Toby Dammit" while you make dinner or make a snack.
