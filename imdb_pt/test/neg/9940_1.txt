Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg in the northern part of Norway, where the climate is cold and hostile, the days are dark during winter and cities face the young people moving to the most populous parts of southern Norway where the weather is warmer and there are more opportunities. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this movie is humans themselves. The people of the choir, who are between 30 and 95 years old, have unique and colorful lives and are very nice beings. They are characterized by severe weather and recession of the North and have adapted to the way of life required. Throughout the film, we learned a bit about many people at the choir and followed them through songs, some events at a church and in the harbor, and at the end, a trip to Murmansk. <br /> <br /> External environment filmed in the film is very beautiful and characterized by Norwegian nature. Scenography is also natural and taken directly from the chorus and the lives of the people we know. Its living rooms, the bathroom, the kettle in the oven; There is nothing artificial about this film, neither in people, nor in the environment, nor in music nor in feelings. Everything is as real as it can be. <br /> <br /> Everything loses when it comes to giving a story. It's very beautiful and real, but why do we see this? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or it is simply just to see a story about Berlevåg Mens-Choir, about his life and some of the trips they have. The message, if any, is that this little society deals with life through social events like the chorus. The chorus kept people together for many years. <br /> <br /> It's all cool, but being as popular as it has been seen by almost 200,000 people in Norway, something is wrong. There is no beginning or end to it. No one wins or loses anything, no one reveals any message or tries to convince the public that this is good or that life up there is great. Why was this movie made? <br /> <br /> Sorry. It's a good movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - it does not deserve a 9 out of 10. It's closer to 4 out of 10, and that's what I'll give it to him. If you see this movie in a movie theater, you should expect the average age of the audience to be 55-60. He reported being consistently loud in all theaters. Perhaps this is also the reason to receive such high praise in the news and good notes also in IMDB: It is a film about the elderly, for the elderly. It's a film of "I regret nothing in my life," and a story saying that living in a small town like Berlevåg can be a good life as well.
