I hired the DVD yesterday and first of all it started bad, it's 4: 3 aspect ratio movie, and it keeps getting worse, the acting is so bad and the movie itself is predictable, I was like watching the movie and saying to myself: This will happen next and guess what happened? Okay ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action boxing movie, do not watch this end you'll end up disappointed with this low budget movie like I did. go and see Ali better!
