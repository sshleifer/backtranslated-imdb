Having had more than a few friends suggesting that I check Rise of the Footsoldier, I finally got to him last night. Undoubtedly, the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and did in his autobiography) is a compelling tale about a man's rise from boy Bootout to connected underworld villain. This movie, unfortunately compromised in quality by miscasts, terrible accents and acting deplorable. Ricci Harnett in the lead role of Leach does a reasonable job of passing the transition from bad guy to serious criminal, but his accent is all over the place. As her voice provides the storytelling, it is something that after ten minutes was driving me crazy. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker since the unintended comedy with an ill-fitting wig (or the worst going Barnett) dialogue that was so explicitly riddled in juvenile and one on the top vehemence in the delivery of line by reducing Tucker's parody. bothered me this movie was that the events that led to the shooting at Rettenden, Essex and the years of Leach's training are of genuine interest to crime fans and fans of football vandalism, so having this story sabotaged by the lack of accents and actions credible left me feeling that an opportunity had been missed. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper give films just a source of authenticity. On the plus side, some of the stimulation and construction films flowed well and kept the attention. The violence was well choreographed and, in addition to an over-reliance on projectile red syrup for blood splatters, was generally realistic. If you liked the movie, then it's worth checking out the Essex Boys telling a similar story from a fictional point of view and also featuring Billy Murray.
