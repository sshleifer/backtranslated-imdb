AZN TV bought the rights to this movie and the station is showing the title in English, THE PICKPOCKET. <br /> <br /> PICKPOCKET, 1997, takes amateur movies to home movies at surprising levels of dislike. The film portrays a series of long and tedious wanderings of an uninteresting and confused face. This main character, Xiao Wu, does not go around at random. Viewers, unfortunately, will soon realize that Xiao Wu has an unparalleled talent for seeking and staying asleep near the most unpleasant noises found in China. Hatching empty buckets of tin being beaten with a stick - it's there. All of China's ancient engines are dying - it's there. A crying baby? Yes, you guessed it, it's there! According to THE PICKPOCKET, China is the most annoying and unpleasant place on planet Earth. <br /> <br /> The only element worse than the sound of THE PICKPOCKET is photography. The camera shakes, shakes and shakes a little more. Finally, the camera stops, but then falls to the knees of the actor and stays there until someone on the team notices the error and starts shaking the camera again. Most of the unstable film is framed in distant, long, long, and long images. In the few times when the camera gets a little closer, nothing is needed to connect the viewer with what is happening. <br /> <br /> The photograph is dark, faded and often blurry. The use of color is - well, there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color. Almost all scenes are performed 20 times for a long time. Few movies are so painful to sit on. This movie is painful to watch and painful to hear. And then it just ends. <br /> <br /> John Woo fans may like to hear part of the DIE XUE SHUANG XIONG soundtrack, as the lead character hangs outside a video store for many minutes. . Anyway, be warned - PICKPOCKET will steal your good time.
