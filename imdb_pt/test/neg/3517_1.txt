This film is a lousy example of uninspired narrative, trying to hide behind an "art" facade, trying to shock the public with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover up their psychological depth of characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this film is pretentious, from the thanks to Bela tarr at the beginning, to photography, acting, music, history and editing. When, suddenly, for no reason, you are forced to watch close-ups of charismatic and Hungarian people on their boats, while the soundtrack tries to persuade you that this is a dramatic moment even though they are only on the way. for the local alcoholic's funeral, that's one thing. Placing scenes of rape completely unmotivated as a shock is a different thing, for which I absolutely have no understanding. This film is struggling to get into a certain genre of (Eastern European) artistic films, but it lacks the subtlety, observational skills and "soul" that other directors have.
