The first few minutes showing the cold and grumpiness of Willis' character were very enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but he really got full after that. This is just a big banal and little annoying to kids from times gone by without any innovation. I know the cast probably chose this kid to show that Willis was so annoying in his youth, but I met this ESPECIALLY annoying and whinney kid.
