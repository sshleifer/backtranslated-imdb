It is impossible to make a movie based on a book like "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostojevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great director, but this film is at a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie was the ending. Well, let's think about the book. In the end, we have the "culprit" Dimitrij Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. In the end, the famous epilogues of Dostojevsky, friends and family making a plan to save him. But that's it ... and now the film takes two more steps and shows us an illusion that ends with the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). only from the moral point of view, I am sure that Dostojevsky would end the book with an open end because, on the one hand, he is not guilty (Smerdjakov is the real killer) and therefore he has to be a free man. But on the other hand he goes to the father to kill him, so he decided to commit the crime ... this is a moral dilemma and then the following point is an open end ... well, it's really not just full open . <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect from such great actors ... In the front, of course, an excellent performance of Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think there are not many actors who can play this role in a better way. <br /> <br /> But like I said at the beginning: This book is not adaptable. It should never be a movie in two hours, that's impossible. I think there are some longer films so maybe they could do the right thing ... But I just keep the opinion that this book can not be adapted. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <br /> A point for the great director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a superb performance of Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally: a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky
