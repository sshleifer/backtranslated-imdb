Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One should think that this parade of great actors could really warm this movie, but no. Travolta takes on the role of Chili Palmer again, but this time we've seen the gangster who tries his luck in the difficult world of cinema, is no longer funny. This is a typical problem in Hollywood, they think that if the first was good, the second will be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the second can not be, Hey Hollywood try to understand the originality can not be duplicated, you have that gives us a new twist, not just the same movie made with a bigger budget. I've always met my selves. Hardly laughing when I watched this movie, but still it has a lot of cool actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock, and that's it! <br /> <br /> 4/10
