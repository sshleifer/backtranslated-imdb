With this film I was really hoping that the idea would compensate for the joint incompetence of the first AVP, and yet to my horror: Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> My hopes I was awakened in the opening moments of the movie inside the Predator ship, and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the home world of the Predators (a frosted digital disposable painting, but it's still good to finally see ) and then, of course, humans (if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> One has to wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie from Aliens and Predators. At the very least, the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework. <br /> <br /> The characters are created the same way we expected on the worst Friday, the 13th Sequel. The pizza delivery scene was indecisive, as was every character interaction scene that followed. Bimbos and teen non-actors do not create a REAL movie, they make a cheap movie, and Alien 1-3 and the Predator movies are good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st Alien is a "B" movie made like an "A" movie) The Strause brothers actually missed an opportunity, which could have been corrected simply by knowing their roots. Alien + Predator: In both Alien and Predator movies we are introduced to characters who are part of a larger group. Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts and in the Predator movies we usually follow a main unit hero: Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it is easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong: in Alien Resurrection we have pirates ... or something, AVP we have ... explorers? ... with weapons ?? and it is clear that in AVP-R we have clichés of slasher for adolescents. What is there to identify here? In concept, the idea of ​​a convict returning to a small town and a returning war veterinarian seemed like a setting for a First Blood action hero, but like many other things, he was never paid. <br /> <br /> Film Making is equally devoid of reason rhyme. There is no sense of momentum for action, only small sequences that build the tiniest levels of tension or interest only to cut when they are getting interesting ... by getting the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action scenes themselves, though heavily ballyhooed in the trailers, are so obscurely illuminated, it is literally impossible to tell what is happening during the fight scenes when they finally occur. Basically, the movie is banned from multiple levels. Bad actors combined with bad direction and an atrocious script (which I, as a writer, I noticed, seemed to hit every wrong note and cliché that only the unprincipled writer without ideas could have mustered) WRITTEN, if it can be called like that, no is not even straightforward for video quality, nor does it show a trace of respect for the established tradition of previous entries in the series. Why does the Predalien suddenly have the ability to toss alien embryos into a pregnant woman's throat to use it as an incubator for the crooks? More than likely, because the dead brainwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as fast as possible. (which means the supposed characters) replace the actual character development (remember a character is defined by what they do, DO NOT SAY) Why the sheriff is taking civilians to a weapons cache ( he is not a law enforcement officer How does everyone's bimbo know where they are Why Predalien expects the Predator CHANGE SLOWLY remove his mask before attacking Why the aliens are still falling into that nasty habit of the series- After all, this series was about a character saying "People are dying ... we need guns!" this writer up works is beyond me, and reflects poorly on Fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. one involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental disability or really is inept at all levels of the film production process. <br /> <br /> The effects are very bad this time around. Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is getting lazy with the design of their creatures. The aliens look like modified Alien Resurrection remnants, with the same bulky musculature around their arms, as if they did not learn in that movie that was not a good project, nor a good one to recycle. Once again, everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness, not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. And just like in AVP, Stan Winston misses a lot when the Predator's false face is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are many flaws to list, so I'll just say: do not waste your money on this movie. . Fox is beyond caring about the fans, as this cheap and useless film is clearly evidence. I felt bad for taking my girlfriend to see (though it was free) and apologized to her profusely afterwards. This is a stubborn fan that is made with the franchise. <br /> <br /> Note to Fox: What we really wanted was not an irrational slasher film, it was a cinematic adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook, which was better than anything you have produced for this franchise post in 1993. <br /> <br /> Leaving.
