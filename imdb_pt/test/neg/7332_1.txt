This guy is a real job. An angry and immature boy in the body of an adult man, carrying all the charisma of a rock, he goes to places that most people would only like to visit and do everything to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone you really like. <br /> <br /> I could go on an endless list of all the stupid things that guy does in his 'episodes', though I just highlight the worst: Crete. While locals are putting seaside picnics in their "honor", this clown has the gall to act like a petulant spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. What an asshole. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes pretending disbelief at a bunch of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talk to a half-witted American, like work) because they did not think Abba was horrible. Wherever he went he brought Abba. This is the kind of conversation you would hear from 13-year-olds who watch MTV too much. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he was annoyed that a certain restaurant had better fried potatoes, so he "accidentally" poured some wine to ruin them. What a strange, emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> Worst of all are his clumsy voices, where he tries in vain to add some sort of perspective to a situation that he was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. He tries to use all these "big" words to sound like an author, but in fact it's just a pretentious hack whose unconsciousness convinced him that he has something to say. Which, by the way, is probably the good thing about the TV show of this joker. It will show you, no matter how inept you are, as long as you take yourself seriously enough, so does the world. <br /> <br /> Then there is the way he speaks with local guides whose English is obviously only rudimentary. He will use the vocabulary that any writer - as he believes himself to be - would know instinctively that he probably will not be understood by these people. Does he care? No. Selfish slaves like this clown Bourdain do not use language to communicate; they use this to seem important. The Mcg13jthm review on this very page is a perfect example of the kind of mind that Bourdain draws it from a low IQ social mismatch. Notice how the reviewer tries to justify Bourdain's sociopathic nature with simple, childish excuses that hardly make sense. "Bourdain can complain, but he goes through 'a lot' and, not only that, he was 'forced' to do this show, but he's trying to redeem himself." An idiot draws dolts, and reading the McG13jthm review should let you know perfectly well whether or not you're the kind of person who would appreciate this totally useless and useless show. <br /> <br /> Finally, to add a bit of "fairness" to my diatribe, I admit that Bourdain would have been momentarily amused if he had found him in a bar. But as the host of a travel program whose aim is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a miserable, abject, desperate, sombre and depressing failure. A failure.
