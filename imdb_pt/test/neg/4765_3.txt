"The Hep Cat," by Bob Clampett, is a distinctly medium-sized drawing, only notable for being the first Looney Tune in color (previously Looney Tunes were all in black and white, while Merrie Melodies were colorful). The tale of a singing and dancing cat tries to lure a cat and attempts a cat to catch the cat, "The Cat Hep" does not have the energy and rhythm trademark of most Clampett shorts. To be fair, Clampett does not have much to work with. Warren Foster's script is embarrassingly thin and although he has turned straw into gold with other cartoons, Clampett can not do it with 'The Hep Cat'. It is usually said of Clampett that you can not confuse your cartoons with anyone else's and is generally true, but "The Hep Cat" is an exception. There are flashes of genius Clampett, as the chase scene in the cat to ask the dog "Hey, you're following me." When the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says "Oh" and the chase immediately resumes. Unfortunately, there is very little of such brilliance in show here. Knowing who directed it, 'The Cat Hep' is a bitter disappointment. We all have days off and this was clearly one of Clampett's!
