The Concorde ... Airport '79 begins in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) contacts reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to deliver secret documents proving that his boss Kevin Harriosn (Robert Wagner) The owner and president of Harrison Industries, who develops weapons for the military, illegally sold these weapons to foreign countries, but Maggie sees Carl murdered and she can barely escape with her life, Maggie must take the Concorde to Moscow via Paris the next morning. he intends to denounce Harrison, who is also his boyfriend, which would ruin him. He decided to crack down on his high-tech 'Buzzard' missile to intercept and destroy the Concorde during a test killing all who were aboard and destroying the documented evidence. . Renowned Airport '80 - The Concorde for its cinema and initial video releases, because it was released here in, well, 1980, instead of 1979 this the last entr ada at the Airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich & is a notoriously bad movie that was apparently ridiculed during press releases and tests, prompting Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that the Concorde ... The Airport '79 is a really silly and downright obscene movie, but on a purely entertainment basis I can think of movies much worse to spend 108 minutes watching, I really can. I quite enjoyed the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend TV reporter before she could expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy is not subtle and decides that the best way to do that is to blow up Concorde with his own guided missile and then picks up a Fench fighter pilot to try to knock him out before finally sabotaging him, so there are three mini-disaster films in one here as every time super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the day . You know Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in all four movies at the airport and goes from mechanic in the first to the extrodinaire Concorde pilot in this, I also think he is a bit of bad luck since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters. I think the real reason the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after that and bad luck was lifted. Some of the things that happen here are silly, Patroni makes barrel, flies upside down and off the maneuver is a guided missile in a huge Concorde not to mention he falls and fires rockets out of his window to destroy the missile all holding a calm head. This guy is good, very good. Then there's the character, there's a saxophone playing black guy who smokes marijuana in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. In addition, despite being almost killed with a missile and then attacked by a jet fighter, the passengers of the Concorde did not seem bothered and fortunately to come aboard the next day, I do not know about you, but then I would probably find a way more safe to travel and why the police or the authorities do not question anyone? Why does the captain of the Concorde, Patroni, only let out and sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... Airport '79 is certainly not boring and is full of memorable moments and I was entertained in a way, although it is far from a good movie and modern audiences may not have patience, heck I liked it was a stupid way, but it's not a kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Even though the Concorde does not fly it is still a very cool airplane and there are many scenes of it here, used in The Concorde ... The airport of 1979 was the seventh built. This Concorde was also the same aircraft that crashed after a tire broke and the fuel leak caught fire on July 25, 2000, while the takeoff in Paris unfortunately resulted in the deaths of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people in floor. When it aired on TV in the US in 1982, nearly twenty minutes of new footage were included, and most, if not all, were filmed recently two years after the original production was over. I know the effects here take a majority attack, but I do not think they are very bad, when you consider that this was done in the late 70's, I think they come across very well. The camera moves during effects taking, real images of real airplanes are used instead of toy models which, in my opinion, would seem much worse and I certainly could see what manufacturers were trying to do with limited resources and limited technology . In a weird way, they're really awesome without ever looking so good if you know what I mean. Probably the most action-packed of all the Airport movies there are missiles, exploding planes, daring landings, murders and a guy named Robert Palmer (no, not the singer) giving a woman a head in a jacuzzi. The IMDb says that this had a budget of about $ 14,000,000, which is actually more than I thought, maybe these special effects are not so impressive after all. Filmed in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. The acting is not great here, people do not seem worried enough to be about to die. Goerge Kennedy gets some fake opponents while Robert Wagner plays the villain. <br /> <br /> The Concorde ... The Airport '79 is fun for bad movie buffs everywhere and to be brutally honest, I'd rather watch that fun mess of a movie than two hours of an Oscar named Hole.
