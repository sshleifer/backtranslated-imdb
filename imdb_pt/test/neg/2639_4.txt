Typical story of an evil boy going after people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear in "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to emphasize this rubbish in his résumés (in fact, Schiavelli left this life with a very good resume). Sometimes I wish that the killers in those films simply look for the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every two months (note: this comment should not be taken seriously, I just think the slashers have lost touch) > <br /> Anyway, this is a movie you should avoid. It's ninety minutes to two hours that I will never come back.
