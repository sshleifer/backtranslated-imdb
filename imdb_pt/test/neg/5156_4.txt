This movie features cockroaches like meat slayers. This may have been the first film in which cockroaches were the top killers, although not the first movie in which cockroaches are killer. "Damnation Alley" featured a scene with killer cockroaches and "Creepshow" had a story that had them. In this they are the star. Not as good as it could have been this one does not have everyone who kills them. I could be wrong at that point, however, because I have not seen this in some time. The cockroaches were killer and this strange researcher is in town to study them. Yes, she's rather strange, for at one point she has her hand in a box on the killer cockroaches and she's like, "They're biting my hand," and she says it in almost a state of ecstasy. There is also a super super cheap near the end of this, as in so many insect films. Not a great movie, but worth checking out on a night you are bored out of your mind.
