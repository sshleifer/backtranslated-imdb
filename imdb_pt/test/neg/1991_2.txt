I have to ask myself, do films like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and criticizing it? How can something so terrible make it so loud? My parents went to see many of the adult-themed movies when we were kids, anything with an R until we were old enough. I only remember two movies that made them say yech! when they got home. This one, and "Catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film is made up of doctors and employees in a filthy hospital, incoherent narratives and a bunch of people from the city (who look like rejects from a 1970s). Sitcom Norman Lear) staging a protest. The worst part is the "murder mystery," an old crazy man doing "God's work" killing doctors and others. When he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only care about him coming out of there, where he will be "safe and happy". A doctor who falls dead from a heart attack is feigned as the man so he can flee. Oh, what a funny movie. <br /> <br /> This movie did not make me think, not a laugh or any other feeling besides "Must improve", but never does. People wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. YECH
