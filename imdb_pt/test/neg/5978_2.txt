This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie drags on and I almost hung up, but I took a chance. I did not expect anything cool, but I was expecting more than that. Good thing I work in a video store and saw this for free because I would not spend a penny on this movie. I gave this movie a 2, just because I've seen worse. If I were you, I would stay away from that, far away.
