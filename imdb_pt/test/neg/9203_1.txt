1) Bad performance. <br /> <br /> 2) For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) Terrible plot with stupid caricatures, making foolish decisions and happily losing precious equipment and survival clothes, left, right and center. 4) Cool monkey costumes of 70 (probably the only good thing about this movie) 5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this team must have watched Space 1999 a lot). Too bad it explodes so soon. The escape ship was also sunk very fast. * sigh * 6) Anthropologists may find some aspects of the film interesting in terms of primate group behavior.
