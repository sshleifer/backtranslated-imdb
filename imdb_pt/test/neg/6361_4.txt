Basically, the first two Critters films were already silly, but in a good and fun way. This movie is much more of a B movie, which is silly, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This is the first sequel that does not really follow the plot of the first two films. Basically, all the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, not good, since the bounty hunter in this movie appears too late) and the budget for this obviously went down again. To save even more, the film was filmed side by side with part 4, which I imagine will be so bad, since it directly follows this film and was made by the same people involved with this film. <Br/> <br /> It's just a typical B movie, which really has no originality or brings entertainment. It makes "Critters 3" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. Sure things could have been a lot worse for this movie, but it's also not exactly a good movie. The film is simply a science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also strange to note how the Critters suddenly changed in this. They are roughly twice their usual size this time, without giving an explanation for this and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than in the previous case. <br /> <br /> The film is only interesting because this was the premiere of Leonardo DiCaprio's film. He was about 17 years old in this movie and of course looked like baby face as he still does now. I like to see these actors known in their early roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio just got better, but he was kind of giving his lines in the same way he does today. <br /> <br /> 4 Really a very silly and lame movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
