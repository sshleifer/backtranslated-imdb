I saw this movie because Calexico made the score. A real disappointment. Trendy and annoying scenes with urban hipsters and their clich√© lifestyles. Mexican border stereotyped cheese culture (mystic grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter in his restaurant getup in mariachi style). A few laughs, but hippie-you-you, and lacking in vision and basic movie talent.
