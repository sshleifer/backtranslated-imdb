Bad plot, bad acting, bad direction. <br /> <br /> He had possibilities, but simply did not get anything. <br /> <br /> This movie seems like someone started with an idea, researched a little Google information and then tried to cut off an hour and a half with many night shots and bad suspense music. <br /> <br /> Others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way - I had to take a break purely because I just did not care anymore. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of an episode of Days of our Lives with a little more suspense. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
