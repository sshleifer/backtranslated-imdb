"Riders of Destiny" was the first of several westerns that Wayne did for Monogram Pictures 'Lone Star arm between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, producers try to turn Duke into a singing cowboy named "Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results. Any fan of Wayne knows that the duke could not have played a song if his life depended on it. His voice was apparently nicknamed by Smith Ballew, whose deep baritone does not sound like Wayne.Warne seems awkward and uncomfortable in "playing" the musical Thanks to God, the singer's cowboy experiment is soon over. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it contains a standard Western "B" plot of the water rights struggle between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local. , of course, plays the hero, he had not yet developed his character on the screen and still looked like a cowboy on the poverty line. <br /> <br /> Also released in the film George (pre-Gabby) Hayes. of heroin, Cecilia Parker c as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as "one of the boys" who performs his "falling racehorses under the wagon," doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would appear with Wayne in most other appearances in the series. Canutt, in particular, would have a profound effect on Wayne's future development, teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight, and look comfortable on a horse. <br /> <br /> As the "B" faroestes go, this is a 'no'. t very bad, however, I have to give a low rating because of the "singing".
