I love the book It's full of passion, romance, tension ... and the movie creeps taking two brave stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a big star in Australia, having performed at Neighbors and released her first single. The decision to put it in The Delinquents was certainly a marketing move. For me, it was not worth it. Kylie may have been great at Neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play the crazy Lola ... and she was not Asian descent as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was boring. He crawled, lacked the passion of the book, focused heavily on Kylie, and was generally quite disappointing.
