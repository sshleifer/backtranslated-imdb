My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a kid. We loved seeing them even when they were bad they did for some enjoyment. This was one of those films, a bit difficult to revise, as I've only seen it once as a child, but it's not something I want to track down again so I can do a more thorough analysis. The story has some old legend of the horror actor dying. I seem to remember that he acted a bit like a top Vincent Price without being nice and stylish. He commits murders and dies, but what is it? Is the movie over? No, as some children, for some reason, arrest the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham beyond the grave. I remember that the murders were nothing special after the first couple and I remember that this movie was quite disappointing. He seemed to have a good premise, but he simply could not deliver the goods, as more legal deaths were needed and the super-terrorist needed to add some to his repertoire.
