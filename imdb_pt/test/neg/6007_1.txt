overestimated, poorly written, acted badly. Did the gym even watch it? I think not. the political content guaranteed an Oscar nomination - Indo-pop frontier - a little boy, terrorism. anything with the word "terrorist" draws attention to this post 9-11 world. It's like holocaust movies that guarantee an Oscar nomination, regardless of their merits. <br /> <br /> And, please, cinematography does not mean photographing landscapes that are beautiful in the first place. you have to be a rotten shooter to ruin making the desert beautiful. at least that did not win the Oscar. they got it right. would have been a farce.
