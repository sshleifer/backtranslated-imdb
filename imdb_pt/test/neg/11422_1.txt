I can not believe this movie is getting the rating that is here on IMDb. Of course, I've come to the conclusion that IMDb is somewhat useless to find out if a movie is good or not, since 99% of movies are rated 6 to 7. It's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. For this purpose, an average is taken from most people and unfortunately, most people are simple-minded easily entertained idiots fast food lifestyle. But I digress. The film. I really do not want to waste my time writing about it. Let's say I thought it was tailor made for seemingly two groups of people, young teenagers, at the age when violent action films of any kind get to the point, and gothic types who love to stifle any gothic vampire fantasy that they can lay their hands on . If you are not in one of these categories, you will find this movie absurd. I liked the first underworld. It was cool at the time and had a kind of nervous quality. The second one was a little trying on the plot, but I liked the direction and the cinematography sometimes. But this whole movie looked like a production of a science fiction channel or even a TV series. I found the actors to be over-directed. His body language hardened into unnatural idealistic postures that seemed planned. Lines were spat as young actors spat Shakespeare's lines, revealing his own selfish glory for being in such a role, but in doing so, roughly hitting the paper. The plot was dry and predictable from the start. I found myself wishing things would just "move on," because it was so easy to say what would happen. I tried to care at first, but my brain was forced to shut down. At the end of the climax, I really caught myself falling asleep. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and it makes no sense that it's not even worth listing them all. Whether you are a teenage faced spine or a chronic goth, you definitely have to. For the rest of us, forget it, as I'm about to do now.
