If you liked the movie Grinch ... go watch this again because this was not as good as a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to "spruce" the screen in recent times. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a horrible sound, which is the only laugh I heard in the theater. Not even the children liked these people, and the children laugh at everything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you are really looking for a fun family holiday movie.
