- Contains 1 spoiler, market with: ***** - <br /> <br /> Not presenting as another remake of "The Interview", Five Fingers is actually. Unfortunately, beyond the difficulties of physical torture, this never adds anything to the predecessor's achievement in terms of suspense, plot or performances. In fact, Five Fingers never comes close to their level. <br /> <br /> What I found particularly painful to watch was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) represented his ordeal. For me, it seemed that Philippe was trying to get his accent too high, and that made his performance visibly amateurish, which in turn even disrupted the performance of a great Colme Meaney. Phillipe's accent, being far from anything near the Dutch, looked more like Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> In addition to the performance of Philippi (which, to my surprise, went from poor to really decent to the end), there is the issue of flashbacks with the banal Dutch scenario. (If these scenes were set in Switzerland, they would have made the cast eating cheese on top of the mountains with endless pastures, with cows grazing wearing expensive watches). Scenario aside, The way these flashbacks pushed the plot did not work for me. It did get served as chips on a drive-in and caused the buildup of suspense to flatline. <br /> <br /> Admittedly the film became more enjoyable as Phillipe is acting better, but I could not help being annoyed from time to time with scenes that were simply implausible. <br /> <br /> ************ Start spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days) Philippe is almost tenderly washed by the female terrorist. This should only be followed by brutal cutting of another finger. Why wash the face if he is suffering torture? And the cut of the last finger seemed to serve only for the title of that film, that is, he was practically begging for it to be cut. Did not that make sense? <br /> <br /> ************ End of the spoiler <br /> <br /> What ended up keeping me watching was the performance of Fishburn who once again proved to be an actor brilliant, but that also had the best part of the script to work on. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is much better to see "The Interview" with that other icon of the Matrix: Hugo Weaving. And when you do, I'm confident that you will not find such an appraisal unpleasant. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
