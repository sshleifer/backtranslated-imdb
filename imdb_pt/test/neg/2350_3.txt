First of all, let me clarify. This movie is a real piece of crap, but despite being a real piece of crap, it's a better crap than it could have been. It could have been a great success, but no ... What this film did not have was, for example, scary moments, good acting and a good script. It was not much fun either. But the movie had cool music, extravagant locations and hot girls. Also works great as a spoof Dracula. (I hope it was done that way, though I do not really think so) <br /> <br /> The story centers on three girls in Transylvania waking up an old vampire who then terrorizes and kills the girls one by one . . Sound familiar? Yes, it does! <br /> <br /> After reading this, you may think that I should have voted better. The reason I do not do it is because I almost felt asleep at some points ...
