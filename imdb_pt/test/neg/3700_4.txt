"Haaaarrrryyy!" The amplified and dispassionate female voice might have been Leona Helmseley in the heat, but no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, the 50-foot woman of the title. In the most infamous role of her film career, Allison's performance literally comes off the roof. In fact, do this with some roofs. Breathtaking, "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, a neurotic and alcoholic heiress and her loveless husband Lothario, Harry (William Hudson, who also co-starred alongside The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter of the third type in the desert with a bald giant in space wearing a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals, and who likes Nancy's jewelery. What he does to her once he has carried her is probably best left a mystery, but soon Nancy begins to grow. Stepping into the center of the city in tranquilizers, firmly curled into nothing but the bed sheets, the gigantic giant heads toward the low rent lounge, where Harry is laughing with a prostitute named Honey (Yvette Vickers ). The confrontation becomes ugly. <br /> <br /> Poverty Row f / x makes the alien giant and Nancy look transparent due to incompetently transposed images. You'll understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz in the credits. Juran was no stranger to directing giant human and nonhuman creatures, as well as directing "The Deadly Mantis," "Sinbad's Seventh Voyage," "Jack the Giant Killer," and several episodes of "World of Giants" and " Land ". of the Giants. "<br /> <br /> Lots of laughter for all the wrong reasons.
