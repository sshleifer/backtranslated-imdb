Special effects like cartoons, horrible acting and dialogue, and dry storyline! This movie has it all! My friend and I went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but that was awesome. The film begins with a woman and her son on vacation on an island invented in the Bahama region. Women, who happen to be doctors / virologists, are in the area when a man collapses. He has a strange wound on his arm and she immediately knows it is a contagious virus. The story continues to show a surprisingly fast romance between the two teenagers (this is justified by the girl saying "I know it's fast, but it's cool".) Anyway, the whole island gets infected with this virus and the CDC is brought in. We are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and contained, it will spread to the United States and will kill millions of people. This information does not prevent the CDC from leaving the island to save itself. Luckily the cure for this horrible virus is found in time, and the whole island is saved. To celebrate the death of their loved ones, the people of the island have an incredible party where everyone is dancing, having fun and forgetting the horrible epidemic that has just occurred.
