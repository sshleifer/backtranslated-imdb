The writing and direction of Duncan Roy are real and regularly below the level. In fact, it kind of stinks. AKA is almost as bad as his recent (horrible, self-serving) remake of Dorian Gray - absurd and twisted dialogue between the characters of the 'upper class', at the same time stupid and pretentious, amateur, stilted to its core. Characterization and script - and sometimes acting - is chia like a school play ... but worse, there is a kind of self-assured peacock on the direction that is just the soul destroying when the director clearly did not understand ... he it's just nothing good. Diana Quick must be shrinking with embarrassment. DR you should get out of the movie ... seriously.
