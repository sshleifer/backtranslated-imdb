While killing time on a Saturday morning, "Looking For Lola" came on HBO. I decided to give it a try even though the description of the movie seemed very bad. It was even worse than I imagined. The film was incredibly unbelievable and there was absolutely no chemistry on the screen among the main actors that I saw myself shaking my head almost every 10 minutes. Between Mike Greenbaum (lead actor) in scenes where he skips the bill in a fancy restaurant and where Lola (lead actress) lets him use his boss's house to fool his parents and think he's rich, it was almost as bad how much he "daydreaming" about the people around him making the macarena (it was HORRIBLE!) and the two actors finally falling in love. I kept wanting to change the channel, but I was trying to give every chance to become a cute love story with a few laughs. This never happened. In fact, it got so bad that I decided to end it just to be able to claim that I watched one of the worst films ever made in its entirety, instead of being criticized for not "giving a fair shot." The last scene in which Lola experiences a dance piece was the culmination of the film. She arrives late after marrying (even the scene where Mike orders the priest to hurry up and then takes the papers off saying that this was done in tune with the film's credibility), and then somehow "convinces" the judges to give a look at her. The two male judges are already unhappy with how late she is. But after seeing her pass the stage (ok, she dances well, but not very impressive), everyone joins, including Lola and Mike's families, other dancers who were there, and * cough * even the judges. Bad, horrible, terrible. It was so bad I had to write a review. Watch at your own risk.
