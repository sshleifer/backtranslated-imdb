I literally ran to watch him, waiting for a movie that would make me cry, or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not heart-wrenching, but a lame exploration of a strong human character. <br /> Intertwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In an environment that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention the performance of the most common. <br /> <br /> It was not all bad, as I saw it worse - and I left the $ 10 movie poorer but wiser - that a well advertised movie is not the same as a well made movie.
