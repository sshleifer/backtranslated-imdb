Banal and not original. It is as if someone had seen Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them up and, in the process, steal other parts of other movies to make another. As with most historical movies nowadays, there are some inaccuracies as the story is manipulated to better suit the story, which is understandable for the most part. For example, during the remaining days of Beethoven's life, it was necessary for others to write down what they needed to say so that he would understand them. That, of course, would have been a bother having to show on the screen. The script, though filled with a few quotable lines, does not capture well the feel of that period of time, and along with some bad interpretations it seems quite contemporary. Diane Kruger is good enough to look, but she still has a lot to improve on her craft. Ed Harris does not work for me like Beethoven and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for it. Overall, it is not a good interpretation of the musical master's life. You'd better find a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
