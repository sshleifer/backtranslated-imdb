Try as she might, she just could not get into that. Perhaps the tones were washed; maybe it was the protracted approach - I'm not really sure, but although this was not a "bad" movie, I did not really think it was an "effective" movie (words I understand that are much more arbitrary than their uses common). <br /> <br /> So basically the deal here is that a series of teenage deaths triggers an investigation and anxiety in a small town in the province, triggering a witch hunt. What does the death of the boys have to do with the mysterious sexy woman who appeared in the city? Is the crazy hermit woman involved? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of police drama and terror, as the various people in the city are suspicious and the corpses continue to appear while the violence continues. <br /> <br /> Good enough, but for me, most fell a little. Oh, he had his moments ... the only boy who entered a beautiful naked seducer was very good, and the scene in which the parents beat the hermit was a bitter comment (even though the effects failed, considering that his skin seemed to peel as if they were whipping her with incandescent irons). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the end. I've already put spoiler tags in this review, but BE WORRIED, HERE'S THE GREAT SPOILER: I do not believe it. I do not believe a priest could convince himself to kill boys for becoming sexually conscious without some indication that psychosis appeared earlier, with other boys, with a story or some other personal affection. The movie did not really win its end. END SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> However, Fulci is a big name and I am more than certain that there is an audience out there. I definitely need to check out more than it did, because this may have been a bad introduction. Most Italian giallo's either, so I'm hoping to see what else this guy can do before writing it. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
