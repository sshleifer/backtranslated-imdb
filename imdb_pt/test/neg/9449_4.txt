I watched this because of the description and art of the cover and once again was fooled. I'm getting sick of all these new stupid direct to horror movies on DVD. Once in a blue moon 1 will be fine. It started with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm which was OK because I like storms and set a good mood.Then it turned into a cool trip where they ended up in a dinner meeting bizarre people. The rest got weird and then it got messy. I watched it until the end, but it was even more confusing when it ended so badly. I had high hopes for this movie but it was more like a science fiction in followed by horror and something that should have been done for the TV.
