Basically a road movie. Gay, transgender and other gender issues are quite disturbing, especially when the child is involved. You have to hand it to costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I knew was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance, out of the normal reach of him (or anyone). The film as a whole was superficial, just a vehicle for intelligent play and bitch. All in all, I would not recommend this.
