This movie was definitely on the boring side. The acting was decent and the film looks really cool, the soundtrack is definitely for the fans of Kenny G and Michael Bolton. Speaking of the soundtrack, I found it very ironic that a movie about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in their titles that was a WHITE RIPOFF of "You can call me Paul Simon's" - except they did not recognize you, it in everything. Is not there something a little hypocritical there? The scene that the main boy was where he was imitating a game show host was my favorite. 10 lines? Do I have to write ten lines about this movie to be included? What a ripoff, I do not think it's just too much to force people to write more than just to include it!
