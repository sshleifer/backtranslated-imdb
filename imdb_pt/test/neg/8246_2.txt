This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly ... whoah! You are a genius and a nasty one and the world is kissing the ground that you are walking. <br /> <br /> And surprisingly, all the other smart people are losers. They know nothing and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult, but still these teachers can analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Every movie has something good anyway and Robin Williams is in it.
