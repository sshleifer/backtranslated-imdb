After the wife of a plastic surgeon dies, he picks up his hunchback assistant to help him bring her back to life with various parts of other nubile young girls. This movie wants to be a Hersel type Gordon Lewis, but fails miserably. The acting is beyond bad, the gore atrocious effects (no, not in the right way), the plot almost non existent and not fun to have. Skip this. Do you want to know how incompetent you are? At one point you can actually see a movie movie board, obviously. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Candy Furr gets topless and again in a flashback <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary with Jeffrey Hogue and Cynthia Soroka, A second "How to make a doll" feature; Alternate Title Sequence with Hershel Gordon Lewis intro; 2 short films ("Mission of the Perfect Woman" and "Hospital Man√≠aco"); Cover the art gallery with Dead Elvi's music; Trailers for "Dr. Black Mr. Hyde", "Boots and the Preacher"; "The Doctor and the Playgirls", "the horrible Twosome"; "Mage of Gore"; "Awful Dr Orlof"; "Mad World of Doctor Morgus"; "Proffessor Lust", "Monstrosity"; "Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico"; and "I, Marquis DeSade" <br /> <br /> Easter Eggs: Theatrical Trailer; a scene from "Just for the Hell of It"; and a trailer for "Ax"
