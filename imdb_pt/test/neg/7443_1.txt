RoboCop's violent sequel was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Never Again, The Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original, because it's almost humorless, and it's extremely bad, and should have been rated NC-17 , because of scenes with children being involved in shootings, people brutally threatening to murder very young children with REAL automatic weapons, and even scenes with a 12-year-old child using lots of swear words, giving drugs to many random people, photographing and shooting graphically to top. and killing police officers and SWAT officers, firing on police officers when several small children are present, and a whole group of children using swearing and beating the shop owner (who is a very old man) from an electronics store and stealing and destroying many items there. This film gives a new meaning to the term "astonishingly average," but the effects and sequences of action are exceptionally incredible. Overall, an OK movie.
