There are certain scenes in this film (such as the hero's first encounter with super villain Shirley Eaton) where he seems to be on the verge of breaking down sex taboos and making his premise (females want to dominate the world by making slaves) justice but never dares . The result is a film without sexuality and some domestic violence. Despite the unstable plot, the film is not too bad until its climax, where his amateurism is rampant (terrible editing, excessive use of stock images). Worth seeing just as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
