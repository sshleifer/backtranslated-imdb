I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 years old when I saw it. It's the only movie I ever left the theater. My mom, dad and I looked at each other during the movie and we knew we were wasting our time. This movie stole about 45 minutes of my life. Everything was ridiculous. The whole premise was very distorted. Being 9, I have always been entertained easily. This movie proved that I could not subject myself to anything and still be entertained.
