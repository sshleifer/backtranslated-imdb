*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW *** What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why do not I care about them? If I'm going to watch a movie for two hours, I'd like to worry about someone or something. <br /> <br /> We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches found in the new world. In addition, however, we learn little about most hopes, fears, etc. of their family, when they embarked on an adventure in the unknown. <br /> <br /> And why was Lucy really in that movie? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (she was forced to serve men in return for permission to board the ship?) or what her plans were when she arrived in New York. For those who might suggest that it was necessary to underscore the fact that a single woman, however cultured, could not enter this country alone, I say that this fact is not enough justification to give her so much time on the screen. That point could have been made in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary character. <br /> More questions: Why did the twin brother on the boat not know the family? We heard about the brother, and some closure at that point would have been helpful in giving the film some cohesion. Besides, how long did the trip from Italy to New York last? Given the conditions of the ship, it makes a difference for the viewer if the trip lasts five, ten or fifty days. (Someone said something about seeing the earth a "week" at one point, but I guess that was when they were already in the way.) I needed those kinds of details to better appreciate what they were going through. <br /> <br /> The only scene I really enjoyed was when the boat, full of passengers, left the dock. <br /> <br /> If you choose to rent this movie, do so with the remote control in hand; you may want the Fast Forward button by hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can suggest that, in the right voice, provide useful information about times and circumstances for immigrants - particularly during the slow stretches of endless pictures of the countryside, people walking, etc. - this movie may have made an interesting public documentary on TV.
