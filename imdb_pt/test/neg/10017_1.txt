The New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television set, which almost ruins David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. Room comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom (and nothing sexy happens there anyway). Gaynor as an actress has as much scope as an oven - she turns it off. The only compensation of the film is a supporting performance of the lively Patty Duke, pre-"Miracle Worker" as the daughter of Niven. She is delicious; "Happy Birthday" is not. * in ****
