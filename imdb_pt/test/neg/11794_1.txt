I watched this movie with some friends and they said I had to see it, but from the beginning I knew it was going from bad to worse. So I can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought that anyone could see that there were no "real" ghosts. I feel that the worst part was this so-called "haunted old house" contained a lot of new items and some "conveniently placed items" I could have thought of effects that would have looked much better than a chair being overturned by an invisible ghost I must say thread). Then later, when they review the ribbon on the chair, she turns around in a different way. Oh, that's a big mistake of continuity. If this was a really good movie then they would have picked it up and all the other items from the "old house". This movie is like a house steal on a haunted hill and Blair's witch project, all in a poorly thought out and assembled film. I would be embarrassed to put something bad with cheap acting, effects and videos from the girls chest and how the camera drops when something "paranormal" happens. This movie is an insult to people who are actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost images on tape.
