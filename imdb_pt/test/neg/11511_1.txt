I do not think this whole show is funny. I really think it's a lot worse than any of the other terrible Disney sit-coms channels right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can not act. The jokes about this show are terribly bland, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member who has a little (and I mean little) acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother, Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo play Sadie's friends. There both actors really stupid and just terrible. Two words that can really describe this show is terribly tacky. It's funny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not yet developed. Now I have explained my hatred for acting and horrible humor, what comes next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. Has she changed again (not so scientific and ben-loving) and suddenly no one recognizes her? It's stupid. In short, I hate this show, however little girls who do not have a funny concept will like it, so I guess that's what they're looking for more quality. Although I may say as much, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: JUST DOES NOT ASSIST ANY OF THEM. <br /> <br /> My rating: Awful exposure. TV G. 30 min.
