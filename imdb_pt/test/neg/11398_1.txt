In fact, I'm still in doubt if there is anything about this movie that I like. As for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. The acting was very bad in my opinion. Antonie Kamerling is not very likely to receive the status of Rutger Hauer. Some people will wait anyway. First let him work on your English pronunciation. If you watch the 'trip' to Paris of these actors (DVD-extra), you'll probably want to rock. Advice to Beau Dorens: stop your acting career, you will never get there ... For the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please. Being generous, I would give 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
