What is it nowadays that minority comedians feel good about slandering their minority and hoping to escape unpunished? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When watching comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to standardize his show as the "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" version of Dave Chappelle's show. What a horrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please do not make a Block Party movie.) As much as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Aguilar, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the cast of "Xica da Silva" at one stage, no.) Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as Dave Chappelle liked to use the word "n". It's neither funny nor acceptable, even if it's "your own people." Carols Mencia also likes to say, "If you're offended, too bad." It is not the offense, it is the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carols Mencia goes beyond - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes to be comedy. It's not comedy, it's not funny. There is a subtlety of being able to look at yourself and make others laugh at comedy and not laugh at reinforcing the stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The Mind of Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what's funny and not what's going to put more biases in motion and then - do it. Until then, the show, Mente de Mencia is a pass.
