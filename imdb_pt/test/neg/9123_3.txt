I really do not think producer George Lucas really did get ready to make such a horrible sequence as "More American Graffiti" turned out to be. But in retrospect, it was the first flaw in his seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming straight from the hugely successful "American Graffiti" and produced at the same time as "Star Wars," this film was the first that Lucas successfully took off from Coppola without having to worry about driving alone. The result is the typical Lucas - much more interesting in terms of structure and form of editing than the actual material. Writer / director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different proportions of screen and split screens to produce strange associations in the images. While it is interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the four lines of the story, the style only sums up the fractured nature of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Lucas's brilliant original film was about a group of friends about the archetype. last big night "before the end of school and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) should go to college. One thing that made the movie work, despite the fact that it is very episodic, is that you had the central characters together at the beginning and they came back together at the end.There is a time layout, as in Nick Rebellion without cause, where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time in life "More American Graffiti" is basically the opposite - the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his ex-girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) celebrating with hippies in San Francisco , Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) dragging races on the semi-professional circuit. In a planned meeting at the beginning of the film, all principles are gathered to watch theJohn, but after that the threads do not come together and undo as they do in the original. Instead, they broke up and followed the characters in about 3 years, just seeing various New Year events in what appears to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to get confused, and I think it's fair to say that we do. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passage into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who have never experienced these events, this sequel drags and stretches the few epitome plot points of the original and tries to transform them in a coherent film. The best parts of the movie for me are Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes are weak, but the style of these sections is interesting and they form a perfect contrast to each other. the others. A good movie could have been made if those parts were a bit better, and if the other parts were not so difficult. Speaking of rip-off races, the whole plot with Milner talking to an exchange student was really lame, bland, and playing Mackenzie Phillips for a special turnout did not help at all. It was just another invented moment, as when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the movie because he is already in Canada. Instead, Laurie has another brother who is basically identical to Curt, but has a different name and is now played by a very annoying actor. There is a sort of black satire to some of the things in Vietnam, much like what I would have imagined the original idea of ​​"John and Apocalypse Now" by Lucas and John Milius would have been. And there's a part of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still together with this fun thing, you have the rest of the movie dragging you down, as if someone wants to see Steve and Laurie arguing in their horrible suburban home like they're auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child neglect. I think even if those parts of the film were not so painful, it still would not really be comparable to the first film because there is no closure and no feeling of coming back together or anyone having learned anything. It's just a kind of ending where you run out of money or something, a cheap imitation of the "Two-Lane Blacktop" freeze and so many better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original, however, this movie has a great soundtrack to vintage hits that are probably worth owning and almost makes the film palatable. The performances by Country Joe and Fish are great, and Scott Glenn all excited as a hippie in love with Candy Clark is a sight to see - I wonder if even then he had to wear a wig? I could not recommend this movie, and still have a little affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every two decades, I think I have to give this movie a chance just to make sure it's as useless as I remember. He's a party killer, but it's something every American Graffiti fan or George Lucas usually wants to see at least once or twice. This shows how much effort can be made on something and can still be half cooked. It makes you ponder how miraculous it is that Luke actually made a movie as good as "American Graffiti" first, as if all the elements were in place and all the proper gods had been placated. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this movie or for Bill Norton.
