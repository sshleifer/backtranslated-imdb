From the terrible special effects on, I was absolutely shocked at how bad anyone can make a movie. Let's put it this way, I have absolutely no experience of driving and for the first time while watching a movie I thought 'I can do better than that! while sitting watching this pap. The acting in that movie was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from the Lawnmower Man, but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the old job in the first place. The plot was mediocre and I suppose, like most movies, if the rest had been done well, he would have gotten up. I do not usually write reviews here, but after seeing some people gave this movie a good rating (it should be cast / crew) I felt I had to tell my piece to save someone accidentally hire him or lose their money in buying this Cack
