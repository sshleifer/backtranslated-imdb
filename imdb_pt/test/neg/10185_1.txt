My mother and I rented this movie. I mean, we love that kind of science fiction movie, whether it's big Hollywood movies or Indy movies. <br /> <br /> But, oh, we've been fooled !! Two journalists are investigating a UFO abduction in a small town in Texas. In the middle of the way, all the sudden things become crystals for us. My mother and I believed in God and in Jesus and the Devil, but the way this movie was preaching this, made it annoying. All I have to say is that we are Christians, but we even enjoy ourselves. So do not blame Christians as a whole, just blame the Christians who need to suck the fun of this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can clearly understand the directors' position on UFOs, and this is what he believes is all demonic. Now, I could say a few words, but I will not. All I'm going to say is DO NOT WATCH this movie unless you feel like being nailed. In fact, it often states that we should be perfect to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked, the one perfect person died on a cross.
