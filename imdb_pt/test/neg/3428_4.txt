The story of Goodbye to the King is intriguing. An American "deserter" (I had the impression that he and his 3 comrades were just trying to escape the capture in the Philippines, since their desperate escape by raft to Borneo is not their classic desertion). But as soon as they reach the ground when they are discovered by the Japanese. The character of Nolte (a sergeant) has only recently come down the beach alone and was not noticed. And incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand that would have taken the Japanese directly to him. But anyway, Nolte is taken by a tribe of headhunters and becomes his king after defeating another member of the tribe. So he's out of the war. Then the British commandos appear and want the tribe to aid them in the fight against the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant hamming spoils an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier pushed back into the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, Nolte acts as if he were raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English is almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. He makes sweeping gestures when he speaks, and acts as if he were one with nature, as if he had been raised in the jungle. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and lots of interesting scenes with the British interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But Nolte's character is never believable. It always seems like he's overreacting. He needed to be a bit more of an American soldier, much less a member of the tribe. As it is, he comes across, not as a royal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. But this is not the intention of the film, as the script makes him admired and trusted by the British commandos. There is never any suggestion that the British think their behavior was strange. He is simply seen by the British as the leader of the tribe. So it always seems that Nolte's character does not fit what should be happening in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another actor could have done a great job with the role, delivered his lines credibly and done. It's an excellent movie. But Nolte spoils the film by covering all the scenes and seeming to not understand what his character should be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
