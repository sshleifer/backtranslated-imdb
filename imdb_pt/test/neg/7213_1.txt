This film is a pile of crap, and to try to base the first is just a farce, the main thing that disappointed me was the use of a liner out of the first, which once said by classical actors how like Sam Elliot can not be reproduced not at all, I mean, when Dalton's phones arrive on Day 1, and he ends the call with cool, that was great, but when the idiot calls the DEA agent at home and he terminates the call with legal he does not has the same ring now really does it, there are others, but I can not be bothered to post on top, but I hope you get my drift, they should be named this wannabe roadhouse ....... ...
