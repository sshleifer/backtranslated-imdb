For football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame acting, lame script, lame football and no direction! I rented this movie during my time in Asia and was shocked that this was considered one of the best films in Singapore. It was just plain nonsense and completely boring. There are thousands of rich and exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about the top Singaporean and stereotyped?
