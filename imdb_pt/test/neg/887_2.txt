In all honesty, I have not seen this movie for many years, but the few times I have tend to be part of it to stay in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. I first saw her as a kid at an ACM Halloween party in the early 1960s, and it scared our kids in a fun way. I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the labyrinth. I can not risk giving the ending, except to say it was surprising, to say the least. I vaguely remember the whole audience of boys giving off a great cry of fear, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending was seen by most viewers as one of the most unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet strangely poignant in a way. You have to see for yourself, which is not easy these days. I do not know if it is available in home video or not but it would still be a great Halloween resource for kids and adults alike.
