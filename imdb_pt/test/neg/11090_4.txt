Julie Delpy stars in this horrible movie about a sadistic relationship between father and daughter in 14th century France. The film attempts to break the image of romantic chivalry of the heroic medieval knight, showing a rather somber image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years' War, told by his father to keep his mother safe and await his return. François comes into action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. Francois the assassin in the name of defending the honor of his father. As father as son, François grows and leaves his family, also to go to the same war. This scenario is a kind of explanation for the events that are to come, since on the way home we already noticed that something is wrong with François. The war did not do well with him, he changed. <br /> <br /> The daughter, Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy), awaits her beloved father, to return from the captivity of the English. She is pure of heart and she was left to look after the property while her father was away. In the absence of her father, Béatrice must deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens Béatrice's hope that her father returns to save her. But when she returns, she realizes that she has lost the will to enjoy life, and she tortures and humiliates everything around her, even her own daughter. From this point, the film describes several ways how François torments his family. Beginning with humiliating his own son, and ending with the rape of his own daughter, Beatrice. Set the film in the Middle Ages supposedly to soften the blow, as the viewer can tell himself, that these kinds of violent acts were performed in difficult times. And in fact, many films about the incest theme, such as Tim Roth's War Zone (1999), which are contemporary, were more shocking because of it. <br /> <br /> Delpy appears in this movie in several daring nudes. scenes. In fact, she seems to be angelic and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed when I saw some scenes of animal torture. I believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for the making of this film, which really bothers me. The quality of a film falls when real violence is used for animals. I hope this movie is re-released without these scenes of cruelty. These scenes do not contribute much to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very long. The script is problematic. We did not get to see Francois and Beatrice before the war, we did not really understand the answer why he changed to such an extreme. I would have to pass this movie, however, I have to mention a few scenes that made this movie worth watching: <br /> <br /> * Scenes of a child being able to kill in cold blood is really shocking. I first saw it in "City of God (2002)". Here, François, murders his mother's mistress while his father is at war. Great scene and very graphic. * The scenes of Béatrice being raped by her father until she discovers that she is pregnant with him are truly shocking and interesting. The scene after the rape, where Delpy burns her rags and cleans herself. She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach hoping to have a miscarriage. <br /> <br /> * Brother humbles scenes where the father throws his son's head at the food - humiliating him, then talking about the war. Later, dressing her child with feminine cloths. <br /> <br /> The film won the César (French Oscar for Best Costume), I agree, the clothes here really make the film look authentic for the time period. The site of the film is Château de Puivert, a true 12th-century castle and a historical monument, located in Aude, south-central France. Beautiful castle and mountain views, really helps you set in the period of this movie. The film was also nominated for three more César awards, but they were all snatched up for the successful French film "Au revoir, les enfants" (Goodbye, Children, 1998). <br /> Released as "Beatrice" in New York, March 1987. Only to be shown in France in November 2007. I watched on YES3 on May 3, 2007 at 5:45 pm, at work.
