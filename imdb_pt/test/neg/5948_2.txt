In fact, everyone responsible for this obstacle must be whipped, dragged and hanged! If this is how the great drama of Eugene O'Niell is as if I never wanted to be the victim of seeing him again. Are there so many WRONG things with this feature where it starts? First, Elmer Bernstein's bombastic score is present throughout the film, even in the silent scenes where background music is subtracted from the character's motives. Second, these characters are NOT nice people, and although some critics might like it, I personally did not like all the scenes in which Ives devoured the scene, but that was how his characters were written: to be hated. W / Loren it's never clear whether she's good or bad? and all her babbling about how she's going to turn things around the way they were before the baby arrived? well, I saw what was coming in clearly. Perkins is miscast and then he plays the role as a warm-up for Norman Bates (which he played two years later), even wanting to take the blame for the murder in the end. Hokey! Third, this film is a studio stage production and suffers because of it. History would have benefited from filming to develop a sense of "place" in relation to the farm (where all the top leaders are fighting). As it is shot, there is no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio stage feel that is not convincing. This is a really horrible movie.
