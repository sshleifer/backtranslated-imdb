As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people should die for a "better world." I said 'better world' because it is a lie that the Chinese people have been indoctrinated a thousand years ago! <br /> <br /> I think most Western viewers may not meet Qin Shihuang (the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant of ancient China. The Tianxia (Chinese word spoken by the king, meaning "the land and the people") spoken of his mouth is totally false. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient China said the same thing, but very few did what they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that the Qin Shihuang empire lasted only about twenty years earlier. was destroyed by people. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
