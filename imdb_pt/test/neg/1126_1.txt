Okay ... that may contain spoilers ... but who really cares? No, if you value the seconds of your life, waste your time on that pile of garbage. There is not a redeeming quality in this movie ... and I say this as a complete fan of the holiday movie series. I loved the character Primo Eddie from the other holiday movies ... but he only works well as a supporting character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think he's a great actor ... but this movie has no cohesion ... the pace is wrong ... it's just plain bland. And the actor who plays the "third" ... Jake Thomas ... was horrible, more than likely due to a real lack of direction. I do not know why ... but your whole character scared me. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this is a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not in it ... it has nothing to do with it. The script, direction, acting ... special effects ... everything is a train accident. With orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train ran over some old people too. <br /> <br /> Please, whatever you do ... stay away from this filth! I call it dirt because it smells the name of the Holiday Franchise.
