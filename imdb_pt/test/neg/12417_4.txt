"Wild Rebels" was probably a second entertaining movie on an album in the triple movie 40 years ago. It has not aged very well, but was never meant to age well; Obviously, it was intended to be a disposable and forgettable fun from the start. At this level, it is a good example of the biker film genre. <br /> <br /> Several elements help distinguish it from dozens of similar films being produced at the same time. The 'hero', 'Steve Alaimo' seems like an unimpressive 'Everyman' - he's not particularly brave, tough, talented or handsome (though he wins a fight with a difficult member of a biker gang to the middle the movie, and the girl gang member chooses to help you about your gang mate at the end of the movie). The soundtrack is very well done, with a good bass / drums 'Ventures' style riff that keeps things moving and saxophones and metal graphics that liven things up a bit. And although the script is very superficial, all actors inhabit their characters in cardboard convincingly and with a good amount of energy. <br /> <br /> There are many sloppy technical gafes: terrible day-to-night scenes that take place in broad daylight, squealing tires in a swamp, fire sirens mistakenly trapped on the soundtrack instead of sirens police, a bench sign made of duct tape on a ceiling, a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06, explosions of shotgun people 100 yards away, a detective killing a biker on the third floor landing from the ground with a revolver with a 2-inch barrel. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of goofy story elements: Linda (the gang member girl) deactivates a bank guard with a syringe full of drugs, the final shootout happens inside a lighthouse (!), locks cops do not actually block roads, police have apparently never heard of dodging and police detectives have apparently never heard of planting insects or having their subject disguised as wea <br /> <br /> But the plot continues, the cameraman knows what is doing, the pace in most scenes is very good, and there are some linings and dialogue exchanges here and there. which maintains the high energy level. (So, no, do not look for this or anything, but if a copy of the MST version falls into your hands, you should have a very good, shallow one.) (My favorite: "Dude, you're messing with private stock! and fun, far superior to "Five the Hard Way," "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three other films covered by the MST).
