POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not terribly objective criticism, but I ended up finding this movie horribly depressing. Like much work by Russell T. Davies, he asks more questions than he can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) reveals hope and perseverance even after apparent defeat. These edifying themes seemed strangely absent here. I suppose the fact that I'm still thinking about it days after seeing is proof of the quality of the program, but the resolution was simply too bleak for my liking. <br /> <br /> I would, however, disagree with the comments I have read, complaining that the end seems "nailed". I think every conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a solid personal belief that solved the main theme of the program well. Although I never really questioned the progression of the events, I felt that there was a lot that could have been expanded. I also read that it was originally designed as a four part series instead of two, and it is possible that the truncation caused some damage to the finished piece. However, these flaws appear everywhere, in sequences and themes that sometimes seem rude or outlined. <br /> <br /> To his credit, Davies is not afraid to write too much, and you have to admire the daring and scope project. Is the premise he addresses here the stuff of movies or novels? it's a brave and ambitious thing to face him in the middle of the television. Strengths include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively hypnotic in leading. For me, it was and remains the best reason to watch. The representation of the humanity of the Messiah was bright, thought-provoking and engaging, and a veritable claim both to Davies's writing and to Eccleston's performance. I also thought that the representation of the reaction of the modern world to the second coming seemed true. <br /> <br /> So, two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be fun. I would rather be raised or at least distracted by my fiction. Do I have a real big world around me? filtered by CNN or the newspapers - if I choose to be terribly depressed. There are definitely fewer subjective reasons why to judge this text, but I fear that my judgment on this subject will be obscured by my emotional reaction.
