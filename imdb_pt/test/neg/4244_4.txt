Throughout the 1950s and 60s, 70s and even in the 1980s, a series of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of "partisans"? civilians who ended up fighting a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally known only in Eastern Europe, has addressed several of these "partisan" histories; unfortunately, only a handful of them have been exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. "Battle of the Eagles" is a rare and low-budget look at the formation and exploration of the Partisan Air Force. Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to fight the German Luftwaffe in the skies of Yugoslavia. A group of ex-pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begins attacking bases and enemy convoys; Over the course of several months, more pilots and airplanes joined the ranks, forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's fable? whatever it is, is certainly not convincing, but a cast of great actors will certainly try to make it work. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a well-armed German air strike against defenseless supporters. The nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short time the audience is treated with a rather patriotic series of scenes. Then the action begins, and this title quickly becomes more of a low budget adventure and by numbers. All characters are familiar cliches: Major Dragan (played by well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic hero hero. He explodes bombing planes with a machine gun and even has an air duel with villain Klauberg (Radko Polic), a climax completely predictable and tacky with an equally predictable result. The rest of the partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a successful playboy; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a veteran of the pamphlet that comes out of the hole now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic ("The day that shook the world") is Dalibor, a young messenger who climbs into the hierarchy, becoming an experienced combat pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan, and Krvavac does not try to rely on these stereotypes. The cast does a fair job, and despite the two-dimensional script, each player is engaging and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, have great moments ?? when he will take his first flight as a gunner, and then when he is forced to land an airplane after the pilot is killed. The plot consists merely of a series of air strikes against the Germans, and subsequent acts of retaliation. <br /> <br /> Krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of real scenes and miniature effects. Unfortunately, the miniatures are so cheap and fake that the transitions between real aerial photography and toy airplanes are shocking and laughable. Some of the scenes of bombing and bombing seem shockingly real, while combats involving scale models, complete with pilots of action figures, are simply pathetic. Sometimes the fumes from the "machine guns" are so large that the smoke engulfs the whole plane of the model. Worse still, editors often override fighter shots in real scenes. Although aircraft are usually in the right perspective, they are surrounded by a glow that distracts any attempt at realism. All this action is defined as an incredibly familiar and boring score by Bojan Adamic. <br /> <br /> "Battle of the Eagles" also suffers from a poorly edited English release. For starters, there are 28 minutes of footage left? cutting the film from 130 minutes to just 102. The missing segments were careless and the cut looks very careless. The musical signals are abruptly cut and scenes are abandoned before being resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart, and only a few extremely necessary action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. So, is there dubbing? all scenes surrounding the partisans are dubbed in English (however, badly), but several long scenes remain in German without the benefit of subtitles. The film could have made much more sense if the sequences of the German language had been excised, rather than crucial scenes surrounding the partisans. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Krvavac takes good care of outdoor images. There is never a time when audiences feel in a studio. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are expansive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter jets and extras in leather jackets. The scenery is fresh and green, and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or far away simply to convey the reach of a battle or a long journey. A German ambush of a party unit at the beginning of the image stands out, as well as a sequence in which Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base. <br /> <br /> As in the home video, "Battle of the Eagles" is just one more of the many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. There is nothing to differentiate it from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it below acceptable. Try to avoid this, unless you can find a complete copy.
