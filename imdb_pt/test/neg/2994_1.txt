I can not think of anything, I repeat, ANYTHING positive about this "Movie"! The entire 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunk in a 5 minute movie! In most scenes, there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems like only the camera was recorded on purpose just to increase movie time! All you see is someone in the background walking around or watching TV without a specific subject or even talking what ever! I feel like I've lost 105 minutes of my family and friends' weekend for nothing! If a movie is poorly done or the setting is not great, that's another story, at least it leaves you something to discuss, but on DISTANT, I just have to call it "Movie" because it was a movie shot by a camera. If you have not yet seen, imagine a 105-minute movie based on two or three story lines! What will you end up with? 5% content and 95% fillings! That's exactly how "Distant" was at least to us! The actors did a great job acting in roles that had nothing special in them, barely spoken or showed special emotions! I got this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what I read on the back of its cover. I'm still wondering what was funny about it beyond our face after watching the movie.
