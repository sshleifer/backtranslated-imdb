It's hard to believe that such a bad movie can be released. The dialogue was not natural. Especially poor was the picture of the relationship between the boy and his future stepfather. I think you could say that they managed to produce a clumsy dialogue, but what was said seemed false and artificial. The suspense was simply not there. The music was as bad as it sounds. The only reason I watched this movie was because I live in the Death Valley area and I was curious about which places would appear on the screen. Luckily the movie was on TV and so I wasted no money renting that excuse for a movie! I honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here. It's a shame that the whole time a film crew has been wasted on such junk! I think the only positive thing I can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.
