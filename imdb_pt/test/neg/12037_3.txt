Some movies you watch and you say, "Well, that did not make sense." And you're not serious. You're just saying that things were overly complicated or a little pointless. <br /> <br /> "Bread And Circus" does not make any sense. And I mean it. And that's not because it's surreal. From the outset, it is quite clear that it is a weak excuse to make special splatter effects. There is no script. There is no plot. There is no history of any kind. One event does not lead to the next - that's how bad writing is here. <br /> <br /> So what? That is, there are TONS of movies that fall into this category. They want to show you blood, they give you blood. Why even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because, in this case, "Bread and Circus" gave me hope. Okay, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas, on the floor - people crawling out of them. The earth, in space, two legs on each side. These kinds of images are wonderful, fun, strange, crazy. But the movie does nothing to them. <br /> <br /> Things happen, the movie ends, and it's all very unsatisfying. I suspect the script was invented at the time. What a pity. If there was a story of ANY kind, it would be a much more entertaining film. <br /> <br /> The movie is very much like the beautiful car you would like to have. So you lift the hood and have no engine. Just a little man selling a bicycle. <br /> <br /> GRR!
