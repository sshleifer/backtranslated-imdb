A typical old black and white film. The dialogues are sometimes good, but often - especially in the second half - they become naive, sometimes terribly naive, occasionally near the point where they are cowardly unwittingly. The first third, with its basic information on Gatsby de Ladd, shown with a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the film. But once Gatsby moves to his new village and makes his moves on Betty Field, the film becomes overly melodramatic. The end is yet another final escape; I do not know if the novel itself contains this stupid and cliche ending or if the producer of the film made some changes in it but I have always considered car accidents a bad way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. I've seen this plot device a million times (or if it's not a car, then it's a fall from a horse); the writer does not know how to end the story, but he knows he wants it to be dramatic, so he adds a car accident. Lame. And to make matters worse, the accident is outrageously coincidental and absurd, both in terms of plot and time; plot-wise because Field's husband's lover (Winters) is killed by Field, and the fact that Winters runs off the gas station into the street as if she had never noticed in the years she lived there. It was a dangerous road in front of her house - and, of course, just as she leaves, she sees Ladd's car and confuses him with Field's husband's car and shouts, "This way! make the tragic end that way! "; time because Ladd and Field are involved in an accident the same day they are preparing to tell Field's husband about their case. Basically, there is a lot of forced and artificial irony in this accident. It also does not help exactly in this movie as Winters' husband, Da Silva, goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife; he basically does this by walking like a zombie, going from car to car looking for scratches, and acting really badly. Both Da Silva's acting and the behavior of his character throughout the film are terrible and confusing, respectively. Scott Fitzgerald was upset on a few occasions as his novels were adapted to the screen by Hollywood writers, and - although he was dead long before the movie was over - he might be right to complain, judging by the naive script of that film. Or, perhaps, his novels are even more foolish and naive than this film, and have been enhanced by the adaptations of the screen. Or the movies are very much like novels. I could, of course, read this particular novel to find out, but I can not be bothered. Fitzgerald's name does not exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and I'm not talking the way his name sounds). He certainly was not Heller, Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway? too much noise about anything.
