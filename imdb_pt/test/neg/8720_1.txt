This is a total piece of crap. It's an insult to Frank Herbert's incredible book. They stained the story and the characters. The acting is average to bad. The only character made right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies early in history and then it's all from there (not a lot too loud to begin with). <br /> <br /> The 1984 film was directed by the legendary David Lynch. I was not too impressed with the film, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. Surprisingly, the miniseries of low quality makes it look much better in comparison. It was at least a little faithful to the book, which I really love. <br /> <br /> They had the chance to do it right this time, unfortunately it was not done.
