As other reviews have said, another of the countless Alien clones, this time with a great wodge of The Terminator, adds a bit of the SF classic story "Who Goes There?", And an incredibly stupid storyline The Andromeda Strain apparently blinking reds make the furious murderous droids unable to spot frightened people standing three inches away from them. <br /> <br /> OK, the story: after a sequence of people running in a spaceship and killing each other, we got a caption. <br /> <br /> "25 years later." The crew of a relay station in orbit of Mars, which is expected to be relieved in 48 hours, detects a huge spacecraft on a collision course. It is Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. This is not a good time to have taken everything useful from the relay station to do some repairs. The approaching ship does not deviate from its course and is transmitting a "NO, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BETWEEN THE ROAD!" Notice. After much yelling at each other, the relay station staff mend something and take the station out of the way just at the right time. But the ship changes course and oppresses them anyway - impaling one of the crew on a crew impasor thing. The satellite begins to "lose integrity". Bits depressurise. Much more screams and races in which only two people from the team are sucked into space from back to front. (Why are they always sucked back?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, the techy wheelchair (which is called 'Wheeler' - the only detectable joke in the whole movie) deduces that Siberia is draining all its power and they need to go aboard it and turn off their engines. They all board and take off their helmets. "Do not enter this ship!" obviously means boarding the ship and exposing yourself to possible fatal infectious diseases. A chief of staff in the main computer room, where they find a dead and dead guy holding what looks like an American Express card, but turns out to be a minidisc. The other team finds some switches. Surprisingly, the dead man appears to be the father of the attractive female crew member, voted more likely to survive a rendezvous with a violent alien. They turn off the engines, but that means the ships' reactor is going to explode. A frightening point of view begins to kill people. There is some doubt that Siberia has discovered a new ore, an energy source worth millions, which means that the more venal members of the crew immediately put themselves in danger to get hold of it. The POV shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! walking noises on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, they give the idea that the killer is wearing corduroy pants and the effect is wasted. After that, everything is running and being killed in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive. - along with the fluffy dog ​​who managed to get at least two crewmen to his death. The reason veterans of space harden into the clutches of certain death, searching for their pets. Dogs and cats have long been a mystery to this type of film. Other stupid highlights include everyone neglecting to work the decreasing levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the onboard computer (not that the low oxygen levels somehow diminish any of the awesome fires that this load of idiots initiates). If the id of the Droid killer so clever he can drive the ship on a tight turn and have another go hit the relay station why not turn off the "not under any circumstances Enter This Ship!" warning sign .. I'm sure if you were looking for more people to kill then screaming GO AWAY! <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only person who can do anything - all the others just touch their nostrils all the time as they show their teeth and shout and point at the guns. each other. It's this kind of script; full of exclamation points - the only thing that kept me going until the end was the hope that the script would require her to take off all her clothes or get wet while she did not wear much. Unfortunately this did not happen. One of the wrong things with this movie (besides being more cyan placed on the screen than in any other movie of all time) is that there was no free nudity.
