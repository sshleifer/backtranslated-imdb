A brazen plucking from "Air Bud", this movie is really about parents worrying a lot about parents. All the weaknesses of the characters (eg adult coaches who do not know the game) are pushed to the extreme - so much so that they are totally unbelievable, not funny. <br /> <br /> There is no similarity of reality here. , staff and you will not develop sympathy for any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the good-looking kits (uniforms) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. Maybe chosen because the setting is supposedly near Arlington Heights, IL, home of Columbus Crew franchise player Brian McBride.
