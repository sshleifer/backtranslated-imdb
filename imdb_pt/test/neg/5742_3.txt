Slayer begins in the rainforest of South America where Captain Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a bunch of Vampires, they can barely escape with their lives. Advance six months later & Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter), who informs him that there have been other reported sightings of vampires and that his ex-wife and stepdaughter Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) left there in an expedition to study beetles, worried that he would ask Hawk to take a squad of soldiers back to South America and officially provide support to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while he unofficially sought out Laurie and was not killed. by the vampires who have decided to venture out of the caves and into the civilized world ... Edited, written and directed by Kevin VanHook this is another badly done original Sci-Fi Channel that is just isn is very good in any aspect. The humorless script has nothing to do, as far as I can see, it's one of those modern Vampire movies that decides to choose the 'traditional' vampire movie he wants to use as these Vampires can be killed with stakes by the heart and have fangs, but at the same time they can walk freely in the sun and they do not sleep in coffins. The film moves at a reasonable pace, but it's all very dull, bland and lifeless. The story is poor and just a little stupid, the character is terrible, the dialogue is forgettable and there is very little here to recommend. Slayer also tries to have some kind of ecological message as the Vampire chief states that they are just beginning to kill humans because of their systematic destruction of the rainforest where they have lived in secret for centuries, unfortunately there is no belief there and it is more like a disposable line to fill the time than a serious statement. There is not enough exploration content and it is a pretty unsatisfying way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The creators do not do anything with the forest, hell I did not expect Predator (1987), but I expected a little more than that. Director VanHook has made several horror movies that I've seen have been equally poor, I'm sorry, but he does nothing here and turns into a film of completely forgettable appearance and feeling. There is no atmosphere or tension, and for genuine fears, forget it. Blood is contained, there are a few bitten necks and a little bit of powdered blood, but it's nothing we have not seen before or it has much impact. There is also a huge vampire monster creature at the end, but it does not look so impressive and ends up being killed very easily. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 2,000,000, this really took a decent amount of size. money spent on it, but it's still a trash movie, it's reasonably well done, but nothing special or memorable. The acting is awful, I'm sorry, but that's how I see it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another poor, stupid, boring science fiction channel junk made for TV that I just can not recommend. Not to be confused with the British movie 'Video Nasty' The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than that, so watch it and see it.
