Being a fan of wrestling, movies about wrestling are usually a drug (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura's story), but that's not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, it's bad, but it's better than some of the others I mentioned. Hulk Hogan stars basically as himself and for some reason a rival network wants to beat him because he does not want to be on that network. Let me explain this so that everyone can understand ... imagine USA Network having Rip ... and TNT will do everything to get it. That makes sense ... does not it? Well do not feel bad because it does not make sense. It also does not make sense to have a legitimate ex-con having a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> None of these movies makes much sense, but compared to other wrestling movies and later Hogan movies. it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
