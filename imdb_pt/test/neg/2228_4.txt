All those who criticize the Sopranos for their stereotyped portraits of the Italians saw nothing until they got a good look at this gangster cornball movie that focuses on such an annoying family that you almost want them erased. The parents of this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - one of them a total, naughty and naughty brat - are unbearable while their eldest son is useless and daughter Pollyanna skillfully competes for contempt the public. But the grandfather of all is, well, Grandpa. As touched by Chic Sale (in the "Dag-nabbit!" Mode) It serves as the moral compass of the films, making many criticisms about "damn dirty aliens". If these are the good guys, it is no wonder that the actors of that era who threw the bad guys became big stars. <br /> <br /> Not that there are stellar performances among the criminals, but at least acquit themselves better than the Leeds family. The incompetent cops do not even get enough screen time to get things going. Only Walter Huston, as district attorney, raises the clich√©-tangled material in his futile attempts to breathe a little levelnessedness into these dolts. <br /> <br /> The film deserves credit for being an early entry into what would prove to be a very popular formula to silence the witness, and does not go back on its description of the underworld lifestyle, but there are examples simply better - and less xenophobic - in the genre.
