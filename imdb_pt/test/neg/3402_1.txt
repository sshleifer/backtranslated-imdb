Basically this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible director who happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, so avoid at all costs. <Br/> <br /> As for this documentary, it's fun; fun and blatantly misleading! Most "historical" images are probably just that, historical scenes of completely unrelated events that were sadly clipped and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would otherwise be. There is no doubt that Waverly is a very interesting place with lots of fascinating history, but making a documentary to market the place and related production is, for lack of better words, terribly useless. <br /> <br /> And yes, I've lived in Kentucky my whole life, and visited the place countless times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and there is nothing respectful about this lame documentary.
