You get a good deal of Steven Seagal's environmental anxieties, and some breathtaking mountain views, along with scenes of cow-boys (or, alternatively, use parts of any trace of WHISPERER OF HORSE). You then add a large piece of virus type OUTBREAK or similar (attention, it must be more deadly and at least Level 4 Biological Risk), wrapped around a fat Militia group leader. You add a teaspoon of martial arts and a zip of explosions and shots to the taste. Add the classic red Indian herbs for extra flavor. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie you get ?: The Patriot. Maybe Steven Seagal's worst movie. I'm sure Seagal tried to say something in this movie, except for the usual "I am a cook" (but also a seal), but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful.
