I just caught "The Rain People" in Turner Classic Movies late at night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight stars as Natalie, a Long Island housewife who - for unknown reasons - leaves her husband and embarks on a car trip, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, she picks up a former football player "Jimmy" (James Caan), who has been kicked out of her college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists along the way between these two as Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize that he is mentally limited and can not take care of himself. She is going through her own struggles, needless to say, and is not in a position to take care of him. Natalie seems to be a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown sometimes; she makes some strange phone calls to her husband, who begs her to come home. Natalie tries to evict Jimmy several times, just so that he re-enters her life through circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange and disturbed cop who befriends Natalie. You have the feeling that this movie will end badly, and it ends. This movie is certainly patchy at times, and the script is a bit flawed. Francis Ford Coppola directed this and, of course, would soon become hugely famous in the years to come for directing "The Godfather." The actors are good, needless to say, because everyone would have a future ahead of them in the movies. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underestimated as an actor. James Caan is especially effective here and seems to inhabit this character. This film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is one of the first Coppola films, and I confess I had never heard of it. So, God bless Turner Classic Movies for bringing it to a new audience.
