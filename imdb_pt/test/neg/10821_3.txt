I think most people would agree with me if I said that the movie Alien practically sets the standard for the atmosphere. I've seen some movies match this bar, but none have ever surpassed Alien's strange tunnels and dark corridors. The Cave is a film that tries very hard to restart the bar. I believe the trailer even mentioned something about being as scary as the Alien, but not once in the course of the movie did I feel a bit scared or excited about it. <br /> <br /> So now that we get the negativity ball rolling I might well explain why the main hook of the Cave (the atmosphere in case you're not paying attention) has failed in a waste of my time . I will now say that most scenarios were beautiful and well lit, but what we hear and what we know is that they tend to ruin what we see. The music for one is terrible. Either we started rock clad or haunted house music exaggerated. Okay, maybe that's a little too much, but I could not bear it. The many underwater scenes were already bad enough (it's a well-known fact that underwater scenes are always boring as hell). I did not need rock music in my ears while they simply swam in a cave. This actually produced many unintentional laughs that were amplified by the following scene of boat accidents. <br /> <br /> Anyway, as I already mentioned, it was not just the music that killed the atmosphere, no. Creatures hidden in darkness must invoke horror. I should be worried that they will show up and merely a glimpse of them should make my blood run cold. The Cave wisely takes a page from the alien manual, not showing the entire creature for long and leading to revelation with only glimpses, but it simply does not work, because creatures are so weak. I think it would be rude to spoil the details, but they are basically the aliens with wings. <br /> <br /> I think you've got the point so far. Atmosphere ruined. However, I know many people who will still see a movie if it is exciting. I'd like to say that about the cave, but I'd be lying. This movie is slow to come to action and once we get there, we sort of wonder when the thing finally will end. We've seen all of this better before, except for a few cool scenes (the guy impaled on stalactites, eels and rapids) so you have no excitement of seeing people rushing from uninspiring alien imitations into endless tunnels. Ah, but the pain does not end there. We must also take the characters and act on them. Well, I can not remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" and the only name I remember is Jack, but that's only because it's put on almost every other line near the end of the movie. Maybe the actors were capable, but the script did not allow them to do anything but run and argue. They had almost no background and whenever someone died they simply shrugged. It is very sad when you consider that the CGI eel gives the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Speaking of CGI; there is a lot of it, most of it is terrible. I recommend that they wear suits (at least I think they were suits), but nothing really fits with the environment and as a result most effects turn out to be very mushy. <br /> <br /> So, I think to wrap, the cave is bad and has very little for that. If the movie had been a SciFi channel debut or a low budget direct pitch for the video, I might have a little more love for it, but this movie was a theatrical release. With more intelligence and talent, this movie could be hauntingly fun, but as it stands, this movie is as scary as entering the basement and that's not very good. <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
