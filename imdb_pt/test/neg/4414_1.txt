Huge, swaying threats, grimacing at the trunk of a tree, pretend to be "natives" in a "Pacific Atoll" (looking suspiciously like the Southern CA ...), trying to exact revenge and revenge. Unlike the foolish stumps of "Navy VS The Night Monsters," the Tabonga is actually a grown man. Well, grown in 2 days: moost has od'ed on these peaks of Miracle Grow ... Anycow, not from hell, but from the grave of a fake native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The Zombies of Mora Tau"), murdered by the native elders for dating those terrible American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang on High," "Under the Planet of the Apes") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "War of the Colossal Beast"). Completing the cast is Linda Watkins ("The Parents Trap") as the obnoxious Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief that triggers a false "fake" accent. A stellar cast indeed! Anycow, because his vague and prosaic wife, Korey, played amateur by Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love's A-Poppin '"), helps to set him up, Kimo declares his revenge against her and all the elders. So doped American scientists destroy the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science," and allow it to SLOWLY wander the island, killing everyone who has done it wrong. Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry fair maidens, so the Tabonga catches female scientist Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell in Frisco Bay") and walks with her. Ally of vines, a good shot with a Remmington hits a knife housed in Tabonga, and falls dead in the quicksand. This ridiculously foolish coughcept is one of the all-time cheese howlers. The Tabonga is arguably the slowest monster in Moovies history, high up with the robust, super-built "Robot Monster vs. Azia Mummy" robot and Creepy Terror's creepy, creepy monster. Try not to laugh as you watch the Tabonga throw fake natives through the hills and into the quicksand, dodge spears, and walk slowly over the "island." Dark writing, wooden performances and sentimental direction indicate that this swarming fertilizer has much more mooore than bite. This lukewarm stack of wood chips was the last cry of long-time editor-turned-director Dan Milner, who quickly disappeared into the well-deserved obscurity after this movie. You flock through the vine of MooCow first: "From Hell It Came" is a composting classic !! : ??
