I only saw this movie last night. I remember the hype of the release, and to be honest, if I had seen it then, I might not have been so generous. I hate hype, this can ruin a movie. I think the film covered the characters and put a lot of emphasis on Woody. He was good too - though he wondered if he was drugged all the time. It was never very deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character disappointed me in the end. To me, he should have been more confrontational with Demi - throwing her out, maybe, or saying she was paid. After all, he would have investigated them before making the proposal - this is not shown in the film, but no one in his perceived position would make an offer to anyone. He was cruel enough to break them and the last drop was the house and yet Demi fell in love with him? The passages giving insight into the relationship of Demi and Woody were the best part of the film. There was a deep depth that overshadowed the superficiality of the character John Gages. He really could have been much stronger and, as other people alluded, I think the draw of the films was Redford and they did not want to tarnish his "image". I say the hell Robert was old in this movie! The Woody and Demi characters were na√Øve in one sense, but I think it was very intentional to take you into their situation and defend your decision. But the reality is that they were losing the house of their dreams and where did they go? Las Vegas? bet the little that remained and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford seduced them a little too unrealistic. The movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that in the late evening - TV was nice and I, if you do not think much - also palatable
