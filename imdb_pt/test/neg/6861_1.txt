It was unlucky to see this while traveling by bus across Africa. It was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It deserves to be the worst # 1 of all time ;-) No acting, no plot, speaking very little. Many monkey grunts in this hopelessly improbable film. An unconscious self-satire - you'll laugh or cry.
