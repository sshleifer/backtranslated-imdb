People call it a "partisan line" of 976 to talk dirty with strangers, and maybe find a sexual connection. A demented sister, somewhat incestuous and an occasional transvestite brother uses the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but they do not discriminate! A couple of sixteen-year-old girls also call the queue for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a nanny for a married man who is hot to her (or anyone). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a cop is lent for murder when he first discovers one of the brothers' victims. He joined a female District Attorney's assistant. <br /> <br /> Nothing very special here. Richard Roundtree has little more than a tip as a police chief. One of the dirty sixteen-year-old girls is played by an actress who also dubbed Peanuts' character Peppermint Patty! According to IMDb, the other died quite young, only a few years after this film: sad.
