It is not uncommon for a celebrity to be confronted with the proverbial "wake-up call." And, if they survive this event, they will come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. However, in the case of comedians, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were before. Such is the case of Martin Lawrence. Frankly, I pay little attention to celebrities, because I have much better things to do with my life than to spend with other people. So, I did not know most of what Lawrence had done before this movie. It was interesting, but alas, everything is common. I got the bigger impression that this guy's stand-up act was not very funny. Save the big life messages for a book, just be funny on the stage. If you want to see a funny Martin Lawrence, go rent some of the old Def Jams that he hosted. Do not rent Runteldat.
