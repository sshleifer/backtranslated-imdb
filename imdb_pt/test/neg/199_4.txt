I just watched the UbuWeb this initial experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes, you read it right, Orson Welles! Years before he gained fame on "War of the Worlds" radio and his debut feature, Citizen Kane, Welles was 19 and eventually found his muse. In addition to Vance and Welles, another player here was a Virginia Nicholson, who would become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman who sits back and forth, courtesy of an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in blackface). During this time, a man (Welles) goes through it (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating). I will not reveal anything else, except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jumped constantly. That's not to say that was good, but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added in the 2005 edition that I watched. It's worth looking at Welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde.
