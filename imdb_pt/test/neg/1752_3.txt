Some movies are not for everyone. This accurately describes the film by Igmar Bergaman, Skammen (Shame). At only 18, I still have what I think you could call a smaller form of ADD and well, I watch movies to entertain myself. Shame was a film with a very interesting premise, of trying to convey the effect of the war to ordinary people, however, fell short of accomplishing this for me. I do not know if it was the captions, the black and white footage, the length of the film or the fact that it took me two hours to study for a major chemistry test, but I did not like it. I understand that it is considered a great film and very important in the history of cinema, however, I think as my teacher pointed out, not everyone liked or likes. I think I'd like you to finish all your many graphics. Maybe the translation lost something, but I felt that there were endless takes that never came to a conclusion. You would meet characters and never see them again, or you would really understand why they were included in the movie. My overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing, but only to form your opinion on it. Whether you like it or not, you need to respect the point you are trying to convey.
