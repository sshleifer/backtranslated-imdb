4 realz son my game iz crazy tite yo I can not wait 2 start dis show and curl in club n make it real 905 style wit crazy models n bottles, son! <br /> <br /> No, I'm just joking. This is a sad show, created by and for the enjoyment of sad men. Men who are so castrated by modern existence that channel their frustration to clubs, where they achieve fleeting self-validation, attacking the puppies in the hope that their little sausages will be touched to try to numb the pain of loneliness and make them feel even if only for one night, as if his place at the Toronto Sausage Board was a little less permanent. <br /> <br /> I read a few comments here saying that this program represents Canadian TV finally approaching American TV or something. Well, that's not objective at all. It's like yes! Pat yourself on the back, Canada - you've finally broken the elusive formula for such groundbreaking American content as "Studs," "Changing Heart," "Elimidate," and "The Fifth Wheel." You see, the real idea here is to put "Candid Camera" in the field. Genius. And there is nothing that crosses this tenuous line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality as a group of adult men shooting each other in a hidden camera, admiring each other's "play" in the club. The love of the man on display here is so palpable that they should really consider it again "Keys to Steam Bath." <br /> <br /> On a side note, how interesting is it that the people who gave this show such brilliant opinions seem to have registered a IMDb account for the express purpose of doing so (I think I am guilty of employing the same way to do the opposite here). My personal favorite is that enthusiastic reviewer who claims to be from the United States. who says "Now it's clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television." <br /> <br /> Soft. <br /> <br /> But why bother even making online buzz? You can not really be canceled, after all - you're on the Comedy Network in Canada, baby! The viewing audience will continue to ignore your program for years to come. In all likelihood, you'll be fine navigating comfortably along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with most of the original Comedy Network programming.
