At the beginning of 'Loggerheads', we are presented with three apparently unrelated pairs of characters. To make matters even more confusing, we are told (through on-screen titles) that the action is taking place in three separate timelines (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a long time, but eventually we get to see how the three pairs are related: Mark Austin, a 20-something gay and HIV-positive young man, is far from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a homeless man and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town where he meets George (sensibly played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and they eventually get involved with the other. . Meanwhile, Mark's biological mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has reached the point in her life, where she decided to find the son she abandoned for adoption at the age of seventeen. Likewise, Mark's adoptive mother also decided to follow the path. her estranged son, how she misses him (despite the apprehensions of her husband homophobic minister). <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' tells us that it is based on a true story and that it may be your Achilles' heel. Director / writer Tim Kirkman goes to great lengths to create scenes filled with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found. Take Mark and George - they are both sensitive souls who have little to disagree with. There is a slight tension when Grace encounters a director of the Adoption Agency who is prohibited by law from providing her with any information about her lost son, as well as a mild conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager. . No sparks fly between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend insists, from the beginning, that she has no intention of reconciling with her son. "Loggerheads" is similar to "Brokeback Mountain," in which the gay couple is the good guy and the straight males (eg, Kure's beach cop and the reverend) are villains. The film's biggest disappointment is that there is no interaction (and therefore no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers." Mark is already dead before the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both an appeal to tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their sincere feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's feelings are, for the most part, well-intentioned, but do not contribute to good drama. Headshakes move in the rhythm of a snail without giving new revelations (or suspense) on issues such as AIDS, Adoption and Homophobia. Ultimately, 'Loggerheads' fails due to a lack of originality.
