In addition to the shooting scene, I felt the film was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner and Annette Bening could have played these roles in their sleep. The dialogue was marginally bearable (and there was a lot of it - no one sat quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to stick to in the story, there was subtlety at all - the eyes and they drove him through the nose for most of the story (I think they added the whole dialogue to make sure you did not miss anything), and the editing really needed to be tight (each screen time of the actor was over <br /> <br /> The whole story happened over a few days, but everything that happened took on epic proportions as well as the day-to-day happenings seemed HUGE for you in high school, but in the grand scheme they really were not that important.Yes, the bad guys beat and killed Mose, they hit Button, they killed the dog - all the things that would take the blood of Boss and Charley pa But the importance was diluted by all the "deep and meaningful" conversations that dominated most of the film. These guys have been working together for 10 years and now they're just talking about these things? The only time there was not much dialogue was at the shooting scene - which is probably the reason why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Finally, someone gives Annette Bening a hairbrush! The thin strands of hair around her face that were (I suppose) making her look a little more romantic, actually made her seem a little disturbed. If she worked outside the home, it would make more sense. Besides, why did not she get married? There seemed to be several single men "gentle and kind" (his words) in the city, as well as the marshal and his cronies. In fact, none of the bad guys wanted it, too (a usual device in other films). She was confined to the house most of the time and did not seem to have much connection with the people of the city. It makes you think ...... <br /> <br /> In total, the film was very long, very talkative and very artificial for me. It looked like a star vehicle with a lot of screen time for the big stars, but it did not have enough character depth to interest me despite all the dialogue.
