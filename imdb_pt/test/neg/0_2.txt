Again, Mr. Costner made a movie for much longer than necessary. In addition to the terrible sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few, I simply did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is noticed early on, and then forgotten until much later, when I did not care. The character we should care about is very arrogant and overconfident, Ashton Kutcher. The problem is that he comes out as a kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and does not show signs of a messy closet. His only obstacle seems to be overcoming Costner. Finally, when we have already passed the middle of the road, Costner tells us about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is led to be the best without previous forebodings or foreboding. No magic here, it was all I could do not to hang up an hour.
