I had the weird chance to see this at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 four years ago. I must admit it was not as badly done as some other science fiction / horror films of the day. The plot revolved around an astronaut who returned to Earth with an alien embryo inside him. Now the plot is rather strange, well, if you can even call it a plot. (Seeing a space program coming out of a building and an old pickup is funny!) I admit it was awful by today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I can see myself 43 years ago watching and being charmed by this movie. It is not even close to the evil of the Invasion of the Men of Neptune, Hands: Hands of Destiny or Future War. <br /> <br />
