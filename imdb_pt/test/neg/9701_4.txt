Let me start by saying that I love the book and I loved the A & E miniseries. I was hoping to love this movie, and I was absolutely willing to allow a moderate degree of artistic license to interpret and abbreviate the actual story. However, this film hardly resembles the original book. If only "the names had been altered to protect the innocent," I might have liked the film simply as a playful, if imprecise piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, putting the name "Mr. Darcy" in a character who is emotional and weak, giving the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, arrogant hoyden, often with tears in his eyes, that he does not care about the rules of society and makes Mr. Bingley a big-eyed idiot the idea that the director had already read Jane Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> There are some really stellar moments in this movie - maybe a total of 10 minutes is really great. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins's proposal begins beautifully. She is 27 years old (quite close to the maiden's age and desperate at the time), is becoming a burden to her family and is not romantic. She just wants a "comfortable home". However, the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she says, "Do not judge me, Elizabeth. Do not you dare judge me!" and runs in tears. Later, you see Charlotte Kowtow for Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who was not at all in character as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good time is when Darcy picks up Elizabeth at her house while she is touring the area with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in the A & E series, but the film version with Keira Knightley made the public feel how humiliating that moment must have been for Elizabeth. Very good. <br /> <br /> The ending also illustrated a level of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries. I really enjoyed this scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending, rather than just knowing that it happened. <br /> <br /> In total, however, this movie eliminated the subtlety that was an integral part of Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The characters speak in a dissonant combination of Austen's dialogue with verbal and modern phrases and colloquialisms. The information that was just alluded for or suggested in the original work is blatantly declared in this version. Yes, time was a concern. It's just a short film, yada yada. But turning a beautiful and complex book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some have commented that they loved the moment when Darcy sees Elizabeth, because it is obviously a case of "love at first sight." Love at first sight? There is? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth should not be a traditional beauty, and Darcy comes to love her for her wit and vivacity ... he literally "loves her for his mind." <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first proposal) when the two are screaming furiously at each other as they approach ... and closer ... and almost kissing. .. but suddenly move away. Ugh! What a sad clich√©. Are they angry and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it does not matter that (at the time) they do not even like each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The characterizations were so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story. Mr. Bennet was gloomy, Elizabeth generally acted as silly as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for a home of her own - unlike the intelligent, slightly intriguing woman with an abundance of common sense that is portrayed in the novel. Jane and Elizabeth's relationship is merely current, instead of the deep love and admiration they should have for each other. All this I might have accepted as mere bad interpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept all this, apart from the many historical inaccuracies. Ms. Bingley was poorly dressed (her dress looked like what others would wear as tight underwear). Elizabeth walked to Netherfield with her hair down and allowed her to fly everywhere. The family lay lazily one morning, though mornings were to be reserved to call acquaintances (or be called in their own house). Elizabeth left barefoot in her nightgown. And in a really shocking scene, Bingley entered Jane's room and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was sick. <br /> <br /> Most people think these are minor points, but I simply wanted A.) a historically accurate film, or B.) an accurate representation of the characters in the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / anyone who has sacrificed precision, subtlety, and a good story for a trivial tale of love at first sight. I can admit that those who have not read the book or are unfamiliar with the social conventions of the day could easily enjoy this film, and there is nothing wrong with that. I just could not get over my desire to see a movie that involved more than just two pretty faces.
