The other is an alleged "horror" movie made during the 1970s. Not to be confused with the similarly titled THE OTHERS, starring Nicole Kidman. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows - a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandchildren something that is simply referred to as "the game." One of these twins - Niles - must be "good." The other - the Netherlands - is supposed to be bad. <br /> <br /> The idea seems quite interesting as an abstract concept and the film was adapted from a novel. I can only hope the novel is interesting, since the film was incredibly annoying from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The running of this film is very much like a TV movie of the kind that UK residents can see on Channel 5. In fact, this movie seems to have been made to be the movie of the afternoon during the day for this TV channel. A slight cut-out for one or two scenes and this would be a Disney-type movie. But even the youngest of children is more likely to be bored than scared by ANOTHER. <br /> <br /> You do not have to check the director's resume to realize that horror is not your forte. <br /> Mr. Mulligan relies heavily on the characters to direct the story. This is obvious from the beginning. I have not seen any of his other films, but TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a highly regarded crime film on this site. Unfortunately, in THE OTHER, the characters receive very little to do, and the script ensures that the movie never takes off in the way you would expect. <br /> <br /> The steering is as insipid as possible. Almost all scenes occur during the day! Think about it - a scene filmed in the open landscape in rural America during the day with the camera focused on a vast area. Sounds scary or atmospheric? Believe me, it's not. It appears as something more like an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes, both the previously mentioned TV series and THE OTHER were filmed in California. <br /> <br /> There is a notable absence of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise seem rather pointless. <br /> <br /> The ending was clearly designed to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced by another film from this time period. I'm not going to reveal which movie, but I'll give you two clues - a kid was a main character and the movie is well known. And I will add that the concept was used with much greater effect in the last film. <br /> <br /> The acting is really very good and it's the only reason I conceded 2 stars. The actors who play the twin boys, along with the actress who plays the grandmother, all struggle with the poor material they receive. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur is completely wasted in an ungrateful role as the mother of the twins. . Do not be fooled by their high casting income. She receives very little time on the screen and her presence only appears as a maneuver to make money from her long-established TV career in order to help attract viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid close attention to the synopsis of the TV. the back of the DVD cover (from the Region 2 UK version). Comparisons were made with EXORCIST, which I thought was a complete insult to the film. There is no comparison. The EXORCIST had everything this movie should contain, but it does not have - suspense, tension, ironic humor, highly disturbing content, great performance, excellent characterization and involvement of the viewer. Ironically, The Exorcist was made just a year later, but in terms of style and execution it seems decades ahead of the bland drama known as THE OTHER. The other appears as a work that would have seemed tame in the 1950s and much less in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> The 1970s was a great era for horror films with such classics as THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN , THE CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE LEGEND OF HOUSE OF HELL, LOT OF SALEM to name but a few being produced. For this reason, the other proves an even greater disappointment. <br /> <br /> If someone finds the other's synopsis interesting, they may want to read the book or do a little more research on what the book was about. I would advise everyone to skip the movie.
