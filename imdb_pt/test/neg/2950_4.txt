(Dir-Leon Leonard): Just adventure movie based on a novel by the author of Moby Dick, Herman Melville. This film is about the captain of a ship that had stolen his eyes (which were extremely rare black pearls) from the sculpture of a god of the native tribe and hid them somewhere that only he knew before leaving the island of Tivi. He became very ill and was on a secret voyage to return to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while others (like his daughter) thought he would return to be treated by the local healer. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A clandestine really knew the true reason for the trip - to turn a blind eye to his God. The silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their God having eyes (causing them all kinds of problems). Along the way, we are treated (for some reason) by a small underwater nature show with an electric eel battling a local octopus (I think only Herman Melville knows what it was all about). Once they arrive on the island, the captain dies, but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter, but she also receives the curse of the disease as well. One of the bandits discovers where God is staying and convinces his daughter to go there and steal the pearls back, but right now the good guys find out what's going on and a fight starts. I will not tell you the results of the fight or the end, I'll leave it to you to find out if you want. As I said earlier, the movie was OK, but some very silly things that I have already mentioned have lessened the impact. I wonder if this new "Pirates of the Caribbean" has any of its plot from this - hmm ?? black pearls, a curse (I wonder?) Well, it does not matter, these elements have not made a very good movie in this case or the other. It seems they would learn that they are lesson, but with the money rolling in that new movie, I'm sure not. Oh well.
