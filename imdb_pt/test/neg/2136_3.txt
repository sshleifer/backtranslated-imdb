WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The ripples following the first film of "Jaws" were still prominent in the 1980s and beyond. The movie monsters are no longer radioactive monstrosities for unknown and voracious animals, hidden in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie the ocean, deep space, genetics). Although "Jaws" has been a landmark in this particular realm of cinematic horror, few movies have ever matched the visceral impact of the original. "Shark rosso nell'oceano" (also known as Devil Fish or Red Ocean), is a respectful follower of the original formula "Jaws". After several unlucky ships and sailors are brutally murdered by some creature from the ocean, there is an initial impulse to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results, and a final push to destroy it. While filmmakers tried to inject a new life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. This film sinks under its own weight of fearful editing, fragile acting and cheap scares. <br /> <br /> The most sickening feature of "Devil Fish" is its cookie-cutter edition. Since the beginning of the film, when three different scenes are mixed, the viewer realizes that the film has no technical credibility. It seems that editors cut scenes around a musical score instead of cutting the movie and then make the necessary changes to the song. In addition, each cut is interspersed and it seems that editors have never heard of the terms "disappear", "clean" or "dissolve". The impact of the scenes can never be established because they are immediately interrupted after a final line and a new scene begins. Several camera tricks abound, such as when two of the main characters share a particular moment on the beach and a kind of time-lapse image of their act is made up of their bodies. <br /> <br /> The music is equally bland. The creature's theme is a hopeless duplicate of the theme "Shark" with little variation. Although I like to keep my reviews devoid of MST3K influence, Mike has somberly described it as "softcore porn music." Failing to produce tension in a film that depends on it is a deadly blow to "Devil Fish." The acting is obsolete, the disconcerting relationships and the whole conspiracy is laughable. The question remains that if genetics advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why could a more practical use be given to a better humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this movie is the idea of ​​the monster, although its presence in the cinema is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is bad enough to fall below the median level. If "Jaws" had never been made, then the film could be described as medium because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed inefficiently. Unfortunately, as a copy of Spielberg's original thriller, he gets more comfortable in a lot of cheese trash.
