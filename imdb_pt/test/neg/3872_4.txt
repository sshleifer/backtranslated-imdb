B. Kennedy attempted to make a sequel by exaggerating and broadening "a gigantic left-wing West (not as leftist as the G. Kennedy sequel that came after this). This is the ugliest movie of the Hundreds of pedestrians, hundreds of Mexican bosses, hundreds of women, a desert, barren landscapes, a storm - the largest scale. <br /> <br /> All in this awkward sequence, friendly only in a strange way, is false. <br /> <br /> The film itself is very ugly. <br /> <br /> Brynner, who did the best part in the first film , does not look good in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rey plays a priest, he will be a political leader, Quintero, in the next installment of the franchise. <br /> <br /> It is true that when you have many characters, you may not need a very interesting storyline, sometimes.For example, Brynner knows McQueen; es choose other 'compadres'; or, B. Spencer finds Coburn; It's fun to see where and how they will find the rest of the team, etc. But you need at least these various characters. Unfortunately, Burt Kennedy's part is not very good at it. <br /> <br /> The return of the seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris meet there; they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original Chico Magnificents, which belongs to a huge group of 300 pedestrians kidnapped by Mexican bandits. We discovered the name of Chico's attractive wife, it's Petra. Chris must again constitute a small army - and here we have a Dirty Dozen treatment - Chris picks his men from the damned. Another member of the command is a womanizer, who will take good care of wives who are without husbands. Sexual humor is especially unpleasant and unpleasant in this movie. He strives to look smart and spicy; is simply rude, dumb and rude. <br /> <br /> The choice of members of the small army was one of the greatest joys of the McQueen film. Unfortunately, in the first sequence, there is the most untouchable of the three groups assembled under the name of the Magnificent Seven. Robert Fuller makes a lousy "Vin"; Oates is the smiling womanizer. <br /> In this immense and colossal attempt, a Mexican revolutionary leader has a gigantic plan - he kidnaps 300 pedestrians and uses them to build a village and a church in memory of his lost children. (It goes without saying that this insane Mexican revolutionary does not compare to Wallach's role in the first film.) B. Kennedy relies exclusively on the camp and on the most important things: ugly landscapes, a storm, gigantic lightning, a desert. A huge battle between the emancipated pawns and the revolutionary cowboys. Of course, Return of the Seven (1966) completely abandoned the good sense of the McQueen movie. <br /> <br /> What is particularly shocking is that this sequel came very quickly after the original movie? the way of doing westerns. <br /> <br /> Both sequences seem strange.
