As other posters have commented this was a very, very bad movie (keeping it kid friendly) FX was low class, they should of spent the $ 1 on a coke. As is typical of these D movies, most victims die and leave a mystery except for a soul of luck and, of course, leadership. I hope the money is worth to Boxleitner, really too big down to Babylon 5. Well see what happened to Buck Rogers, but damn it was low even for him. "It was so bad and in the older actors you might even look like they thought it was bad too. Do not Watch. <br /> <br /> ***** Spoiler Warning Below **** <br /> <br /> This thing haunted everyone who was after and still Boxlietner ran away ... that was pure BS. And the end? How the hell did the kids end up with him? That was really stupid.
