Not the best of WIP, but not the worst either. I honestly feel guilty laughing at this movie, considering that it has to be the low career for everyone involved. However, the acting, the dialogue, the absurd scenarios and the ever-present "boom mic" come to me all the time and certainly increase your bad movie charm. As much as I'm a Linda Blair fan, top honors (or topless) go to Sybil Danning. In addition, special praise for Henry Silva, who is the only one in the cast who does not play his role very seriously. Viewing, the movie now, however, makes me look at the Stella Stevens character more closely. She plays the director, and I have to wonder if this is when Hilary Clinton decided to adopt her current visual and behavior. After all, I'm sure she did not have to look for more than her husband's collection of videos to find this movie. Not that I'm judging. I've seen it several times, and it all makes me wonder what would have happened if Clinton had managed to install a hot tub in the Oval Office. Hmmm
