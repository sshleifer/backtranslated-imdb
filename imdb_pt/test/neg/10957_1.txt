Unreal !!!!!!!! After reading the initial reviews posted by purported reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all initial reviews, 38, all rated this movie as 10. After comparing with other great movies, these critics found that Quick and the Undead is a The Lord of the Rings (8.7), The Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8, 1) and Dawn of the Dead (7: 8), to name a few. I hope these shills use their next lasik discount procedure, which they hear about, because it's completely obvious these reviews have been faked. <br /> <br /> I was led to believe that this movie had a unique concept in its genre. of making zombie movies. Unfortunately when watching Quick and Undead, it is obvious that these criticisms were generated by people who were involved in the production, or who are interested in commercializing movies / financial success. Nothing cements this in my mind, more than hearing that a part of this film was filmed in Texas, were coincidentally the first post in the film that praises the film. The film culture Zombie / Horror B in general is a group that forgives, but this film is sadly beyond any redemption. The characters are recycled and the plot is bad. The quality of the film was not bad enough to be labeled as a camcorder, and at least they used a film-quality camera. The acting is horrible, the star trying, unsuccessfully, to leave as a Clint Eastwood wants to be clone. Christ on a bike !!!!!! Even the lead actor's name is Clint. He was just terrible. The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood is that the leader is using the "wood" of Eastwood's name in his acting style. Zumbi makeup was above the quality of Halloween party, but did not apply completely to undead cast members. All zombies were not made in your hands. The plot was so choppy that it made me wait for a power outage, a defect in the DVD disc, or the zombies turning their attention to the director. Maybe the movie is worth for some viewers, but not for my hard-earned dollar. Luckily I used my free rental coupon to check out this DVD. Maybe this movie will be salvaged by Nott's entertainment (appropriately named) by releasing a special collector's DVD, which will tie loose flaws, and deliver the promised goods ??? Some like, I do not think !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! !!! Let's just hope that your next release, The Flesh Keeper, is truly a "keeper" of a movie ... and not a recycled 5th generation version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Fingers crossed here folks ... but only if you care.
