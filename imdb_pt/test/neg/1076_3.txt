The characters were so uninspired it hurts. The skinny little computer geek, the funny African-American with stupid cliches jokes, cool white face with a compassion for cars, and the handsome leader ending with the pretty girl. The actors are, at best, mediocre. Norton ecsept doing a good job as the bad guy. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is also stupid and a complete waste of time. It's all about a bunch of pampered boys using the world as their playground, where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table. I mean, why work to make a living when you can steal people? <br /> <br /> And who moves the lights in a big European city? And in the middle of the day FRIGGIN!? Think of all the damage and not of killing innocent civilians. What about all the ambulances and fire trucks? <br /> <br /> I did not create any sympathy for the main characters, and the time that Mr. Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, I could not give less than a fart.
