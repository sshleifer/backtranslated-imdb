Who the hell is responsible for this terrible maiming of one of my favorite books? This is just terrible. terrible act, terrible script. The story is not even close to your old self - and what were they thinking? Robin Williams, for God's sake! This really defies description. I do not see that. Seriously, do not do it. Not even for laughter. Especially if you are a fan of the book. This may be the worst film adaptation of all time - everything is disjointed and scrambled - the characters who are important to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized, and all potentially interesting locations of the book have been changed (example: Vienna - New Em something profoundly uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book, it is basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up, exploring his writing, and so on. Protests) as a kind of feminist manifesto.The book is well written, engaging and long. Its prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, is about Robin Williams once again telling us to enjoy the day.
