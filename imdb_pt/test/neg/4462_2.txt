If you saw this movie for the first time with Mary of the Fourth Form, perhaps it is possible that nostalgia offers its charitable side. If not, you have no chance. The hipspeak of young things is complete nonsense, people may have used the occasional word you will hear here, but not lots of them in sentence after sentence. It does not date Dracula in 1972 as if shattering, from the moment anyone under thirty opens his mouth, it is impossible to take the film seriously and, to be a laugh, it is not even a smile. The idea of ​​playing Dracula in modern times is good and worthy of a much stronger script than Don Houghton can offer. The River Thames and Chelsea Male are no match for the puppets, castles and extras terrified, but you can not help feeling that with a better writing it would have been very different.
