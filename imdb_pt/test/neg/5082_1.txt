Frankly, I'm impressed to see that this movie is receiving relatively good reviews. I will be completely honest and I will say that the only reason I went through this is because of Ryan Phillippe, not for reasons particularly attached to his acting skills, although I think that in recent years he has proved to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990s indicated. <br /> <br /> As for action / suspense movies, this movie fails in almost every aspect. The acting is good, I think, but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense, a fact that the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to Chaos theory as if it convinces anyone that the film is really clever. '- but again, judging by other reviews, some were. Do not be fooled: the script is a boring and derivative mess and no other element in the movie makes up for it. Wesley Snipes probably never had a less interesting role in a movie, and Statham is a completely boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
