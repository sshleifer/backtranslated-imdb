Be warned, the next time you see "Richard Kelly" involved in any production, run away. Fast. Kelly proved to the world after her latest movie, "Southland Tales," that he is a pretentious director. It was indulgent and complicated. In "The Box", little has changed. <br /> <br /> I can imagine what your argument about Warner Bros might have been, and I'll bet the studio executives have consumed it: a full-length feature film. based on one of the ancient tales of Richard "Twilight Zone" Matheson. <br /> <br /> Big mistake! Do not read any more, unless you want this movie to be completely spoiled for you: Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct "experiments" in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is marked because he was hit by Alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all that red button test. Obviously, as Norma pushes the button, knowing very well that someone can die, she must suffer the consequences by not considering the life of another person instead of yours. In the end, she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of their son growing deaf and blind. <br /> <br /> Kelly dances around the "message" of her film, trying to get the audience to find out what the moral of the story is. Obviously, anyone with a brain is saying at the beginning, "What if I were the person who dies?" Richard Kelly does not even let his character have this normal, HUMAN conversation. In fact, they avoid it all together. They seem to be both educated, working in a prestigious school and also to NASA, so why would not they have a better ability to LOOK OUT OF THE BOX? <br /> <br /> If he had the main characters really have this conversation, the whole movie could have ended right there! Instead, we have to watch marriages last forever, NASA and the NSA will be complacent with Arlington Stewart assuming these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden's life beyond our world, so it will be "easier" to kill his wife and drones controlled by Steward, who can be anywhere, nowhere, at any time. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is the rhythm. Nothing really happens. It is a confused miscellany of ideas that are laughable. <br /> <br /> It's unbearable how this movie is being marketed. The commercials seem "vi" and even use the music of these films to sell it. In reality, what you get is a slow, tedious, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at acting and visual effects), and a messy movie that is neither imaginative, interesting nor cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are kidnapped and all of a sudden she is back in the big black NSA car with her husband on the way home. Where she went? Why did they take her? Do we really care? No more you will not. <br /> <br /> By the end you really will not care what happens to any of the characters. You'll be hoping that they'll all die for the movie to end. Go see anything else that is playing. Do not waste time or money.
