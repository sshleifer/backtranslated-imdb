Even those of us who like cute animal images - and I loathe them - would be hard pressed to find any merit in this horribly bad farce of a movie. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians", with their intelligent and loyal dogs, their stupid and torturous humans and their absurdly "happy" and predictable ending, comes to mind with the alternate title "101 Turkeys". This would cover everyone involved in his unfortunate production. I dismissed it as an insane Hollywood perversion of British manners before I knew, to my horror, that it is actually a Canadian film, made at Victoria BC, that fake British theme park of a city, while it was taxing Ottawa ON, equally false hole of Canadian mediocrity. Let me tell you how bad this is. The silly plot? The asinine script? The somber performances and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly intelligent animals? The endless cliches and predictable antics? On second thought, neither I nor those who browse IMDb have time for a complete catalog of their flaws. However, if I were to detail their merits, that space would be blank. Trust me, this is bad; a landmark monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have seen, my condolences. If you have not, stay away from like SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Do not let your children see that their tiny minds can be distorted by the even smaller minds of those who financed, fabricated and filmed this terrible madness. Maybe tonight, when I retire, I have a nightmare with horrible beasts of prey popping up from the bedside table as I flee on frenetic flight. I believe so. It will be a far better thing than watching this banal beastly bestial. But then, I could dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of it makes me want to stay awake all night, shaking with the possibility of seeing it again, even as a nightmare. I may even find something worth seeing in its place. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" Maybe the instructional video for my built-in vacuum cleaner.
