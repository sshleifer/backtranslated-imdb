I just saw this earlier on the Fox Channel by accident (my dog ​​woke me up) - I had seen it years ago and thought I remembered it quite well. As a kid, I had enjoyed it. But now? As another poster commented, several of the reels were out of order, and although it was disorienting at first, and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - what was horrible became surreal and fun. Musical numbers for what I think was the "big" fundraiser ("you're in show business, I'm in show business, most kids are in show business, let's do a show") come out of nowhere BEFORE all the talk about putting on a show and then disappearing without applause for totally unrelated "straight" scenes. The protagonist's girlfriend appears, spits lines and lines of dialogue and then disappears. I was half awake and I loved every insane minute of it.
