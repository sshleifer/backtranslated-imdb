one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose). Every scene that contains something to do with; aircraft, romance, script or acting is very confusing. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all riders, it's so bad that you should laugh at some point in the movie (see also Airport 79: Concorde for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Anyone else, avoid this movie like the plague (except for fans of B movies, of course) <br /> <br />
