This seventh movie (yes you read it right - the seventh) shows how the insane doll group came to be; by a French puppeteer who uses them to take revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him when they discover he holds the secret to life. He was taught to him by a sorcerer, also on the run, before he died. He used this power to give life to normal puppets. This sequel is basically absurd, sprinkled with more nonsense, like most Puppet Master sequences. Due to the PG13 rating, we did not even get any fun puppet murder. Come to think of it, there are no damn puppet murders. If there was a franchise that needed to be cut, that would be it. No more .... God, please no more ...
