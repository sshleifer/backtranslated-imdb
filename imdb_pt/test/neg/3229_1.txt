I hated the book. One guy knows a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and meanwhile, they are being chased by a killer and a monkey animal (both want the dog). Dean Koontz really can not write (I read the book on the recommendation of my sister, I should know better). When I saw this, (mostly out of a morbid curiosity) I actually found myself criticizing because of the fact that it was fake for the book, even though this is a book that is impossible to make a good movie. I figured at least if they are going to make a film adaptation of the worst book I've ever read, filmmakers can also be accurate. They turned the guy and his love interest into a virgin boy and his mother for some reason that bothered me more than anything (even though I seriously doubt to keep a guy and his girl would not have done anything better). Very simple; Bad book, bad movie, I do not see it.
