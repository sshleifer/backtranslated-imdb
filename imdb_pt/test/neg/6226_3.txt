This is a new approach to comedy. It's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke is that, by itself, is funny. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French tale, located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The film also features the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters behave as if they were in those Carry-On movies of previous years. <br /> <br /> I believe these are also jokes - to launch these actors who make no attempt to act French in any way. , to make them give way to the broad English comedy of dance halls, and let the whole mystery unfold unexplained to the public. In the humor department, this is pretty much the Algonquin Roundtable, it's not. The movie tries to be charming and quirky, and I think those features are kind of funny. Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death, maybe, but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> It's an example of personal cinema. It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the public, but remains true to its premise and its internal logic. Although all situations are unbelievable, they are logical within the film's own bizarre world. <br /> <br /> I usually like this kind of eccentric movie, but I thought that would be a step too slow, to be stupid. , tedious, and to provide very few pleasant surprises or genuine humor. Just kind of meandering in predictable and suffering ways, and wasting some wonderful talents along the way. It has to be the low point in the career of each of the top stars, who are all distinct players. I thought it was the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in that thing. <br /> <br /> So call it an interesting shortage, and pass it on as a rent, unless you have plenty of time to kill. <br /> <br />
