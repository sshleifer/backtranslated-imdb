The dominant conflict is between two great actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the horrible script. Of course, the actors lost, as the director / writer Claude Chabrol ended up forcing the main couple to follow this useless piece of diseased imagination to the letter. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the film, which miraculously gains depth and humor. As for Chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, he reaches the climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you'll wonder what pills he was taking while driving.
