Guy Pearce looks and acts like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of those bimbo guys wearing Levi's jeans and standing in front of a herd of buffalo because they realize that Buffalo also likes Levi's. In each scene, Guy Pearce seems to be saying, "Look at me, I'm so beautiful!" As a hero, your character is a total coward. In all the scenes that require courage, Pearce receives the short end of the staff. SPOILERS: However, at the end of the movie, this worm-book-worm character surpasses a bunch of baboon-like Morlocks that can run and jump along side walls (like Spider-Man). At the same time, TIME MACHINE seems to cause a nuclear explosion of some sort that erases an entire valley. Oddly enough, even though Pearce and her heartthrob Mumba are within a foot of the last Morlock who was killed; seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe watch the valley explode from the safety of their mountain. Now this is fast running !!! Jeremy Irons as the King of the Morlocks is great. He really makes the movie a lot better than it was. Mumba, the model turned actress is not very fluffy, and she does not do much acting in this film. The scenes that take place in the 1900s have no real atmosphere. Even if the dress period and the vehicles are displayed, the characters act as caricatures of how they imagine the people of 1900 would walk and talk. The original version of this movie was much better in that regard. The characters of the period were much more realistic, and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie made PAST seem like the real base of the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes in which Pearce deals with Emma's death and then fails to save her from her fate are very good. The issue of Morlocks being cannibalistic is not very well explained, and it makes no sense that they have a big dark butchery full of knives and cutlery, but they are never seen using weapons except for a dart. Also silly is the giant pit full of water and bones. Throughout the subsoil, the Morlocks are chewing on fleshy bones. So how can all these skeletons be in the hole? It seems like there are some Morlocks that Bar-B-Que their humans and eat them off the grill, and other Morlocks just like steak ?? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? As I watched the dozens of Morlocks who were gorging themselves on human flesh, it occurred to me that they should have a very advanced system of bathroom and plumbing, considering that they were casting many bones. All these problems were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce is holding Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is staring at his friend, Mandingo. Another totally annoying thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING song that is in the background. Once Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); the song LION KING never stops, and every time the natives are around, there's that African groan singer (is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) who starts crying and whining about the music of the LION KING jungle. I watched the credits at the end of the movie, and jungle music is not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably look at that. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with good effects. See it once, then forget it.
