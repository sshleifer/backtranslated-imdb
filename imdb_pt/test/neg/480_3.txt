As a fan of Bruce Campbell for almost two decades, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to see his last film on the big screen with the man himself present. Unfortunately, "Man with the Screaming Brain" was itself a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Set in Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its original Saturday night movies - "Man with the Screaming Brain" is a curious horror mix of the 1950s B movies, comedy swap of bodies, violent film of revenge and exaggerated pasteliana with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that does not make sense, well, not even "Man with the Screaming Brain." Campbell plays a CEO of a pharmaceutical company who visits Bulgaria with his ex-wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the semi-finished subway system of the former communist country. The two appear with a former KGB agent transformed into a taxi driver, and all three find their death at the hands of a gypsy and vindictive woman. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and put a part of the taxi driver's brain on Campbell's damaged skull. In addition, they put the brain of his wife into a robotic body they happen to have at hand. Campbell escapes, with a hastily restored skull and the voice of the taxi driver - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - echoing in his head, part to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) But first, there's an attempt to imitate Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin's "All of Me," when the two personalities of Campbell fight for dominance over dinner of restaurant. Just as he was playing his own evil hand in "Evil Dead II," Campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind. Sometimes "Screaming" comes close to another Steve Martin film, "The Man with Two Brains," as it also takes a foolish approach to the science fiction clich√©s of the 1950s. , he tries too hard for a very small result, and that is twice as good for semi-understandable Bulgarian Ted Raimi, who has a lot of time on the screen. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he's better off in small doses.) In the end, it's neither scandalous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a parody, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a movie pastiche B I was glad that Campbell had already left the exhibit the moment he stopped, since I feared having to say, "Gee, Bruce, that was really ... something." <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best compliment I can give as a film is that at least the images have adhered to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
