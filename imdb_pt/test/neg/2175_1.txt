This extremely boring and bland movie made me think that Chaplin was the real Hitler, since only someone as wicked as he could torture people with such nonsense. I saw this remastered film, which only made the suffering inflicted by this most serious atrocity. This film is nothing more than a pathetic and repetitive film that, instead of inducing two hours of laughter, induced two hours of suicidal impulses. After the first 10 minutes of this, I began to wish the gas would start leaking from the theater's speakers. <br /> <br /> If I could give a zero of ten, I would be happy to do so. Avoid at all costs!
