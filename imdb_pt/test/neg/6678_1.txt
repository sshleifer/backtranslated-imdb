Normally, I would not waste time reviewing a movie like "Human Pork Chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the previous film of the same title, which is probably better known in the West as "The Untold Story"), but how reviews here are already very vague about what it really consists of, I thought it better to post something more detailed, so that no one really gets tempted (like me) to buy it because of the mystical movie.I would honestly say just stay AWAY. > <br /> **** MAJOR SPOILERS are contained below **** "Human Pork Chop", I was hoping to be like a Chinese interpretation of the popular Japanese films "Guinea Pig." Anyone who has watched enough of this series he can see where his creators are coming from.There is a strong sense of humor running through him - you can not watch the ridiculous "He Never Dies" without laughing and "The Making of Guinea Pig" is a fabulous turn of the whole thing in your head , proving that it has just been done, with some the joy, by pretty good gorehounds. All of GP's films have an aesthetic of punk rock, DIY, shoot-em-video, occasional flashes of genuine art ("Mermaid in a Manhole"), an angry political agenda and a mad zeal that puts them in an O league "Human Pork Chop" has none of the above. <br /> <br /> It is shot on 35mm film (with disarmingly good production values), is 90 minutes long and is totally devoid of anything redeeming. The plot recounts in flashback in a police interview of the suspects the systematic torture, death and eventual breakup of Grace, a prostitute addicted to heroin who is kidnapped and brutalized by her pimp and her henchmen when she steals money from him. Despite his fleeting attempts to be a piece of morality, the film has an inhuman and inhuman feel, and we can not help but focus on the mentality of those behind it. Though she thinks of Grace as baseless as an innocent victim, the petty nature of her script and the constant and vicious dialogue of the protagonist leads to a "she deserves it!" point of view that makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch. Much more time is spent detailing Grace's degradation, and when her captors are eventually found guilty and imprisoned, it seems a hasty reflection on behalf of the writers who have long since ceased to care less. <br /> <br /> What makes it bother the reason why anyone would want to watch such a movie is that even the kind of person who really enjoys sex and senseless violence in the movies would be missing out on a lot. Torture is just a continuous stream of kicks, slappings, verbal abuse, psychological abuse, and then increasingly bizarre demonstration of power on behalf of the captors use Grace's heroin addiction to make her fulfill her orders. And when I say that, do not get me wrong, by any chance. Unlike "Guinea Pig", with its frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost adolescent sensation of mockery to the process, in spite of the ultraviolence, "Human Pork Chop" does not have this sexual connotation. There is no real nudity in the film and violence is carried out purely by malice by the hateful protagonists (who at the beginning of the film are seen stuffing a dog into a bag and banging against a brick wall - do not worry, it's not real, just a cheap special effect!) <br /> <br /> The only real bloodshed in the film is at the end when they dismember Grace's body and boil the bones, all very poor special effects (nor near Guinea) Pig "level "and at this stage you will probably already be feeling very miserable and sick to care even with what is happening. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing heartbreaking and uncompromising along a line similar to Buddy Giovinazzo's "Shock Combat" and I think it could even be compared in a push. Both films deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmare environment, devoid of any socially or morally redeemable characters, and both films "climax" in a particularly visceral way with the inevitable and inescapable condemnation of the individual. <br /> <br /> To be fair, neither glamourises is violence (while "Guinea Pig" could easily be accused of this), but we can not help but wonder where the place is for a movie like this. He fails on many real points in his frank presentation of such brutality and with a heavy rhythm, a virtually non-existent plot and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, I just can not understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like that. I just came to an end, purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 0 out of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
