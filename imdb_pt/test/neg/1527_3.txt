The topics presented are very interesting; suburban sprawl, suburban sprawl, public transportation, oil and gas depletion, energy dependency, alternative energy sources, etc. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a pure and shameless piece of propaganda. A point of view is presented, then hammered on the viewer over and over. You see the same handful of "experts" repeatedly doing your case. The so-called "narrator" begins to sound like a news reporter, but by the end he is even preaching the dogma of the film. <br /> <br /> The dark side of the movie is not so much the dark and damning message about oil. exhaustion, but the feeling that the people in the film are really desirous for a post-oil society and all that implies. They paint this picture of a utopian society in which we all return to the self-sufficient local village model; walk to work, shop locally, grow our own food, and generally have an idyllic nineteenth-century lifestyle. For them, the post-oil society would seem like a great vision of a better world. It would certainly mean the end of globalization and, even better, the end of Walmart. I'll give them some credit for applying real math in exposing the weaknesses of several alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 stars because I enjoyed the old footage and the premise.
