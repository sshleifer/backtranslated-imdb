I watched this at the True / False Documentary documentary festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was pretty disappointed. I was hoping for a legal documentary about the protest and activism surrounding the RNC, but what I got was a very bad, misunderstood, fictitious and conspiratorial tale. I had heard of his neo-documentary technique, "Blending True and False," but I expected more along the lines of a fictional plot developed for a better embodiment and create a sense of unity between actual interviews, but it was over the lines of a terrible TV movie about conspiracy theory. <br /> <br /> The overall performance is terrible except for Rossario, which is not surprising considering that the director on the show said that most of the main characters had no acting. his apology is that he wanted them to be real. Here is a suggestion, real people can not act, but actors can usually act for real. <br /> <br /> It would not be offensive if it were not obvious how much he was bent on forcing it. Radical conspiracy theory about us throughout the film, is especially hysterical when we have a scene in which the director appears and begins to complain about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. The film also does a good job of ridiculously stereotyping each role, it strives so much to romanticize these street activists and stamp a great 'Good' or 'Evil' on every character. <br /> <br /> Jump, maybe find a good documentary /
