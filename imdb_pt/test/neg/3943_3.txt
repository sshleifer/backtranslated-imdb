A mediocre horror movie at best dealing with stupid, not-so-excited teenagers who discover a malevolent video game (GASP) is killing those who die in the game (DOUBLE GASP). This movie is the sustained mystery of Gang Mystery in "Scooby Doo". I was hoping they'd take off a mask from one of the villains. I could handle this for 40 minutes, even as a movie about science fiction, but going to the movies, come people. The effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something of two - but director Uwe Boll, since this would be his cast. As always, the best thing about video game systems is the glorious power button. I suggest using this means of visualization. * 1/2
