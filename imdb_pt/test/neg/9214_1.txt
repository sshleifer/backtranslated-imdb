The film tells you to be conscientious and conscientious. It also destroys anything and everything, the Bible claims to be true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It has been called "blasphemy," and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people think of it as a good continuation of the Bible. However, the film shows many things and subjects, which can be interpreted as a cinematic version of the "Apocalypse". Some of us think that such things should not be abused. One good thing about the film is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice. The director seems to just forget, that some people act in this way already solely based on the fact that they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible ... Why try to change that unless you are the Devil himself?
