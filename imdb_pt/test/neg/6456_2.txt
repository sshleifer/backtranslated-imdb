There's something wonderful about a "revenge" movie. Everyone wakes up in the morning believing to be the "movie" star, and anyone who interferes with the personal agenda is somehow the enemy. Revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Instead of fighting back at the moment, the "hero" relies on built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore balance. Of course, in the "real world," this kind of revenge rarely relieves tension because life is not a movie; after revenge is decreed, the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge movie helps people ignore this bitter pill. In movies, the final credits roll and all responsibility is resolved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming with Sharks" is billed as a comedy, undoubtedly an act on the part of producers to figure out how to sell this weirdo. . It's dark, but it's not somber comedy ("Company of Men" and the works of Todd Solondz come very close). Portions of the film are so brutal that they are pre-dated from the current "torture-porn" genre that everyone is so obsessed with ("Saw", "Hostel"). There are some laughs. There's laughter in "Private Ryan's Rescue" too, but it's not labeled comedy. <br /> <br /> The intrinsic problem of this movie is that it has not won its revenge case. It is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to "pay him back" for all the ill-treatment. The hero (aptly named "Guy") is an "ordinary man" so vague that we know literally nothing about him ... what does he do with his free time? Does he have friends / family? How did he get where he is? What are your interests (this becomes a race motive through the film, no doubt inspired by the filmmaker's own struggle ... "What do you want?", The answer to which we are denied by a wave, Last) ? It's very difficult to take care of such a character, even if he acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes an idiot on the wrong list, like "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey as the boss, "Buddy", is supposed to be a monster, but he is too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant - he seemed almost as surprised as the audience is probably what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, the sight taken suddenly becomes empathetic to him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a malicious monster without rationality. At this point, any message that the author has lost has been lost; there is no "hero" in this movie, ergo, there is no reason to care. <br /> <br /> It is no exaggeration to suppose that this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. I've worked for a similar boss and I can assure you it's not so absurd. I had fantasies of satisfying similar desires at that time and I thought I was justified. I thought you could conquer the most beautiful woman in history (actually, the ONLY woman - there seems to be only about four people in the universe of this movie) just for being her na√Øve, eager ego, who won compliments and that a boss abused you because he was a bad person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based on self. As the movie points out, if Guy was so unhappy, he just had to leave. The film does not offer any end, despite the end of the "surprise." We still do not know anything about the protagonists, we can not even be sure that anything they said was based on fact and they all magically manage to have their cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) The movie business can be quite brutal. <br /> <br /> There are many good movies that tell a solid and satisfying revenge. style fantasies, both the feel-good variety ("9-to5", "Working Girl", and not so much ("War Of The Roses" remake of "The Hills Have Eyes") . This is not one of them - despite a fun twist of Benicio Del Toro as Emily Blunt of "Prada" and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, petty, confusing and slightly monotonous creation of itself. - indulgence of a director who, it is hoped, "worked everything" so far ...
