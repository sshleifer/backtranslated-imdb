George Sluizer of THE VANISHING FAME (He made both the astonishing European original and the remake of Hollywood) directed CRIMETIME. He should not really be guilty of this poor and confusing film because all the problems are in the screenplay of Brendan Somers. It is poorly focused and lazily written. For example, the killer sits around a nightclub waiting to catch a victim, any victim and starts talking to a teenager. Cut to the next scene, where she tells the villain "I told you all about me, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately, the girl told the story of her life off-screen and it is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue. I really know how difficult this is, but for a script that is produced, the writer should have tried harder. <br /> <br /> It's hard to explain the message of the movie. At times, it seems like he's trying to be a native British hunting killer by stigmatizing media voyeurism with crime (perhaps even influenced the infamous MANHUNT video game), but the script is not witty enough to take that forward. When you have a sex scene that does not progress in the plot or characters or subtext clues you know you have a poorly written script and CRIMETIME is a poorly written screenplay
