Now you can really call it a movie. Did I know that some of the movies the Japanese do are good for anything but bad? I mean, I slept three times in this movie. No horror, some minuscule percentage (0.2-0.5) of comedy. Action let's just admit that there are some, but the scenes are badly filmed, the actors are pathetic. None of the actors did a good job in their own role. The ones were not convincing. The script is awful, too. I mean this movie can be great, REALLY, but for the 60's (in not 100% sure.) I recommend not seeing it unless you want to get as bored as I did. I can not understand that this movie has its rating. IT'S OVER, OVER, OVER CLASSIFIED !!! This is a PERSONAL opinion, of course. I do not want to offend anyone, but who could like this crap? So I hope this helps someone not to waste time "enjoying" this movie. However, the choice is yours!
