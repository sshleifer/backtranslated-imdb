The movie is fine. Which means I do not regret watching! I found the acting purely and most of the stupid dialogue ("oh no, that was my grandmother's bible!"). It's kind of a bad U-turn remake. A man arrives in a deserted city nowhere, meets wrong people, and falls in love with the wrong woman. And off because you are involved in something, he thought he could leave behind. The film is quite predictable and there's really nothing new about it. When it's over, you did not care. Most of the characters are stereotypes, especially Brian Austin Green !! All added up just another movie from the states, but quite entertaining on Wednesday night boring. Mobile International Sites: IMDb Germany |
