When my own son is begging me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to tear my eyes out. I wanted to get across the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last bit of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies of my life that I watched and immediately wished "unwatch" if it were possible. The other films are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than this crap on the hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget that I have already witnessed this blasphemy in the good name of Seuss. <br /> <br /> For Mike Myers, I say stay with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a hit for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
