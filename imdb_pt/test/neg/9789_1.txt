This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I think you could take that from the title. In addition, there is a particular love scene that may be the strangest in movie history. I can not even remember why I saw this movie or when. This alone is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you're looking for the weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then, by all means, rent it. Good luck in finding it at your local store though. I doubt this movie is in a very wide distribution. And please do not show this to children by any means, as this can distort their impressionable minds forever.
