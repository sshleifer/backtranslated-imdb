This movie is hilarious, what's better than seeing two battling creatures? Gigantic versions of these beasts cgi battling! However, I need one of the weapons used in the movie. Because apparently they are using tricks. Count the amount of shots they use before having to ... oh wait that's for sure they never have to recharge. Regardless of the photos ... it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the film for the Komodo range from a tiger to an elephant. Oh, and I forgot to mention that apparently these giant Komodo dragons are sneaky like hell? Because somehow, even when the actors are looking in the direction that the beast comes from, they are surprised when it appears. <br /> <br /> Whenever someone dies, you can say your coming, because everyone prepares for it, they put their arms in the air and cross them to save themselves ... this never works. <br /> <br /> The ultimate jewel is that these writers' brains are just a gland full of knowledge. With "facts" such as these two creatures being amphibious for comments like "helpless animals," they are just full of fun facts.
