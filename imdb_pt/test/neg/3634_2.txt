I've seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them I've been forced to watch. And I did not like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving us incredible shows like Drake and Josh, why did he decide to create such a stupid show? My problem is not just with Dan, it's also with the guys who nominated this show for an Emmy, they were drunk that day, or what's the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for an Emmy, but it's way better than Zoey 101. The creators of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this show, let's hope that your pregnancy knows who will affect the show, or better yet, it will be canceled .
