Horrible Horrible Movie, I still can not believe my friend convinced me to see this! No plot, bad acting, dull scenes and very stupid dialogues. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and it's worse than Halloween III that I gave the stars too. So I give 0 stars and 0 of 10, well here's a 1, but you get the point.
