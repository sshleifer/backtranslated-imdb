Have you ever heard of cloning redundancy theory, where a copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of this. They have tried to duplicate everything since the first movie. Now, in some cases, this work. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight when they play essentially the same character. I really like Randy Quaid, who is not more or less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not a Rodney Dangerfield, and worst of all, C2 has shown once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. There is very little I like him, and C2 nailed the coffin closed in his "comedy" career as far as I'm concerned. He seems to feel the same, clinging more to tuffy like Driving Miss Daisy and hosting Psi-Factor. Also, most of the time, "been there, done that" for Caddyshack 2. Watch the original twice, instead of each version, and you get more for your rented money.
