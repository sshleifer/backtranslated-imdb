Wow, um, that was kind of a movie, as they say, different. It's called a comedy ... but it was not really very loud out loud. It was crazy. If you are willing to accept that 3 people survive a calamity of global scale, why not 4? or 5 ' ..... and why all of a sudden ended up with nothing happening ?? They could have done this much better simply by having another element in the plot, such as a grumpy female for the ugly guy or something ....... Zinc, ridiculous ... ahh <br /> < > I do not know ... watch ... it was not that bad ..... kind of funny at times ... I think ... schneider
