From what I understand, Fox was ashamed to have released a PG-13 Alien / Predator movie not long ago. It was not well received by any means. <br /> <br /> I do not know exactly where to go, since they thought Anderson was the best director of the franchise and they had produced a true science fiction gem, Fox turned to him is a small but experienced group of monkeys for answers. These monkeys were not veterans of writing sci-fi films, but they had seen the remake of Burton's Planet of the Apes and the House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Your first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget, but the monkeys wanted to save money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they could write the film themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of big new lines for the general public to remember years later - this was more difficult. They hit head for a while and created a truly award-winning script, outfitted with clich√©d characters, foolish decisions and a big gap. <br /> <br /> Fox was pleased with the results, but wanted to see what would become. of the central parts of the film - the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money on the budget, so they decided to end the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible original AvP, and follow with the man-in-Alien costume seen in the old movies. The actors who played the aliens had difficulty fitting into the costumes because they were not properly sized by the monkeys, so they waved their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for predators, the monkeys decided that a predator was enough this time (again, economizing budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly came out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> But what about the effects, you ask? Come now, people. They may be monkeys, but they clearly knew that CGI would play a key role in the film. Without dipping, monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and sparking effects. Placing red and green filters on the camera lens provided some excellent views of Predator. <br /> <br /> The scenery was something that the monkeys thought a lot. If that were on Earth, in Colorado, everywhere, they needed to make it realistic. That's when they admitted that they could have made a mistake. You see, the monkeys did not have proper training in this department so they thought about turning out the lights in the city and having the movie play in the dead of night and the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot that people like to see the creatures instead of looking at the shadows and raining the whole movie. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fighting scenes incredibly close so that no one could see what they were fighting or who they were. But again, rookie error. <br /> <br /> The classification. Fox told the monkeys to make the film censored. That was easy. Without showing how many of the wounds or deaths actually happened, the monkeys created the habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: viewers got the blood they wanted and the monkeys did not have to shoot most of the action scenes involving that violence. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors originally had doubts about the script. Why does a blue liquid, the Predator, have infinite amounts of magically disintegrating all that it wants and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving a police car throughout the movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full-length photo of the aliens? Why does a watch play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions continued to grow, but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Fox was thrilled with their work. So excited that they opened the film across the country on Christmas day and even spent a few dollars advertising the week before. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these estimated franchises. <br /> <br /> But some ask: What happened to the budget that the monkeys forgot to use? They put in their next film: Aliens Vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew that the general public would be upset about the title, but since then they have released this statement: "For people - do not worry about our next movie. violence". "<br /> <br /> And everyone lived happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The end.
