There is not much to say about this except that it is probably the worst of the first zombie movies (I can watch another, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month is over). To the intention of all the stars of John Carradine to build an army in the service of the Third Reich, they are not seen doing much! James Baskett (Uncle Remus of SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) Performs his leader, who also serves as Carradine's servant. Black comedian Mantan Moreland reprises his role as driver of KING OF THE ZOMBIES's "fragile cat" (1941), as well as the exotically named Madame Sul-Te-Wan as Carradine's maid. Unfortunately for Carradine, his supreme achievement? the buzzing of his wife? brings her all sorts of problems: her relatives not only appear in her remote home to investigate her sudden death (which means he has to fake a funeral!), but she really is disobedient and outraged, eventually "persuading." your fellow zombies rise up against their master !! Also involved is cowboy superstar Bob Steele (even better known for his role in Howard Hawks' [1946] THE GREAT SLEEP [1946]), who plays a secret US agent posing as a Nazi posing as a sheriff! Fortunately, director Sekely would have been much luckier with his next genre, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (1962).
