I watched this months ago on Netflix Instant and left a comment there. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, most other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad direction. I also liked Russell and Stop "in the old days" and was very hopeful for them. In my review of Netflix, I mentioned that I lost interest in the movie and started doing the dishes and making a sandwich, but still watching the movie in the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused when the last 5 minutes of the movie unfolded. I even rewound it to make sure I was not missing anything. This movie totally crapped out of how to make a final "twist". I suspect the idea sounds good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that it lacked sets. And yes, I suppose all those "bad sets" were an effort to give the viewer a clue. All he told me was "low budget". <br /> <br /> Anyway, the reason I came here was because over the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island, and with what the reviewers were saying, or not saying, take me to believe that Shutter Island is the same deal, only with a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually I have no idea how much Dark World cost, but I HOPE they did not spend more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> So, that being said, I kind of thought that if someone reworked the bit script, has a bigger budget for a better "look" (if that meant a better scenic designer, or better post coloring, just someone with a vision), they could redo Dark World into an acceptable product. Now it looks like Shutter Island is doing it. It looks like they got the right view, but the script may still be wrong. Money can not buy everything, but it should in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2 star rating is for Russell and Stop.
