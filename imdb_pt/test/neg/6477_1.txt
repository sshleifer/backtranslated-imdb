I think there are two ways to make a movie with kids as a target audience. You can tell yourself a) "Let's make a movie that kids today will love!" or b) "Let's make a movie that I would have loved as a kid!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that appeal to a younger audience. The main examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. This cat Darn is an example of the first approach. You see these characters flat and unbelievable saying things that should be funny, but they are not. The plot itself is sufficient for a short ten minutes, but instead continues. And although I'm not a kid, I do not quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for the kids? The clumsy cops chased by a dog, the old lady with a timid bird, or Christina Ricci's sarcastic sarin? One actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug playing the FBI agent.
