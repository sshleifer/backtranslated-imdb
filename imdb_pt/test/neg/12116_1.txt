It shows that in half the time it is indicated for nominations, comic relief, chat shows, quiz shows, game shows, charity shows, Brighton. When you're done and you think you can find salvation on the wireless network, the tremendous noise of good old JR Hits you like a freight train going from Texas to downtown NY that has lost an hour and is trying to recover. <br /> <br /> About this show (FNWJR). <br /> <br /> It's a normal chat format with JR. As host and a house band that has more than four gays (ha ha ha, ow my sore sides.) And the first season had Andy Davis but he left or was fired to make room for the Ross Ego. <br /> <br /> Ross will use less of his guests as props and you will not really hear them speak because of his "It's my ball and I take it home" attitude, you also see that the larger the guest, the more he is willing to lie and suck at them, get in with the big boys (like the weak boy) However, when a small TV star appears, he will cheerfully humiliate them, ask personal questions about the past and tell about their lack of stories Sometimes he underestimates the popularity of a guest, says something to downplay him and then when the audience is shocked, he quickly transforms and starts to become the hick, the best example of this is when " Life On Mars "star John Simm came and he said how someone how do you get the job, your look OK, but not good-looking Hollywood (Bare in mind the Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry was in the green room, he was really just trying to suck them they were right on the couch). When the crowd acted in shock, Ross quickly said, "What, I'm a little lighter in wearing that corset, I do not know what I'm saying." If he has no low life on TV, he'll just enjoy the four gay men on the piano with more outdated jokes than his fashion. <br /> <br /> It's a very different story. when a Hollywood star or a big TV star appears on the show, he will tell stories for them to enjoy. When some actor explains that he was in a support band, then Jonathon Ross will say something like "Wow, well, he's always going to see a band that I try to seem interested in by the support band, to make them feel they're wanted" with an underlined message being "Please, like me, I was probably one of the people who cheered when you were in your band." Plus, with an audience of Ross fans so hooked on all the jokes and bad bulls, it really makes a bad show. <br /> <br /> You better watch the chat shows in the US, they are more scripted, but not anywhere near so difficult to watch.
