As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years, I found this movie very difficult to watch. Very unreal. It seems that the producers of this film have done little or no research or simply did not care. Card tricks are something you would never see in a real poker game. Common sense right? Plus, it was full of movie cuts and such during the tricks. Who could not do that? The cheating was amateurish. Palmar, marked cards, etc. Would you sit in a high limit game where they would use open playing cards? Would you sit in a game where the players pushed their chips in the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them and just verbalizing what they bet? COME ON ! I gave it a 4 because the twists and turns may be interesting for some people, but for those who know how to play the game, it will be very painful. Next time, they should use real players and get some tips on how to do it the right way. OUCH !!!
