The only good thing about this movie is the work of art on the promotion poster by H. R. Geiger. Anti-nuke protesters, all looking like punk-rockers in the late 1970s, and somehow became non-violent (with the exception of their leader, "Splatter") occupy cities. Fraternity boys come down on the punks to do some violence on them and turn them into victims. Bad acting and bad plot then descends on the actual victim, you, the viewer. I gave a "2" because some sexual scenes at least give the MST3K potential. <br /> <br />
