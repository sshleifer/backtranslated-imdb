I saw this movie when it came out. Let me see now - this guy who had previously skied Mount Fuji manages to accumulate funding and hire staff to document what sounds on the surface as a bold and daring act - to ski on the highest peak in the world. Well - AND HERE COMES THE SPOILER - what happens, see, after a great team of people can help you get close to the top - and a life is lost in the business - he takes his skis, manages to do it well short, at the point where the PLATFORM OPENS ... and that's it. And instead of recording the images to hide this incredibly anticclimatic end to an embarrassing disaster, the guy goes ahead and releases. SPOILER INTERVIEWS I admire the incredible courage and effort that must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning photos they had. OTHER SPOILER: Ah, yes, one of the Sherpas is killed by falling into a crack. The narrator, who is quoting the "reckless skater, casually observes that, according to the Sherpa religion, since this man's body can not be recovered, his soul wanders the world forever and never knows how to rest. tells the narrator. he answers - because it served the purpose of letting that clown "ski on Everest." I do not remember seeing a piece of celluloid more meritorious. This is one to miss at all costs.
