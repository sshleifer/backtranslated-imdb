Firstly, I'm surprised to see that this movie has a rating of 7 on this site. At first I thought it might be the industry staff accessing the IMDb and increasing the rating. but after looking at the rotten tomatoes and seeing that this movie has something like a 76% approval rating, it seems that maybe people have been fooled again to confuse pretentious crap because of depth. I mean, this movie is just awful. the acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some (unintentional) laughter. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a teenage skateboarding boy being interrogated along with his friends for a murder that happened in a park where they skate. and that's about it. the rest of the film consists of terrible acting, terrible dialogue, slow movements of people walking, faces of people, people skating, often adjusted to songs that do not fit the scene. maybe it was meant to be "cool" or experimental or hip. or maybe it was done hoping to fool people into thinking it's something deep, but it does not work. nothing in this movie works. it's pretentious junk. I can not recommend it enough.
