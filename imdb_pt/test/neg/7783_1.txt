I could not wait for the end. This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. If you thought that practically anyone could make an assistive movie, these people prove there is a minimum set of skills needed. This is a movie without redeeming features. Score a zero in each department. This is more than just "amateur," as the audience receives no consideration or consideration. There is no serious attempt to act or entertain. The plot is aimless, meaningless and meaningless. The cast looks very uncomfortable and completely lacking in direction. The technical aspects of the film are poor. <br /> <br /> Like a DVD, it's a good drink holder.
