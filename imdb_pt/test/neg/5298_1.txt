Travolta and Thurman deserved a better movie. This is very minor in every way, not a unique idea. But the biggest problem is the film's ridiculous philosophy. A gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people is becoming almost like Mickey Mouse heroes on stage and giving awards at the ceremony. Maybe that matches real life. But showing this as a fairly normal "happy ending" is beyond my imagination. "What's wrong with firing on some bad Ukrainians if they're not politically correct?" - The show has to continue! This makes me think that Hollywood writers have a big problem in separating good and evil, even if the genre is a "black comedy."
