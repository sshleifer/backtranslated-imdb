This movie has an incredible cast. MGM took some of its best actors and starred in a movie with the normally lovely Margaret O'Brien. Lionel Barrymore, Edward Arnold and Lewis Stone star as three greedy bachelors living in the same house. While they have amassed a fortune over the years, they have also been selfish idiots. One of them has the idea of ​​donating some property to buy a good name (like the Carnegie), but the property they want to donate belongs to O'Brien. And because she is an orphan, they volunteer to be their guardians, so they can give their property and look like great philanthropists. <br /> <br /> There is also a goofy sub-plot involving fairies - led by the wonderful character actor. Henry Davenport. And, as O'Brien is Irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little people make up much of the plot. Frankly, I hated that part of the movie and wished they'd just dropped it. Instead, the story might still have been about sweet Margaret melting the hearts of the middle-aged men - this would have worked. But ... the "little people"?!? Sheesh! On the whole, the actors try very, very hard, but the foolishness of the plot and the deadly sincere way they tried made me shudder. I noticed that a lot of people liked this movie - I think I'm just a grumpy old man! I found the movie horrible hard to watch.
