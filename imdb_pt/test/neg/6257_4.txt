"Based on a joke told by Jim Wynorski" ... that's what I read at the end of the final credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski has to have a horrible sense of humor! This movie is really terrible. I loved the first two chapters of The Massacre Slumber Party series; the third movie was completely useless, but completely watchable, compared to this piece of crap! There is not even a Driller Killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the places, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and laughable. The only good reason to watch this turkey is the girls: if this movie was a porn, I think it would have worked much better! The movie also has no blood: the first scene (the one in the tent) can be more bloody and the scene with the headless guy knocking on the door lasted a second! Some moments of light emotion can not save a nonexistent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only bearable character in this movie! Oh ... there's an absurd part with Brinke Stevens, who sang "Linda" in the first Slumber Party Massacre: police bother her to find out more about the killer; but what we have is just a few images from the first movie! Not a dialogue, not a monologue, or anything of that girl still traumatized, who is forced to relive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), giving us no clue about the killer! <Br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
