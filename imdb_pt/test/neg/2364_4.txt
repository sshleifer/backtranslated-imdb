A young girl dubbed "T.N.T." for being a virtual dynamite in a fight and a knockout in terms of appearance, goes to the lawless part of Hong Kong in search of his missing brother Stag Jackson. When she finds out he was murdered, she decides she will take the murderer to justice in a way that only she can. Sounds good, does not it? Well, there's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as the initial basis for a martial arts action thriller / blaxploitation, which is what this wants to be. The leads really turned out pretty good too with Jeanne Bell fitting into the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw doing well as the ambitious and hungry Charlie. Where this fails miserably is in terms of the combat action it offers. The fighting scenes are totally and utterly unconvincing and / or sometimes so completely over the top that it gets to the point of ridicule that does not help at all when the basic focus of your movie is a Kung Fu action heroine. Also poor lighting, actors with accents that make comprehension difficult, confusing camera work and sometimes poor sound do not help the obvious low-budget effort. This does happen in an area that can charm some fans, but offers a lot of T's in "T & A", in fact virtually every fight scene in the movie is followed by some kind of nude scene and Jeanne Bell actually has a scene of extensive fighting in which she is completely topless. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is not something you want to revisit, because the fight scenes are so pathetic, laughing, bad.
