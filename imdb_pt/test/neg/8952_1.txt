This TV show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on TV today. Obscenely predictable and obscene use of slow-motion photography, stories full of stories. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never have been allowed to film in anything. The way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. His acting is so bad it makes a person shrink from shame. I'll give some credit to the show, but sometimes it's fun, but not enough to make a difference. With all the negative points that this series has, I still prefer the reality show, which can not be more useless than that.
