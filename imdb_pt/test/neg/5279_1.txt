Low budget "movies" like this just give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter. In other words, if there are people out there who are willing to fund such a play, then surely there is much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like me who can actually write stories. This movie is up there, or should I say "down there" with Ed Wood's in the world. History, if you can call it that, and dialogue, not to mention sophomoric acting, is a farce for the genre itself. Someone should have invested a stake in that stench while it was still on paper. It follows that since the literature has been practically dead, this film must follow. To have a good or even passable film, you must have at least a good decent writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak comes to mind. They have used many of their stories for low-budget movies since when, but they still leave today as good and serious entertainment, namely, "Donavan's Brain." The cast for this "job" should seriously consider returning to work in their respective snack bars or shoe stores and forgetting any fragile attempt to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this like the plague itself !!!
