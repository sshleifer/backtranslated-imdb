Bone Snatcher is about a group of miners who go in search of a vanished crew of miners in the Namib Desert. When they are found, they are nothing more than bones stripped and could not have been dead for more than six hours. The story keeps you interested in what exactly caused it. The characters are well enough, and the acting is very good. About an hour and ten minutes, when you figure out what's making the bones clean, you sigh "oh, that's really stupid." The movie is ruined by bad writing and an end not exciting. Until that moment, the movie was very good, and it's a shame that it has had such a bad change. So I can not recommend this movie. I gave it a 4/10.
