My roommate and I have another friend who works on a local Blockbuster video. He finds really horrible movies for us and tells us about them. One was a "Christmas Horror" movie starring former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg as the killer Satna Claus. We did not watch right away, but we did not think there could be anything worse. Apparently, we were wrong. We were shown this slasher movie "starring" Ken Shamrock against a murderous scarecrow. At first, we thought Ken would actually be the terrifying killer, and that's why we wanted to watch, but he was not, and that made the movie even worse. What absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama. If you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape your head, NEVER NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE.
