This movie is so bad that it's hilarious. I watched Hell Ride sort of think it was a comedy though I could not figure out if they were actually taking the p * ss, or if this really was a serious attempt to do something decent. I realize it's not listed here as a comedy, so they must be serious! Basically, it seems like a gang of retirees riding motorcycles shooting at each other and trading the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each other's heads, then showing each other the 'get out of prison' cards they made! Also check out Vinnie Jones' accent, where the heck should he be?!? Oh, and there's a load of naked girls too, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than not letting anyone have sex with these leather critters! The guy who wrote and directed - a Pee Wee Herman resembling a Greeshan 2000 beard and a tan orange - for some reason put himself in the lead role, maybe that's part of the joke, I do not know. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure that this movie is a p * ss. It is produced by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible that he has thrown it into humor as a sort of laugh. It's a total rip-off of Tarantino's style, but he's done a lot of harm. It's a lot of fun, and I think, anyway, it can be a cult classic either because it's a fun parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style, or something that's very, very unintentionally funny. It has to be seen to be believed.
