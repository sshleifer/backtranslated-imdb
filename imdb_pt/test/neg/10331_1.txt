Noted only as the acting debut of future Hollywood star Sandra Bullock, this ridiculous action movie is so full of holes that it is easy to suspect termite infestation. The plot is incomprehensible and very badly thought. The production values ​​smell like cheese. In fact, a total LACK of production values ​​would have been better ... at least the movie could have looked more glaring like that. The ADR is ridiculously bad and omnipresent in the movie. It is debatable if any of the actual footage dialogs were used. <br /> <br /> Presentations are for the most part horrible, although there are some exceptions. In these exceptions, however, performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors wrong direction and causing them to act completely out of character at times. (ie, characters ranging from passive to panic in the blink of an eye.) In addition, the constant "gun effects" (magazines being loaded, slides being cocked, etc.) are completely used in too much, and more often, totally out of sync with the onscreen actions. Add to that the vocal distortion "Bad Guy" for the leading villain (especially to let you know he's the villain in this incomprehensible movie mess), and you have a recipe for disaster. <br /> <br /> The situations in the film go beyond the "suspension of disbelief" and become frankly laughable. A main character spends a good deal of the film tied to a chair before deciding to use the butterfly knife stuck in the stocking to break free. So, my questions are ... why did not he do it sooner, and why does he still have the butterfly knife? It was not searched? RIGHT. This is one of the hundred examples of completely ridiculous situations that have somehow been filled in this 90 minute pack. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad TV movie on TV. 'If it were not for Sandra Bullock's subsequent success, it would NEVER have come to the DVD. But it does, so my only advice is to stay away. Watching this movie can hurt your IQ.
