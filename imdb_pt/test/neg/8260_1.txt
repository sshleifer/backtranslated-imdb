OK,. so I went into this loving RuPaul. I still love him / her, but I think a little less. This is a rough movie that shows a lot of male genitalia. This is a parody of the 1970s black-and-white films and is intentionally ill-made. The only fun part about it for me is that all the voices were connected with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. This is about the top, non stop, laughing your back is so stupid, badly made movie. I would never watch it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There is no rating on this, but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul did a much better job.
