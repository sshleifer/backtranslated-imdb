Terence Stamp can carry anything, but this is still a one-dimensional surface film. It's cool to see - just like the actors - and if you like drag queens, I think you might like it a lot, but the plot and the characters are as thin as cardboard. It's one of those politically correct films that distorts everything else to make a "minority lifestyle" look warm and cute. It stays way out of the dialogue, which is fun in that hygienic way, I guess. <br /> <br /> Ninety percent of the action is parading in garish costumes in incongruous situations. Dramatic content is a symbolic attachment - they hardly try to take you seriously.
