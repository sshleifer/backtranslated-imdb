... But definitely still only deserves 4/10 stars and not more. An idiot father is a fighter pilot who is shot down by some Arab country. They never name the country in the film, it's really ridiculous, they vaguely refer to some Arab nation, this movie is really ignorant like that. But Lamar of Revenge of the Nerds is here, he is friends with the main character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives on an Air Force base, his father is an Air Force pilot, but he does not enter the Air Force academy, devises a plot (with the help of his retarded friends) to steal two jets and go rescue your father. Yes, exactly - this is one of the greatest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can tell he basically wanted to whack Doug Masters the whole movie. Well, anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can not believe they did 3 sequences for this movie.
