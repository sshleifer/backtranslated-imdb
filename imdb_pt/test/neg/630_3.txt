I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) weeks of college in Barcelona. The premise is right - a confused and disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused and disorderly young individuals. But the director's weak remarks about symbolism, philosophy, and social commentary were completely inaccurate, and this leaves us, the public, feeling confused and untidy. Angry. <br /> <br /> Maybe if this movie had been presented as a European film of "American Pie" then I would be able to turn my brain off and go for the ride. But straight away, the director awakens our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of distorted roads and the dichotomy of the "inner self" versus the "public self" (the "mother tongue" versus one's "secondary tongue.") . In addition, he plunges boldly into the theme of racial / national stereotypes. For an interesting start, eh? WRONG. That's as far as it goes. These interesting topics are scarcely mentioned again, except for the epilogue-type planned end, which seemed to be the director's hesitation in returning to the subject. This reminded me of a meandering speech that leads to nothing, but the speaker ends by saying, "So in conclusion, I hope you see how this relates to my original thinking!" <br /> <br /> In addition, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab in stereotypes betrays itself. If the goal is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce a cockney-talking English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a Neanderthal (literally banging on his chest and making monkey noises at some point), while Europeans tolerate him arrogantly? Why is it that the British girl sinks into insults (calling the French "frogs" and massacring the French language) while everyone is above all this? The answer is that this is not a deep movie or well thought out. It is simply a replica of an Anglopho for Anglophiles. But it really is not different from the prejudice you want to ridicule! Now there's a funny irony to consider. Okay, philosophy, art, and socio-political comments aside, I was still very bored with this movie. There's a very funny joke that involves cheating on one of the girls' boyfriends, but besides, I barely entertained myself. The only reason I watched until the end is that I would like to update my French and Spanish. (You see, we monolingual Americans can be stupid, but we try.)
