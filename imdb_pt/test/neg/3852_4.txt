The only reason anyone would want to see this movie would be because of John Leguizamo. I remember the previews, and it seemed to be another second-rate comedy. But the fact that Mr. Leguizamo starred tried to rescue him. His name, as it was known at the time or not, tried to sell it. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed with Leguizamo's performance. His days in "House of Buggin '" (a clone "In Living Color") were his tip. There is a fine line between madness and idiocy, and let's just say that Leguizamo crossed it ten times. He seemed to be trying to be outrageous and crazy for the camera. In fact, I'll say he tried too hard. Crazy humor overflowed into stupidity, and the movie was spoiled. I can not say that I blamed you, if you had that opportunity, you would try as much as you would, right? His eagerness cost him dearly though Mr. Leguizamo ... The Pest follows the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the "racing letter," and more. No group is left to be ridiculed. Blacks, Latinos, whites, Jews, Koreans, Germans, homosexuals and the blind are among those chosen. Again here, things get very overloaded, and a lot tries to be falsified in a short time. The resolution of the film takes five minutes to clarify and return to normal. <br /> <br /> When you have a movie, and you will ignore plot and reality because of comedy, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of meaningless movie. That would sum up the "Pest" of Leguizamo very well ...
