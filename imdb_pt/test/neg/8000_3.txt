Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of several "Ninja" movies produced by Cannon starring or co-starring the Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the star of the first movie "Ninja" was the legendary tough Franco Nero. Unfortunately, not even Mr. Nero or Sho Kosugi could not make this film viewable. When you have two bad guys in an action movie and it's not watchable or entertaining, something is wrong. But I digress. Skip this chapter and watch the next movies in the series. They are more interesting and very fun. <br /> <br /> Then Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing the "oriental evil" (I use that tongue tongue in the cheek mind of you). He is the star! Strange about a western movie. Watch instead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except fans of Sho Kosugi or Cannon.
