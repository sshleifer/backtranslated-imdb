Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me puke physically !! <br /> <br /> It was a horrible movie, although the story was similar to the plot of the games. the whole thing of the superhuman soldiers. Unlike what Jack Carver, an all-American man in the game, is played by a germ, unless that's some kind of distorted irony, that's what made me pull the middle finger to the screen of my TV the second started. The fact that you can say that it is filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed to be the middle of the summer, this is unnecessary because the game is set in the rainforest, while it seems that the director just looked out the window. in the morning and it was "this is a good forest". <br /> <br /> THIS IS A NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: If you plan to make a movie based on a game / book, understand and ask the fans about Do not just play for an hour and assume you know it !! !
