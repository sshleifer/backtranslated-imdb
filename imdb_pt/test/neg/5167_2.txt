It was like watching a movie trailer on the rise, except there was no movie coming. The film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished to the point of being almost laughable. The subject of this film is over a very short period of time and, frankly, nothing really happens in the odd 90 minutes of screen time. I was waiting for the definitive Aussie movie about our soldiers in World War II and how they fought incredible odds in terrible conditions. This certainly is not. <br /> <br /> That said, the acting was great and authentic venues. This could easily have been a great film given much more time and money, instead it is not even mediocre and I can not recommend it at all.
