I've been watching movies from last year, and I must say I've never felt so bad, what I felt after watching this extra large movie, it was bad, really bad. There were songs and songs. No one should watch this movie. The director showed the Germans who speak English, which is silly. The Germans do not speak English. and in one scene there was a white girl who asked for autographs from Himesh. (Obv he must have given some money to her) At the promo they showed up getting ready for the riot to laugh. But I could tell that there was only one scene where Himesh was laughing for no reason, because he thinks it's funny. Hansika is very good. She's like an angel. But very young only 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and do not know what to do then you should watch this movie or else your wasted money
