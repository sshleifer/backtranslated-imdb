I'm aware there are some fans who might like this movie. I am aware that the idea of ​​"seeking God" may seem interesting to some, but to me, however, it is really boring. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply boring. When it gets a little interesting, it gets stupid. Come on ... Kirk fights god and wins? How low can we get? The only good part in the movie is the camp scene in the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but after that, the movie becomes boring, annoying, with nothing but good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk hit him).
