There is nothing I hate more in a movie than pretense, and this is one of the most pretentious movies ever made. It's the obvious self-consciousness in every picture: "See what deep, sophisticated film we're doing," the director and the writers seem to be saying to us, and to themselves they say, "Let's see how we can boredom and confuse the audience even more." I'd rather watch the worst of Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer than something like that. At least they gave us honest trash, and at least their movies, atrociously, were fun. This film is as fun as a root canal without anesthesia and therefore is tantamount to torture. <br /> <br /> Have these writers ever heard the word 'story'? It does not look that way. They have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to put together an excellent cast and extract good performances from them. And for what? Bored us for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, and this lasts only two minutes, occurs when one of the owners about to be evicted begins to shoot the state officials who come to tell him that he has to leave. But nothing comes of it. Too bad he did not keep filming until he got to the writers. The only redeeming features of this film are the acting scene and some beautifully photographed scenes to the end. 3/10
