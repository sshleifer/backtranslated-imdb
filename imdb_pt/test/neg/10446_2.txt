Hey, what a great idea to open a movie - show someone's home movie. Theater schools must be full of idiots! There they are taking drama classes in hopes of becoming the next big thing in Hollywood when all you have to do is send a home movie to a studio. Hey, I think I'll send the video of my wedding and call it THE GREATEST ROMANCE ALREADY SEEN or send a tape of my honeymoon and call it THE GREATEST SEX WE'VE SEEN. Oh, wait, I'm not married and I've never been on a honeymoon! Do not worry, I'll send you somebody's wedding video / honeymoon !!!!! SOFT SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think that with an opening like that, SHARK HUNTER could only improve you, right? As shocking as it may sound, the home movie is the best-directed, best-written and best-played part of the film, but it's all downhill from here as the family goes into the sea (in fact, a pool- three. Yacht on foot where Mom and Dad are eaten by a CGI fin and their son Spencer vows revenge against the fin. Moving on to the present day and the French are using an underwater research base for oil exploration. The only thing is - and it's so obvious you can not miss it - it's not filmed underwater! , the director made no attempt to use the unconvincing technique of filming the scene through an aquarium. The underwater research base is blown up by the shark (maybe hired by Greenpeace?) Killing everyone in and Spencer now an adult man is hired to hunt down the shark that killed his parents and a bunch of Frenchmen. What else happens? I have no idea why I decided to watch something else. <br /> <br /> There is no grudge if some cast and crew are reading this and I hope Matt Codd will become a big fish in Hollywood. Do you think you know about sharks, Matt? You have not seen anything yet
