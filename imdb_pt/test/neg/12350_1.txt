It is not a balanced point of view. The director should not express his opinion as truth. The film has some criticisms of Fujimori, but always gives him and his family the last words. Thus, few critics of Fujimori were provided that it seems that the only reason they were included was to be able to say that the film provides the two views. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film hardly shows one of the massacres that Fujimori is accused of. And this gives him credit for the intellectual mentor of the MRTA insurgent murder that took over the Japanese embassy. It is well documented that the CIA did the planning. There are even photos of a well-known CIA strategist on the site published by Caretas magazine and other newspapers. The fact that such well-known information has not been used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions: the director is pro-Fujimori and purposely and falsely chooses to give credit to him; the director does not want viewers to notice that the CIA and Fujimori worked together; or it was only out of ignorance, since the director is not Peruvian and was not present in Peru at the time the events occurred. <br /> <br /> The explanation provided by other commentators, that Fujimori is still quite popular in Peru, does not excuse the lack of precision and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> In addition, the statistics provided in the film for the actual support of Fujimori were the highest I've ever heard of. Most statistics from major search agencies are much lower. Another point to mention is that the intelligence that was instrumental in capturing Sendero's leader and uncovering the secret network was made by a police force led by Ketin Vidal and he had full autonomy from Fujimori and Montesinos. <br /> <br /> Fujimori's first government experienced an improvement in global economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts. which were not beneficial to the country in the long run. In addition, the gap between rich and poor continued to increase during the Fujimori regime. In his second term, the economy was suffering and there was nothing to privatize, and by the end of Fujimori's second term the economy was about to collapse. <br /> <br /> In terms of investments in infrastructure of the Fujimori regime, they patronize the pattern. They were created to increase support for Fujimori, but were not meant to last for long. These structures needed continued maintenance, but Fujimori did not provide political power to civilians in order to demand more investment. In fact, the Fujimori regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization such as unions and grassroots groups and the increase in informal disorganized work was immense. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director chose to spend most of the work. film talking to Fujimori instead of citing cases of massive corruption in favor of Fujimori (the media, businessmen, military, etc.) that were so widespread that it was impossible for Fujimori not to be aware of it.
