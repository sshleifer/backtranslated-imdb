This is one of those exaggerated comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool's is a classic "b". <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn recently commented on "Town and Country" that it is a big problem in Hollywood that they start by hiring the actors and making a deal. before a script completes. You have to find out that they not only entered this picture without a complete script, but they also spoiled it every day. Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studios that say, "It's the script, stupid." <br /> <br /> This is also one of those movies where you feel regretted by the actors for most of the time. They are working hard trying to make everything seem hysterical, but they know that most will be accompanied not by laughter, but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theater. <br /> Is it an absolute disaster? Not entirely. There are some smiles along the way, mainly due to the efforts of the actors. I probably would have left the theater thinking, "Hey, it's okay." So why the undeniably hostile tone in my commentary? The end. If, as noted, the rest of the movie is just a setup for the ending, then it loses spectacularly. I really like to talk specifically about it, but I hate people who donate too much (even on notice). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind Paul Reiser (nothing donated here, it's in the trailer), get out of the theater and go out thinking, "Hey, that's okay." The rest of the film is neat and creatively bankrupt. And you'll be shocked that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. <br /> <br /> If you loved "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet The Parents", then do not worry about watching this movie. Go have those teeth taken care of instead.
