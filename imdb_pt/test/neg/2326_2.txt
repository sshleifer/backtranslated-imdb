I bought the video for Â£ 13 at HMV (we paid more in Britain) because a friend told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the opening credits were a let down ... the dance / music was not very powerful. <br /> <br /> The car ride and an unexpected accident, just as the girl's passenger would be impaired, was a nice touch, something unexpected. ... though the way she stepped away from the car with perfectly tidy hair and still carrying a bag looked gaunt to most of the directors ... but to Lynch it was something else. <br /> <br /> She confused walking around after the shock was reinforced by a low regular noise, similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard; I thought Lynch's other master would play, perhaps, portraying the demons gnawing at their shocked and traumatized self-consciousness. After a while, this noise became a bit annoying, and in later investigations I discovered that the new video tape creaked. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this creak took much of my pleasure, but this movie has become a waste of time. (and money) <br /> <br /> The two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fairly fair, though predictable. There were no male characters of any merit and, in addition to some vaguely good scenes (the vacuum cleaner calling), there were many terrible scenes that were simply weak and ridiculous. For example, coffee being spat on the napkin by the menacing loon and silly monster face in the back of the restaurant. Oh, and about painting on wife's jewels..boring and naff. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of the broken genius .. you know when you hear Dylan's worst clue and think my God, that was embarrassing .... was it really Bob? <br /> <br /> The feeling is of a failed TV movie, misplaced together with some (not many) extra bits to give it 15 I played during the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll give you another chance and watch again. If I want to be intrigued and work hard to understand a movie, I'll watch Frank Woods, Guide to Consolidated Accounting. <br /> <br /> Lynch made a classic ... Blue Velvet and Straight Story was cool. <br /> <This, like Wild at Heart, was a disappointment; its strangeness now is predictable and obsolete. Anyone want to buy a second hand video? <br /> <br /> Make way for a younger, original talent, David. <br /> <br /> Four in ten (and no more). Excuse.
