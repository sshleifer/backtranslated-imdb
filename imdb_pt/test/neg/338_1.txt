I have 10 more year old computer games with better special effects! The plot is unstable and very predictable. Most actors look like extras without experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a team of 'Scotties' from Star Trek without the personality or the charm. Unnecessary scenes of people putting up tents! Tents with all the supposedly high-tech equipment! The actors seemed not to be sure the camera was in them. Nothing that makes you care if these people survive or not! It looks like it was made in someone's backyard and in the garage using cutting edge equipment! Nothing seems original or even a little fun. Do not waste your time!
