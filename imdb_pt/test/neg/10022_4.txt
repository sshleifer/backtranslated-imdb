1980 was certainly a year for bad horror films. "Friday the 13th" and "The Burning" may have been the best, but there were always some fans who were not far behind, like "Do not go into the woods alone" and this one. But in all fairness "The Prey" is far from as bad as "Do not Go Into The Woods", but it's still not big. One thing is that it's just annoying and acting is not very good, but much better than "DGITW" and this movie really has some attractive women to look at, all three female leaders were impressive. One thing, what is happening with all that useless wildlife photo, it seemed useless and it seemed that the director used this to use this to fill some space of time. <br /> <br /> So, what was there to like? This movie? Well, there were a few moments of cheeseburts - I could not contain a fit of laughter when the final girl did a bizarre kind of walk on the moon to get away from kille and there were some good killing scenes - my favorites being the girl choked up death with the sleeping bag; and the false look. <br /> <br /> In short, The Prey is dumb, boring and the killer I did not find scary, this movie could have been so much better.
