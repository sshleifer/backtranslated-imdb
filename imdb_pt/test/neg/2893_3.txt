This is really a very bad movie. However, it is good to laugh at horrible ideas and "special" effects. The plot revolves around an EU space agency that discovers a tenth planet orbiting directly in front of the Earth. They send a Guinean mission (did they go to Mars and still have not discovered this planet? Someone stupid enough to fall in love with it?) For the planet and you can believe it is the mirror image of the planet from where they came from. Almost everything is predictable from that point on. Honestly from the title of the movie, you can guess almost everything. The amazing thing here is a managed space program directed by Europeans: There is really no excuse for the concept or execution of the plot. So it's good for a laugh or maybe if you're in an altered state of consciousness.
