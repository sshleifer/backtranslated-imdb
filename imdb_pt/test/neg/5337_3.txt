Oh, no, one of those attacks from the Japanese ghost movies ... I do not even remember how many I saw. maybe sells ... but not for me. not scary at all. the Japanese horror movies are very similar since the first one ... also the boy's pull. I've seen it pulled on the scene so many times in so many horror movies. mobile scene is also nothing new ... the drama of the guy being hit by a half-sucked train ... I mean it was missing all the drama ... OK this is for children 14-16 who listen to Japanese rock and think who are so unique ... let's tell you. There are a million of you = D, this is one of them. 3/10 I've seen worse, but you will not be missing out on not seeing this!
