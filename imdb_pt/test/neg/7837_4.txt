The maximum risk is quite amazing for a person who has seen more of his films. Director Ringo Lam has made a joint action film, which can be compared to most other medium-quality action films, which is a special predicate for a movie "Muscles of Brussels". It has a rather elegant style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme does not make you cry for his acting, he does a relatively good job. Of course you can not compare Maximum Risk (oh, what a creative title!) To `Ronin`, but after watching` Knock off` is the hell of a good movie ... in special standards, of course.
