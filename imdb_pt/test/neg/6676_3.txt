Contrary to what one critic said, this is NOT an imitation of the Magnum Force. In that place, Lieutenant Hal Holbrook assembled his own squad of Academy recruits to dispatch repeat offenders. In Extreme Justice this operation has the sanction of the superiors of the LAPD. To what extent they sanction the exact methods used is questionable. <br /> <br /> This Special Investigations Squadron seems to be the refuge for the LAPD's misfits, those who have forgotten their first duty are protection and service. That's why Scott Glenn thinks that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective with more than his share of cuts in Internal Affairs for excessive use of force, is perfect for the squad. <br /> <br /> What should have sent him running from Phillips is the fact that he has a great relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. The one who certainly played me in this movie, you'd think Lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team. <br /> <br /> And what his team is, it's a death squad. They aim at perpetrators to follow them and wait to catch them in the act. So it's open season. <br /> <br /> Extreme justice went a long way from trying to make a point. Surely there would be no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and take them outside. No civilians were injured when the citizens of Coffeyville did this to the Daltons. Or wait until three rapists finish their work before moving. That's what we were asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And frankly, I could not buy it. Many good players get really lost in this.
