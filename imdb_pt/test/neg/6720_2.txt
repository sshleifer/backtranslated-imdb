Three words: What a pile ..... Two words: do not bother! One word: sucked! There is no reason to see this movie. Even those Seagal fanatics should get away from this movie. The martial arts, the typical Aikido, are horrible. The movements of the martial arts are good, but cinematography is pathetic. The film actually goes into slow motion whenever Seagal gives his "killing move" to his victims. Worse still, it shows the same movement three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's acting was stupid, but I still give this movie a "6" for acting because of the supporting cast whose "villain" roles were really fun. <br /> <br /> The plot is just plain stupid. Seagal plays a Federal Express agent with a license to kill. Your character also has this dedicated work ethic, which means that all your packages are delivered to the right people at the right time - at no extra cost - and nothing gets in your way. Not assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death. <br /> <br /> I expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this movie from random and horrific acts of violence that lend themselves in no way to the film's advance or its history. There is a reason why this film went directly to the video and there are several reasons to avoid it. No one should bother with this double. <br /> <br />
