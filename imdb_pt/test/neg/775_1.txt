This is absolutely unquestionable the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so bad that I plan to rent it again as soon as I can find it. This movie makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like an Oscar contender. Just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. It's awful. Approach perfection. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). As far as I can go ... I'm laughing too much. I know it should not be funny, but ... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * * CHANGE ABOUT THE WOOD !!! <br /> <br /> Regard's * DATo *
