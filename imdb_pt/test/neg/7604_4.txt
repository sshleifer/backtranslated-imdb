This was a real disappointment for me. The original bride with white hair is a great fantasy kung fu movie, but this one was very weak. I do not care about the new characters who unfortunately dominated the screen time and the story was not well developed. While the first film was tragic and involving this was tedious (as I just counted the time to the end, when ill-fated lovers actually met). The action was also bad on this one. The fights were not choreographed very well and there really was not much kung-fu. Only a few weak sword fights between the highly discredited Lui and one of Lin's henchmen. Lin herself primarily uses a sort of telekinesis to throw people on walls and sometimes her hair, far from the impressive display with the whip and kung-fu she displayed in the previous film. I still gave this movie a 4 because at least it was a fast paced and I wanted to see what would happen in the end, although I (like most people who watched the first one) predicted that it would fall out the way it happened. and after seeing it, I found it anti-climatic and wished they had made an appropriate sequence or simply left the story alone. I really recommend the first, but as for the continuation only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride once again need to apply.
