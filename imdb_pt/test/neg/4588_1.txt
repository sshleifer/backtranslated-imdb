The hockey game I play and watch has something called "speed", which the actual hockey scenes in this flowing movie never come close to capturing. Add to that a plot that is clich√©d, predictable, and more stupid than stupid, with some of the darkest sounds of the '80s numbing your senses in every scene and you have "Youngblood." Oh, Keanu as a Canadian French, yes, whatever. Gimme Dunlop, Braden and the Hansons anytime ... ONE out of ten.
