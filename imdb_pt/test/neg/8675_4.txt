Oh gosh! The BBC is not about to be knocked off its pedestal by absorbing period dramas through it. I agree that this Jane Austens novel is the hard one to portray particularly for a modern audience, the heroine is hardly an Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. However, I must say I was hoping for an improvement at last and was very disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was Jane Austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit and depth were diluted, if not lost. If some past adaptations can be seen as dated, the weakness of one of them must be that it is too modern ("your life is a long party" ?????). The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was wrong. choice, needed someone more restrained, did not gain any impression of depths hidden under a submissive exterior, she was more like a child playing. I see that I must wait for the BBC to weave its magic once more.
