I really was looking forward to this movie. After reading a number of pre-release reviews, it sounded like a genuinely cool movie, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt). <br /> <br /> Well, it may have been all those things but it's so annoying that I challenge almost anyone to sit back with it in its entirety and keep attention. Also, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. He's such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in that movie. "Disappointing" seems to be the word most used by critics here to describe this movie, and I totally agree. <br /> <br /> I guess it did not take long for word to come out about how bad this movie was because, like Cage's accent, it did not do well.
