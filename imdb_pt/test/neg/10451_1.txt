I thought I could see something good, but ... I'm tired after watching this movie, I do not know what I most hated: the script, the acting, the FX or the music. Try to imagine the worst episode of the Power Rangers and still be nice. I've seen better FX in FPS Games (The touch with the bone sword or his breath that's making people disappear into a green smoke is genius touch) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. I liked how the women in the car were screaming when the "monster" was walking around the car (even though she was looking the wrong way). So give yourself a break and do not watch this thing, at least call someone to watch a horror movie with you, believe me, you'll end up playing monopoly for a few kicks.
