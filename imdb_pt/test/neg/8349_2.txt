As a geology student, this film portrays the ignorance of Hollywood. In the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside the burning house, it is less than 30 cm from the lava, which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit. This stupidity is witnessed again when "Stan" will save the subway 4. His shoes are melting to the subway floor while the rest of the team is just a few feet away from the lava flowing. And to end this monstrosity of a movie, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement K rails. Earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow of firemen have already experienced cars and CEMENT. Common sense says that this film is an absurd and gross understatement of human knowledge.
