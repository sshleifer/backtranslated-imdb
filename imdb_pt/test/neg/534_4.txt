It's a kinder and gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it's there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. Is it the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible film of Jean Claude Van Damme, or is it the cover of the trilogy Masters of the Universe? I'm still confused about it. Anyway, there really was no need for this movie. What was the need? Angelina Jolie. She can play a murderous robot that can explode in the middle of intercourse, but what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her a prize winner.
