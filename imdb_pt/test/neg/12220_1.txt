I'm sure there's a documentary among the ruins of this Yawn festival somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. This disconnect soon turns into a complete animosity that borders on hostility. Although because of the bad flow of the story, I'm not sure what's going on with them and what are the consequences of whatever they're trying to do. The story and the faces jump so fast that it is very difficult to fully understand what is happening. The third founder, who takes $ 700K, is so late in the film that Khaleil and Tom have to go back (no result) to explain "oh yes, this guy also created the idea." And just when I thought I had a slight understanding of who all the tertiary characters were, some crazy woman complaining about having a puppy? What is up with that? Besides, did Tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the team? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening. Actually, I think I feel for them.
