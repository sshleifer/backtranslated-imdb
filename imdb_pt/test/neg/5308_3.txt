If pulp fiction and Get shorty did not exist, this could be an OK movie. When I say this, I mean that nothing in this movie is yours unless it is another terrible dialogue or a complete cliché. All the talk like 'I will not say more than I have to get' Shorty seems to appear in this garbage sequel, all cameos as Steven Tyler are acted terribly and are not needed and as for Christina Milian, dude, do not me let's start. Sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like John Travolta and Uma Thurman seem to be trying to stay with kids and hip and almost ruined the reputation because of this movie and frankly I think the best acting is from the rock that plays next to it from one of my least favorite actors, Vince Vaughn. The man tries to be funny all the time with him taking the mickey out of how the rappers apparently speak.Cedric, the artist and Andre 3000, do another terrible act {I personally think the background actors were better than Cedric Andrews } and the only funny part of Cedric's acting André and the rest of there gang is the way the pants are down there to the knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason I find this funny is because many of people actually do this. So in conclusion, this movie tries to be funny and fails miserably, it does not have any new stuff, comedy or coolness when copying all the other movies, and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare the how bad it is for its brilliant predecessor Get shorty. Oh yeah I forgot to mention that there is a big cliché in the end.
