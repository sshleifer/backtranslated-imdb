Five years after the American Civil War, Westerners are more concerned about the old war between settlers and ranchers. The ranchers herd their wares, from Texas to the town of Abilene, Kansas. There, cowboys find not only a lot of money, but also big clashes, with homesteaders. High on the saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (as Dan Mitchell) tries to keep the peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience in mediating between the hands of the trail and the customers of the hall. He also juggles the city's most beautiful women: the stylish singer Ann Dvorak (as Rita) and the beautiful lady of the church Rhonda Fleming (as Sherry). Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (as Bravo Trimble) offers more comic relief than good help. "Abilene Town" begins with a promising symbolism and contrast: shots interrupt Scott and Fleming singing an anthem. at church; then the camera switches to Mrs. Dvorak sexually singing her bar number, which makes a man shoot his pleasure weapon. After that, it really becomes a standard Westerner; is a little more foolish than it should be, but not too horrible. The young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the settlers. Dvorak's costume is the film's greatest asset; in her, she is a real booster. <br /> <br /> **** Abilene Town (11/1/46) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
