go get your video camera, your little brother and the upset neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons; and you got a movie! well, that's what these guys thought anyway. it was so bad that I do not even remember most of it, except flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in Nam. Despite the really tacky title, the awful quality, the terrible actors and the clich√© written, I think this movie is not the worst that I have already seen. I'm saving this slot for everything with steven seagal, chuck norris and jean-claude van dam. anyway, if you're out of options when it comes to finding new horror movies that you have not seen a thousand times as I was, and you're debating this, I'd still skip this. it had absolutely no redeeming quality. this serial killer thriller was a weak and insignificant attempt at a B-like movie if they were very lucky, they could make the $ 4.50 bin at wal-mart. but I very much doubt it.
