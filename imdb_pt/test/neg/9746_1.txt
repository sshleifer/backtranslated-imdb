This movie was frankly chosen as a pig in a tug from our local video store. It turned out to be a pig. The plot, as it is, was disjointed, inconsistent, and predictable. The actors constantly seemed embarrassed to be speaking the poorly written lines. The only funny moment in any movie revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertent use of an airbag. The rest of the movie did not have the effect of amusing my little daughters (under ten), me, my wife, my mother-in-law or even the cat or the dog. My advice, if you are tempted to borrow this turkey, it is to save your money and your time. Look for something else ...
