This movie is so bad it looks funny. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. The funny thing is that the trailer had scenes that were not in the movie. Just watching the trailer would have saved me a lot of my time. In fact, it showed everything that happened in the movie, except for the conclusion and that was also so obvious. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to think of a reason why this movie was made. This is so bad. Horrible. <br /> <br /> I would give 0 out of 10 if that were possible. There is nothing more to say about this movie.
