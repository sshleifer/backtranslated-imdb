Ben, (Rupert Grint), is a deeply unhappy teenager, the son of his married and unhappy parents. His father, (Nicholas Farrell), is vicar and his mother, (Laura Linney), is ... well, let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to an eccentric, eccentric, once-famous and now-forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that he finally finds himself in the true 'Harold and Maude' fashion. Of course, Evie is deeply unhappy and it is only when these two sad sacks meet that they can put their misery aside and pick up the road to happiness. <br /> <br /> Of course it's tacky and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a tough side, and Walters, who could walk through this kind of thing if he wanted to, is great. It's when she puts the craziness aside and finds the pathetic character (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink) that she's at her best. The problem is that she's the only interesting character in the movie (and it's not because of the script that she does nobody any favors). Grint, on the other hand, is not only unhappy; He's a bit annoying too, while Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Still, she has the English accent on the outside.) The best that can be said is that it is mildly pleasant - with an emphasis on softness.
