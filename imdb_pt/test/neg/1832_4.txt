1 st watched 6/24/2007 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK thriller, but a little predictable too. This story is based in Germany, which is also where the film is made. This is a young medical student who has a chance to go to a premier school in Heidelberg and comes upon seeing some strange things happening. Someone she met on the train and saved, shows up at the school's experiment table and she is suspecting a crime. She does some investigating and the disappearance of her friend takes her to a secret society called AAA (and no, it's not Alcoholics Anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-Hippocratic oath and is used to make experiments on living people that the doctor I did not want to know. Usually, it is capable of doing. She discovers that her grandfather (who was a rector of the school) was a big part of establishing it and is very easily filled by members of the school. It's an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on and then it's kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting the bad boy of the group that's taking things to the next psychotic level. Although this film was made in Europe, it touches a young American audience with a focus on sex, sex and the premise of the horror film (which is really a big fall) and explains why it probably made good money and generated a sequel , but it does not necessarily make a good movie.
