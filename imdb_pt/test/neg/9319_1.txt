Well, I remember when the studio fired Schrader and hired Harlin to do reshoots in that movie, they were right to do it. Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist is simply a bad movie, it's annoying. It would be nice to think that the studio set aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned the version of Harlin and praised Schraders, even though no one has ever seen But they were not. <br /> <br /> To summarize: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be, and it shows A great way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad cast support. <br /> <br /> Save your money and your nerves, I do not see it.
