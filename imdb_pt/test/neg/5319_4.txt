Peter Hunt began as a very talented film editor and got his first stab at directing when he directed the James Bond movie "Her Majesty's Secret Service" (considered by many Bond fans to be the best of the series). Other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure films such as "Gold" and "Shout At The Devil," both adapted from Wilbur Smith's novels. "Gulliver's Travels" is odd on his list of movies; It seems strange that a director of Hunt's style and expertise could choose to direct such a film. A half-animated action-half-animated re-creation of Jonathan Swift's classic satire, the movie looked like twenty years outdated, even when it was done, and in all honesty, it just does not work. And there's not much that Hunt (with his usual eye for fast-paced action), or star Richard Harris (who can usually cheer up the blistering roles) can do to rescue this. <br /> <br /> Lemuel Gulliver (Richard Harris) is a brilliant medical student living in the seventeenth-century Bristol. His father (Norman Shelley) wants him to go to London to make a fortune; but Gulliver prefers the idea of ​​receiving a much smaller salary, but much more adventure than a ship surgeon aboard a ship called "Antelope." During a trip, the 'Antelope' is diverted from course during a storm and hits a reef. The ship sinks and everyone is lost, plus Gulliver. which is washed ashore in the kingdom of Lilliput. When he arrives, Gulliver discovers that the strange land where he was dragged to the earth is populated by incredibly small humans, no taller than the toes. To them, he looks like a giant. They convince Gulliver to help them in a war against another race of small people living on an adjacent island. But Gulliver does not like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation, so he makes plans to escape. <br /> <br /> Harris is left to take the whole movie here. His first couple of scenes involve other actors, but once he is shipwrecked in Lilliput, he spends the rest of the movie walking on sets on his knees and acting alongside his animated colleagues. The idea of ​​mixing live action and animation was not new at the time, but it certainly had not been made very much. Some Disney films, such as Southern Song, So Dear My Heart and Pete's Dragon, had tampered with the idea, but they were still fine in their childhood. "Gulliver's Travels" is not a particularly humorous film, but the scenes that show the interaction between Harris and his co-protagonists are at least made with competence. Occasionally, the movie tries to be true to its satirical origins (there is a scene where we learn that Lilliput went to war with his neighbor because of eggs!?!) And the point seems to be that wars can start on the most ridiculous things. ). But deep down, this is much more a children's film and the satirical tones are little known. Have all involved made things better during their careers? "Gulliver's Travels" can fill an empty afternoon, but otherwise it is a forgettable and nothing astonishing experience.
