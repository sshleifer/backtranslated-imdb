Okay, so Gus Van Sant wanted to remake Psycho in color so he could bring it to the modern audience, who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were forced to watch a black and white movie while they conveniently forget that both "Clerks "and" Schindler's List "were filmed in black and white and are great movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the same narrow-minded people would not want to see a great movie just because it's black and white. whites are the same people who would not like "Psycho" anyway, because they do not have a murder or sex scene every two minutes. And the murders are not the hideous blood / viscera / blood / snap that people are accustomed to seeing "Halloween," "Friday the 13th," and "Nightmare on Elm Street." That's why redoing "Psycho" almost exactly as it was originally meant to not work, because it's really only of interest to people who are fans of the original. All the others are just watching them so they continue until the next sequence of "Scream" is released and for that reason they will be disappointed. "Psycho" depends on suspense and mystery, not on blood and courage. (And just so nobody thinks I should be an old citizen if I like old movies, let me make things clear by saying that I'm 21 years old.) <br /> <br /> So if you make the movie in colors was all that Van Sant wanted to change, why not just color the film and relaunch it? I mean, what's the point of redoing a movie if you're not going to change anything? The least he could have done was put the script of his own director instead of just copying Hitchcock's - or better yet, hire a new writer to adapt a new script from the original "Psycho" book. But it seems that Van Sant could not decide whether to redo "Psycho" * exactly * or not. This should have been an all-or-nothing project - either redo the film exactly or make it different - but, as it stands, this movie is about 95% the same, but with a few tosses that seem to have no purpose at all. For example, when Norman masturbates while spying on Marion undressing. It does not suit the plot, and the only reason he put it was because he * could *. He wanted to say, "Hitch could not show people masturbating in 1960, so I'm going to do it." Whoopee, great thing, how I'm so shocked to see someone masturbate. And what on earth was the point of showing images of clouds and farm animals united in the murder scenes? And then he leaves * an * important scene, where Lila and Sam meet the sheriff outside the church. <br /> <br /> In addition, using the script almost exactly the same, the whole movie seems a bit anachronistic. Initial credits say the year is 1998. So what's with Marion's 60-year-old dress or the umbrella she carries with her? Why do Marion and Sam have to have their meetings in a hotel room, when nowadays no one would be shocked at what they are doing? Why are not there air conditioners in Marion's office? Why does not Bates Motel have TV in the rooms and apparently no automatic door locks? Why does the sheriff have to ask the operator to connect him to the Bates motel? That's why using the exact same script was a mistake - just changing a few words here and there was not enough to modernize it. It needed a complete overhaul. <br /> <br /> Although Vince Vaughn performed well as Norman, he just did not look right for the role. Part of what made the original "Psycho" so scary was that Norman had that innocent quality of a boy next door, so no one could believe he was capable of such horrible crimes. With Vince Vaughn playing the role, is anyone really surprised that Norman was a psychopathic killer? <br /> <br /> That said, I can understand that Gus Van Sant was obviously a fan of the original movie "Psycho", and wanted it to be a tribute. This is not a bad movie, but the problem is that this may be the only exposure of people to "Psycho". I really think you should see this movie only if you saw the original. Since I'm a fan of anything to do with "Psycho", I bought a used copy of the remake, which I can watch from time to time. The original movie was a filet mignon, while the remake is a hamburger. But even filet mignon would be annoying if you had it everyday, so it's good to have a burger every now and then for a change.
