I first watched Kindred in 1987 along with another movie called Devouring Waves. I remember then I hated them both and never bothered to see them again. <br /> <br /> However, I recently started a crusade to collect so many terror titles from the 80's in their original form, which were deleted for some time. I have a fairly proud collection with many other titles on my list! <br /> <br /> Kindred, though I still do not have a copy, is a high priority, like all the old movies I did not like back then. , I now own and now re-watch and think they are brilliant and the parts I remember from Members are now leading me to want to get hold of an ASAP copy <br /> <br /> Live for the 80s and Long live the horror!
