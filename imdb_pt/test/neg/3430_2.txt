In addition to John Krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. The love story of Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan was as clichéd as possible, filled with incredibly bad lines about how their parents would never let them stay together and their looks anxious. None of the "emotions" had any depth or reality at all. The two accented characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and whoever was the weapons specialist) ... once they saw how bad the accents were, they could not have decided to just drop them and rewrite some lines to avoid giving the pain of the public? Apparently no. I do not even know where to start editing, particularly sound editing. If you hate obvious dubbing as much as I do, do not watch it. That said, Krasinski was great. On the face of it, I admit that I'm a big fan of Office and that's why I rented it. But he's a lot of fun as the "wall-hungry friend with crazy ideas". He has a clichéd role, but he still manages to make it as fun as possible. The ending was awful. It had simply been terrible. The idea of ​​a robbery that went awry had potential, but Keegan struggling after being shot, even his studio to fall on a painting of Chabert (which looks nothing like her) is the most embarrassing scene.
