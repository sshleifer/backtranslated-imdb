This series and Elon Gold were being HYPED as "the next big thing" on TV shows for NBC. Well, they were not. Dennis Farina was terribly mischievous as his father-in-law. He looked so uncomfortable and out of place here. The term "private convocation time"! should become the "Dyno-mite!" of the 21st century. Well, it was not. People then asked, as they are today (when his name appears), "Who the hell is Elon Gold?" I saw him in an episode of "The Mentalist" tonight. I mentioned his name and my girlfriend asked: "Who?" It's not funny. Total wasted antenna time. NBC had really high hopes for this show, but it just fell apart.
