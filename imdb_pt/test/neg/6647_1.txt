This movie was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that movies must have to be watched, and that is * some * psychological credibility of the characters ... unfortunately, here, this is not the case. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have some reason for such behavior, this is not revealed to us by the director. The character of Sophie Marceau is particularly annoying, taking pictures of everything throughout the film, when one might expect something more rational (for example, meeting her mother in the hospital) ... and why exactly she married that guy? (No, this is not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems stolen from a soap opera, and although the performance of the actors is not bad, it does not help much. After all, I just could not find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I have tried too much after the first hour, though. I never left the movies during a movie, but this time it was the closest of my life so far.
