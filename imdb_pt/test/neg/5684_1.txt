I watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. So, I move quickly all the way to the end. This movie should be the worst of all in the low-budget sci-fi movie category so far. Bad acting, cast, directions, Lara Craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! Throughout the film, I think there might be only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but only two of them started throughout the film. I was expecting something like the Starship Trooper, but it was nothing close to that. I was fooled by the movie title and photo on the DVD cover. Do not waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Come to think of it, I wonder why they bother to cast bad movies like this?
