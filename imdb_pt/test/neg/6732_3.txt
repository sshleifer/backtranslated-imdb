Can they get worse than that? Probably. But after all, Steven Seagal can do what he does. Well, like that; This time, instead of mortally wounding the bad guys, he only hurt them. For the reputation of being a bad agent, Seagal is hired to deliver a special package from France to America. But it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and disrupt the mission. The fights just do not have enough bite and the big bangs are just great and that's all. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear in wood. Also in the cast are Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Do not put all the blame on Seagal for this clunker.
