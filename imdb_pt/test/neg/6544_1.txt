This low budget independent film redefines the word "blah". It will surprise more that this word can actually be found in the dictionary, defined as: "absurd .. uninteresting, monotonous, lifeless." The film redefines the word because I would have to add to these four words: "PC crap," "pretentious on a pathetic level," and "meaningless." <br /> <br /> The film tries to be both "in" and "in touch" with the contemporary behavior of beautiful people struggling for je-ne-sais-quoi and "thinking" (think they?). There is almost no plot to speak, although there is one for sleeping. The most fictitious and politically correct things about it are how a white woman is a close friend of a young black stallion, the black street saxophonist with a crush on such wise advice and advice, and the fat black psychic. Is not it beautiful how the races can understand each other? ... Ahhhh ... In the end, the woman reads "poetry," which is nothing more than one of her insipid inscriptions of "dear diary." She is standing ovated (!!!), although in real life her listeners are more likely than not to nap in a deep sleep. But this movie has little to do with real life, even if it's where it's supposed to be going. In real life, her reading of "poetry" would only have been cheered if she had the good sense to include the juicy and sexual details. "And then I rubbed his huge cock against my sweaty, impatient pink vagina ..." Congratulations! What's worse, the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she bathes or fucks someone, but they never have the good sense to show off her breasts, which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The black guy and the blonde, who are separated by a meter in height, connect: they look like a cheap variation of Rodman and Madonna (as if the last two were no longer a cheap combination ). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in her book "Miss America", is the blonde. Stern writes from Eggert that she removed her implants. However, I believe that when they removed their implants, they also sucked most of the flesh from their flesh and muscles by mistake as she seems to be hungry here. <br /> <br /> The saxophonist in a scene develops like an angel. wings; he looks like Al Roker announcing cakes of angel food.
