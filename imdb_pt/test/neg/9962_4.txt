George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact that, worse than the movie he appeared to be, he would always retain a sense of dignity and perform well. "The Mad Monster" is no exception to this rule. It is by all standards a poor movie (if fun). The filmmakers obviously did not know how to make the most of their low budget, and the script seems to be over in a day or two. Still, Zucco is good and believable as the mad scientist. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is nice in a camp. Normal horror movie fans will not like movies from the People's Republic of China. However, these "Poverty Row" productions have a small but loyal fan base. Occasionally they would rise above their limitations with "Deviation" being the best example of this. Usually they look like this. For all its technically poor qualities, "The Mad Monster" is a fun way to kill a rainy afternoon. The Retromedia DVD is recommended as it combines this with another RPC production, "The Black Raven," the original movie trailer, and best of all, an interview with Glenn Strange talking about his role in this film. (4/10)
