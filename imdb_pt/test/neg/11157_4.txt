Watching "End of Days", I had a feeling that the filmmakers might be trying to make it unique to the Hollywood action movie. They have failed, of course, but you have to give credit for trying. Peter Hyams actually tried to drive this time instead of just producing another action movie. He tried to inject atmosphere into the film, darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. This method can work if used correctly (see "Se7en") but here it seems a cheap trick trying to scare us. Hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than the basic shootouts and fight scenes, with the exception of the "sub-final" battle. As a photographer, Hyams demonstrates real skill, exhibiting good frame and motion work, but it's nothing above solid work. <br /> <br /> Writer Andrew Marlowe is the film's biggest enemy. In some parts, the script really shows the ingredients of a good religious thriller, and sometimes even shows some almost intellectual thinking (the scene of the Temptation between Arnold and Gabriel Byrne), but these small advantages are choked by a river of negatives. Generic dialogues / characters, plot holes, and convenient plot points that happen to point all characters in the right direction are just a few of Hollywood's standard black holes that Marlowe's script addresses. The shadow of the good movie could have disappeared very quickly. <br /> <br /> The film surprisingly has a good cast. Arnold, still possessing that attitude greater than life, tries to throw a depressed police officer on the edge, with no more than average results. Stick to being the invincible hero Arnie, it's what you do well. Gabriel Byrne is the group's strength, bringing an air of cynicism to the role of Satan. In a mature villain role for overacting, Byrne restrained himself and adds a little more threat to the character. Kevin Pollak, as usual, manages to make at least a few laughs at the film, but he did better. Also look for a small stellar role by Rod Steiger. Hyams seemed to be trying to separate this from the faceless mass of Hollywood action movies. He was headed in the right direction, but he had neither the script nor the originality to take him there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
