"Chupacabra Terror" is saved from a "1" by the presence of the graceful Canadian Chelan Simmons as the heroine. She is a delight to watch, front, back and side. Otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie. Playing as a low-cost version aboard THE RELIC, John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported, and the unconventional monster is simply a man in a suit. , bloody killings, at least then the body count in this one is pretty impressive.Formula, to say the least.I love the moment when Simmons tells somebody what chupacabra stands for: Goat eater Oooohh ... scary!
