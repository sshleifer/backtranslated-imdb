As an avid fan of Christian films, and a person trying to keep a keen eye for improvements in the field of Christian cinema, I was excited to get a chance to see this movie. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark on quality movies. I was dissapointed. <br /> <br /> The initial scene is excellent, despite being a small scratch of Leon - The Professional at the angle, it shows a great cinematography in the first steps ... everything after that was I barely got through this, I was tempted several times just to shut up. <br /> <br /> The performance, though possibly sincere, was incredibly horrible. But again, the heart of the problem was the script itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur script "The Awakening" (which will soon be an independent film) looked like a Hitchcock thriller alongside it. (Which is not saying much.) The good side of this film is that it was filmed on brand-new Sony High-Definition 900 cameras, shooting in 24P. This movie and Star Wars: The Attack of the Clones were the first films to use these new technology cameras that year. Unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with poor lighting, poor angles and poor handling. <br /> <br /> The only good feeling I had of watching this movie was how good my indie movie will look next to it. ; 4/10
