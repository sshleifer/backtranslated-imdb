Some modern Janapese horror movies are very good. Strong plot, scary moments, good acting, while others are just .... unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to the last camp. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate the film based on 3 elements: Plot, Scary Factor, and Acting. <br /> <br /> 1) Plot - True to the name of the movie, the plot moves in a circle and is never really explained. OK, the city is captivated by the spiral curse, but why? And why do people act so foolishly? There is a fleeting attempt to explain what is happening to the reporter .. uselessly ... <br /> <br /> 2) Scary factor - if this was meant to be a horror movie, it failed miserably. I can not remember a good scary scene with a lot of development. <br /> <br /> 3) Performance - very monotonous. People walking around saying meaningless phases. I can not really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes. <br /> <br /> Overall, there are much better Japanese horror films with a coherent plot and strong characterization. Do not worry about wasting your time with this aspirant.
