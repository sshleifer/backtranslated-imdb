This tale of the upper classes, getting their rise and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of a Joan Crawford film in which she suffered in mink. Here people behave in a terribly civilized manner in the face of adversity. A wealthy London lawyer, (Tom Wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local nobility, but that she also killed the husband of his housekeeper in a hit-and-run accident. He vomits, but on the other hand his upper lip hardly shakes. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park," (this is his directorial debut) from a Nigel Balchin novel, it's quite comical, although I have not sure how much comedy is intentional. It's like a throwback to British 1940s films where all characters behaved like characters in books or plays rather than people in real life. However, not everything is bad. Wilkinson is fantastic even if you never believe him as a person, while Emily Watson (the adulterous woman) and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high-class) are both good at covering the cracks in the material. Cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts ensures that, no matter how difficult it is in the ear, it is always good for the eyes.
