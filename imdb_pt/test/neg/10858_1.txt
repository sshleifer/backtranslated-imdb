Larry Bishop, the writer / actor / director, focuses too much on camera, music, and visuals. The film resorts to senseless ramblings and vulgar monologues, which seem to have no other purpose but to annoy and annoy the public. The actors experience a rough ride from beginning to end of the film, and are caught in a terrible smoke screen. The hell with the ride. The movie is a bomb. <br /> <br /> Winners are presented as weathered watchers, who seek their own form of justice for what they see as illegality. They are motorcyclists, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the vindictive leader of the pack. The Gent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but mysterious. Deuce, played by David Carradine, should have gone on the ride, as well as ticket buyers (if you decide to see the movie, you'll regret it, but you'll find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lewd and venomous character, completely full of disdain. <br /> <br /> What intrigues me is how this film, with all its continual ramblings and vulgarities, has someone to invest in a movie. ride that absolutely goes nowhere. Ticket buyers, take my advice: do not pay the trip. Please do not make the same mistake as the investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes or so of the film is confusing and unintelligible. The dialogue, which quickly turns into meaningless monologues, makes no sense. The whole movie is hell to go nowhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. He should have passed the tour too. There are decapitated heads, cut throats and naked women fighting. Of course Bishop does not know where he's going with the movie. He gets totally lost. But at the end of the tour, you will not give a damn. Mother of heaven! Stay at home. And, by all means, do not take the tour. I rate this movie 1 out of 10, but this movie is so bad it deserves a scratch.
