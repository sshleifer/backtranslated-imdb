First, I saw another reviewer said that this movie was "fantastic". Well, nothing could be further from the truth! This movie is complete rubbish !!! A stupid horror comedy that is not at all funny !! Do not take it means it's so bad it's good because it is not. It is a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this wasted DVD. A group of friends gets together on a weekend, gets drunk and decides to make a video in the backyard. They take Mom's and Dad's video camera and start creating scenes on the spot. Everyone is amused seeing the mug for the camera. They think that if they find it funny, everyone will find it funny. Well, they're wrong. This homemade backyard video is crap. The effects of "acting" and comedians are terrible, but I think this is expected, since this is nothing more than a home video. On the bright side, I think the crap has gotten out there. gives hope to anyone who wants to make a movie. If these people could make your movie and be released on DVD, anyone could do it! <br /> <br /> 0/10 - Save your money.
