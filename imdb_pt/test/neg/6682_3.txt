This was a first feature for Clinton, I was there, while he made that mess in Adelaide around 98 ... Although I was not directly involved in the production, I was witness to the typical delusional, post-set behavior that fell: the parties, drugs, illusory glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a movie, but also a by-product of young and talented people being caught up in classic ideologies of fame & worldly position <br /> <br /> I like of Clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another rift with a more mature script ... there the problems are, and I'm sure it's much better work will be done if there is a next round. Because, frankly, he certainly did not do himself any favors with it on his resume or the cast ... but, hey, it was a paid job, in the country where actors regularly starve to death, > In summary, it's fascinating to watch the 'making of' basically not so much fun to try (unfortunately!).
