This movie is so annoying that I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open on another tab on Netflix trying to figure out if anyone thought it was one of the most annoying, heavy and puzzling movies they have ever seen. A warning: I really could not finish, so these are my impressions until the 54th minute. Keira Knightly gets a lot of time on the screen. As others have already mentioned, his mother wrote the script (perhaps during some kind of drug-induced stupor, in which inanities and emotionless statements about emotions seemed interesting dialogues) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree that she is adorable (with her teeth not exposed ... her locked teeth cause me anxiety and fear), I found her reactions forced and badly timed. As in William or Dylan does something cute ... pause ... K HAHAHA with dimples and a playful arm punch. Like a minute too late. What? And she can not match the intensity of Cillian Murphy. He somehow manages to actually look at her and it seems he is fascinated by her and fall in love with her while she seems totally disconnected, almost as if she is interacting with a mirror. This should be torture by acting alongside someone who is not providing the same level of energy as you. Do you know what else is torture? This movie. Knightly looks impressive during her cyclical "I have 1940 curls and a warm dress. Watch me sing!" shots, but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks it's bizarre, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan. When are you going?" This confuses me because the accent is so confusing and not authentic, but so thick that sometimes I have no idea what she is saying (or maybe she has fallen asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or was, or few, would it be so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts the rest of the action (just joking). <br /> <br /> This movie looks like someone dreamed of a movie, maybe after reading a little of Dylan Thomas before bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world, it was like "Dude, that dream was so interesting" and tried to replicate it. Then someone else warned, "Your script needs work. Nothing that happens promotes a story or creates need," and the writer is everything: "But that's how I dreamed!" It's like the disconnected fantasy of a child, one of those wild, winding threads that spin to catch your eye. And then William went into a war and then Vera had a baby and then some blonde girl drank too much and there were so many planes and pin curls and everyone had ruby ​​red lips and ... <br /> <br /> As for the character Dylan Thomas (so dumb that's all I can call him), why does not he have no line in this biographical movie? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that he's going to make a wagon wheel in public! Get out of here, you crazy poets! (I realize she's not a poet, but she and Thomas are like a nauseating unit of crazy people having crazy moments like a warm sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks on the bulletin board if they should buy this movie. . I say do it. Leave it on your shelf and use it just like a gun to narrate children, senior citizens or guests of the house. <br /> <br /> Q. To the character of Murphy ... when someone asks if you were "in the shit" you can say yes, because your war scenes seem to have been filmed in a landfill.
