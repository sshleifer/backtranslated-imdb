Besides the fact that this movie was made (I suppose it seemed like a good idea at the time considering BOTTOM was so popular) the only thing that intrigued me about GUEST HOUSE PARADISO was what happened to the lighting? There is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film, and I watched it on the TV network, so it was not a case of watching a dishonest tape. In fact, the film was filmed so obscurely that it was impossible to see what the hell was going on. But if the dialogue went to anything that might not be a bad thing
