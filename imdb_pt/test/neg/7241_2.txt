If I was still five years old, I might have thought it was scary. It's (I think) a low budget movie. The acting is not good, but it could be worse - the filming and special effects are terrible. The plot is thin and not worth insisting on. A lot of time is used in boring scenes of screaming. The chases or fighting with aliens remind me of kids fighting with scary masks. Some blood with blood and parts of the body - it would scare a 5 year old kid, I guess. Apparently it scares the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's far from reaching anything like the movie Tremors. <br /> <br /> This ends up being an "incident". and we see alien ships in the vicinity of the earth. Makes you wonder if anyone is going to make a sequel ...
