Rise of the Undead begins when a huge nuclear-type explosion runs through an unnamed American city, some people survive in a building leaning against the door so it stays closed and keeps the disgusting (!). They argue with each other for a long time, so a monster thing comes out of nowhere and begins to kill them one by one ... Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton and Shannon Hubbell, one of them has to say Rise of the Living Dead it's terrible. The script takes itself very seriously but makes little sense, the first thing I asked myself was was there is this huge kind of nuclear explosion going on outside destroying the whole city, why these people I'm watching are still alive ? Why is the building in which they stand still standing? So I wondered when something really was going to happen, all the first 20 minutes were put into a room, actually that's a bit generous, it's more of a hallway as the main character argues. It then transforms into a "Return of the Living Dead" (1985) with a government-created virus that turns people into zombies before one of the most abrupt, senseless, and seemingly random twists I've ever seen, making it the biggest part of what happened a complete waste of time. So in the last 30 odd minutes, Rise of the Undead turns into something like the strange sci-fi type as something that looks like a ball of energy that floats killing everyone, I was the only one wondering what that floating ball of energy is? in? Coming back to what was happening outside of what was the reason again? Oh, that's right, we're never told. Rise of the Undead is a mess, the character is awful and not even given names, the turnaround halfway will cause you to tear your hair in frustration, the dialogue sucks, nothing is explained and there is virtually no story here . The final 10 minutes (perhaps a little more) of Rise of the Undead do not feature any dialogue, and the movie suddenly stops. Horton & Hubbell, the director, were obviously working on a low budget, the whole movie is set in about two rooms and three corridors! The photograph is awful, they use seemingly random color filters at random and sometimes it seems that Rise of the Undead was filmed on a camcorder. There are no special effects, there is a bit of fake blood around, but there are no real makeup effects to speak of. There are some CGI images of the city being swallowed up in flames that look good, but the floating ball of the energetic creature looks terrible. There is a baffling shot at the beginning where two people are sitting against the corridor wall and talking for some bizarre reason that their heads are cut at the top of the screen! Only their lower bodies from the neck down are seen, but nothing else is happening in the frame, they are not moving and there is nothing else but for some strange reason their heads are cut at the top of the frame as they talk to each other! It's a strange thing to watch, actually. <br /> <br /> With an ultra low budget of about $ 10,000 and according to IMDb filmed in two weeks, I have to congratulate the creators for having Rise of the Undead finalized and distributed, but it is where my Congratulations stop because otherwise this has poor production values ​​and is placed in about three corridors that are located somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Rise of the Undead was shot. The acting sucks, so I will not dwell on that. <br /> <br /> Rise of the Living Dead is a drug, it looks like a zombie movie but honestly it is not, everything is sub-par and I know the filmmakers were working on a low budget but this is not really an excuse for me. Definitely not recommended.
