To paraphrase the previous critic's comments, if you're a Stooges fan, avoid this one at all costs! My basic question is: being the experienced comedy soldiers that Moe and Larry were, why did they insist on trying to continue the act when it was so obvious that their home studio, Columbia, was not so clearly interested in giving them serious writers? veteran comedy directors? This movie plays as someone who is giving a pale imitation of the trio and you can see how hard Moe and Larry are working to make every slapstick piece relevant. Joe De Rita, despite his training in vaudeville, is not up to work as a replacement for Curly, Shemp or even Joe Besser. If that's what Moe and Larry had left to choose, they should have closed the store and taken advantage of the retirement. Leaving us fans with better memories of much better movies than they had done previously. Always let them laughing is the motto of comedy and always leave while you're at the top. Hence, Seinfeld is leaving the show while he is up there, instead of waiting for the inevitable decline.
