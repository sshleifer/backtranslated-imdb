After watching this movie on a tedious Saturday afternoon, I could not understand why so many people liked it. It was not "comforting" or "smart"; was just an amalgamation of all the other "people who did not fit together during a holiday and despite their ideological differences learning something about the other" movie already made. <br /> <br /> The characters are a bouillabaisse stereotype - We have the Blacks, the Hispanics, the Jews, the Asians and the homosexuals - and they never do anything except what everyone expects the characters in a movie like that. The black mother states that "all right, then," when it is mentioned that another black character is in church instead of helping to prepare dinner (because all blacks love the church), Hispanics seem only able to speak Spanish when they greet some (or one of them wears a bandana because all the lesbians dress like Ani DiFranco), and the Vietnamese family owns a video store. In L.A. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "What's Cooking" because every ethnic family cooks a different version of what they think the Thanksgiving dinner should be! The black mother wants corn bread and macaroni and cheese, the Hispanics are shown rolled tortillas, the Vietnamese family is frying spring rolls; I'm surprised there was not a bottle of Manischewitz on the Jewish table. All this is shown through the traditional tradition of "musical assembly", where they play the "Wipeout" of the Surfari, quickly changing the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. Is not that cute? In any case, once the director has just established how different everyone is, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, like all people of all races, religions and cultures, come up with implausible and overly dramatic conflicts for every one of the families. . It would be a plot killer to mention what each of these conflicts is, but make sure they are really surprises, that is, if you are sleeping in the first half of the movie. The theme of "dishonoring the family" is very strong in every respect. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're the kind of person who likes these new movies that revolve around unlikely interlaced characters, well, you still will not like this movie. If you like extensive assemblies of foods being passed around a table then you need to put this in your Netflix queue. But if stereotypes and clich√©s are catchy to you, be sure to ask for it for Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
