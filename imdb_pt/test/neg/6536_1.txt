So that's what's so important to SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, huh? Well, I suppose I can relate as long as story, script, dialogue, acting (except for Mrs. Aselton), cinematography, and editing are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other friends to make a few years. ago, the biggest problem with digital video was that we would now have to navigate a future sea of ​​bad things to come up with anything worth watching now that any of you and your brother (or siblings in Duplass's case) could go without and make a movie. "The Swollen Chair." Do I need to say more? <br /> <br /> This feature-length video is yet another chapter of the bleak and growing world of "dudeology" movies; young armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a sketchy script written hastily, and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voila !, instant video producers. Do not get me wrong - I'm all about independent cinema (for example, Hollywierd sucks). But having said that, you can not argue with some of the realities of this system. <br /> <br /> If the Duplass Brothers had to go out and raise a real budget and bring real producers, of course a script like that would never have been lit by the green light! And therein lies the problem. There is no longer a verification process to get movies (sorry ... videos) ready for production. Just grab a DV / P2 camera and you will! And what's worse is that high profile festivals like the ones mentioned above actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. It's because? Precisely because it is without budget. <br /> <br /> I think it's important, especially in the current climate of indie films, to stop allowing videomakers to add language by labeling themselves as "filmmakers." There is a big difference in my book. When you have to get out and really put your script on the line, asking friends, family or business people real money to make a "movie", knowing the potential losses at stake, then you will know what it means to be a "filmmaker . " But leaving a few hundred at Sam's Club for some DV tapes, some sodas and chips do not cut. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I have to mention how annoying it was to hear a woman being treated like "dude" throughout the movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves that intensively overused nickname for his male friends only where he is at least kind, where his friend Mike is worried! <br /> <br /> I think it's time for the indie film community to start calling these shoddy people. , videos without budget for what they are and simultaneously reprimand prestigious festivals to give such casual efforts, praise. Or, or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy of adding a new category to the festival's line up ... "Dude Films."
