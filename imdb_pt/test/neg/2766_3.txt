The movie begins with a little girl (Rita) watching her father get killed. He was apparently a criminal who shouted at his fellow thugs. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl grew into adulthood and STILL the past of her father haunts her! A little later, Rita finds a useless one and dates him. During one of his dates, he is a bit intoxicated and driving like a total idiot. The cops hunt and he walks away - killing a pedestrian meanwhile. Here comes the really stupid part. He convinces her to confess to the crime, since he guarantees that his lawyers can get her off the street. Why, oh, why would she agree to that? However, she does and spends the next two years in prison !! And shortly after his conviction, this boyfriend disappears - showing that he is a total leap. What an idiot !!! Later, after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) reports on the truth about her boyfriend. So he explains, the boyfriend's family is loaded and she should shake them for lots of money for all the trouble he put into her while doing the rap. Frankly, this makes sense - as they certainly owe her - especially since they knew she would go to jail and had every intention of using it and then throwing it aside. <br /> <br /> Now The idea of ​​bleeding money from rich idiots is a good idea. However, there is no way this would have happened in the first place because it is hard to believe that anyone can be so stupid as to take rap to a hit-and-run! In an interesting twist, the donkey decides on a life of crime - wearing a wig and catching a rich guy - leading him into the wilderness and stealing it with a gun! Wow ... how did she change! Apparently, she loves the idea of ​​stealing "farses" - that is, rich hypocrites. However, and that did not make sense, she soon stopped doing that and started shaking the old boy's father - why she bothered to do some petty thefts in the meantime made little sense. And what was also a little hard to believe was that, instead of wanting money from the old fool, she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mafia-controlled man for mayor. Strange ... very, very strange. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another plot unfolds involving a young Alan Ladd. He is an undercover agent who infiltrated the crowd. He was chosen because, by chance, he is an idiot for a real thug - what a cliché! But what does not make sense is that this real thug is not in jail and is committing crimes while the fake is infiltrating the crowd in another city. Eventually, evidence that Ladd is able to figure out is enough to issue warrants to the Mafia bosses - including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing, as in the meantime, she made the decision to become a decent and legitimate woman, as she met a very nice guy she wants to get married! Wow, what are the odds? Overall, this is a silly, half-assed movie that suffers from "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are many plot elements and strange twists to make the movie a bit believable. Also, since the film has just over an hour, everything seems very forced and artificial. It's a relatively poor PRC B movie studio just for Alan Ladd's performance shortly before he gained fame the following year at Paramount. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this DVD was released by Alpha Video --- a company that sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly in the public domain), but which NEVER wipes out the impressions or adds closed captions. In other words, the DVD production values ​​are strictly 3rd rate ... at best.
