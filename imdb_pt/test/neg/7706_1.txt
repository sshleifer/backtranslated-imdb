So many of these types of movies nowadays. This zombie movie falls into the main "cheese" category, unlike the much more polished dawn of the dead, and Day of the Dead. In all fairness, these two films were great studio releases with big budgets behind them. But they were good movies too. A low-budget movie can still be good if they stop accepting and using the worst scripts. Whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This film had such special effects and a very similar plot. The main difference from other such films is the time it takes for people to turn into zombies. In this, it seems to take only a few seconds for them to die and turn into a zombie. However, with the ease that this "infection" spreads, you may have zombie blood upon you and not even appear to be at risk for infection, and believe me, people in this are covered in blood. <br /> <br /> The main problem I had is that our 2 main stars sometimes were walking around dozens of zombies and were not bitten. When all the others turn into incredibly fast zombies, these two were attacked by zombies when they were unarmed and were able to get out of it without any problem. Our hot star still survived a missile attack on the building she was in. I was laughing at the load right now. Disarmed, having 10 zombies in it and a missile hits the building, but can she get away without a scratch? Of course, of course ... Also, whoever advised these people about how special forces behave obviously never spent any time in the military. They should have watched a movie like Blackhawk first to get at least an idea of ​​how they behave in combat situations. <br /> <br /> A soldier was a private fat obese soldier. LOL that was a good one. Another continued to rise to zombies thinking they were survivors, even putting their gun to one point. These guys are there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers of the movie Stripes. Special Forces, lol ... <br /> <br /> So they get to the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. The explanation is confusing and does not even follow the first film. It did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the jokes of the Anti Bush. The military lady at the beginning told them that the order came from the vice president to the president and in the end was the vice president of an "undisclosed location" giving the orders. That was the best part of the movie for me.
