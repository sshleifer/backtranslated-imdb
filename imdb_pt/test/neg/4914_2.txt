I often wonder how movies like this are still made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar, it seems that the director invented the story as he went along. Adding twists and turns when he liked them, it did not matter how ridiculous they were. The script was non-existent with futile dialogues like "Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai" and "Yeh Versace hai Madam" (yes, right). <br /> <br /> Each of the characters was superficial and underdeveloped. Acting was horrible. It constitutes (Lycra for Udita and terrible suits for a stocky Emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors do not even vaguely resemble a Victorian mansion), script etc etc, just a word - rubbish. <br /> <br /> For those people who love Hashmi and his movies, watch. As for me, I'll never get those two and a half hours back. The only redeeming factor was some of the music that was decent.
