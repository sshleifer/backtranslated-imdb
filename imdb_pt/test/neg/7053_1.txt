This movie should have ended as soon as the joke about Bebe's Kids was told at the opening. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really funny routines were not supposed to be something that the whole family could see. Take on the role of one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and try to squeeze the joke for as long as possible to turn it into a movie. This movie had to be self-service because I can not find someone who found the settings or family antics. What is funnier about this movie is the good sense of writers and producers to pass it on as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
