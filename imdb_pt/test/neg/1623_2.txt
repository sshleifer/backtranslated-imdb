The redeemable quality of the film (besides the actor's thong) is the hilarious performance of the villain, Zor. This wonderfully exaggerated villain has a certain ... Shakespearian presence that made this film bearable (hence the 2). I just laughed every time he pirated, raising an incredulous eyebrow at the henchman or hero. A true example of someone who is not paid enough. (And that BEARD!) <br /> <br /> Now, actually, what happened to the 12-minute hang-gliding scene? Really, really, really bad. I can not emphasize that point enough. <br /> <br /> So seriously, if you deign to see this movie, watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. With those beloved silhouettes, many horrendous movies were tolerated.
