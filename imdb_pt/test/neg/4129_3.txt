"Three" is a seriously stupid wreck movie. Masked as a psychological thriller, the closest relative is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also with Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provided well-designed characters to root in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's grieving parents trying to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrified by Zane's psychotic killer. It provided an acute suspense, increasingly reinforced, a frightening feeling of claustrophobia in open seas when the game of cat and mouse of life and death unfolded. "Three" suffers from poorly drawn characterization (the audience does not care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary device, a total lack of suspense or excitement and a few beats, damaging performances of the main players. Zane, in particular, overtakes the top in an irritatingly polite manner. In "Dead Calm" he was menacing, bonded and boiling with poorly controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, petulant, viscous and unraveled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dried cigarettes and cigars? And how did his lighter get full of juice for over a year? Mrs. Brook is very picturesque, incredibly beautiful, but both the chest and the back seem to have been overly inflated by some sort of life raft bomb. They, however, can act with more skill and conviction than the rest of it. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. The guy who played the vodka-souring Manuel, the third component of this sad triangle, could have been replaced by a piece of wood - no one would notice. In fact, judging by its total lack of ability to deliver the dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in cast bets (apology). <br /> <br /> More sides: the scenery is good and the cinematography (above and below the water) is believable. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing this had a very limited theatrical release (if any) or went straight to the rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is that it is not very good. If you want something decent along these lines, get "Dead Calm". It was made by people who knew a little about cinema.
