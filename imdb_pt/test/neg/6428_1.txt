Well, that was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview was the entire movie. No plot, no clear plot, just some misplaced suspense. It seems that the director has tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystique and fear, but there are still gaps to be filled. Why drugs? Why the number 11.11? (Btw. As Sarah enters the library, the clock says 11.14) What is the connection with the murder of the parents? What is the role of this woman Rayden? Is she one of the children or not? Who are these kids anyway. There's a lot of stuff out there to create the best cult movie as "the omen," but the director just leaves them lying on the floor without going into history. Even the "Blairwitch project" was scarier than this. Any gaps that you expect to be filled, such as "The Butterfly Effect", will remain open as credits begin to roll .. OK. For the next movie ...
