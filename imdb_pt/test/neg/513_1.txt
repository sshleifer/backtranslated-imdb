Don Wilson star as Jack Cutter (Ooh real name difficult!) A vampire killer who faces an army of vampires, you see that the story is a bit different because vampires can not be killed with silver, crosses or sunlight necks ( How convenient because it lowers the budget) and here is Cutter runs to a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame) The action sequences of Night Hunter shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although it is to emphasize humor, the most shocking movie. What is worse is that these sequences of fights are unbelievable, since Wilson's martial art is disguised by a disjointed edition. Of course the biggest interest comes from the fact that, in fact, this is prior to Blade, however, the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that he had Don Wilson in it. It's from Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a movie that most people would pay to not see. I unfortunately am a bottom feeder and I pick up the section of the store that looks for gems, in this line of work you always run into crap. With Night Hunter, I can have the world's most stinking poop. <br /> <br /> 1/2 of 4 (horrible)
