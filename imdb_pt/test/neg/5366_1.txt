I was excited to see this show when I started watching the promos at A & E. I've been fascinated by ghosts and paranormal since I was a kid, and I love getting Ghost Hunters when he's on (SciFi Channel). I tried watching three episodes of "Paranormal State" and just used my time commenting on it because it is so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible aberration. "Paranormal State" is beyond cheesy. Cheesy "Director's Log" voice-overs that will leave you wishing for Captain Kirk. Cheese teasers entering commercial breaks that are taken out of context. Everything that is paranormal in this show is automatically considered "evil" and the work of a demonic spirit. Then come the exorcists, demonologists, psychics ... as in "Poltergeist" you almost expect the team to come out and say "This house is clean". I very much appreciate the "Ghost Hunters" approach, in which they go to refute the statements, then take what they can ... and are almost always comforting to the client (if they find anything) that haunted is not equal to evil . "Paranormal State" is not "so bad that it's good" ... it's just bad. Did not A & E mean "Arts & Entertainment"? The artistic part has already passed a long time, and the entertainment factor is also diminishing.
