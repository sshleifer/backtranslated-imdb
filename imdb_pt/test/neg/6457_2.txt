Talk about misleading advertising! What was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental location? I think there was perhaps a ridiculous part in the movie. I can enjoy the black comedy, but this only had the blackness without any comedy. The movie was generally disturbing and not funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy and the rest of the cast was good as well, but usually the film falls apart because we do not really see a reason enough for Guy (Whaley) to lose so much of his head. The ending was also disappointing. What would be Buddy's motivation to let Guy get along with what he did? This is not really explained at all. Why would Buddy go to such a plan? Would not it be more like Buddy to have sex with Guy completely, handing him over to the police? The ending did not seem to make much sense to me, no matter how I looked at it. <br /> <br /> Generally, I did not like the movie despite the good acting. Spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film, but in the end it gives Buddy some of the humanity needed. The story was not as good as the cast.
