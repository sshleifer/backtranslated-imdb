Leon Errol deals superbly with his double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I find it hard to like the "Spitfire Mexican" series because they are all invented to produce wrong identities, and these are telegraphed far in advance. Errol is funny as the stuffy Lord Epping, but I'd much rather much more intelligence and less repetition. <br /> <br />
