Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiancé, played by Reginald Owen, stranded in Labrador when his plane crashes. (That's really what should have happened with this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while he's waiting for his fiancé. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy soon feel attracted to each other. The scene with the bear is so artificial. We knew he was a domesticated bear all the time. <br /> <br /> The complications happen when Clara appears. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara they should separate, when he refuses, she wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end. Out with all that snow, it's too cold for anyone!
