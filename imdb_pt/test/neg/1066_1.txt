I really hate and despise this movie and the filmmakers behind it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm all for making a hard and honest movie about youth and youth culture. "River's Edge" from 1987 is a prime example of a well-made teenage drama. However, what I question is the childish, dirty, sensationalist approach that the "2:37" creators have adopted. <br /> <br /> A good example is how it raises so many problems and still fails in any way to comment or come to a resolution on any of them. My other big problem with this movie, in addition to its full plagiarism of "Elephant" by Gus Van Sant (surprised Van Sant has not sued) is his attitude of 'bull loose in a porcelain shop' for rather delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide. <br /> <br /> In short, avoid this movie like the plague and anything that this filmmaker is involved in later. I have heard that your motivation to do "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. Having seen the result below standard, this does not surprise me at all. This is a glorified student film exercise that has nowhere to be in a movie theater or on DVD. Pure and simple.
