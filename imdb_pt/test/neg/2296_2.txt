Calling this decent or nice horror tribute movie is too optimistic. Heck, you can not even refer to it as a good parody of the genre, because it's way below average (it's funny, but not "haha-funny, you know.) But still I'd say take a look. for the huge amount of trivial elements in it.By the way, all the people who are complaining about this movie here in their comments only have to blame themselves.When you see the DVD cover of this movie, you should already know that not will be on the same level as "The Piano", for example, so do not come to complain later ... <br /> <br /> Evil Ed could have been something, but it totally messed it up.I suppose the main idea behind this film is the critique of the growing 'cutting committee' in horror nowadays. It shows an editor named Edward who is slowly (well, not too slow) going crazy seeing all the violence and violence in the films produced. His name is Sam Campbell ... Funny, is not it? u also expected a character named Bruce Raimi, but there was no surprise. Anyway, this guy got rich making movies called "Loose Limbs". They present (and I'm not kidding you!) Scenes in which a girl is being raped by a BEAVER (?) And then gets shot in the head by a bazooka !!! Now, who says horror is not more original? <br /> <br /> With all the blood and "loose limbs," it's hard to believe, but it gets really boring really fast. After a decent first 25 minutes, Evil Ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from it. The only thing left to do (aside from pushing the eject button, of course) is to look for the obvious amount of references to far better horror movies. I've seen obviously stolen scenes from The Evil Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Braindead and several others. And there are a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well. <br /> <br /> Evil Ed discovers In Sweden. I'm convinced there's a lot of talent out there in the far north (take the Danish "Nattevagten" as an example) ... but none of them have joined the cast or crew of Evil Ed. Just to see if you're in a bad mood and not wants to use his brain.
