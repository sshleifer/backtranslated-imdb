Another son of Sam is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's horrible. The acting is not good either. But there is something about it that makes you want to watch more (like a car accident). The ridiculous close-ups of the killer's eyes are funnier than anything. If you're looking for a scare ... this is not the movie for you. It is very dark and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while, it was titled HOSTAGE. No matter what you call it, it's still a poor choice for entertainment. It might be good for an MST3000 party or something. Do you believe they would use that title as ANOTHER SAM SON? If this does not have written exploration everywhere, I'll eat my hat. I remember when this was filmed in Belmont, North Carolina. Many local personalities were used as talent.
