I remember getting this movie on one of Showtime's channels. What stood out for me is that this movie happens entirely in Phoenix, Arizona. I am from there, so I locate the locations easily. <br /> <br /> Regardless, a ninja kills a scientist because they wear yellow sweaters and golf, which is pursued by the police. It takes about half of the police force to knock him down and when they eventually kill him, there are no discernible bullet wounds. His spirit lives however, when a woman finds her and touches her katana. From then on, she is periodically possessed and kills the cops who killed the original ninja. Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja. This can be a plot device of the two previous films, or perhaps a plot hole. All I know is that this movie is very exaggerated, bad and fun. This is something to watch with a tub of popcorn and several friends and give the MST3K treatment.
