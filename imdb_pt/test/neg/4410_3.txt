** May contain spoilers ** An unhappy South Sea dweller is run by other natives (Caucasian-looking) after he befriends visiting scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. The meddling scientists unearth it and discover that it took the form of a humanoid tree. He comes to life and goes in a riot and sure enough, that 50's bogeyman, the atomic bomb, is guilty of this aberration. To claim that this particular monster walks as if it had a stick would be redundant. Suffice it to say that the animal crawls, like the movie itself, throwing its enemies into some quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments. Paul Blaisdell created the man-tree costume and is hardly his best work. Over the years, this movie has been subject to many comments like "To hell, you can go!" Personally I think it's the best tree movie I've ever seen.
