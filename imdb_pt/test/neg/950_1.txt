I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer I was expecting a very elegant martial arts movie with lots of action and maybe a little plot to think along the way. I was very disappointed as it seems that once you have seen the trailer, there is nothing else worth watching (if what you are expecting is as described above). My girlfriend then gave up halfway and while I continued to watch in the hope that something interesting could happen ... nothing happened. I did not find any attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I'd just say do not bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you really do not mind losing.
