Brilliant acting, great plot, wonderful special effects! This is what I would say about this movie if I were watching with a bag of diarreha in my head throughout the movie. Instead, I endured a crap for 2 hours. Our "brilliant" story begins with some billionaires who have nothing better to do than look at volcanoes in a vain attempt to find their lucky amulets. Instead, he meets a 5'4 "man in a rubber dinosaur suit and some strange people from the cave. In his infinite wisdom, (along with his infinitely large nose) he decides to enter this volcano with a team of "special" people.To travel to this underground earth, do they go by plane? No. Boat? No. They use that giant can of soup with a "solid metal" drill at the end that I swear I saw oscillation In short, this movie was fake than .... Oh, that's right! This was the most fake movie I've ever seen! For those of you who have not seen and are planning on sitting down on a Sunday afternoon with this wonderful I warn you! <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, you should be prepared to cut off any fragment of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! allows a minimum of 1/10 I give this a 10/10!
