Frankly I met the true Han Su Ying before and saw her pictured by an American actress who bears no resemblance to anything Chinese makes my head spin while I watch this movie Why Hollywood can not get Nancy Kwan ... at least she's more faithful to the story ... because for the love of God ... Dr. Han Su Ying is Chinese I know because I met her personally <br /> <br /> and looking at all the cast .... so few Asian faces in a movie about an Asian love story also make me think <br /> <br /> I think the acting is good but without Asian faces in an Asian love story makes the plot so tacky and a whole load of Baloney /> <br /> It's like another movie that I know 'THE CONQUEROR' Imagine my eyes popping when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and to make matters worse. ... how on earth can a man born of race in MONGOLIAN STEPPES come to a Southern Alabama accent ??? !! and a cheap imitation of anything Asian <br /> <br /> Good heartache <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that one day I'm going to see Dr. Martin Luther King Jr being played by One of the boys of black and white minstrels show <br /> <br /> I'd love to see this <br /> <br /> and laugh all over the roof !!! <br /> <br />
