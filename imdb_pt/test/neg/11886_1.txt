This film tells the true story of fugitive black slaves who found their own commune at the top of the mountain as free men in seventeenth-century Brazil. The story is interesting and uplifting. However, this movie - like a movie - is terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. It's Afro-Brazilian pop music from the early 1980's. Battle scenes are fought with sounds of cheesy pop rhythms, best left for the disco or for bad cop dramas. Admittedly, the lyrics are folk tales of the heroism of the slaves. Special effects are absurd. Instead of invoking the mysticism of the African religion and the atavistic beliefs, they just make the movie look cheap. They are completely unbelievable, and I do not mean just a sense of verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> Life within the commune of Palmares could not have been as portrayed in the film. For this society, as shown in the film, is a part of the kibbutz, a part of the afro-pop festival. Moreover, it is almost embarrassing to see the director interpreting the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. It portrays everyday life as a series of dance parties in which freed slaves paint themselves brightly and turn to the 1980s pop line. On the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful food but the spectator hardly ever sees any work being done. The king invests against private property in a banal and cliché way. When a man complains that people are taking the vegetables he has cultivated for many months, the king says, "What comes from the earth belongs to everyone, for the earth belongs to no one. If they need food, they have the right to get yours. "<br /> <br /> I'm glad I learned about this episode in the story, but I'm relieved that a film with such low production values ​​and dealing with such worn stereotypes is probably not done today.
