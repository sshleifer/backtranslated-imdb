What can be said about such a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> - Very bad acting! The leading actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a poor dog beaten up ... The other actress (who does evil) looks like Ozzy Osbourne's female duo with a horrible red wig. The other actors are so deplorable that they do not deserve to be described. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with possibilities, but it does not work at all: we know nothing about the meaning of "11:11", nor who Rayden really is, except for the simple "she is evil" or "she is a child of the Apocalypse". is not an explanation. We do not know why the parents were killed, what kind of danger is growing and why Sara was chosen. As the movie continues, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes with bad music. In addition, the ending says nothing: we only see two possibilities as if one of them were a bonus scene or the cut of the director ... There is no plot, so no interpretation possible. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I could not help laughing. For example: the deserted library or bathroom scenes, silhouettes of ghosts walking with a gust of wind, ... there is even the elegant "scary little girl" as in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotypical gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, black and thin clothes). Is it a must to make it credible? I think not. Sara's psychology is so underdeveloped and so typical that it does not make it credible or captivating. <br /> <br /> - Terrible direction: like I said, nothing original, everything has been seen a thousand times. and is used here for no real purpose. <br /> <br /> There are some funny inconsistencies. For example, I do not know whether "ghost science", "paranormal course" or what is taught in American universities ... In Europe, this is not really the case: teachers speaking of negative energies or using sensors of "non-material" creatures ". .. ridiculous. Also: how can you watch a movie shot in the 60s with a super-8 camera on the computer screen without spending hours of your time for a scan (in the movie they instantly watch on the computer screen) and how can you, this movie old, isolate a tiny detail, then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analog movie ... <br /> <br /> Eventually, "11:11" is only worth watching if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you You want to fall asleep on your couch ... But it's an expensive way to fall asleep!
