In 1994, the Power Rangers had become a big franchise and TV executives of USA Network were hoping to take part in the action and created the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters of Beverly Hills, in which the evil Emporer Gorganus, who seems to be wearing a Darth Vader costume at home, and his talking bird, which looks like a rubber chewable toy, come to earth invade you by using giant monsters that seem rejected from a 70s Godzilla movie. Fortunately, Nimbar, an alien looking like a giant piece of clean gelatine , recruits four teenagers to defend the land, Nimbar gives them a tattoo of a different constellation that allows them to become superheroes who look like dancers from a decade of eighties. video clip, they could also be combined into a giant knight. Forty episodes were made. The USA Network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from Japan like Power Rangers did, and created that program on its own using the budget of a science fiction movie from the 1950s. The fight scenes are generic, the special effects are bad and some of the sets seem to fall off. The actors realized how ridiculous the show was and practically bothered him. I can only imagine their shock when the show was canceled.
