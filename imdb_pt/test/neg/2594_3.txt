Family Guy. When the show was aired for the first time, it was new, original and really funny. Now I stopped watching. It has become one of the worst shows on television, combining boring, repetitive jokes, prolonged jokes, and the hope that every joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word "whore." Seth Macfarlane clearly has problems with himself, and he's obviously favoring the audience of 13-year-old boys. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how something that started so funny, so different from everything, can become this horrible mess of a "comedy" show. I've been seriously listening to a better liner than a comic pud. <br /> <br /> It's really sad to see great shows fail, and watch comments like that. Either Seth Macfarlane has stopped trying, or he believes this show is hilarious the way it is. <br /> <br /> Anyway, God help us. <br /> <br /> I hate this show, and I'll dance an Irish jig when it's finally canceled.
