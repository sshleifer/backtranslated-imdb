This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious. I like to compare him to Plan 9, in that he can be so bad, so horrible, so stupid, and a waste of time that I catch myself laughing out loud. <br /> <br /> One of my biggest problems with this is that it's a complete imitation of Robin Hood, and be honest and say that I love Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. But let's face it, for the forbidden love between Peck (which is definitely fading in. Although, in all fairness, there is still a few years left for the masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird) and the female character (who is so forgetful, apparently, that I forgot her name.), to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys shouting "ROBIN HOOD" all over. <br /> <br /> However, I do not think the movie is not worth seeing. On the contrary, I think this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years, even if it was not intentional.
