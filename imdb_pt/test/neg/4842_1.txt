I mean, come on! Now my compatriots have begun to make you proud! Is not it enough that our movies already suck? Now you need to infect English movies with Polish acting and no sense? Please stay away from this movie, do not lose your eyes on it. A five-year-old could make a movie that makes more sense. I am from Poland and I am ashamed that this title can really be observed by you. Please, I'm begging you, DO NOT watch this movie and if you do, DO NOT judge the Poles and Polish films based on what you see there. We've had some good movies in our history and we've had some bad ones, but this one - it's like nothing worse than I've seen in my entire life. Keep away!!!
