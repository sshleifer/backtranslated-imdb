Your time and brain will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's War. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the most entertaining character in the film, Gust, the Greek, and he plays him as a eunuch. Gust, in the book, is a hard core and completely free to speak his mind. In the film, it is not even shown to be equally important to Charlie. And poor Charlie is never shown donating blood (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is very mild, and the story is very old for our modern time. We did not really care about the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which happened despite Reagan, not as a result) by a well-funded group of people who were extremely willing to fight. It is not quite the lesson we need to hear and see how the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going. (As I read the book, I got that feeling of déjà vu, except it was present day).
