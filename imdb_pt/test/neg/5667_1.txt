Again, like many other TV shows, a certain actor / actress enters the limelight, in this case Miranda Cosgrove, having built her reputation in previous films / series (especially by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider. movie). show, begins to sing the soundtrack (which she did not write and thus gets even more fame). Wonderful? This creates so much imbalance in popularity against his other co-stars, especially Nathan Kress, who is continually pushed for minors. In every episode except iDont Want to Fight, Cosgrove's music would never have found the charts without this show and she sang the main song (which was not written by her) and other covers like About You Now and Stay My Baby. do not forget that she also synced your music live. Is this how you create vocalist today? Back at the show, Cosgrove reveals more physically portraying scenes of bikini, hula-type hula bra and bra often mentioned on the outside. seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). Wedgies are mentioned, panties were mentioned once. Og let's not forget "Oh My God", a phrase that comes (is any of the writers / actors Christian?). Granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids, I'm surprised by the multitude of mentions to female underwear. , especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointed breasts" have been mentioned. I'm not sure if the kids would abstain from saying this at home / at school afterwards. <br /> <br /> It is not that I am against mentioning or exhibiting women's underwear (which the girls will wear), but for a Nickelodeon show, those responsible should have realized that children would have such exposure thing. I doubt other Nickelodeon shows have such content. As mentioned in other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many places - for example, when the character Sam cries, how earth is it time to laugh? This distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, Cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the maximum fame and support from the hardcore fans who even chided a hotel staff when told to keep their noise level (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the show, but she faces Cosgrove's competition in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single against Cosgrove's covers). As noted, the third co-star Nathan Kress is the least noticed of the lot. He is portrayed as an atypical boy who suffers the impact of bullying by a girl and other boys, but somehow a wizard of technology. His height in the early episodes makes him a cute but unusual actor, given his character's passion for Carly / Cosgrove. In addition, Kress is not entering the music industry, and as the fame of Cosgrove increases with each episode, Kress is left behind. I'd bet he's the least paid of all three actors. <br /> <br /> The content of the program is of course fictional, but it also lets us imagine how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (so the laughing lane is used). It also contains several continuity errors (how can your father and the Air Force Colonel be in a submarine? US Special Forces have their own branches and the Air Force does not use US submarines SEALs). A unique feature is to allow viewers to submit their own videos to appear during or after the episodes, but again, the videos somehow do not address the comedy theme. <br /> <br /> Once again, it is a program that is full of mentions of women's clothing, skin exposure and the use of used laughing bands. It's a series that pushes a teenage actress so far in the crowd, so that her songs / actions are overly supported by her fans, leaving her co Stars behind.
