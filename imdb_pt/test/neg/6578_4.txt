I like underdogs. So, 12 years after seeing Star Trek V for the first time, and thinking it was strangely bad, I took a second look, hoping to find some quality that I missed the first time. The writing is half-cooked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the film on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we move in the plot the idiot stays. The last quarter of the movie is just ridiculous. What was even worse, from the point of view of the original cast, is that this was the first film to be released after the franchise returned to television with Next Generation, and the next Generation episode of The Next Generation would embarrass * - including special effects ! What embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The Final Frontier is not completely miserable - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it is far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first) than the one The reason why I can think of watching is why you will enjoy the other movies more. <br /> <br /> Unless it's an episode with Troi's mother.
