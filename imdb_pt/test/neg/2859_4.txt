Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. Nor is it terrible. <br /> <br /> The performance was wooden, at least in the part of Pinocchio. The doll had all two expressions. Like most of the actors, except as incredible as it sounds ... the minor characters ... most of them were nice on top of it. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very "B" and, as I said earlier, the doll really exploded. <br /> <br /> The 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand ... looked pretty good, I think they spent about a third of the budget on that ... and the shower scene. .. WOW ... I think they must have spent the other 2 / 3rds of the budget on talking to the actress who made that scene to do it. Outstanding. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a little below average "b" horror puppet movie ... rent Chucky if you have a desire to see puppets kill. <br /> <br /> The story had some interesting ideas, enough to keep me watching until the end.
