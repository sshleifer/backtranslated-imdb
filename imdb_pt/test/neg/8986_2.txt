The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to relive her childhood traumatic past (the death of her childhood friend and violent father). Tory discovers that her friend was only the first in a series of murders that are still occurring. Can your psychic powers help solve the crimes and prevent the ongoing killings? <br /> <br /> You really do not need to find out why, Oh my God! That was so so bad! I know all fans of Nora Roberts are going to join this movie and give tons of 10. So the rest of us will see a score of 6 on IMDb and really think it's worth watching this movie. But do not be fooled. The ending was predictable, the role of TERRIBLE actor (do not even tell me about the southern accents * you *) and the story was banal. Just remember ... you've been warned!
