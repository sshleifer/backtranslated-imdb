The acting was horrible. Special effects, though exceptional, dominated the film. The writing was pathetic and the dialogue was unbelievable. And the little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place. <br /> <br /> But the worst offense of "Armageddon" was the complete lack of scientific reality. "The asteroid is the size of Texas," says Billy Bob Thornton. This is 800 miles wide! Does not anyone at NASA even see the asteroid until a midnight meteor shower destroys New York? Suuuuure Does NASA hire a drilling team to join the astronauts and train them in a week? Okay, right. Does anybody bring a sidekick on the Space Shuttle with them? Yes, this is realistic. And Bruce Willis explodes the asteroid with three seconds to spare. Like Disney-esque! <br /> <br /> How bad was this movie? I twisted by the asteroid!
