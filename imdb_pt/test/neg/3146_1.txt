When I was younger (oh, about 2), I watched Barney for the first time and enjoyed it. BUT, at that time I did not exactly have a brain either. And now I look back and see what a horrible show "Barney" really is: First of all, EVERYTHING on that show is scary. Barney, the main character, is a horrible 9-meter talking dinosaur that teaches 13-year-old boys about "imagination ..." BJ (I know what you're thinking about his name). a smaller but scary yellow dinosaur, which is placed to be "supposudly" cool. But, in fact, it is exactly the opposite. After watching a few episodes with B.J. changing his tone with his cap slightly turned back, and making some not-so-funny jokes, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god (* vomiting *) oh-oh-oh-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of ​​a character EVER. She is a green triceratop (it is a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. His observations of "hee-hee-hee" and Barney praise the cries of "super-deeee-doooper," make it difficult to keep up with each episode while seventh-graders learn about shapes and manners. <br /> <br /> And that, my friend, is what makes this show really horrible.
