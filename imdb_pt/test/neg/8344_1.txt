I saw this movie and thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is the one who thought of an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes, which is a real fact that this movie was to be made in the state capital of Hawaii. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, this is unbelievable absurdity and very foolish. In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.
