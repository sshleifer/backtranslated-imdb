I had not heard of Soap Girl, but I saw a poster with a five-star review of Film Threat outside the theater, so I realized, how bad could it be? Well, I found out. My God, this movie was horrible. The most wood acting I've ever seen outside of a porn movie. Absolutely agonizing dialogue. I just can not understand how this was done and why someone agreed to be a part of it. And I find it completely unfathomable that this was being shown in a theater and that money was being charged to see it. How did this happen????? And more importantly, what was the guy in the movie THREAT THINKING?!?!?!?!
