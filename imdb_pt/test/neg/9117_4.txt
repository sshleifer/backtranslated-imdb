Critics were like "a movie that will break your heart," etc. So a friend of mine and I had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I will summarize and leave others to write about their content. This movie tries to touch you, to reach your heart. But this fails. At least for me. And for my friend too. <br /> <br /> Everything that happened happened just on the screen. It was always there, not here, where I am. I thought most of the time "hmm, something is happening on the screen, but it's just on the screen. It's not real." (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Mies vailla menneisyytt√§ (2002)
