Lucius Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter films, especially his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a kind of black comedy, but there is only one problem: it is nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also disgusting, but not so). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habit, dating ugly and deformed rich women, then killing them and stealing their money. The film makes this plan seem so easy. I think women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their money in person. After the eleventh murder, I began to suspect what I had always heard about Fulci: he hated women. He should have. Anyway, this movie smells bad, not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with zombie movies and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
