This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a bad movie. The direction only gives the impression that the film was invented while Patrick Swaze is so wooden that you can almost see the puppet strings on his body. Spy-on-spy movies are not - or should not - about hunts and car shoot-outs, the bad guys in those movies are really bad and lose the main characters even when they are at point-blank range. <br /> <br /> Even the action scenes are just a clich√© of mounting sidewalks and breaking through tables and chairs - yawning. <br /> <br /> I've got half way and off - completely bored.
