The director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this terribly ill-done project of having seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his two previous Qatsi films, is hopelessly confused here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughing heads, etc., mingle without purpose. The banal imagery parade is largely generic to Getty Images et al, and heavy digital manipulations are amateurs in the worst imaginable way. Certainly someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Could you have pointed out that applying a solarizing filter to almost every picture was a MISCURE? Looping, layering and distortion of images resemble a class of freshmen in Photoshop. And to make matters worse, computer animation sequences are more artistic than a 1980s Wall Street pie chart. That's not to say that only improved aesthetics would have saved this movie, but some meager efforts in that direction can have made it tolerable as a visual basis for accompanying music. I feel compelled to point out that Philip Glass's score will surely satisfy his fans. It's not a radical departure, but a refinement of what Glass does best with lovely Yo Yo Ma violin contributions. If you decide to watch this movie, focus your attention on the brief opening sequence. While you may already be familiar with once majestic Detroit but long abandoned Michigan Central Railroad Station 89 minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of the 20th century decadence as the critical point when you should have gone to the sign EXIT / press the STOP button, You have been warned.
