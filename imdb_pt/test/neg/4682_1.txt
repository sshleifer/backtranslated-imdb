As I write this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of Sweeney Todd's tale is making a lot of money at the box office and the film even earned some Oscar nominations if I'm not mistaken. I have not seen it yet, but I sincerely hope that Burton did not look for inspiration and / or style marks on Andy Milligan's "Bloodthirsty Butchers." Yes, even though the title clearly mentions the butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and a female bard. Together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she processes the bodies in their famous London meat pies. In other words, a premise of Andy Milligan in its most typical, derivative, delusional and amateur form. I think the IMDb rating for this movie speaks for itself. Although the real story is definitely not the worst I've ever seen, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts sheer ineptitude. The production is a gigantic mess with an incoherent narrative structure, really stinking photography, poor lighting, poor acting and direction, gore and zilch tension, or atmosphere. More than half of the footage is pure and the words do not describe how boring the film is, even with a mere 80 minute run time. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; do not you need to fear like no one else than Andy Milligan is ?? hands down ?? the worst director of all time, but I think he did not care. Maybe if you rule out a really high level of tolerance, "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is worth being seen.
