The most unbelievable so-called comedy I've ever seen <br /> <br /> It's not a patch on the naturalism of the hilarious Twin Town challenge <br /> <br /> Vegas me as usual but this script is so terrible predictable as well English in the worst way (In recent years, English films were terrible all of them) Ireland at least produced the commitments, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 highlight great films and Wales had Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days of Dolwyn , Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood, etc. <br /> <br /> The comedy is painted by numbers, the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterization and no originality and it is so bland <br /> <A England is falling behind, no matter how many dark northern films they produce. It's the old class system that destroys English movies. The Oxbridge graduates spitting out endless clichÃ© scripts about working class people with whom they never lived. This is pathetic. Monty Python was not funny, nor was he anything about Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> Leave guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or write your own dialogues and forget the archaic bankrupt class system. The class people and the real talent coming through the system appropriately appropriate writing and the British and British film industries will re-emerge, the next Prince Edward writing a modern day Oliver Twist?
