At the very least, some of the sitcoms that leave tirelessly from the US are downright bad. This garbage, however, depicts a "warm-up side of the heart" regarding a clothing horse. Acting ridiculously "learned" with looks and phrases delivered in fashion "I am SO important and lean and beautiful". In the episode I sat down, someone's "job" was at stake simply because a colleague had "put" a phone call, stealing his skills ... !! Actually, this is the lowest of the lows. What kind of damage this causes in the masses watching, seeing only flashy glam-puss people who parade around "work." Completely unhealthy. When the bonds rolled, I thought, ah, well, that gave jobs to the boys. You know who you are.
