This movie smells like production line planning. It looks like the filmmakers reviewed the recent hit movies and played spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Drink! Airplane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film addresses the age of Stewart / Allyson's artists; though, I am sure we should still think that they are much younger. There are messages in the "Strategic Air Command" that I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I'll stick with a truly disgraceful element: The happily married couple is challenged when Stewart's character makes an important decision without consult his wife. In the most dramatic scene of the film, she calls it. This ends completely without solution - Allyson is crying with the heart in the bed, and Stewart leaves towards her. NO discussion; he simply says that it is correct and leaves in his wife devastated. For all he knows, she could cut his wrists. <br /> <br /> Later, Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Stay with Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
