Ghoulies IV begins at a museum storage facility where the blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) is looking for an antique jewel, after hanging up several guards she summons the demon Faust whom she loves and wants to have sex with her, unfortunately she lost the jewel then he is not very happy and orders her to receive the last one ... Which belongs to Jonathan Graves (who returns from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis) who is experienced in demonic possession and things like that after the events of the original Ghoulies Alexandra begins to find the jewel to be able to bring Faust to Earth permanently from the "other side" to, well, I do not really know. Yeah, it's really about that ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Wynorski, whose own name gives shivers when it's attached to a movie that I'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on Goulies IV is as I expected total crap, total and absolute from start to finish and it's as simple and straightforward as that. The 'script', cough, by Mark Sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies movie except in his title and they have managed to persuade Liapis to reprise his role which also has the added advantage of being able to use images from the original , although it has no relevance. The story is almost non-existent, the whole film is a difficult task to watch, it's incredibly annoying and stupid, it's slow, predictable, it's completely clean with blood or blood and it has two comic elves I presume are supposed to fill the quota Ghoulies even though they do not look like the previous movies and are actually just embarrassing to watch, in fact I think they were practicing to be ventriloquist for most of the movie, like when they talk t move ... You know that I do not want to talk or think about the Ghoulies IV so please believe me when I say that this is a big piece of crap of the size of the Elephant, do not waste your time or money. Director Wynorski transforms a completely rotten movie into almost every level, the special effects are terrible, just like the whole movie. Apparently Ghoulies IV claims to be some kind of horror comedy, but loses both targets by the proverbial mile and is neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this movie is the actress Randall in her PVC clothing and leather running around trying to find the jewelry and this is not worth sitting through this crap to see. There is a decadent half decadent car scene with a few accidents, but it looks like it was edited in a completely different movie and given Wynorski's track record, I'm sure it was. Forget anything that does not exist. <br /> <br /> Technically Ghoulies IV sucks, it's obvious that she has a low budget, but that simply is not an excuse to be that bad, is it? Liapis is back in the cast, although he probably wishes he stayed away, the PVC cat Randall is easily the best thing about this movie that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV sucks, there's nothing more to really say. I honestly do not see anyone who likes movies taking any of this, I just can not. I can not believe I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies about anything, but this is going to happen now because even though this sucks, it's a lot better than the Ghoulies IV, one to avoid people and you can thank me later. The things I sit so you do not have to, honestly ...
