Oh my God!!!! This was the first movie that Broken Lizard did as a group (although it has just hit the video), and I've never been more disappointed in my entire life !!! I tell you, if I had seen this movie before I saw Super Troopers (which, by the way, is a kicking movie A $$ !!!), I would never have watched !! I had read several reviews online as well as on the cover of the DVD, which delirium as being, "Brokenest Lizard's funniest movie ever!" Now, if they were referring to Super Troopers as being the funniest movie of all time, I would agree non-stop but not this one. Talk about dry. It took the movie a good 45 minutes to continue, and until then, I was so out of the mood to watch, it was not even worth it. Maybe you have to be tall to make it really funny? Do not know. I love these guys, I really like them, but this movie is by far the worst they've done. Club Dread was a very good movie, but this one, just wow. I recommend Super Troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want more of a romance, drama, with some funny points, I'd say go with Puddle Cruiser. Just my opinion though, everyone is entitled to their own! :)
