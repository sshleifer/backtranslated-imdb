I do not mind some adult humor, but this feature was simply dirty. The first 10 minutes consisted of Pryor cursing a guy taking pictures, following my swear words even more. I do not know what happened between the last 5 minutes because I left. After seeing this, I never looked at Richard Pryor in the same way. And to think that he actually went on to host a children's show. <br /> <br /> If dirty, nonsensical, bland swearing makes you laugh, then you'll probably like it. But if you're the "old-fashioned" type, do not bother.
