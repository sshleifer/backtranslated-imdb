This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and certainly the worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor ever made. I can not believe that the person who created the movie as Teen Deewarein can create such total crap. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film itself is actually defective that Zeenat has to look for Meera and get her leniency to help her husband avoid the death penalty in Soudi Arabia. The common logic is that if Zeenat can not easily search Meera, the Soudi government will not do so, so Zeenat can safely forge Meera's signature or fingerprint and produce it before Soudis. Another more stupid thing is that Shankar gave an incorrect address on his passport, so the Indian government authorities can not get to the address, but after some time Meera picks up Shankar's suitcase under Soudi's government. Wow!! Does not Soudis well connected to the net in India more than the Indians? <br /> Nagya does a little more than a special part in the film with the role of Chopra, who is eyeing Meera and looking for Meera's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad (this guy is just a waste) helps to keep her like a fortress. Nagya can not speak Hindi and was helped by other guys translating the dialogues in English he writes in Hindi. This time, it seems that his helper was in serious intoxication, writing dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (honesty jump). In a matter of minutes, for our worst nightmares, Meera not only makes this honest leap, she shuffles her feet to do "Imaan ka Naach" (honesty dance). <br /> <br /> One of the only bright films is its cinematography and really nice tones. But since Bollywood learned the thing called Post-Production, almost every movie has vibrant colors and well-mixed backgrounds, so it's no big deal. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that making an extravagant movie is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and all are ready to be affected.
