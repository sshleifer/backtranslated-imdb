This is the first recorded effort to put sound into a movie, and the oldest that obviously still exists. This historical film is the opening segment of the DVD "More treasures of natural archives". <br /> <br /> It's just a 15-second clip of a man playing violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. Beside him are two men dancing. Towards the end, another man enters the stage. William Dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violinist. This "movie" had several titles over the years, but the sound experiment was not really a success. It took more than 30 years from this point to synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the audience for entertainment. However, this was a start, no matter how primitive it was. <br /> <br /> For more technical information and history of this film process, see the other review here by "Boba Fett1138".
