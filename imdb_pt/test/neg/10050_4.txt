From time to time it is very advisable for the aristocracy to watch some silent film about the hard life of ordinary people in order to remember the privileges and the comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or even before? in comparison to the complicated and hard work ordinary people have to endure every day since the aristocrats dominate the world. <br /> <br /> And this is what happens in "The Love Light," the first film directed by Dame France Marion who will be famous later in the world silent and speaking thanks in general to his work as a writer; better for her, certainly, because her career as a film director does not impress this German count. The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford), a cheerful Italian girl who lives surrounded by a "picturesque misery" (an important difference of opinion between upper and lower classes, aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury"); she has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all she gives him in return is indifference. Destiny begins to work hard and soon the war is declared and the two brothers of Dame Angela enlist and in the next roll both are dead. But fate is even more cruel and Dame Angela, meanwhile, falls in love? a German !! And to make matters worse, she does not know that her Teutonic sweetheart is a spy and that the light signals she sends to him every night from the beacon she keeps thinking it's a sign of love do not mean "Ich Liebe Dich" but "sink any damn Italian boat into the sea"? <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dame Angela, soon her sweet German spy will be found by the neighbors in her house where she was hiding him (a not strange fact, in fact, because it is not an easy task for a German to pass unnoticed-but the German spy prefers to die before being captured by those Italians. <br /> <br /> Of that German love, a half-Teutonic born (the perverse Destiny at full speed?), but a greedy neighbor who has a a particular idea of ​​motherhood will take her son with the consent of a Catholic nun who took the Council of Trent to extremes-a fact that will leave Dame Angela on the edge of madness. <br /> <br /> But meanwhile, the secret admirer of Dame Angela has returned from the war and you may think that, finally, the sad life of Dame Angela will improve, a tremendous mistake, because Fate has reserved for her that the returned soldier is blind.But as they say in Germany, it may be a blessing in disguise and, finally Dame Angela will regain her son and will start a new life with her blind love in a poor Italian village in what is supposed to be a happy ending to the common. As this German count said before, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion than she continued her writing career, because as can be seen in "The Love Light," she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, ha wohl! but a completely different subject is to direct films and its silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm, despite the effort of Dame Pickford to involve the public with its many misfortunes. The non-existent cinematographic narrative causes indifference in the viewer, making this the kind of film in which only Dame Pickford herself provides the interest and not the circumstances of it. <br /> <br /> And now, if you will permit me, I must temporarily leave because this German count must send Morse signs from the north tower of Schloss to one of his Teutonic heirs.
