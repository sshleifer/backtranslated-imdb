Okay, is this horror? I'm horrified - but I do not look awful. Black and white is artistic, but too much black is an exaggeration ..... enough said about lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... It's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done ..... but hopefully not. My question is: when will the public get tired of reliving this maddening dilemma? I think the director thought he would do something different - portraying killing kids. Well, that was done before too. So I guess he had to go for shock value ..... have them killed in the darkest of fashions. Ok ..... the public was shocked ...... angry .... disgusted ..... asleep. And rising from my place, I felt all these things. So the director was successful? Yes! Absolutely! Those are the things he wanted me to feel and I did. Now what do I do with the feelings? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the incredible talent with which Francis Xavier was "gifted" with ... could he consider applying it to making films that speak, dare I say, coming out of the darkness? I was in the dark after seeing this movie, my soul was beaten .... this is what this vessel is about? There are a lot of these films out there - they make the money they tell me. So what about people who want to see all these deplorable visuals? What is happening in this world that people will pay to be terribly shocked? I would see it again ..... not always.
