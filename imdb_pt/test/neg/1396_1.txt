I have not watched this show in months, but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had a roommate who liked it. So, maybe it's been a big improvement all this time, though the commercials and the IMDb rating of 4.2 are not a good sign. <br /> <br /> It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Even Mencia says so. And while I was not that big a fan of Chappelle's Show, her jokes were at least original and clever (and much bolder than Mencia). Mencia jokes are completely non-original and obsolete. If you can not see this, I think there is no hope for you. But to be fair, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> - Mencia blatantly rips Lil Jon's satire out of Chapelle. Just pick it up. <br /> <br /> "South Park" makes an episode about Scientology. A week later, Mencia has a joke in his program about how offensive he is to scientists. Keep in mind that the joke is not about Scientologists, but about how much he offended them in his program. When to this point, he never made a single joke of Scientology, ever. <br /> <br /> - After Hurricane Katrina, two photos of the AP go through the Internet showing a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. WEEKS later, after millions of people have seen it, Mencia introduces him to his show as if he'd discovered it and was being shown it for the first time (the Daily Show would have been made something like that in a day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than theft of jokes is the way Carlos promoted himself and his show, claiming that he is breaking some sort of PC barrier (whatever that is) and that he you're not laughing, you must be a weak puritan who can not handle race jokes. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true, then why was the Chappelle Show so popular?). He constantly berates his audience for "not understanding" if he can not laugh enough, and often repeats and explains his jokes, a technique that most comedians stop using at age 14. The worst part is that Mencia does not seem to be very smart. It's kind of tragic that there are dozens of funniest and insightful comedians trying to do this while this guy is making money. His show is reportedly the third highest rated on Comedy Central, which is disconcerting (again, it has a rating of 4.2 on this site). Where the hell are they getting those numbers? Comedy Central tries to call itself a "daring" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the most idiotic audience possible, this will never be the case.
