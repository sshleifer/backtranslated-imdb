I rented The Matrix Revisited with a friend of mine. We both loved The Matrix and we both loved shooting, so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes at The Matrix. It turns out that The Matrix Revisited tells almost nothing about the art of making movies or even how the Matrix was made. It's basically a huge commercial for The Matrix, a movie that The Matrix Revisited's audience has seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the problems and stress and detail that went into producing The Matrix, look no further than the bonus on the original The Matrix DVD. There are things that show in these documentaries that I did not even realize they needed to be done or done. Matrix was such a difficult and challenging film that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that is as informative and interesting as an MTV special.
