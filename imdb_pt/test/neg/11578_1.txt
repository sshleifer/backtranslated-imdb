I'm currently watching this movie and do not hesitate to review it now. The acting is ridiculous. Half the cast should be retired porn actors, and to get the porn you can imagine the acting quality. <br /> <br /> The graphics are unlike anything I've ever seen. I think there are puppet shows with more credibility. They can not even buy blanks for the guns they throw at the pathetic excuse for monsters. Maybe I should also note how incredibly impressed I am with the number of "bullets" your guns can carry. <br /> <br /> If you were asked to summarize the film, I would say that someone had snapped up a group of people who did not like the local fair, knocking on an island, adding unnecessarily intense music and letting 6-year- edition. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not formulate any possible explanation for the release of this movie, recorded on DVD and it costs $ 6 at my local store for a day. If anything I have received the benefit of knowing that I am much smarter than all parties involved in this film. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie with great intensity. Because? I'd like to meet the captain, I'd like to know ...
