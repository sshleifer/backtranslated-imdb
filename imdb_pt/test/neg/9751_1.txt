Seriously I do not understand why people are like "Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a lot of rubbish! The acting in the first place is ridiculous, and we're not even going to start talking about the dialogue because it was terrible ... The movies should be fun, and that, let me be the first to say, it was not * entertainment *. I was really laughing because I was so ashamed to watch. Music and dancing did nothing for me either. And what about the "hottie" of Channing Tatum that all the girls talk about? Whatever. The movie was pathetic. Do not waste your time - or your money. Unless you're a fan of dance movies, but movies like this are not * movies ... they're jokes.
