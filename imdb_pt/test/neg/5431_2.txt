CONGO is probably the worst big budget movie of the '90s. It's so bad it's watchable again and again. A group of people with different agendas probe deep into darker Africa, where they find a temple of riches as in King Solomon's Mines - but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding these riches. On the other hand, humans have a "talking" gorilla named Amy, who helps save the day at one point or another. So much for the plot. The dialogue is nonsense, the acting is almost uniformly atrocious, certainly exaggerated (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are on hand to ensure the ham factor), and the special effects are abysmal. Wait until you see the cannibal gorillas. And the lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there is a volcanic eruption to complete the grand finale? Laura Linney of all people is together for this most bumpiest of rides. What could she be thinking? It happened around the same time that she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, a film that helped secure her stardom.
