Hercules eventually fell into the same category of many promising television productions that could have been a great classic, just to become a sad joke. <br /> <br /> I really like Kevin Sorbo and his supporting cast, but I did not like it do not care what direction the show has taken since the movie's equivalents. I think the program would have been much more successful if they had kept the same format they did for the movies. <br /> <br /> I watched in the beginning and lost interest along the way. I found the episode strange afterwards, but my attention towards him was lucky enough to get to the commercial range.
