The cover of the DVD explains the premise: "Three troubled teenagers are going to jail" and are "prepared to make the time until Captain Greer offers them an agreement to work for him - in disguise." The movie opens with the definitions of the words "Mod" and "Squad", so you do not need to search them in the dictionary. For a visual definition of "Cool," look for photographs of the original trio: Michael Cole (as Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (as Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (as Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> A black. A white one. A blonde. Once they set it cool. The three that make Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's "The Mod Squad" are in their twenties: Claire Danes (as Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (as Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (as Linc Hayes). They are not able to do much with the given material. The portrait of Ribisi is the most "distant", which means that he has more fun with the original characterization. Danes novels Josh Brolin (as Billy Waites), it looks like he could be in a re-make of "Marcus Welby, MD". You will not believe that Michael Lerner is going to dance with Mr. Linc's "Linc". Epps. He explains: "I'm not a fairy, I just like to dance!" and requests, "Turn me!" <br /> <br /> The Mod Squadron (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
