This movie is stupid. There's no getting away from it. But it's also Dumb and Dumber. Remember, Dumb and Dumber is significantly funnier than that. However, I for a love watching stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends about how bad it is. Call me insensitive, but watch this movie, and you'll find that the only way to laugh about it is by laughing at it instead of laughing.
