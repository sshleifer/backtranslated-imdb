A Swedish splatter movie? Has the world gone mad? <br /> <br /> Probably not, but it's still not a common view these days with Swedish films, the b movie business in Sweden seems to have problems lately, the golden days of "Rymdinvasion i lappland." And this movie seems to have some problems all by itself: it's very talked about in it, it still manages to be a little fun especially for the good FX, which are great for a movie b. The script and most of the acting are still very bad, but in fact it does not matter much, it's supposed to be a gore movie and nothing more, that's where it goes a little wrong for some reason. There simply is not enough blood to fill the void. Every person who knows Gert Fylking will have a good laugh about his role as a sergeant. Although. I almost chuckled. It's really so much fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to the good parts I've listed, there's nothing to recommend here unless you're hungry for Swedish B movies. <br /> <br /> 4/10
