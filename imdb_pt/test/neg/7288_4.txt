My main criticism of the film is the animation. I totally agree with everyone else who was very poor. Some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than in the first film, which is much better. Also the background colors seemed rushed and a bit static. It's also a shame that Michael J. Fox did not talk to Milo, he did such a good job, and James Arnold Taylor was not sure if he should sound like Milo or Aladdin. I also took into consideration the lack of a good plot. the third story was confused and told awkwardly, and the second story suffered with script errors. To make matters worse, the first one I can not remember, apart from a fishing village being haunted or something like that. However, there was good music and good voice talent from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film from the total disaster. All in all, a disappointing sequel to an amazingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
