the film is simply horrible (2/10). Although the actors are trying their best (well, sometimes this is not much) special effects are ... let me put it this way, it would be better if there were none. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately it is the opposite. There is nothing more of the original atmosphere. And it's all very chaotic. Maybe they had a lot of stuff to show in 2h. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you would like to see this movie I recommend you look for the TV series (same title, same actors, even the plot remains the same) that was done at the same time as the movie did. It's much better (9/10) and the story really makes sense :)
