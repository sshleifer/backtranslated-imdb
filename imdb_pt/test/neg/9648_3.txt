This confusing and self-conscious "b-w" movie watches like a baby on a very bad acid trip. You're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of decayed lettuce that accidentally fell off the back of a dump truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away by the drain of the storm. There is no space for plot when you have "visceral images" and "subtle" joys. To me, it looks like the director is trying to make the next great art film while begging for intellectual compliments. I did not bring my beret either. Watching this, I felt almost insulted, since the "movie" does such an effective job of moving away from you.
