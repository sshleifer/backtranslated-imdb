This was my first "Bollywood" film and I found it the same way many other recent viewers - through "Ghost World". Having done a bit of reading about the Bollywood movie industry this week, I understand quite a bit why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror movie. But "Something for everyone" does not always result in a cohesive product. <br /> <br /> The number of ultra-groovy dance music "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" captivated the world in a way that probably could not have done. in 1965. It's all over the internet now, with many people struggling for a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does a great job of dancing after the take, making everything look cool, new and fun, even when any normal person would be exhausted! She rules <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss. Kitty, the music is light and fun, contrasting with the plot of terror. Still, I see myself singing in Hindi a week later. I found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> If you want to live in this life, then listen to what I say, leave your sorrows behind and join the party, take my advice <br /> < > those who want to live live with laughter and corners loosen their hair and relax the people of this world, what do you know? come to me and I'll explain <br /> <br /> Whoever has anyone who sees me will stop worrying in this world fish swim freely here and there <br /> <br /> My second favorite number in the movie is the Butler 's Dream, where Mehmood is fascinated by Miss. Kitty. Electric tiki-like idols are wonderfully cheesy, as are the whole set of that number. Online, I had seen this described as what would happen if "Liberace vomit" !! Great fun. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a good movie as a whole. That's why I gave it a 3. It's really a true fiction movie with some funky and kitschy musical numbers that have nothing to do with the murder plan.
