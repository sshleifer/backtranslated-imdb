Before Airport 79, these movies were pretty good. They had decent special effects, cast of stars and good acting. This movie destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for that. Let's talk about the special effects WOW !!!! they are horrible, which the director was thinking. I know it's only 1979, but we'll see other very good special effects films like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​Concord and this could have been the best movie at the Airport, but they did a lot of it. How about Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) flicking out the cockpit window to prevent a heat missile from reaching the agreement. He is also doing dives and 90 degree loops. This WOW completely unrealistic and unrealistic !!!!!! Believe me the special effects do not help in this scene, and really are beyond bad .... They almost seem like a cartoon, and that's how the whole movie is !!! Finally we will talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor at just the best .... About acting is a major issue in this film, especially George Kennedy .. What I really like as an actor, but it just does not cut in this movie. The total blame has to fall on the director, who did a very poor editing job, and really took a beating in the Airport Franchise. Too bad that the Concord is still not used today was a marvel of air travel ...
