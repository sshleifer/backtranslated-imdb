Ok, if you like your monstrous, rigid, starched and thundering moovies, but with a lot of drowning, then go straight to "Lady Frankenstein", an Italian stagy and costumy corpse walker. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the old Baron, and must have really needed to pay for the condo. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in European B movies, generally as Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Men of the Moon", plays her ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled prom dress. Cotten makes an ugly, big-headed monster (would it really be too much effort to make a good one?), Which immediately limits Cotten (who took out his royal check and ran), and wanders around strangling everyone in sight. Tania (Bay) decides to change the brain of her lover (who is old and wrinkled) with the brain of a younger man (who is "pretty", but stooopid), to make another monster to strangle the first monster that Cotten did, who is wandering around strangling people. Well, after a lot of exposure, and some bottlenecks, the two monsters jostle a little, Tania stabs the first monster on the back and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her mansion with the second monster - just to have her gas! Doh! There is so much drowning going on that you do not see the fact that the movie is as exciting as a dead carp, and the mooves just as quickly. The Alpha video version I saw for this review was heavily edited, and one person wonders that many nekkid people were cut, not that it would have greatly improved the movie. Director Von Theurmer has directed a variety of Euro trash, including "Jungle Warriors," "Island of the Dead" (as Mel Wells), and "The Crucified Girls of San Ramon." MooCow says avoid this corpse from a movie, and find something that moves in moore from a full ... accelerator. <br /> <br />; = 8)
