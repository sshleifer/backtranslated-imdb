It's certainly a direct video for the video, but the story is not as bad as most other reviewers think. I really like the fact that the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> The reactions of the hero and the reactions of the rebels are only human. The Hopper character is really playing God. This may be the right thing to do, but you may not like it anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, the gambling god is condemned to death, and the hero, who would have passed his own life, can live. Very moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I've seen, is that the earth is doing so well without the moon stabilizing its rotation.
