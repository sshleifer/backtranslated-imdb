Having some downtime before going to work, I looked at my DVD collection "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" and chose the most obscure title of the package: Zis Boom Bah, starring a forgotten Grace Hayes. "Classics" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles I've never heard of and I suspect they are all in the public domain. Anyway, this movie also stars his son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (whom I just discovered is a native of New Orleans from the state where I live, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as owner of a malt store and Huntz Hall, giving a time of the East Side Kids, as Peter's friend. The plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich, carefree son into a responsible one with him without knowing who she is, is for the birds and does not have many funny scenes, although I did like Peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with Hall. to drag. And the songs and dances are fun in themselves. Rubin, however, is everywhere with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything that concerns him does not make any sense (although I liked his funny dance). Since this was only 61 minutes I'm sure played in the bottom half of the double feature account, I'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few fun bits I mentioned enjoying.
