Maybe if you smoked enough marijuana this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unbalanced people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's. There is a strange innocence in this movie and sex is a lot more bizarre and fun than the steel professionals who They do it for the cameras now. <br /> <br /> The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She has a classic look, WASP-ish - as a very cute Ivy League sisterhood girl. So what the heck is she doing in this cheap and extravagant skin movie? From my point of view, she does not seem to be drugged in this movie (which may explain this) and she really seems incredibly committed to the role. When she sings her first song, she really acts like she thinks she was having sex with Julie Andrews or something. I just got the feeling that this girl really believed that this would be her big chance or something, rather than the career killer she was. Anyway, she is very cute and you can not believe she would get naked on the screen, much less do a scene of masturbation, some scenes of oral sex (with men and women) and then make the real deal as a climax. for the film (snark). Nor is it definitely a double body. This is our little Kristine taking one for the team, or for the greater glory of showbiz or something. It's amazing to watch and it's definitely exhilarating (ahem), but somehow I kind of wish she had not done it. She was a very pretty and talented girl getting some really bad advice. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my guess is that Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long wanted this movie to go away. She was very cute and cute in "meatballs". Almost impossible to believe that this is the same girl - but it is.
