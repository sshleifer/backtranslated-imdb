This movie is really so poor in its desperate attempts to be "feel good" and casual that really made me embarrassed watching. I can not imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebrities and the press must have felt like pretending to like the star-studded premiere. His excellent media ratings are a sickening example of how ridiculously small and innate the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen, it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it really deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, homemade visual effects, clumsy dialogues, painfully idle attempts at working-class humor, and the overly cozy and meaningless plot actually make this film a movie of inferior quality. To stay away.
