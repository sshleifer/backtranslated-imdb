After placing a mummy in a local museum undergoes cat examination, a metal object in his brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit, or ghost, if you will, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives near the museum, is possessed by the evil spirit. Soon she steals the Egyptian treasures of the museum under their noses. Detective Verlac comes out of retirement to pick up the supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> This is quite useful, if you have not seen any other incarnation of "Belphegor" before. If you have, I recommend skipping this particular version as it can not help but pale in comparison to others in spite of the nice locations and scenarios. It plays out like a Sci-Fi Original movie (slightly) bigger budget, and I do not really mean that, as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Candy Eye: Sophie Marceau shows ass & boob side <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: None
