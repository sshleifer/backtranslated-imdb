I know ... I know: it's difficult (if not paradoxical) to have a "believable" fantasy. But for me there is also a condition in which the unbelievable TOO MUCH interferes, or distracts from my general opinion about the film. The latter was the case for me in relation to Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have many unanswered questions about the plot, but some of the actors, too, I thought, were a little overdone. (Perhaps, however, was the writing: asking them to recite many trivial, predictable reactions and clich√©s (excess?).) Others have said enough about the plot. I just wanted it to be done - and, I guess it could have been - more convincingly. P. S .: This is a FRESH comment about this movie - I just watched a few minutes ago; It is not a memory of years ago.
