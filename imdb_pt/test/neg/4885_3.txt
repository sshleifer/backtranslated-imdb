I'm testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me amnesia that I called for the English version of this movie. Now let me get down to the points Musical Score: Poor quality but at least fits History: It's about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his brother Sheriff and they fight for landowners a major land and he allies with Mexicans to lead them out and Trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend it - The scene of the final climactic fight will confuse anyone about who are the good guys Conclusion: better than I thought, but I need to continue with this I am the next will watch the Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme film "Universal Soldier" pray for my sanity
