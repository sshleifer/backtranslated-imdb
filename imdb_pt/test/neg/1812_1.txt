The film Heart of Darkness is an insult to Joseph Conrad's book! To be honest, the movie made me want to sleep. On the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. I feel that the film left out several key elements and missed some of the key points of the book. In addition, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, although not a story of adventure or easy to understand, is filled with hidden meanings and interesting twists in the plot. The book, although very confusing and complex, is surprising. When you finally understand, you feel like you've learned something. The novel, or short story, had several key ideas such as futility and madness that the film left out. In addition, several important scenes were altered, which, in contrast, affected the whole plot. Many of the scenes seemed very "agitated" in the sense that they did not fit together. In summary, the film seemed to be a misinterpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I would only recommend watching this movie if you can not imagine or understand the book, but otherwise I would ignore this. It was terrible and in complete disorder. If you've never read the book, you definitely will not watch the movie because you need the basic information in the book to understand the movie. The film was a horrible spin-off from an excellent and detailed book.
