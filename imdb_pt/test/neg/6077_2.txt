I'm afraid people are not so critical of a job that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with "Amadeus" aside, the "Beethoven Copy" deliberately chooses the easy way by putting the audience before the art. And therefore deny the world a discerning, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Now consider the following: is it not possible that the actual story of the creation of the ninth symphony can really be a powerful and engaging story? and also so in a dramatic saying? Was Beethoven completely deaf to the writing of the symphony? Is not this more interesting? How was the symphony performed? Would not it be great to know? So, ask yourself, what possible motivation can a filmmaker have to introduce a woman as a copyist? If there was a copyist, he would certainly be a man. What was your story? (please try to be a little critical here, even if you like the invention of a composer). <br /> <br /> Fantasy must be much more than a distortion of reality to serve the purpose of writers. For those who find themselves comparing and justifying Anna Holtz's invention with the invention of Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in 'Amadeus', consider that he confesses to a priest in a lunatic asylum (Schaffer uses this device to great effect in the film ). Copying Beethoven may have worked if Anna were an invention of Ludwig's feverish imagination. But we must believe that it is "possible" ... Yes, and that Strauss was helped by aliens. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive comments I read here so far are often expressions of a WISH for the movie is good; almost a deliberate amnesia. Remembering the movie for what you want it to be and not for what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, then consider that you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of actual events but also sacrificing the film. truth because of a triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a little note about acting here that may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is NOT good like Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does it shock you? He looks clumsy during the film, much like an actor dressed, but off the set and standing at the buffet table. Most of his lines are said as suggestions rather than responses to Anna Holtz's speeches (ie, he is not listening to the actor). He is clearly an actor disguised as a character instead of being the character. <br /> <br /> Really, how many times does Beethoven have to roll in his grave before we hit it? Just ask yourself, would Ludwig approve?
