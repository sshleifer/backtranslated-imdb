This is one of the worst movies I've seen for years. The plot has potential that is never realized. Actors are a bad choice, but considering the writing on the screen, their talent is not wasted. I really wanted everyone to die as fast as possible so I could go out and watch something else. Unfortunately, I stayed to the end and laughed at the murmurings of people who complain about how awful it is. There was no boo, after all, this is England, just soft moans about how crap that was. So I look at IMDb and I see 288 people gave 10 out of 10. I really can not see how these people are able to give that score. They must be a PR firm working with the distributor. There is a hilarious problem at the end of the movie, when in the graveyard and in the horseradish attacks, look at the dishonest scenario that rocks when touched (supposedly a brick wall) - the blood effects are waaaay OTT - the movie looks like everyone is doing a fake horror, except the director.
