I was wondering what the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival held to include this movie in their program. I think they must have agreed with the others who reviewed this film. I, on the other hand, consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bad script, full of holes and dialogue so improbable that it is embarrassing. Ideas are introduced and then discarded without development. The acting made me totally cold and uninvolved. The decor of the setting was appropriate for the time, but the nightmare of a decorator. The only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly. The attic gave the impression that the items had been thrown into the scene with no attempt to create the appearance of a real attic that had been filled with garbage over the years. The photograph was leaden and devoid of variety. Save your money for something worthwhile.
