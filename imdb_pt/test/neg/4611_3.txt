<br /> <br /> I thought this movie did not have the dramatic suspense that the first movie had. This is hard to come by when the movie happens for a week. The original film led to the final climactic scene over a period of one year and was still less violent than the sequel. One good thing about this movie was the movie went relatively fast because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachel's best friend died, there was no funeral mentioned in the film. Another downfall was the involvement of Amy Irving. All the scenes of her put the rhythm of the movies down. The dialogue in this movie was terrible. It did not reflect the way children talk. In conclusion, this movie could have been a hit, but it collapsed after the opening scene.
