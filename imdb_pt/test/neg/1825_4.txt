I watched this primarily for the sole reason that it should have references to the Third Reich. There was a rather predictable, brainless terror film that seemed to have been made to appeal to feminists or something. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you, if you wait for an entire movie to see the attractive breasts of the female leader, the last thing you want is a sex scene made with "good taste" with angles of Camera irritants that show nothing. Her busty friend did not get her either, but we saw lots of men's asses, pubic hair and guys with open shirts. And in the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel blows and the villain's swings (which turns out to be the heartthrob, oddly enough) and she easily fights him (uh huh) while her love interest is tied up and waiting to be rescued The most entertaining part was when she picks up a chair and "swings" on the guy and she breaks it over. Now, it would be as much as she could lift the chair, much less crush it against a person strong enough to break it! It sounds ridiculous, she basically touches him against it and falls apart. If you are going to do this kind of "role reversal" garbage (which has already been done to death), then you have to at least make it semi-plausible. <br /> <br /> But there was a good bit. The bad guy got the best out of his naughty friend, teaching him a lesson in being a bum and sleeping around. This is not exactly something feminists would like. Very stupid, actually. Not that American horror movies are usually much better, but you must wonder why they bothered. I did not bring anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> 5/10
