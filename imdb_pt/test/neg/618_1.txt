Lance Henriksen has the gift of being the main name of a B movie, even in this case starring Charles Napier, Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker. As always, he does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is just plain bad (do not even tell me about the ending). And the editing is so horrible that it can really be a beautiful thing. Is it just me, or does it seem like Joe Don Baker was inserted in the movie at the last minute? Also, whenever the glass is broken in this film, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. Lastly, after seeing this, I think David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Felony, this will be the third film I give the 1/10 grade, joining Iron Eagle IV and Without Mercy.
