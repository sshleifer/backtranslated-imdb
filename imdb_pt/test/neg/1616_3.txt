I bought this e-bay movie as part of a bunch of about twenty horror movies, all about a dollar a piece. Watching this, my first impression was that it was probably from the late 80s. Later I started to think - the posters of Linkin Park on the wall and everything else seemed to suggest that I was dealing with a newer movie. Realizing that, the movie became an unbearable torment. The last 3 minutes were the longest in movie history - the film simply refused to end. Is there a genre like "horror for children"? In that case, this movie is definitely it. If there are parents, wicked enough to want to introduce their children to the horror, I suggest this would be perfect for children of about 6-8 years. The only thing I really liked was Greg Cipes, who was a very good actor for that kind of nostalgic and retro part of a double drive-in account.
