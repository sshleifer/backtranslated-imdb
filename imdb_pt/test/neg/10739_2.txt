The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two main actors are good, and it was not filmed on VHS. The story, the dialogue and the plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Speaking / leading zombies who come back to vote and influence the political tide against war! Give me some time! What are the next zombies that come back to do skydiving? Maybe zombies coming back to host QVC shows? I have never supported the Iraq war, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful to the extent that it mocks the true horror of war. With zombies being mass-produced on the market today ... this is the zombie-related entertainment SPAM. How "Homecoming" came to "Masters of Horror" is beyond me.
