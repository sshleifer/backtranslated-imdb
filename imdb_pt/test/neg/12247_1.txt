This movie would be a big part of the story if it were actually a real Kennedy assassination movie. There are many mistakes in this movie for me to point out. It's a Kennedy assassination movie, but many of the important facts have changed. Missing scenes, and many of the scenes, after the president's limousine passes the license plate, do not fit. The two Kennedy move visibly slower than the other four people in front of him. The next time you watch this movie, look for things that do not fit, like the Texas Gov. and yours, along with the SS men in front, flipping forward, but you can see that the limo is not stopping or slowing down is actually accelerating. This film is clearly an attempt to cover up.
