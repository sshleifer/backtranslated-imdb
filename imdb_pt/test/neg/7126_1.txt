I got into this movie with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of Grudge 1 to me. Well, if the former could not leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then I doubted this would be any better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers tell you: Asian is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Luckily for her, she is not around for long. That decision may have saved her career. <br /> <br /> The film has three story lines, and none of them makes sense. And worse, none of them are developed. You almost begin to understand, and then somebody dies and the story stays behind. Right, killing people could be scary, but I was more confused by trying to plot the plot than by being scared. They go back and forth between the three lines of the story, which are not related ... OR ARE?!?! * EFFECTTT SOUND * ~~~ The timing of the three stories are shifted, and you can tell early on that the movie will have a turnaround at the end. BE READY. Oh wait. Sorry, this is not a touch of quality Fight Club or Vertigo, you can see this coming from miles away. And you probably figured a VERY better turnaround in your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of the girl making her "AMAZING" appearance, maybe it could have been Michael Jackson? That part of Scary Movie 4 scared me. <br /> <br /> The murder sequences were terribly made. Unlike the horror movies of the past, where a killer appears out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door for example, and everyone in the theater jumps (and then the fat one behind you spills popcorn on your neck) - this had none pop scary ups. They zoomed in where the random Asian woman or child would appear, and you knew exactly what was to come. Instead of making the music stand up high then quiet, and then appear out, the song really gave you time for the scary scene. If I know it's coming, it will not scare me. <br /> <br /> The film began with an explanation of what "Grudge" is; When a person is killed during a fit of rage, a curse is placed where the person was killed. So why does the Asian being cursed by her mother have any meaning to the story? And why is rancor moving the countries now? All that happened was letting me envy my friends for making me go - we should have seen one of those animated Pixar movies. It would have been more scary.
