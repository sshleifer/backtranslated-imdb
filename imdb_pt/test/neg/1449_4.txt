I did not expect much from this movie, but I was eager to try something I initially thought was a teenage horror of the '80s. Although three teens are a somewhat critical plot, it's by no means a horror movie for teenagers. "The Power" is about a small Aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor (who must be adult and thus 'corrupted') becomes the vessel to release all evil from the idol, and often with deadly implications not only for the possessor's victims, but also for the possessor himself. After making a lot of changes in control over this thing, three teens find it and can not figure out what it is, except that since they've found it, strange and dangerous things are happening. They offer to explain the situation to a reporter who does not buy the spiritual bologna. However, it is her producer who wants to investigate further, especially if that means he can gain control of the idol (I presume the teenagers are not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol). It's a story told a thousand times, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, in horror and science fiction films. <br /> <br /> That was, at least for me, able to keep some interest. Despite the low budget, this has not been made so obviously cheap or loaded with bad acting as many of the low budget and unspoiled horror films of the previous decades (these days, they have the same cheesy qualities but bigger budgets). We are sufficient enough to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become somewhat absorbed in the mysterious atmosphere and so on, despite a history of clich√©s. And while not terribly bloody, the special effects were well done. <br /> <br /> Again, it is a routine horror tale, especially with the ending (which by modern standards has become a device that is overused), but one that is not so embarrassingly bad. It may be worth checking, even if it's just for laughter.
