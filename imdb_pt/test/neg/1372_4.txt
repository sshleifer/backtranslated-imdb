This show reminds me of an episode of "The Simpsons," in which Smithers had just been fired by Mr. Burns and was forced to live a miserable life while unemployed. All he did while the hours were to drink and watch Comedy Central. The implication was that Comedy Central was a pathetic TV channel for miserable people with nothing else to occupy their time. "Mind of Mencia" is a bit better than most Comedy Central programming, but it still serves as an example of why this channel is a low quality filler for people with absolutely no life. To tell you the truth, Mencia is a fairly competent comedian who plays banal and bilateral jokes and fits into soft stereotypes of people based on their race, sex, or economic status, or a combination of two three of these characteristics. If you heard one of these jokes from one of your friends in a bar or at work, believe me, you heard what happens as a comedy about "Mind of Mencia." Carlos also tries to make fun of current events, but lacks creativity or originality. This is not to say that Carlos is a failure all the time. I found some of her amusing skits as the picture of her rap video as an oil sheik. If you find a bland and bland comedy in your alley, you'll probably enjoy Mind of Mencia. For those people who are tired of repetitive, pedestrian comedians displaying the same old jokes used by time, stay away.
