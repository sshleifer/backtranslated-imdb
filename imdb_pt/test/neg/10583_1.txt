The movie begins with a spoof of Spider-Man which is his introduction to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell of "Drake & Josh" fame, personally I would give the film to Josh who is much funnier) and the joke of "Rick Punchers "is raised from the plane, so the writers were obviously already scouring the barrel for ideas for this movie. Rick's class is on a scientific trip to the Amalgamated Genetics lab and here we meet the first star name of the film, Brent Spiner (Date on Star Trek TNG) playing Dr. Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, from which his powers come. <br /> <br /> We find our next big names of stars in Rick's house, his Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days fame) and Uncle Albert (Airplane, Police Squadron & Gun Gun Leslie Nielson naked And we are introduced to Carlson on the Board of Directors of Amalgamated (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons) who is then very promptly killed. We are told that Rick slept for 5 days and got some cheap, sexually oriented scenes designed to catch the attention of the male teen audience. The Stephen Hawking scene is painful to watch and it really is a bad idea that does not work and is not at all funny. <br /> <br /> We got another parody of Spider-Man (Rick picking up the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there when Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball that would have broken her skull and killed his dead stone. You get to see Rick's first powers emerge (exciting skill and speed) then his first rescue, which goes very wrong. We also get an incest referral which is in fact very bad. We have a flashback and a parody of Batman in which we find out that Rick is the sole responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman Again Ricks Uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (of Hellboy) at Medical Hospital. Then we get a parody of X-men (very badly done, since Patrick Stewart is white as they are), Barry Bonds is interpreted by another similar. <br /> <br /> We met Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson) looking dazzling at her costume!). Ricks 1st tour in his costume (once he fixes his ability to see and breathe through him) is another parody of Batman. The clip of Tom Cruise's YouTube interview is played by a similar one (and not very good). There are many modern references, like Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia, all showing that the film is set in the present day. There's a very weak gay joke (it's never a good idea to do that too) when Jill is helping Aunt Lucille make Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene is not very funny, just childish. <br /> <br /> The aunt's fart scene is not particularly funny, just incredibly childish. Anyone who thinks funny must have a mental age of about 12 years. She's dead and so we have a really bad necrophilia joke (is not there any topic these people do not try to use to get a cheap laugh?) At her funeral, and the cremation joke even worse. <br /> <br /> We received the two worst parallels throughout the film (Prince Charles and Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you still did not know how childish or stupidly lowbrow film is Landers wins the award "Douchebag Of The Year. " Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a very bad scene where the same girl can get through Jill twice in the same direction). Obviously the Hourglass is frustrated, Jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the entire movie is the finale.
