I thought this series would be another fun action series, with some dynamic plot and great performances. I was wrong. Although I like Jamie Denton, this show is not worth watching, unless you enjoy seeing some brutalized people and the actions of supposedly guaranteed agents under the theme "national security." The show is a big advertisement for the current government, and expels jingoism as if we were talking like that every day. After a few episodes, it was very annoying and I began to watch reruns of House Invaders at BBCAmerica. Instead, watch CSI and Without a Trace, no doubt.
