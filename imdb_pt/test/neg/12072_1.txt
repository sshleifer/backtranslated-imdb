Well, I think I finally saw my last Woody Allen movie! I read the review in the paper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good Woody Allen experience (as I have had many times in the past). Well, that was not the case. This movie has nothing to offer. Even with the wonderful performance of the talented Sean Penn - this movie failed. One of the characteristics of his other films are multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue. This movie basically consisted of just one character - very one-dimensional. He hardly laughed. Probably looked good on paper! I think the only thing special was Samantha Morton's performance. Now I'll be looking for your movies in the future. So in conclusion, this movie was a big disappointment. >
