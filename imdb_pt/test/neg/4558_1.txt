I'm amazed at how many people consider this movie decent ... much less great! Do most people have basic standards for a movie they watch? I just do not know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial movie product" does not really deserve the respect of being called a movie. Calling Dean Cain's talent is a great injustice to anyone who really has talent. I've had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of it went straight into the tubes. At least her role was extremely small. Maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to be paid. <br /> <br /> The ignorance I saw when I saw the "Firetrap" was incredible. Let me start by taking it out of my chest: if you can not realistically show fire, then do not show anything. OK?!! It's a shame for all involved when you show lame effects that do not even come close to simulating a burning building. <br /> <br /> Some interesting details: 1. A caretaker opens the door to a large closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames. What he does? He tries to put out the fire with his broom! 2. The same caretaker (who knows the building is on fire) then faces a door marked "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind tells him that it would be a good idea to open the door. Big mistake! 3. A woman is donating a fantastically generous donation of $ 100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she is wearing a fur coat for the charity event they are undertaking! (Do people who care about animals dislike this kind of thing?) 4. Several people in the movie are forced into a safe of some sort with solid steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse (!!) could not do. t penetrate. However, they do have a spacious vent that leads directly to the back of the thing that anyone could track. This certainly sounds like a lapse in security. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I got tired thinking about this lame movie. Our "hero" whom we ought to cheer for is a career criminal who, in the beginning, tries to kill some cops. What an incredible face! If the general public wants to waste their minds on this nonsense, then more power for them. I just wish I could erase it from my memory. 1/10
