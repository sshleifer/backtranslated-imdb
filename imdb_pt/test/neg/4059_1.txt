This is undoubtedly the worst sequel I have ever seen, and I have seen many of them to come to that conclusion. The plot is simply ridiculous. I can get a ball and run around a field too. Why can not I play Superbowl? Yes, I know this movie was intended for children, but there are only a few scenarios that even kids can realize are totally stupid and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was very good, but this was a total crash. Disney is missing out on this. If I controlled who won the Razzie Awards, I would give this one a couple. Have a nice day! =)
