"House of the Damned" (also known as "Specter") is one of its haunted low-cost horror films, full of mediocre performances and cheap effects. It is a family that inherits an old Irish mansion and, after moving, begins to experience strange phenomena and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a young woman who was murdered and buried inside a wall in the basement of the mansion. The couple's young daughter is taken to another dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. <br /> <br /> The ideas that this movie borrowed from the 1982 film Poltergeist are obvious. I'll say that this movie has some rather frightening sequences, but sometimes it's very, very annoying. The acting here is nothing special, the mood is good, the soundtrack (which was basically this dramatic Irish opera song) was a bit annoying, and the CGI's special effects are really awful. I mean, it was 1996, you would think they could have done a little better than them. The end when the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I have ever seen, very cheap. But, hey, this was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the translucent monster wolf thing that the daughter sees looks horribly fake. And what was the meaning in the film? What the hell does a wolf monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects here are what really ruined this movie. The acting was also very bad. I usually enjoy many low budget horror movies, but not this one. "House of the Damned" is nothing special, just consider watching if you have nothing better to do. But you'll probably want to get through this. 4/10
