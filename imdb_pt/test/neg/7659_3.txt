With a cast of mostly minor stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner and Eddie Albert), lousy special effects (it was certainly the '70s, but "Alien" and "Star Wars" came from the same decade), and a plot which is so laughable that someone might want to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been GROUNDED. <br /> <br /> Even Oscar winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can not keep this "bird" in the air. The implausibility of the third film - airplane is submerged in the Bermuda Triangle - is far more believable than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "The Concorde" at all costs!
