This piece of trash is actually the PUMP, as in Bottom of the Barrel. I can not figure out which is the worst; Norris' dull portrait of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or hysterical overcoming of Christopher Neame. This movie does not offer on any level what so ever. The action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that should be horrible look like a cliche from the fifties. You can not just fill a room with smoke and men in a rubber suit, and wait for the public to scream in terror. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie does nothing for me. In fact, it looks like an unhappy mix between a cheap porn movie and a Miami Vice addict with a little sprinkling of hell. Do not wait. That should have been a yawn from hell.
