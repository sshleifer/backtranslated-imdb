You could see the end result a mile away. All the signs were there .... the prom, the liquor, the quick ride, the distraction of the females .... A good commercial for seat belt use , and later models of vehicles that sits passengers farther back from the windshield. In addition, the end is rather anti-climatic, as the Econoline van Evil hardly suffers a crease in his nose after hitting a bridge in high speed (highly unlikely). More damage to the van would have made this a bit more believable. And why do these movies always happen during / after a prom? Is it a case of once you survive the prom, will you be good for life? More than anything else, this shows the lack of policing at the liquor ball, and not keeping track of the MINORS that are leaving the dance for a ride.
