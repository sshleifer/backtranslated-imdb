First, I must say that I have seen version '39 at least 100 times; know the whole dialogue and have read the game '36, which is different from '39 and contains its own gold nuggets. This version is as flat as a movie of life in adultery. There's a reason you have not seen an expensive TV ads campaign. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the malicious tone of the original and how women spent all their time warring with each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intention. It was a theatrical farce of gossip, adultery, and bite in the midst of a group of well-to-do Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original material. They choose this strangely, putting half a scene here and half a scene that comes from the first version. Bette Midler (which is in only a few scenes and represents the old Countess in a broad and smiling style) has no context in this version. She mentions going after "Buck," which is a key element in the original - so he never mentioned it again. This film is so monotonous that I will not overanalyze it, but here are some things I found unbelievable:> Mary Haines bragging with her domestic staff: "I can get my fingernails out of a picture!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could have read about it and got an Oscar name, right? > A COMPASSIVE Sylvia Fowler !!! Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie kind of faded. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic book engine that swept the play. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant and spiteful woman who chattered reams of insignificant, ridiculous and irresistible dialogue that is still classic and quotable. She was not above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The filmmakers of 2008 decided that this character had to die. By killing her, they killed the movie.
