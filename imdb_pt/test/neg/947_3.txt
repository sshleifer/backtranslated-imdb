The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal trades in "My Giant" is to say that this movie is for his career as "Ishtar" went to Warren Beaty - not ruined but slowed down ..... very much. Crystal must know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play next to a child 2) never play in front of an animal 3) never play in front of someone who is almost 3 feet taller than you, is so innocent as a child an animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I guess, but I do not laugh, except in the scenes where Crystal is alone and not overwhelmed with her ex-wife (what her role is in this movie) or with the Giant mentioned above. Did I mention that there is also a child in this movie? Well, forget it. The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and us, but for the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you do not believe me, watch it on old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live." Go rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally". <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more ho-hum than rate-fi-fo-fum. <br /> />
