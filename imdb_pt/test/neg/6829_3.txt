So let's say you're a producer, you have some money, and somehow you have equipment from Richard and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script ... but, why bother? You see, this movie is really terrible, the acting is very good but the cast is a horrible outfit and Willis did his best to play those characters that they just can not play. now, this movie has no plot, or rather, there is something that tries to pass as a plot: there is a killer (Willis) that is cool, dangerous and sophisticated (in fact he is not any of this, but some dialogue between the other characters , you must have that impression) then this killer is on a mission to kill someone, now there is an ex-IRA prisoner who is kind and friendly and very nice (gear) that the FBI releases from prison so he will help them. so now the FBI is "investigating" to find this killer, the investigation consists of a lot of unlikely information - like a random person losing his wallet and someone using his name to buy a car - which is always right on the money . since there is no real plot and the script is so bad, you can not expect any real character development, or tension, so instead of creating it through the story, they simply add some disconnected dramatic music, which signals something very dramatic is happening instead of actually creating something dramatic .. <br /> <br /> The result is that this is a very bad movie, and a complete waste of time that somehow gotten an incredibly high score for the its level, probably because of the cast - and that's exactly what the producers are counting on.
