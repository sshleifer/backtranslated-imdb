"Maduro" is one of those terrible indies that can get in circulation and give indie a bad name. Telling a stupidly incongruous tale of pubescent twin sisters who crawl from a car crash that kills their parents and then they take to the road while cheerfully stealing shops, making goo-goo eyes on some guy, and ending up at an army station so dilapidated that I want this (yes, right!). An apparent attempt at success, "Maduro" is an almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly as players enter and exit the character, finally ending up awkwardly with an ounce of credibility to be found anywhere. Not recommended for anyone.
