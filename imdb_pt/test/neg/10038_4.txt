I wanted to like this movie. I really, really did. I was so excited when I saw the preview, it scared the hell out of me. But when I saw the movie, I was disappointed. The acting is flamboyant, and the comedy attempts are woefully out of place and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy being chased by a shit in a comadre is not funny or scary, it's just stupid. I grew up in the Bell Witch legend, so I know a little about it. Many facts in the movie are correct, but this movie should have been much better. The entire birthday party scene, for example, lasts about fifteen minutes, adds nothing to the plot or story, and should have been left on the cutting room floor. A heavier publisher might have managed to get a decent movie out of this mess. <br /> <br /> Please understand, I'm not in any way involved with the other Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb listing. I'm just saying what it's like.
