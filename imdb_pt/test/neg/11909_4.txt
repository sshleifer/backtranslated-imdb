The premise of this film seems to be that the passage of the 2nd World War generation in the United States, with its apple pie falseness and its hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. Those terrible hippies seemingly ruined everything. <br /> <br /> What holds the film together are the excellent performances - particularly Lemmon's, which is truly remarkable. Otherwise, we have a boring drama in life (with just over 24 hours of Jack's life) with pretensions. <br /> <br /> I found it a difficult task.
