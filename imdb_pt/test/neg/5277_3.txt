This movie is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a great actor, he shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, etc. But this is really crap, he did not even come close to a decent Irish accent, maybe he should have practiced with Kate Hudson while she was doing About Adam. For the Irish, this movie is laughable and, even worse, it is quite annoying for several scenes. I think the producers made this film in the hope that the (non-European) target audience would never have seen or heard of the "General" or Martin Cahill and would love an intriguing and entertaining story. Total crud !!
