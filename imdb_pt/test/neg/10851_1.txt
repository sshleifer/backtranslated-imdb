The publicity for this movie suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange operatic attractions, so we were not shocked at the Duke of Mantua urinating during his reprise of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda sing Caro Nome in the bath. It's just rude and boring. What stands out in this film is the lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk places the duke's palace in a decadent pool. In fact, he's not the duke, he's just a character named Duka, so it's hard to understand why he has too many passersby and his own court jester, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in an apartment of the council that is decorated with the orange couch and decorated in the stained wallpaper that is of rigeur between the vanguard directors. The Duke, sorry, Duka's heavy-duty riders ride (Yawn). <br /> <br /> Concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected and unintended humor. What can we do about the fact that Gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council apartment? When the call says Monterone is being taken to prison, we see him being taken out of the pool by two attendants in pink shorts. One imagines that he will be accused of urinating in a public swimming pool. <br /> <br /> It was common for opera films to be synchronized lass 20 years ago, but there is no excuse for it today. A dubbed opera is like soft porn. You do not believe what is happening because the artists are not making enough effort. The actress in the role of Gilda does not seem to have learned her lines correctly. She barely moves her lips when she should be singing. When she sings Dear Name in the bath, she lies down with her legs slightly apart. It's hard to tell from which hole the sound should be coming. The Duke later limits this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the yodelling phrase in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The sound environment never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding like it's being played through a transistor radio. Reasonably slow, low intensity times are preferred for the overall effect to be of a karaoke in your local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a film from a production of the Spanga Opera. Spanga is a village in Friesland, Netherlands. They usually run in a tent in a field. If I had attended this performance in a tent in a camp in Friesland I would have been quite indulgent. By filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also open to world ridicule.
