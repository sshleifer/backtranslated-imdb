By 1971, it was becoming increasingly obvious that Hammer's film studios were leaving. HANDS OF THE RIPPER is a case in which even the idea smells of despair - The spirit of Jack The Ripper has his own daughter! Yes, well, no one was expecting a documentary, but this plot seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for stupid premise and you wonder why the producers brought Jack The Ripper into the story. Was this to give the film a grumpy title? <br /> <br /> Production figures are unimpressive and cinematography gives the movie a cheap TVM feel, but you know you will not watch a Hammer horror classic as soon as the title starts, because the song is risible. I think the composer was trying to make the theme haunting and touching, but the song resembles something of a romantic movie. I'm going to give the cast some credit as they take their roles seriously in what is a far from serious movie. <br /> <br /> I did not really like this movie and it immediately reminded me of the Phantom Raspberry Blower Of London Town. of the two Ronnies that I was laughing in the weeks before I saw it
