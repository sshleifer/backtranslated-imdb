Please give this one a present. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the rest of the cast made terrible performances. The show is flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I do not know how Michael Madison could have allowed this on his plate. He almost seemed to know that this was not going to work and his performance was pretty mediocre, so all Madison fans ignore it.
