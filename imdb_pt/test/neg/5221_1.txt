I usually do not like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his fighting scenes are usually well choreographed. Chuck is undeniably one of the great names in martial arts. So at my local bookshop, I found a movie I had not seen before and took it home. <br /> <br /> Although the acting in this film was worse than most of Chuch Norris's films, I was hoping to see at least one fight scene. I quickly began to realize that this was not a typical Chuch Norris movie; instead, it was a Christian film intended to illustrate the paradigm of "good to come out victorious." <br /> <br /> There is nothing on the packaging that indicates this is a Christian movie, with the exception of the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, which I had never heard of before. I will certainly keep that in mind the next time I see a movie from that company. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with sneaky proselytism. If someone is going to make a religious movie, at least have the good sense to point out to the viewer that this is what they will receive. The only part that remains on the exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight. At least it was during dinner, and I spent some of that cooking and eating. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts movie, and not expecting too much, do not bother with this movie because it does not even offer it.
