Uzumaki, which translates into "spirals", coming to this new wave of Asian horror films following hits like Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes ... and much more coming as Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters, falls short of the supernatural and scary element of suspense, so characteristic of other films, the only thing left is weirdness and not a style of Tim Burton or David Lynch, but in an irrelevant and monotonous way. <br /> <br /> It starts with a girl, another girl with a crush on her, her best friend and her father, obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens is about Uzumakis, people die and you see Uzumakis. So okay, it goes along, I kind of have fun with spirals, characters do not seem to go anywhere, but I'll play along. We find out that the city is cursed by Uzumakis, people start screaming at Uzumakis and the point is that Uzumakis are everywhere, the movie is a disaster, does not know where to go, except to show the power of Uzumakis !!! ! !!!!! There are some legal concepts such as when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis in her fingerprints, but there is another scene in which she hears her husband (beyond the grave !!) say that she also has Uzumakis in the ear, the path they dealt with this scene was laughable, not a bit extravagant, there are also some (a little) of cool visual effects, such as the collection that father has of Uzumakis and the girl with Uzumakis hair .. yes, Uzumakis hair, your out of context, it looks like it was taken from a Fruit Snack commercial where if you eat a fruit snack Uzumakis, its taste is so incredible that your hair turns into Uzumakis, now if that was not bad enough, suddenly out of nowhere is there Caracol Men .. or ManSnails ?? whatever?? And you know why? right? Because in their shells they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis ??. That only left enough time for a low-quality anti-climactic finale and by that time I was fed up with damn uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki there, of course, look around you, how many Uzumakis can you find ?? If you want to see a movie about spirals, see PI (3.1416), now you'll find some cool concepts of uzumaki between the meaning of life and Dark City also has a bit of spiraling. <BR> This movie could have acted as a video clip, it has already won a cult audience and that is why I was forced to see it, but after doing so, I do not know why people think it's great. I was truly disappointed.
