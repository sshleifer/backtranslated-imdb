I think the best way for me to review this title is to break it down into its pros and cons. <br /> <br /> PROS: ~ they turn into wolves instead of plastic monsters / cartoons. ~ the pursuit of wolves through the forest ~ "Cash Machine" by Hard-Fi being played <br /> <br /> CONS: ~ some parts of the script make you shrink (for example, the terrible part in which the woman escapes of the Fortunate Five boys' games, and there's about half an hour of "Dear Cousin" and a round robin of "Yeah, look, we know Gabriel's law") ~ the dive transformation is ridiculous ~ the obvious end and ridiculous ~ Aiden being told a thousand times to go away, and then says "if you cared about me, you would have left me" - the obvious characters - the unnecessary - the completely unnecessary cut of the arm by Aiden's speeches. <br /> You see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I love werewolf movies, and I've tried watching it a few times to see if I'd like it more, but it just made it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I get inside. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister in scary things. Anyone over this age can suffer and want their hour and a half back.
