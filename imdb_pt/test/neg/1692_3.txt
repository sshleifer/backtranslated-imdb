I was 12 when this movie was released and adored. The music was inspiring and made me feel good, watching several times in the movies. In fact, I had the soundtrack album and played the song several times. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. Just sitting and watching him with my two daughters who liked it a lot, but my older cynical grown eyes hated it. It is very poorly run in many places and considering it was Lionel Jeffries driving I really wanted to take advantage. The animation of the character was so difficult, but the scenarios were very good. I remember critics at the time saying it was a bad movie and I was horrified, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie, yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why I thought it was good then. But that does not justify it, because it is a bad performance, direction and sloppiness. The lead actor's voice seems to be dubbed, which also distracts a lot. I can not see what they were trying to achieve when it was being done, all that became was a weak movie.
