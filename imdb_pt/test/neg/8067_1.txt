However, chances are that since you are reading this, you have seen it. <br /> <br /> From almost 500 movies, this is the only one not short that I gave a 1/10. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other low budget Asian warrior movie so I guess there are even worse things out there! Scary ... <br /> <br /> P
