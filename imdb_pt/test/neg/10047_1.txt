This failed satire exercise or commentary on the human condition easily gained a place as one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I'm seriously thinking about buying a copy, if I can find cheap dirt, drive away an unwanted company. It's honestly so bad. I see it as some sort of anti-personal weapon. If you are the type of person who only has to see a train accident to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. To be fair, the Kelsey Grammar character has a line that almost works but does not work. Unlike everything in this movie strives to be insightful, but loses the mark by approximately the distance between the earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. I can usually appreciate a book or movie in which the protagonist suffers from some kind of existential anguish, but the anguish presented here is so unbelievable and exaggerated, and the film does not even address the absurdity it presents in any way valuable. If you are familiar with the term "vomit word" then you can get a picture of the cinematheque. Oh, and the narrative structure is poorly conceived, pretentious and amateurish. Failed style and substance. If you really hate someone, invite him to a double feature film of this movie and "The Terror of the Little Town," a Western dwarf from the 1930s and place them under constraints with their eyes forced to open the "Mechanical Orange" . But that probably violates some provision in the Geneva Conventions.
