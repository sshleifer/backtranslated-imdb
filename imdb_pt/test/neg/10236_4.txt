The weather was not nice with this movie from the transition days of the sound of silence. The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help his lucky violinist that she loves. There are, of course, complications. The problem with the movie for me is that it did not age well. Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes looking so exaggerated that they are laughable. A late conversation in which Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room made me howl with the delivery of the song. There are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. It's not a bad movie, it's just that the film's technical limitations disrupt real pleasure. Usually I forgive, but this time I just could not go with the flow (So again the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). It's worth having a good mood (and be reminded that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)
