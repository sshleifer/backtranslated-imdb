This came from an adult who happened upon the first one expecting a child-oriented film and was surprised by the adult humor that was in Emperors New Groove. The character I liked the most was Kronk, so I was thrilled when I heard about the continuation (sp) featuring no other than "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just watched Kronk's new groove, it took me two days because I had to hang up, I was so bored in the middle of it. I finally watched the rest the next day and unfortunately the second half was as bad as the first. Being a Disney movie, I was hoping to have some musical scenes, however this one was filled with them and they were not having fun. The great thing I found about the New Groove Emperors was that it could be enjoyed by a wide audience, from children to adults. Kronks New Groove in all honesty did nothing for me or my girlfriend and we both loved the first. It really is aimed at small children, the comedy is rather childish, the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely tacky. <br /> <br /> Save some money and rent this movie if possible because it is definitely not worthy of a second sight. I was extremely disappointed and shocked at how this movie was released together. They actually managed to make a character (Kronk) not funny in this movie, which is incredible in itself. Obviously, all opinions are different, but I enjoy myself very easily; I usually like sequences (sp) even when others discredit them, mainly because I loved the first one so much that I needed to more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was, I would enjoy the movie. I can not say the same for this, I would never have thought that I would be turning it off in the middle due to pure boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy with Own Risk.
