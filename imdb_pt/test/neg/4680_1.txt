I recently became a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he's the most deliciously original comedian to come in years. He is refreshing and fearless in his routines, which span the gamut of topics, from how boring Bush is to the exploits of 1970's producer Robert Evans. I am a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and his innocent / schizophrenic routine of eyes wide-open Whenever she effortlessly shifts her naturally sharp voice to one that is clipped and hoarse, I can not help laughing. I liked Brian Posehn long before I knew he was in "Just Shoot Me," and there is something so naturally funny about his aged nerd personality. All three talented and exclusive comedians are "The Comedians of Comedy," a documentary from Netflix about their US tour. They really deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they deserve. I thought, no, I knew I would like this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Instead of the three comics each getting their own daily segments, "The Comedians of Comedy" is bogged down by sinuous and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor, no insight, no real interest. I think there are a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines in the 109-minute movie. What an idiot! Come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars playing in their trailer? Where is the mood to see Posehn in a gallery and a comic shop? Does anyone find particularly funny random restaurant scenes? If this movie could not have shown our comics parading their things, at least do about what life on the road is like. It's not even about that. Worst of all, the comics never seem to be having too much fun. Oswalt admits how bored he is doing a radio interview, Posehn shyly admits how bad he is at touring his house, and Bamford improvises nervously every time the camera is aimed at her, and his humor is only sporadic. <br /> <br /> Sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, unbelievably crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like Dane Cook. Instead, we have to go through their daily routine routines on the road in a low quality movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film. If you can locate any of Oswalt, Posehn's or Bamford's DVD presentations, do so. Your talent should be a joy to contemplate, not a task like this here.
