This is by far the most horrible movie I have ever watched. I have never before rated a 1 out of 10. My advice is do not watch it. This does not even qualify as a movie. <br /> <br /> You'd better sit on the bored couch instead of watching this movie. Acting was terrible, but the worst was by far the plot. Highly unlikely sequence of events that are not even funny. They are really very lame and stupid. Pick a lot of fool by Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid to star in this movie. It could even mess up their career. <br /> <br /> When I joined Blockbuster, the main focus was on the movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret it. <br /> <br /> Once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie, you could basically predict what would happen. I hoped it would get better, but instead it got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating it. The movie is terrible. Do not watch. Hope this helps.
