Nothing will beat KOMODO with the lovely Jill Hennessey as a psychiatrist (!), But the KvC is not as bad as I'd hoped for a quickie on the SYFY channel. Just be sure to watch it while you're drunk or stoned, or while you're trying to sleep. The unimaginative title basically says it all: a group of actors, mostly unknown, converge on an island where a government experiment to grow giant vegetables went awry. Giant creatures that came in contact with the vegetables took over the island and ate them all. So now the government is preparing to blow up the island, regardless of the people who are there. The acting is wonderfully atrocious, especially a mustachioed right of the Incredible Hulk TV series, but this is typical of this type of cable made for cable. CGI creatures are of TV-grade quality, which means you know you're watching cartoon monsters. However, two of the girls in the group are very cute, and worth seeing while they run here and there in their tight suits. You just want to eat them!
