This movie could have great potential. Certainly, with the current technology, one could expect real special effects. But the films are not only made with special effects, of course the acting is necessary. This movie did not have both! <br /> <br /> First, let me tell those who are upset about this, not following the bible: why a movie can not have artistic license? If you want to know about the story of Moses, read the bible. I've seen very few movies that follow a true story, fact by fact. Look at the film from its artistic qualities. <br /> <br /> By watching this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. It fails miserably in that. Heston and Brenner had PRESENCE. They became their roles. You do not see it here. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not compare, stand on your own, this movie will be very rushed. Parts where a scene should be developed, this does not happen. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this one and see the other one. However exaggerated the other is, it is by far the best film.
