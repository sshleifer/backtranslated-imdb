This is not exactly a complicated story. It is not a mystery or a plot that you need to spend time watching because you have lost an intrinsic part of the dialogue. Stating that a movie has to be seen multiple times for you to "get" can apply to very few movies, however, this is not one of them. These types of movies have substance and are so engaging that it's easy to miss an important part of the dialogue, or a subtle nuance to plot details that you may have overlooked. With Goya's ghosts this does not apply. The main flaw in this movie is the lack of detail. He jumps from one character to another, never giving enough substance to any set of scenes to allow the involvement of those who are watching. Because of this you do not connect with any of the characters. You do not get to the point where you care. Either the main actor is gone, just like the movie looks like it's going to redeem itself, or your actions are despicable and you're not inclined to do it anyway. Goya's refusal to go far to help Ines is a good example. His refusal to compromise still mirrors the general tone on his part. The only characters you can feel momentarily are Ines, when she is being interrogated and then tortured. After Lorenzo's rape, any focus on his character disappeared. After that, the only other in-depth involvement comes from the film's best scenes, centered on Lorenzo's invitation to dine with Ines's family, and his parents try to force Lorenzo to sign a false confession and retrieve his daughter. So when things start to develop again, they disappear from the movie. I read many reviews here about how the movie did not know what it wanted to be, etc. I figured he basically did not get much of anything. From Lorenzo's return and the coincident vision of Ines's daughter by Goya, everything seemed nothing more than planned. Without much history, no effort to really examine the turbulent times in which they lived happened. The essence of whom Goya was did not materialize, except his actions, or the lack of them, proving that he was more self-centered than anything else. As for his art, the film seemed intent on examining some of the paintings he did, but again wasted another opportunity by examining the reactions to that work rather than the work itself. To summarize things better, the film had no cohesion, it lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered, and by the end, you felt as if you had seen a series of aborted attempts to involve the viewer by changing something to another without properly involving the viewer in any of them. You can not watch something like this several times, hoping it will improve with the additional examination. There simply is not enough to waste time. It's not a case of you missing something, it would just be further proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good are simply not there. How much better movie ever made? It's not even the best movie I watched today.
