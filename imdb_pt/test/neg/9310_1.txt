I can not emphasize how bad this movie is. This director took all the unintelligent and cheap photos to make these people look so "distressed". Why are your clothes so dirty? Why the hell would you get the new Clark to play a crack head? You should be banned from movies for the rest of your life Buddy Giovinazzo. <br /> <br /> I take serious offense to this idiot wanting to play real actors like thugs and delinquents as some kind of smart joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they screaming so much? Why is everyone so mean? Why are these children so filthy? Would not anyone want to be so filthy? Not even a drugged child. <br /> <br /> You need to grow up and not make any movies again.
