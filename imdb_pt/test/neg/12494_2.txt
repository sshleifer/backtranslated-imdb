This movie was obviously done on a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? It seemed that they made no effort to make the "future" look less futuristic. For example, the first scene happens in an 80's office building and all the cars that are exploded are from the late 70's (I suppose they do not want to blow up cars that cost more than $ 500). In addition, it is quite obvious that Don "the Dragon" is driving his personal car during the film (after all, he partially funded the film). Finally, they point out at the beginning of the movie that all kinds of drugs are legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. Not only does this never become important in the movie, but later when he does not need surgery without anesthesia, why does not he just go out looking for some cool heroine or morphine? The whole movie is sloppy like this and completely anticlimactic, as Don easily explodes an "unstoppable" Cybertracker about 25 minutes after the movie. However, if you find this movie cheap or free, I watch it, the last scene is almost worth supporting the whole movie.
