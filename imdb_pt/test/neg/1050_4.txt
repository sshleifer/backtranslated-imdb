This is really a two halves movie. The first detailing the life and friendship of two boys (one of them, a privileged Pashtun and the other, Hazara) in the late 1970s in Afghanistan before the invasion of the USSR works extremely well. The young actors present compelling performances and see Afghanistan as once played the present situation there in full relief. <br /> <br /> The real problem arises when we enter the later phase of history where we join the Pashtuns. like a man who lives in America. Old debts to his young friend lead him back to his homeland and it is really at this moment that things crumble. The central adult character is clearly supposedly sympathetic, but actually appears as a coward and wallowing in self-pity. It's hard to really take care of him and we can not help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we can not see - that of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> As soon as he returns to Afghanistan, the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly planned coincidences. Most notably, he is able to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (though he is not looking for him) despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This allows him to face past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be believable. Narrative resolution is also analyzed with a horrible and malicious sentimentality that undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make. <br /> <br /> Although it is possible to begin to see the characters and abuses of your films. Lives as symbols of a state that has been torn apart by world politics, it is hard to really see this as a film that engages in any broader political discussion. Instead, the narrative is reduced to a character's emotional journey of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so monotonous and confusing that it's hard to get really involved in his story, while opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.
