Carlos may not be the most original comic, but the first series was fun, his comments sincere and his remarks were recent. I missed a few seasons, but after all the allegations of material theft I caught some episodes of Mencia's Mind at the end of July 7. I see a little change! Carlos is much more connected to humor and sexual jokes than the racing remarks. In one episode, he kind of hinted that he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I think not. Maybe Comedy Central gave it another season, but the episodes I saw sounded tired and with more words than the Osbournes. Carlos, get back on your feet for a few years, get some new stuff and try again.
