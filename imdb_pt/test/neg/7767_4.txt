I did not expect much from the movie so I'm not disappointed. Carrie looked ugly, Mr. Big's eyebrows were colored with wax chalk and Samantha said nothing. Charlotte's boy was annoying to watch while she was in many scenes - the title could easily have been "SATC: Parents' Night Out". The angles of the camera were simply not so good, especially in relation to Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a symbolic black woman whose character did not have a proper outlet and few appearances from gay friends who seemed to have been thrown for no purpose. Samantha coming and going from LA choked the flow of the story, especially when she enters Fashion Week and nothing happens. The film seems to have been done in a hurry because it could have been good, but scenes were played to show off different clothes or to give viewers the chance to return to the show without adding much to the scene. story of the movie.
