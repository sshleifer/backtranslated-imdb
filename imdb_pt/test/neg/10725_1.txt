A satire on greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes they pathetically try to ridicule. The reign of Jim Carrey was certainly of short duration. He is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his portrait is nothing short of frightening. He produced this, this "masterpiece" too, so he can not blame anyone here. "The number one comedy in America," screams the desperate TV adds. Of course Jim Carrey was supposed to guarantee full houses, but the game is over. If I look angry it's because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, in addition to, among tickets, parking, Coca-Cola flat, almost $ 45, starring and producing mr. Carry. Not anymore, you hear? No longer.
