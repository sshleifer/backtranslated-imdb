I'm a big fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. I think the best features of zombie movies are the sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This film focused more on a "let's leave it bloody" view. <br /> <br /> The film was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies come off the ground and knock the guy down, there's blood coming out of the hole. I was not aware that the holes in the planes floors bleed so widely. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst acting I ever saw when she woke up and started to feel bad. I laughed a lot when she died. He deserved it in every way. <br /> <br /> I was a bit confused about why Dr. Kelly could speak after becoming a zombie, but there was nothing said by another zombie because of screams and annoying screams. And they seemed to be killing the zombies fairly efficiently, throwing them in the abdomen, but when Dr. Bennett gets kicked out of the plane and into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live in the end. I kind of felt like they changed things to create a "good" scene. When one of the malicious girlfriends (I did not have time to learn their names. They played a useless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a two-way mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I've never broken a mirror on a plane (bad luck and everything), but I doubt there's a lot of space behind there, with the bathroom's insanely confined space and all. <br /> <br /> The few redeeming qualities were too late, unfortunately. One thing the movie had to do was smoke hot flight attendants, but they felt the need to kill all but one. And I'll admit to laughing a lot when the old lady masturbates Frank's arm and he says "She's rolling me to death" or something. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm sad. wasted my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it is kind of redeeming it, but still ... He failed on many levels. Stay with Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later.
