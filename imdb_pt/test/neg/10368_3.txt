So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad but still a great guilty and fun to watch. From the beginning of this movie, I knew I was in trouble. The Egyptian skull style villain Power Rangers who watches the Rita-style repulsion of the puppets through his glass pyramid came straight out of the left field! All the additions to this franchise in this story have been completely absurd! Suddenly we have a wide variety of all sorts of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three movies. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was being written, the writers had visions of ever seeing an Egyptian villain of the Power Rangers, totem monsters, annoying twenty-something people who could not seriously act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists , but never say anything clever), and a lame doll "Decapitron" whose head may turn into the ghost of Toulon. <br /> <br /> Another thing that disappointed me a lot in this movie was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the dolls are back at the Bodega Bay Inn, back to their case (minus Blade), and for some reason Toulon is willing to help their dolls again (he betrays them in part II for his love for Elsa). This is not explained to EVERYBODY ... and so with that, and all that other garbage thrown, I did not amuse myself any more. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you want. I even collect rare B-movie laser discs that you can not find on DVD, so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they just got what they had instead of trying to fix something that was not broken, well, the series can still be live and with good health. That said, even if the reviews are not so good, I'm really interested in checking out the Retro Puppet Master, which seems interesting and pays great tribute to the original themes.
