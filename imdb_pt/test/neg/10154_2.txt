my friend and I rented this a few nights ago. and, I must say, this is the best movie I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "man, we'd better get some beer before the joint closes" and "man, gorgeous is not wearing a bra again." what poetry there! and it's a wonderfully original movie as well. I mean, you do not usually find a horror movie where every murder is exactly the same. I mean, exactly! now this is originality. and almost all transitions between scenes are those great psychotic close-ups in the ER scrubs. that Cool! the acting is so wonderful to. the father was simply brilliant. must have studied REAL PARENTS before filming. And how many movies do you think just do not make sense? not many. but this is one of those precious stones. I mean, how cool is it that a guy waited outside for about six hours to play a joke while his friends were inside? this is really cool. in general I would say this is the biggest film of the genre, or better, in the world! *****
