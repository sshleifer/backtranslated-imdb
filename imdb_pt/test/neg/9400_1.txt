Yes, I really found this movie unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I did not like the character Sandra Oh, she really bothered me. It is unlikely to be accepted in rural Italy because it is not white. this was a bit of PC nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film is also offensive to Italian men. For example, the only man she (Diane Lane) has an affair turns out to be a caddish scam. But guess what: in the end, her typically plasticized brick head appears, with a white, tanned smile, and she finally finds what she wants all the time: a real American man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is quite racist in its description of the Italians and the way it subjugates them as daring peasants or backward peasants. <br /> <br /> The photography was good, but the film and its attitude were rubbish.
