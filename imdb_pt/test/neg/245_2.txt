The first 2/3 of this movie was not so different from the American mummy movies of the 1930s and 1940s. Two lovers of ancient Mexico dared defy the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to keep the sacred treasure and her beloved. And the lady was reincarnated today and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all about the typical mummy movie ... although it's a bit slower and duller than the American versions. Oh, of course, the Aztec mummy looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> However, in this standard movie, but boring, there is a super-villain. Because? I do not know - it certainly did not make sense to have one. It seems that this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and make her show where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the necessary equipment to make an army of atomic robots, mannequin! But first he has to build a single mummy to defeat the mummy, since the mummy so far has been unstoppable. <br /> <br /> You have to see these "human robots" as they look like the huge clumsy. Flash Gordon robots and other series BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really seem hilarious and see the conclusion that when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot worth watching the rest of the boring movie. They both fight in super-slow motion like they're bathed in taffy ... and it's done so naively and foolishly that it's bound to provoke laughter - certainly not exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is terribly boring and a messy mess - especially in the end. However, for fans of bad movies, it's a must-it's bad, but unintentionally funny and great for watching and laughing with friends.
