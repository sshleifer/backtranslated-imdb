I watched this movie with a kind of dangerous fascination, like a hedgehog stuck in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you liked it) is a bad movie, but the important question is why? You have a good cast; is lively; is prepared to face the sex of the front, with some of the characters really getting something here and there, which is unusual for a British comedy. Also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, the Marmite artists agreed, but they have had their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What is lacking most of all is the charm. The characters are incredibly stupid, unbelievable and alienating, so instead of a Men Behaving Badly movie, the producers made the Game On. Any mediocre writer who wanted to make a movie about the sexual attitudes of British, sexist men and sexists, would have gotten some copies of Loaded, Zoo or even Viz to read Sid, the sexist, and the thing would have been written. Instead, the producers have clearly tried to create idiot characters, difficult to worry about. Comedy of character - unlike pastelain etc - only works if the public can recognize some human truth for the situation. But watching this movie is like listening to an annoying joke that you know will not end up weird but you can not stop it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is also poorly produced. The structure of the plot is weak, there is little delineation or character development, and many of the scenes are not funny. Time after time, the same lame reggae begins to divide the scenes, useless and gracefully. There's a lot of unnecessary repetition - when you make a joke about parking outside a sex party, you do not have to do it again. One can imagine what the UK Film Council saw in the screenplay. <br /> <br /> This is a world where most men are rakes, and most women are always ready for it. The apartment and Alfie satirized the same world view, but the producers of this film accept without criticism. So, they ended up with a sort of inferior upgrade from Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Someone British needs to have another go in this sort of thing, and do it properly? a good upcoming project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I think ...
