I'm seeing a pattern here. If you watch a movie at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, chances are that if you go to the movie, there will be hordes of movie lovers, even though you were chosen to be on that TV show because it was too bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as being a science fiction movie that emphasized realism. Well, if that is the case, I could write for several paragraphs on how, even with the knowledge of 1950, this movie is totally flawed. Gravity may be the first obvious observation, or as MST3K did as a "selective gravity" sketch, also about when they are plunging to death and they are just standing looking out of the window, hum would'nt the ship being head low effect that scene? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that this ran over the budget or something, but I think that this movie was just a plain cheese, like the under type. Just compare this with "When Worlds Collide," which was released in 1951 to see the real place where this movie ranks, there is no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own, it's not even funny to watch on its own. It gets a 5 or 6 as an episode of MST3K, since there is no action or too much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh I mentioned, it's bad.
