Jon Stewart (aka John Liebowitz) constantly rips conservatism and anything republican. This liberal comedian is anything but as he dumps his "humor" in the throats of impressionable young people. I saw the show while I was stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy is bordering on betrayal. He will take the side of Al Queda over Bush at any moment. He is shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a false laugh. I remember four years ago when he "interviewed" John Kerry. The two made faces to each other that seemed to hinder a catch session. It was like, "get a room, guys." I just do not like little traitors who distribute their propaganda. Call me superficial. The Daily Show has had a long run and there are many liberals of similar thinking who have a fiery hatred for Republicans and conservatism. I'm not surprised by your success, but is it that many people actually watch Comedy Central? That guy from Mancia makes me puke.
