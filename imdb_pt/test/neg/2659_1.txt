It was not until I saw Sidney Pollack in the picture that I already called him this movie. This is your worst movie possible. Absolute Dreck. The dialogue is wooden and unbelievable, the plot is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas is wasted in this movie. There's nothing about her character that makes you want to believe this story. <br /> <br/> Harrison Ford is like Valium. There is no life in your eyes. <br /> <br /> I blame Sidney Pollack for the failure of this movie. The script is horrible, and he's too smart not to see it. So it looks like some kind of reward, be it from a studio bond or something else, but that's just BLEED ROTATION!
