I saw the first two nights before coming to the IMDb looking for some actor information. I saw the 9+ rating which surprised me since I was not so impressed with what I had seen. (As a reference, I happen to believe the Lonesome Dove was the best Western TV ever. I grew up alongside MGM's backlogs in Culver City in the 1950s and I have a sense of reverence about the Western genre. ) <br /> So I saw the first glossy review and decided to read "more". There I found several comments with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings about the lack of character development, bad editing, feeling that it was filmed on Universal's lot (MGM's already gone) and general impression that it will not come close to changing my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0". <br /> <br /> This led me to think about the process that yields a rating of 9+. If the people who give the 10s and 9s do not take time to justify their vote, is the ballot box being filled by people with a monetary motivation? I have long used IMDb as a tool to display movies and found the best available. Now I'm not so sure.
