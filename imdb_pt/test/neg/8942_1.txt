OH MY GOD I'M LOST Now I know that all this guy does is Pointless R J A wrote on August 13, 2006 (post # 881): What a terrible experience. It looked like a group of 3rd grade students stole a video camera, borrowed some old 1995 edition software, and joked with each other.

This was a group of friends having fun and recording each other. The plot was very difficult to follow. The attempt of artistic camera angles has damaged the story and in itself has become a dizzying experience all along. The performance, though comical, was very amateurish. The concept is fine, I think. Maybe next time, producers should raise some capital and hire real professionals and try again. I must say I'm tired of thinking that making a good movie is easy. It is not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can make a good product. I think in the end they will learn how difficult it is I am so disgusted I do not have any comments Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (post # 762):
