This movie has the distinction of being the worst movie I've ever seen, and the only movie I've ever given 1 in 10 on imdb so far. I was fooled into renting it because of the cool art of H.R. Giger's hood in the box. This cover art is the only good thing about that steaming pile of ... It was about frat boys fighting "freaks" in a strange post-apocalyptic world, but not a little interesting, where the cities are in ruins / chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and wonderful place for the young to get other men into fraternity organizations. The uninspiring performances of boring characters, not-so-special effects, dark and unoriginal scenarios, and generally extremely low quality in every aspect of production make this lemon the all-time loser on my list. FINAL CLASSIFICATION: 1/10 I would like to give a zero. <br /> <br /> Noob Aalox
