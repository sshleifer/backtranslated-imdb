The story begins in the house of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and the father seemed to act a little quiet and reserved with one another. They continue to give her daughter her gift, which is both of them and made me look funny on the faces of the two parents when they gave the child that gift, it was almost like 'I hope she likes it!' There is a murder in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart, (Julia Kerbridge), "Reaper", 2000, gets involved with the case because of family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disturbs her whole life. Rob Lowe (Kevin Finney), "View From The Top", 03 is a neighbor in the same apartment as Julia and he goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad movie but it certainly is nothing to go crazy unless you enjoy a movie in Canada and a beautiful Catherine Mary Stewart, a native of Canada.
