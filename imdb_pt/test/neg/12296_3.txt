Yes. Those of my generation who grew up watching those old Sunbow cartoons were spoiled. The 80s Joe Tune was one of the best cartoons in television history. Well written stories, well-developed characters. Granted it was nothing more than a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. Fast forward almost twenty years later and between Value vs. Poison. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed spasmodic and marionette. The film looked more like a sequence of Little Soldiers than a story about a special military force. Then we have character development or lack thereof. Dusty like to be all dusty? Slice and dice like to do things together? What? Did the writers do a writing course on how to develop characters with the depth equivalent to Jar Jar Binks? As for history. I like a bit of science fiction. But this whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army was done to the death in Joe's universe. Mega Monsters or Toxo-zombies anyone? But I credit the creators for trying to make fans happy to have a martial arts action every 10 minutes. I'm not a big fan of SE and SS, but I enjoyed the fight scenes between the two. If you can enjoy VVV for what it is you will enjoy it. I admit that I can not appreciate VVV as it should. Again, everything Joe does is compared to what was done in the '80s, and honestly, nothing compares to the glory days of GI Joe. If you can enjoy VVV for what it is you will enjoy it.
