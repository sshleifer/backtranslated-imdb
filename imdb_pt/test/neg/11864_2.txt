This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I could hardly stay awake. The acting and the plot were horrible. I like B movies, but this movie has nothing that makes me laugh or think. OK, there were two or three funny moments in the beginning, so I have to give this 2 out of 10. If you really want to watch, watch the first 10 minutes. After that, you'll be more and more disappointed while the movie runs.
