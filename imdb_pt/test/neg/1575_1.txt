Put the film down and back slowly. The acting rivals a high school play, the plot is worn out and the production values ​​are slightly higher than the community theater. The stooges are so plentiful that it becomes a laugh. Rooms are changed, movement of the dead, dogs are used for wolves, men shot with .45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles, button blouses and unbutton without human touch ... this is a movie baaaaaaaaaddddddd. I almost fainted when I saw the average rating. There is no accounting for taste. BTW, there is no nudity.
