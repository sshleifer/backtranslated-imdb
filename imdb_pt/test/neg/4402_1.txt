It's like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class and the teacher to sleep. <br /> <br /> Totally tedious and silent (yes, silent) strings of unrelated video clips. <br /> <br /> Instead of this film, watch the paint dry or the grass grow - it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing the Arabs being malicious with everyone around them. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (the director) should be ashamed of this film waste. <br /> <br /> Deserves one for the quality of the film, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or lack thereof).
