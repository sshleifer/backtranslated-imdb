First, let me start by saying that I am an amateur of Laurel and Hardy. I read all the books printed on them and have seen all the movies available more than once. I even took a chance and called Stan on the phone. He was very kind and spoke to me for more than ten minutes. I followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back. I still have this letter. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good comedy moments, but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual form. Stan was seriously ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later. In my opinion, any Laurel and Hardy movie is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> But the final opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To quote him: "This movie should never have been made."
