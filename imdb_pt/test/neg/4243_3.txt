It really surprised me to see that someone would take so long to evaluate such a bad movie. The beginning (of the film) had some truth in it. Partisan "AF" was started in 1943, when two AF Croat Ustashi communist pilots deserted, along with their observers, in Breguet 19 and Potez 33, respectively. The aircraft saw some action in the bombing and hand-bombing, but did not last long. One crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot was killed later while piloting a Spitfire Vc. True party squadrons were established when the RAF deployed two of its Spitfire Vc (Yugoslav) squads, and Hurricane IIc, respectively, manned by pilots of the former Yugoslav Air Force, and assigned them to Tito's forces on the island of Vis. Even those were never involved in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was a giant cow dung, to say the least, and the lowest point to its director, not bad at all. On a whim of fate, I was present in the filming of the last sequence of the film, when dozens of German planes were destroyed (522 Yugoslav trainers, also used in the air sequences) at Mostar military airport. The pyrotechnics were impressive, and the Scot served luxuriously by the film crew was even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameless lie and was often joked by the contemporary audience.
