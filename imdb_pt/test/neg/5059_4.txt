Mr. Moto's Gamble has a fairly straightforward plot - when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the even more mysterious Mr. Moto to solve the case. <br /> <br /> shocked by the number of positive reviews of Moto's Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... well, I found it extremely disappointing. I like Mr. Moto and I like Charlie Chan, but I can not say I cared about this mixture of the two. For those who are unfamiliar with the story behind Moto's Gamble, it was originally planned to be a Charlie Chan movie. But when Warner Oland gave up, some scenes and actions were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I indicated, the final result left me disappointed. Mr. Moto is not Chan. He is more mysterious, more athletic and more exotic. So trying to put Moto in a Chan movie is like trying to fit a square stake into a round hole - it does not work. And listening to Lorre / Moto trying to deliver one of Chan's trademark euphemisms ends up sounding silly. Add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already short 72-minute runtime consists of boxing scenes (something I never seem to like) and you end up with a movie that I could not help liking. If I have to say something positive, I would like to point out Keye Luke's performance. But even he's not close enough to save Moto Gamble in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but a 4/10 is the best I can give this one.
