This is the worst exercise of middle-class pretension coming to our television screens. I unfortunately did not see it when it was shown for the first time, but I paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating nonsense - and I'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. I love Tasmin Greig being a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing and so I know she's capable of the best of comedy parts. However, she played this role as well as she was able, considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided. Please broadcasters should keep in mind that the Business Descriptions Decree can be invoked if you continue to charge as comic material which is, at best, a psychological romanticism, and at worst a drama that presents itself as a peculiar comedy to hide the fact that it is neither fish nor chicken. .
