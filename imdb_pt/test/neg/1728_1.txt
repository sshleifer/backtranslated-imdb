I became increasingly annoyed with the progress of the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) has predicted that a meteor will hit Earth. The "powerful" do not believe him, so he begins to build a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a fortunate reporter. to a useless tabloid who gets a hint from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains. He sets out to investigate. <br /> <br /> While trying to enter the secret survival shelter, Jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them up to an inch of their lives. He spends the rest of his time complaining to Dr. Crawford about who gave the doctor the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I found myself wishing Jake did a great favor for the future. and turn a gun on yourself. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this turkey.
