The digital effects were made on the cheap and the action sequences have no suspense. This was essentially done for TV and shows. David Suchet looks bored and Nigel Planer looks down with shame! and as for Robert Carlyle's London accent, Dick Van Dyke, no comment! If you want to spend an hour or two when you have nothing, then it will work. If you're going to buy the DVD, wait a few weeks and get it on Asda's bargain, because that's where it's going! If the budget was higher and Richard Doyle's book followed more closely, then it might have been something special, but how a bit bad. Watch the trailer instead! Or read the book and see what it might have been.
