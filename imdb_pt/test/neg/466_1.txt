I had high hopes of seeing this, as I always enjoy the performances of Paul Bettany. I thought he was very good as Darwin, and did his best considering the terrible stuff he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book About the Origin of Species was one of the most innovative, controversial and innovative. publications never, but you would never think that based on this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is virtually nothing about Darwin's five-year voyage in The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, for example, certainly of paramount importance to history as it was from his wildlife investigations that he began to form his theory of evolution. This is just a long, somber domestic drama, with Darwin portrayed as a slightly wacky eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and receiving the cold shoulder of his emotionally constipated wife. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of Emma Darwin is awful and has little connection with the historical descriptions of the real Emma. There may have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, whether from Emma or the local priest, played by Jeremy Northam (a blinking and losing part, which is a complete waste). of a talented actor) to act as a counterweight to Darwin's views, but was not resumed. <br /> <br /> The story focused a lot on an endless feeling about Darwin's pain for his daughter Annie, and a long time was also wasted on Darwin wondering if he would write his book or not. Eventually, I was so bored that it was hard to care. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours focusing on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.
