Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the greatest comedy team of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cockroaches, many of which were parodies of great Hollywood traits. Most of Laurel's "parody" movies are only slightly funny, and even less funny to modern audiences who have not seen the original movie Laurel is parodying. Fortunately, 'Mud and Sand' satirizes a still-well-known film 'Blood and Sand', starring Rudolph Valentino. 'Blood and Sand' was released just nine weeks before this parody, giving you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's movies were edited, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Several sources (including IMDb) state that Stan Laurel character in this film is called Vasibarino Rhubarb, with an 'o' ending. I displayed an impression of 'Mud and Sand' with the original titles (in the Hobo type font), so I reported that Laurel's role is actually shouting Rhubarb Vaseline, with an 'e'. But I agree that 'Vaseline' is funnier. Laurel copies the elaborate cutlets that Valentino wore in 'Blood and Sand' (he should have made them more!), And there's a parody of Valentino's dress scene from that movie, which made the movie women faint in 1922. A young lady named Carmen in the original movie is parodied here as Caramel (a girl I'd like to sink my teeth into). <br /> <br /> This movie (like the original) apparently takes place in Spain, but there is a gag on the Dry Law. . Laurel uses a characteristic gesture here that could have become a trademark for him (like the characteristic turn of Hardy's tie), but I've never seen him in any other Laurel film. There are some fun dialogues: Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other killers to "Save a bull for me". When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, a footman tells him "The bull is without, sir" ... which is funny, but I was disappointed that Laurel did not respond "without what?" <br /> <br /> There is a funny moment here that almost certainly was not planned when Vaseline appears for the bullfighting hearings. Laurel goes to the bullring and - before she can say "dear run" - he throws a bull over the fence, where he falls with a thud near the other auditors. The bull is obviously fake, but the joke is funny anyway ... and, yes, there is a title card with a joke about "playing the bull". The casual moment occurs when Laurel repeats the gag and Vaseline hurls a second bull over the fence. This one lands on the butt and balances for a moment before it falls. Very funny! If anyone planned this joke in this quick comedy, I greet the unknown gagsmith ... and the technician who manipulated the bull to land in that position. It's more likely to have happened by luck, and the director and editor were smart enough to keep it. During the silent movie era, whenever Hollywood made a big-budget movie that was set anywhere people dress, they did not speak English, it was a common cinematic device to show a piece of text or an inscription in the local jargon, then dissolve in a scene of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low-budget comedy spent the money to copy this device here: we see a billboard outside the race with a message in Spanish, then it dissolves in the same text in English. Unfortunately, photography in this cheap movie is so obscure that the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> The actresses in this movie are attractive ... including Broncho Billy's wife, Leona Anderson, and Stan Laurel's law-abiding wife, Mae Dahlberg. ; the latter briefly makes a beautiful dance. (Mae danced in Stan's vaudeville act). I was surprised to find Charlie Chaplin's half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a brief paper, since Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In 'Mud and Sand', Laurel performs a funny performance that is quite different from her more familiar Stanley character ... but this movie is a lot less funny than her brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: only 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Twenty-three years later, in Stan Laurel's last American film 'The Bullfighters' (1945) he again played a Spanish bullfighter (with his post-dubbed Spanish voice). ). Coincidentally, this movie used footage from 'Blood and Sand': not the Valentino movie, but the remake of Tyrone Power. 'Mud and Sand' is funnier than 'The Bullfighters', but not much.
