Okay, so I'm relaxing in my room when Mom knocks on the door. I open the door and what I see in her hands? "HIGH GOLDEN SLEEPING". I think it has to be an older horror movie because nowadays someone may be stupid enough to name a movie that after the blockbuster hit "Sleepy Hollow," starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. That alone should have kept me from putting him in V.C.R. But no, I had to risk it, I had to believe that this movie could have a little ray of hope. Little did I know the rays where there is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> Number one, the plot is so ridiculous that it's probably true in some inland city. Two, the actors seem more people than the real-life people who happen to ask each other on the set when the director screams. Three, almost any film starring the director is always horrible. But the funny thing is that this is another movie directed by Kevin Summerfield. I became relying on your movie to take me to the floor with a small laugh. <br /> <br /> Where to start this movie? I know, let's start with the corridor in the forest. The lighting of the camera was so bad that I thought the hallway was still and the man on the camera was running. I love how the woman stops eating a chocolate bar. I mean, it's just about the darkness, or just about the light, who could tell with the lighting of the camera. And she stops running to eat a bar of chocolate, I mean a BAR OF CANDY THAT HELL. So she ends up being the first victim because of stupidity, and I'm ready to break the tape, find the director, burn her little hands. <br /> <br /> So, out of nowhere, some guys like to try and fix it. a car that was probably broken a few years ago. Then comes the fake Mack 10 and a very real prostitute, who happens to be part of our main cast. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of children who get into trouble. And you are given the choice to pick up trash at Sleepy Hollow Park or face the suspension forever. We sent in the bush one of the teachers (Mr.E or Kevin Summfield) who supposedly watches over them and makes sure everything goes well. The funniest thing is how poorly developed the cards are. I mean what it is with the fake face of Mack 10 and who ever heard of Hacker trying to kill himself. And some as one of the students had an affair with Professor Mr. E, before even all this crap of community service came along. However, the school still thought it was a good idea to let it go. There is also a student named J, that the goal of the movie is to continue annoyingly appearing nowhere, trying to make the audience jump, when all he really does is increase the film's low price. The sound was so horrible in this movie. I mean, there was a visa when two guys are fighting, and the guy punches the other guy in the stomach, and off the TV comes that sound effect that sounds like someone punching an old wooden box. It started horribly and ended dangerously stupid, even my taste. I'll say that though, the music on the back ground made the scenes seem tolerable. But not very tolerable. My conclusion is as follows, if you want to get into another movie that Kevin Summfield took seriously buy "Sleepy Hollow High". PS I'm still thinking of shooting me to remove the images from the fake Mack 10. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
