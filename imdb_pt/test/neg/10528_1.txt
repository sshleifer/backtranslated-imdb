This movie is sometimes a wild sex comedy from the 80's college, another a sweet romantic ... Then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles on science fiction traits ... It's so uneven it's almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But I would hardly rate it as one of the worst movies I've ever seen except, of course, that they hired Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing for him to work on here. Poor dialogue, bad performances to work out, all poor ... And yet he is fantastic ... There is not a good thing on his part and yet he does it work with pure charm alone. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was so capable of achieving so much with so little brilliance is a spotlight on how much everyone else in this movie has failed, making it look even worse than I suppose it really is ... If any other actor were in the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie like crap and would never think of it again, but an excellent Peter O'Toole performance, despite all the odds , ensures that I will remember this movie for a long time. time to come ... if only like a movie that maybe it might have been nice if someone involved in it was almost as good as Peter O'Toole.
