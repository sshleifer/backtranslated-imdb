A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the death to the local police and becomes a target of success for Mafia agents. A professional assassin, Dennis Hopper, hired by the Mafia, is chasing her to prepare for success, but eventually he falls in love with her. So, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome, which defines a case where a kidnapped hostage begins to like and cooperate with the abductor, Jodie Foster also falls in love with her abductor, makes love and both prepare for an escape. <br /> <br /> Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing, and can not keep up with the artistic level of a great performer like Dennis Hopper is. There is no real emotion and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is saved to some extent by the performance of Jodie Foster, who is not at her best, but still shines with her talent, beauty and gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price, and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn known for his great part in "Wall Street". <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the movie, it is not a complete loss; this film offers easy entertainment, but we expect much more from the director of "Easy Rider", and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "The Accused."
