Do yourself a favor and stay away from that movie. Less than 50 billion of 10. If you want strong action, do not rent it! If you want a good independent movie, look somewhere else! <br /> <br /> I never thought of seeing Burt Reynolds in such a bad movie. It has the finest storyline of all time. The Van Damm films must win an academy compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe once again proves why he is not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a drug addict better than him. I do not want to bore you with more facts about this low-quality movie except to say that you'd better rent anything for Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. That should prove my point, if you understand me. <br /> <br />
