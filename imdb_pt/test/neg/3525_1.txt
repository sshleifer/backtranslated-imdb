Let me see ... I've seen all the movies Lou Ferrigno made. I've seen Batman and Robin ... twice. I memorized the dances on Breakin '2: Electric Boogaloo ... I watched Blade Runner's endless student movies ... but this movie is the most painful thing I've ever seen. <br /> This was the first film for the "direct to the video market". So you can thank Blood Cult for all these mysterious movies of Michael Dudikoff at the local Blockbuster. You should know that this is not even high quality video. This is the degree of consumer. This is his father's video camera he never uses. That's what you have to look for for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with the details of the plot since I'm getting sleepy just thinking about it, but I'll tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. I only watch this movie when I'm angry with myself. So, I recommend this movie if you are suicidal, or if you are willing to take a big challenge. <br /> <br /> If you rent this movie (God be merciful), you will know what it is about the first 10 minutes. That's when you get hit by the usual introduction of the horror movie. You know what to do. There is a lot of suspense and it builds before a girl dies. Yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. This is the most annoying introduction I've ever seen. I honestly believe you could take a camera off ebay for ten bucks, get the butt that smells the most gin and candy, and tell him to film his mother cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this introduction. It bored me to tears. I cried like a baby. <br /> <br /> Another of the things that makes this movie so incredibly painful is its actors. Yes, I saw bad performances. TRUST ME. I've seen Oliver Twist's fourth-grade productions with more realistic dialogues. The lead actor makes me sick. The "supportive" actress is a disaster of a human. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on your boyfriend. True horror. <br /> <br /> So, rent this movie if you can find it. You will never be more depressed by spending $ 3 on anything else.
