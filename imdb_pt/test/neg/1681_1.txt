Dull characters on a note with almost no development, deadpan performances of people who sound as if they are simply reading lines, and ridiculous special effects combine to make it a real smell of shit. The story begins with the eminently mild Russian and his colleagues attacking an Al-Qaeda training base. The scene tells us that al-Qaeda has recently sought a definitive weapon, and also serves to illustrate Russo's unique character trait, a tendency to avoid teamwork. With the help of a collection of blank slates and walking stereotypes, including a Russian spy, Russo travels to Chechen territory to pick up a mad scientist who works for the terrorists. Along the way, they encounter vast hordes of meat-eating bats flying in broad daylight for some reason. From there, the film becomes nothing more than a drag swamp of ridiculous action, including a scene in which a swarm of bats cuts a soldier's arm!
