Pretentious horror movie that looks like a novel that turned gothic on a drug that takes you to a fantasy world where strange creatures hide. The movie has some good pictures, but its strange mix of what's real and what's not, is not going anywhere. Worse still are the vague pronouncements in the voice of one of the characters. This seems to announce a more serious and meaningful film, but I do not think they have entered serious or meaningful territory to start trying to sell the meaning. There is not much to say, people talk, drugs have visions ... they talk a little more. It is not as bad as it is useless and bland. The dull is the sin here and the reason why you will want to avoid it.
