I just read an extra long review on the first page of this movie on this site and he explained in detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I think this advice is really helpful! I mean, a movie that tries to be so good and exciting is not what the movie wants to be !!!!! So, yes, watch this movie as seen in that show, and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars, you can give it ten out of ten stars! Until then, my one star review is only for the real, pure and unbelievable version of this movie !!!!!! Got it now?
