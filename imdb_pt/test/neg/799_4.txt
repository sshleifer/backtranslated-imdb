In 1976, a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the door of your house and the next morning they open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. Late in the afternoon, a man with terrible scars on his face comes to the door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and receive a million dollars in cash. If they do not press, nothing will happen and the offer will pass to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone, including their son about this business. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who currently works for NASA, can not be accepted into a new job for which he is applying and Norma, who is a teacher, finds that the funding of his faculty is being cut. Someone's delight in this bizarre science-fiction thriller, based on Richard Matheson's "Button Button," will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ridiculous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic as it anchors a sense of realism with the family. Richard Kelly's previous film, Donnie Darko, wisely used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion to paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream state of this much superior film, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is totally implausible. That Norma also accepted someone in her house who has almost the same scars as The Dark Knight's Two-Face and believes in this offer, it seems equally artificial. If this seems unlikely so far, what follows is even more absurd, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other Divine being influencing these situations. Scenes involving the opening of portals in public libraries, random bleeds on noses and irrational drones pursuing the Lewis family become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To some extent, the movie could be called intriguing just to see where it's going. Kelly is occasionally clever in her ability to keep our attention through many of the movies. In one scene, Norma is lecturing and then asked by a strange boy about her foot. He insults her about it, as she's missing four of her fingers. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be chasing them. However, the eventual justification for all these oddities is wrapped in a revelation of highly artificial science fiction that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing about the film is that once button is pressed surprisingly early, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished by much of the duration of the images. The end, which will not be spoiled here, reappears these moral issues again in the hope of echoing the Greek tragedy. Although the similarities can be seen, at this point, given the improbability of much of the film and the uneven performances, there are few reasons to care. The Southern accent of Cameron Diaz may be unnecessary, but it is surprising that Langella is the most disappointing in the film, with a well-written role as the mysterious man with scars that seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It's really just a shadow of his imposing performance at Frost / Nixon. There is not much for many of the other actors in the movie to do; in particular, both Norma and Arthur could not be considered characters, but spokesmen for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as when Norma sympathizes with Arlington about their deformities, and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other if the button kills one of them, highlights that. Since 2001 Richard Kelly has been unable to make a film that has lived up to the quality and imagination of Donnie Darko. Although this film may be intriguing for some time, it is very absurd and implausible to be enjoyed and certainly would not justify multiple views given the rather illogical revelations of the film. Sci-fi fans may appreciate it a little more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains enigmatic. The Box is a movie this year that should have been archived.
