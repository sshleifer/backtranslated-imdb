I was hoping to see a more exploring style of film but unfortunately this turned out to be just a poorly done low budget action movie that simply does not have the talent for it. Story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas) who is boyfriend Rick (Jeffrey Combs) works for a secret agency and has invented a motorcycle that is bulletproof and can fire lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can shoot lasers as well. The head of the bionic agency (Martin Landau) has made a $ 5 million deal to sell it and sends two hired thugs to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bike. A tall, blond bandit named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manage to kill Rick, but Teri survives. While at home she discovers a videotape that Rick left out describing his invention, which helps Teri do what to do next. Teri is being pursued by various agents and she is caught and tortured but does not talk about where a play of the motorcycle is needed but she gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick) where they end up using the motorcycle. for a bloody shooting. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Fred Olen Ray, who made his career out of making ultra-low budget exploration films, but he made a terrible mistake here, leaving out the exploring and trying aspect make an action movie. In addition to a quick bath scene at the beginning, there is no nudity and the usual excitement that viewers are accustomed to seeing in a Ray movie is not where it is. I do not think anyone was expecting Thomas to go naked, but she does not wear sexy clothes. Not that it stopped me from looking at her in those tight jeans and admiring her almost perfect shape, but Ray really screwed up everything in that case. Like all his films, the cast is fun to watch and many familiar faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Dar Robinson's stuntman died shortly after being made and it's his latest acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would waste his time with this rubbish like this, but I was interested in the casting of Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas good in this movie? Who cares! I think she showed that she could have become a popular movie star "B" if she wanted to, but that never happened. Ray wastes everyone's time with this effort, although the cast is fun to watch, but he has left out the elements that make him a nice filmmaker.
