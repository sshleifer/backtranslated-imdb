When you get to the front of a movie, you know you're wasting your time watching the movie in question. That's exactly how I felt while watching Darkness. I could see anticipating every turn and turning easily. It's a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a multitude of movies that deal with the occult. It's so silly that I almost found its ingenuity graceful. I can not say I was totally bored, but I found the film too derivative to my liking. Director Balaguer√≥ tries to redo his first Spanish hit "The Nameless", but fails to do so. I admit, some sequences were pretty scary, but I just loathe it when I figure out what's going to happen next. Besides, I hated to see good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini perspiring a lot about this piece of garbage. Finally, Anna Paquin as the star of a horror film? That must be a joke. She's cute, but she's one of those good-acting children who have become a very monotonous adult actor. You can live without watching this.
