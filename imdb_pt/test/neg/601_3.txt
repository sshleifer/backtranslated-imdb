When A Killer Calls has to be the biggest ripoff released by Asylum so far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who gets scary calls from a scary voice that repeatedly asks, "Did you check the girl?" Of course, she has calls tracked by the police (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks - off when "he" turns on, wait ten seconds, and dial * 57). Sound familiar? Yes, that's why I rented it, too. <br /> <br /> Well, you should. And I hate to say that, but that might have been more fun than the big screen junk that was released at the same time, were it not for a fatal mistake - instead of reveling in the glory of imitating B movies, he tried to do something original. He tried to make the main character nice, instead of having a fun cliché with her. You see, this could have worked with a talented actress. But she was not. Of course, she looked fine, and she screamed and cried, but. . . oh well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Then came the horrible ending. Not horrible in that it was horrible, horrible in that it was annoying. The pace up to that point (about an hour) was overdone, cliché and fun. Then he heads in another direction, and walks away from another idiotic and entertaining movie with a sexy cast of "teen" for a hostel / borefest. <br /> <br /> I think this fits in the "Oh well, whatever" category. The lead actress cleared a line? Oh, well, whatever, I do not feel like redoing it. Did we forget to give the killer's motivation? Oh well, whatever, I do not feel like rewriting it. Does the pace change completely in the middle of the road? Oh, well, whatever, I do not feel like shaving fifteen minutes off. Continuity errors? Oh, well, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (dumb, tacky, predictable, exaggerated movie with sexy cast) then you will be fine until the end. The end is stupid, not fun, not scary, not fancy, tacky or fast. In fact, there were almost exactly five minutes of character doing nothing but being tied up (and this is not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and looking around at things in the room, then screaming, and. . . whatever.
