I really enjoyed the first movie and when it appeared again, without thinking or checking, I took a family of friends to see it. I was ashamed to get so excited about them. <br /> <br /> Disney has processed the original film as the human body processes a delicious meal - it absorbs something good and ends ... well, you know. And by having a dark-skinned person like the FBI man, the fingerprints of the informant were subjugated. Taken as an isolated movie, I suppose it's not too bad if someone likes this weird kind of movie. thing, but when we read the book or saw the first movie - horrible!
