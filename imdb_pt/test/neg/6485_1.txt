I bought this 'movie' from a gas station in the $ 3.99 bin for one reason: Billy Drago, who is one of my favorite actors. He's terribly scary and good, but that's where he stops. The film itself is a cheap and terribly horrible attempt at a horror western, and does not manage either, no matter the successful merging of the two genres. The performance beyond Drago's is so bad that I wanted to put the couch cushions in my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent and the script, I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs, unless you are a difficult Drago fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful unforgivable.
