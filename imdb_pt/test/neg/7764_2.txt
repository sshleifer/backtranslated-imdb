I know this show gave women a lot of freedom in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a kill buzz and an over-analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can not STAND Carrie analyzing every little thing in this show and that's what really killed me. Moreover, Charlotte's complaints about her nonexistent problems made my ears ache, and Miranda's cynicism was a complete slaughter. I mean, can not she just be happy? Samantha was the only legal in the show and the only one who deserved to be assisted. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but that was the only one worth watching - the rest of them were pretty much the same. The mood was drier than a bucket of sand and not a very interesting storyline. All in all, it's not a very good show and I'm glad it turned out.
