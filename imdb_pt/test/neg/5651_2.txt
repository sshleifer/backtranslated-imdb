Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the movie is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is so bad that it seems improvised in half the time. The new plot makes me think they took the book and some newspapers, threw it in the blender and used what came out for the script. It's a shame for the book and the independent movie. The only reason I got to the end of the movie was my hope that it would get better. Unfortunately, this only worsened, culminating in a really late finale. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that EVERYTHING about the movie is bad. The CG is acceptable, in a style of "Reboot" of the 90s, which I assume is what they were looking for. And I suppose you can not go wrong with "people" being bitten in half and gushing blood all over the place.
