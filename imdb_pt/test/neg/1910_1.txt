I was anxiously waiting to see this movie, but when I finally had the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop midway (or was it quarter?) Because of the bad script and direction. Not to mention the poor cast! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and he is much better suited to be the hero of the story. <br /> <br /> Well, basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who betrayed her long-time decent boyfriend just to have nonsense sex with a rich spoiled brat. This film could not attract my sympathy, not even when the writer intended. I wonder where moral values ​​go? <br /> <br /> The actors are so tough that when I go back to the movie (a few weeks after being interrupted due to their boring nature), they still have not been able to make me pay attention. The spoiled couple can only make me angry! What movie! <br /> <br /> I think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review them together so they do not make the same mistakes next time. And next time they may consider Josh Hartnett as the protagonist ...
