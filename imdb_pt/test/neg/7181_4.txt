If this is Commander Hamilton's best film, I'm not curious about the others. <br /> <br /> The greatest tools of a movie actor are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show a lot of emotion, he closes his, so for five or six seconds we can admire his eyelids while his feelings remain unknown by behind them. Lousy acting technique. Stormare also recoils, sometimes when he fires a gun, turning his head and closing his eyes. Watch closely. James Bond can rest easy with a competition like that. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting supporting performances from other actors, but not enough to hang a whole movie. Cinematography is good-looking, doing a good job of capturing the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara ends up looking cold. Maybe Hamilton will carry his own weather with him. <br /> <br /> There are some good individual action sequences here. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain, who turns the hero into a big pill. James Bond jokes may not be particularly good, but at least he does not look constipated all the time. <br /> <br /> One positive point in favor of the film is that the psychotic, contorted and cruel hatred of Israel in Guillou's books was left out. What has been maintained is the worship of a noble and heroic PLO, which he shows us working in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of the dictator Khaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe, since Khaddafi expelled the PLO from Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film, Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use this gift? Hamilton does not care. <br /> <br /> We are far, far from "For Whom the Bell Tolls" here. <br /> <br /> Commander Hamilton will continue to be a local phenomenon. While the books of Henning Mankell sell well around the world, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
