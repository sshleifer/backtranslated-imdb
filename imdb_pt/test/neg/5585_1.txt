6 out of 8 comments on this subject have rated this movie as being worth watching, so let me fix the balance. <br /> <br /> If this is the best that independent British filmmakers have to offer, then they need to sort things out. their cameras now and find employment in another sector. Unfortunately for me this was 82 minutes I will never see again and hopefully I will save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your preference. <br /> <br /> Although the idea behind the film is interesting, it is not developed enough to keep the viewer connected. The students' characters are insipid and uninteresting, and frankly you will not care what happens to them. The soldiers are practically caricatures of all the bandits seen in the movies, I've been waiting for Captain Markovic to spin an imaginary mustache. Some of the effects were very good and showed some imagination, but these were ruined by the shockingly poor acting, poor script writing and uneven camera work. The budget might have been better spent sending the "actors" (and I use that term loosely) to the theater classes or the Thomas brothers to the film school or maybe in a spell-checker because the captions were spelled incorrectly. The fact that the missions were not picked up and rectified, talks a lot about the immaturity of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the filmmakers, or that they or they were watching a completely different film. I beg the brothers Thomas never to give up their daily jobs, for if they stay in this camp, they will surely starve to death.
