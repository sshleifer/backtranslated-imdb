The only thing more filled with holes than the premise of the movie is its screenplay. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for the lack of glorious, flamboyant and brazen talent of Joel Schumacher. The plot is totally illogical, but super fake-heavy and everything is art-driven within an inch of its life in the most clichéd, overheated way. I love how the medical school's autopsy room is a low cavernous marbled mausoleum illuminated in red with huge paintings of Rembrandt hanging on the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives an army jeep supported on canvas. No one in Joel Schumacher's films lives in a non-eccentric way. It is always an alternate universe where everyone is young and painfully hip, but hip strictly and obsessively according to an idea of ​​hip-male billionaire middle-aged child out of touch. Holy crap! The part where Brother Baldwin # 16 dies and comes to life and then is haunted by all the women he slept with, who say "I call you" and "I just need a little space" is the funniest thing in the everything. universe!!!! In what kind of world do we live where Joel Schumacher manages to keep people throwing money at him? "Flatliners" made me want to review all man's work only for the kind of high quality yuks contained in it.
