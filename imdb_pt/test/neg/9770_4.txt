I'm a great fight. As a story that is surreal, this movie could have been great (as good as rated by some here), but mixed with acting (director and relatives who play important roles due to financial reasons, I think) found here. .. although calling this performance, it is not just a snippet of that word, it is giving a new meaning! A new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you are into surreal movies (there are some that I like, see the Japanese Foreign Circus, for example), you may be able to ignore the flaws (see above) and enjoy it more. There are great ideas here, after all! Lots of great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while watching this (with a group of friends) most of us just could not stop laughing ... not the director's intention, of course! Again, everyone has their own taste, as you can see by the high rating of this movie, but I could only recommend the movie if you are aware of the work that Alejandro Jodorowsky did and / or is a fan of it!
