STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in its path as the construction of the new Delta City continues and a new threat to face in the form of Cain, a cruel dealer with Christ-like delirium, selling a new addict in the streets called nuke . As he continues to struggle with the memories of his old life haunting him, the plated hero comes out to bring this villain down, only to end up being stung in pieces of junk. With Robocop out of action, a relentless OCP business woman proposes plans for her new android - a beast and growling beast from a machine that needs an equally nasty test to energize - that Cain fits perfectly. After a brief flaw in his system, Robo returns to take justice to the streets and hit the scoring with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a movie that can always surprise you every time you watch, no no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those movies that can not be made again. That being said, it is not surprising that a sequence has been made - it is even less surprising that this sequel is actually less than the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has created a nasty, slightly incoherent, super-long movie that fails to capture the magic of the first movie, no matter how hard it may try. And it certainly does, the funny ads from the first movie running endlessly, corporate satire aiming to be a little sharper and the action roaring as fast and furious as before, but with blood / blood even worse than the first movie. The first film gained a name for some unpleasant blood-soaked violence (including a man's genitals being blown up and a man being blown to pieces), but while this was more memorable, the violence / violence displayed here is one way more sadistic and gratuitous. <br /> <br /> But overall, the movie leaves you with a general sense of apathy - why are you watching this when you may be seeing the original again? ? **
