Announced as a romantic comedy against the early years of World War II, he fails to deliver. The problem is that, although it is beautifully photographed, it does not have a consistent plot or narrative. Beginning as a murder mystery, it offers no hope to its actors as it snakes through recent history. Depardieu is wasted on a trivial paper that he obviously is not comfortable playing. Adjani can not upload the photo. The hero is not; obviously an imitation of a "unfairly accused" role of Hitchcock has no balance. Neither heroic, comic nor suspenseful. <br /> <br /> This could have been a good movie. I remember "The Lady Vanishes," which combined suspense, romance and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
