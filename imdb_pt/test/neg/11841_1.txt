So I was sick with the flu on a Saturday and the hope was that the SciFi Channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the trilogy "Carnosaur," "Pterodactyl," "Raptor Island." Then I turned on my remote to see which movie the SciFi put on its fascinating primetime Saturday. Some movie I'd never heard of before called "Raptor." I was very excited. The movie begins with some teenagers driving in a jeep, when they are chased and killed by a Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, this is weird, it looks almost exactly like a scene in" Carnosaur, "except it was in the middle of that movie." Then I came across a very bad acting and then a guy was sucked into an underground research lab where he was eaten by a fierce T-Rex. Now I'm like, "Wait a second, this was also a scene in" Carnosaur. "So, after I saw some shamelessly ripped scenes of" Carnosaur 2, "I figured out what the hell was going on, so basically Roger Corman & Co. took off scenes from the trilogy "Carnosaur" to use as action scenes, woven into a basic "dinosaur-flees from amok" plot, and tried to go through it like an original movie.I do not know who I'm most angry with, Roger Corman or SciFi Channel for trying to make it worthy of prime time.The only reason it was worth watching was to pick the actors who looked like their counterparts in the trilogy "Carnosaur" and guess which scenes would be raised in As much as it hurts me, being a dinosaur lover, I have no choice but to give as little notice as possible because I feel completely stolen.
