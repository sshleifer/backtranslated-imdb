The name of Bad Company's greatest hits album is called "10 of 6". You could have just released this album and cut the sound of this movie. Most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. I think the older ones during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made around 1930 and 1940. That's how I feel about the films made in the 1970s. The characters in the film seemed to be doing a test for Danny Terrio. Why do films have to exaggerate in the 1970s? The only good period piece I enjoyed was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut out this television show. It was just like things were in high school when I was there, around 1980. I was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like that. It was totally young dominated. There were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and the inner city of Philly. This was more of the '70s than I remember as a kid. This movie was very boring and tacky. Sometimes I was falling asleep. I do not know why an actor who was acting during the '70s appeared in this. He was probably trying to give some credibility. Walken did not even show up until the second half. I think the only real thing about the movie was the "baby boomers" were / are very spoiled. All the children in the movie were spoiled. I do not know what they had against their father.
