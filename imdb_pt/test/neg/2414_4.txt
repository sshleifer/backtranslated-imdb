It begins with some disgusting jokes of sexual comedy, but soon reveals its true colors: wants to be a clone of the "Desire of the Death". I say "want" because the script gets so laughable every minute it ends up looking like an absurd "Death Wish"! From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles, the "heroes" who dress as commandos and shake their machine guns because they do not want to attract attention to themselves (!), For thugs who drive through the city in a very black van after being recognized as his vehicle, this movie has many ridiculous points to fit into a list. The other big problem is that you can not distinguish most of the characters; Of course, you know who Borgnine, Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes, and you would not know the difference.
