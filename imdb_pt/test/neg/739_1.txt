This is a terrible movie, which is almost unrecognizable from the book, although they have a kind of similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better spent doing anything else, including watching the grass grow. The addition of ill-made fantasy scenes makes Catherine look unbearably foolish. The actress who plays Catherine also comes across all kindness and seems constantly surprised, even when she should be looking lovingly in Tilney's eyes. Honestly!! The film ends with a fantasy scene of Catherine where you can not help but wonder if this happened or if she's just delirious, not in the right way that makes you think, but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie . The only good thing about the movie is the title, which was written by Mrs. Austen herself. I usually love BBC productions, but this one sucks.
