An exorcism exercise by numbers, with a disappointing lack of fidelity and use of the term 'blackwater'. The cinematography appears from the base of the land of Cape MOW, which removes any appearance of marshy and cloudy atmosphere of the process. Also, there are no gore, sex or youngsters appealing enough to indulge the majority of viewers in the movie. That said, the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy presence of olive skin. What else needs to be said about this non-winner? Do not rent, unless you have a crush on middle-aged adults lamenting your past and complaining of priests cliches, psychiatrists, Hispanic janitors all lamenting your past actions.
