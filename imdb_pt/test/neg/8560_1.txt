I can not even describe it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm being a cool guy when I call the movie). Just another big budget made for someone who does not like to think too much. It's not even scary. It's revolting when there are great movies that never hit the big screen and then comes this ... "thing" to fool movie fans. I think big producers do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Just get a great producer, hot (despite horrible actresses) and a ton of cliches of horror movies and cook for a week or so, and you get "The Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible !!!!
