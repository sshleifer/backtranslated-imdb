This film brought a whole new meaning to that worn phrase "how to see paint dry" because it was "like seeing paint dry in the middle of a monsoon". <br /> <br /> I was drawn to the film by its location on the west coast of Portugal that I visited. It is a very beautiful place and black and white has introduced a new dimension in beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was terribly banal and frankly you have to have some history. <br /> <br /> A film crew runs out of film and the entire team has to wait. Well, a wait is a wait. I can wait for a number 15 bus on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours at a remote railway station, in the middle of nowhere, on a cold winter Sunday afternoon. However, a wait is boring and, yes, that wait was boring, too. <br /> <br /> So the leader goes to America to protest with the movie supplier who criticizes him for not doing the whole thing in color. After several arguments, two blessed bullets sound from where and the long-awaited end finally arrives, not before time. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would see this movie again if someone would come up with a couple of cans of colored film for me to play on the screen.
