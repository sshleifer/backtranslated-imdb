I am a big fan of Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and amused myself by seeing them overshadowed by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly small movie that had all the ingredients to be much more. The very brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely titled, worthless son of a rich Lord are authentic and amusing. But for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak between anyone. The song was annoyingly movie-quality of the week, and the narration was totally unnecessary. Clearly the work of a first-time director on a small budget who either did not or did not pay enough attention to good advice. What a pity. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you hate at the beginning are the ones you like in the end, and vice versa, so there is some kind of character, less in terms of perception. For example, Watson's character, though refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to irritate me in the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions and later when simply stated that she would be returning to the civilian apartment without asking for permission without apologizing. And I went from disliking Wilkinson's character of relativistic control / freak to understand him and did not really want him to change (unlike his wife). <br /> <br /> This movie clumsily transformed from a whodunit into a "Love Story". "or" Steel Magnolias "drama of the disease without informing me sufficiently of the fact, so I was absentmindedly guessing what the next turn in the plot would be after all had been revealed (Was the Lord driving the car? The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and tells how brave Watson is, the best nurse any dying boyfriend could ask for, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc., was fine until he began to sob like a baby. , she is just another rich person with a lot of time in her hands, and so she directs her hard work, giving the wife an unnecessary drama.fucking was just another way of occupying her empty life, the dying guy thing was a an added bonus to her, for somehow she made her previous actions completely above reproach. <br /> <br /> Look, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secrets who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he acted like an abused dog, his desire to open his wife's affection by increasing every kick she gives him. I'm not anti PC or anything, just does not sound true, even after taking into account all the harsh realities of middle age that we all tend to face. The end for me was (and not the director's intention, I'm sure) depressing. The film spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people simply do not fit, so I did not find joy in the promise that their relationship would continue. I'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, this just has to be a little plausible and not banal. Is that too much to ask? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
