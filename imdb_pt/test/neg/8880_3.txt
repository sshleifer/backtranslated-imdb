I had this DVD to watch, thinking that I would see a kind of biography of the painter Goya, but the film was about everything except about Goya. This film is about a young woman taken from her family by the Holy Inquisition, supposedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (just because the poor girl did not like to eat pork!). The rest of the film is about torture, humiliation, driven by a poor script (I can not believe it is by JC Carri√®re as I could not believe this crime is directed by Mr. Milos Forman) centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is Goya, I forgot, playing a completely peripheral role - that could be the role of John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joachim, Joseph or anyone else. Very disappointing - one of those movies that will be forgotten forever (if it has not happened yet). Rent "The Name of the Rose" if you want a movie about the Holy Inquisition. And I do not know what you should rent, if you want to watch a movie about the Spanish painter Goya. Maybe a good-caliber director, not Forman, has yet to do that. PS: The Spanish painter Goya - the title role that is lost in the plot - is portrayed by a Scandinavian actor, something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to make the biopic of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
