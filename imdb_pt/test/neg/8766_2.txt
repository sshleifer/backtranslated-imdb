The back of the DVD for this raves movie, "Chey is Quentin Tarantino's Christian Films." This is not so much an insult to Quentin as to Christian movies. This film is poorly written, rigidly rendered and edited with an aimless intensity. The scenes unfold in a confusing and unreal way and are interspersed with a beautiful photograph of a time lapse. Flashbacks, disappears in gray, freeze frames to tell time (unimportant in history) are made with any apparent reason other than to give the film more cinematic credibility. The camera is random, some nice pictures are cut with ridiculous mounts that have no meaning. Inadequate locking and lighting leaves the viewer wondering who is talking to whom in many scenes. Oh and the audio is terrible. The special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But this is all technical. The film does not engage on an emotional level. The dialogue is so fake and the actors seem to have read only a moment before the camera rotates. The story ... things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. The characters are struggling to get hold of a dimensionality. And the characters have to make a stand on Christianity and faith in every scene. Take a queue of M. Night, engaging Christian movies do not need to have the characters saying the name of Jesus Christ in every scene for the movie to be Christian. Goodness! Please do not try to show this to your unsaved friends with other expectations besides laughter.
