What distinguishes some of the 'Lone Star' movies (and many others in western and adventure films in their thirties) was the lack of what we recognize as aesthetic storytelling. To make sure they had good against evil (the basic element of any Westerner), the kid knows the girl and some characters, like the old farmer and his beautiful daughter or granddaughter, and sometimes the evil banker or another man of Business. the way the action unfolded was often different from film to film. <br /> <br /> "The Frontier Without Law" presents Earl Dwire in his great transformation (not) as (for some reason inexplicable) Pandro Zanti, a "half Apache, half American posing as a Mexican who speaks the language fluently (Gabby Hayes), who has a long-standing relationship with his wife, and is the only one to be seen in the movie. you'd think that because the opening scene shows Zanti killing John's father (Wayne) Tobin off the camera, he would play a bigger role in the movie. chase after heroes and villains. We get a lot of good stunts from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby on his horse when he walks, jumping on 'renegades' and knocking them off his horses, a horse jumping off a cliff in a lake, and even the same slide down the sequence that was in "The Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time Mighty Yak uses a surfboard instead of straddling a tree branch, and its inclusion is equally illogical this time as well, since they are in a desert. <br /> <br /> The high point is clearly the methodical and methodical walk of John Wayne, well photographed, traversing the desert after the escape, and Zanti stumbling over those fantastic Red Rock Canyon basalt cliffs (seen on countless serials, westerns and science fiction films "moon") framed behind it. No final duel at fifty steps with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to hug and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! When John Wayne finally reaches him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from a well and dies. <br /> <br /> After many chase sequences, the Zantai gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from behind. a revolving cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked off by being blown up. Do not walk in the sunset or obligatorily kiss the girl: the last shot is Ruby, now mrs. John Tobin, on the phone of now-sheriff John Tobin: "What would Sheriff Tobin like to have dinner with?" The movie also has poor lighting and editing in the beginning, the pace is slow, some parts with the sheriff drag him, and horse chases fill the film. So, despite the different and unusual elements, he appears as one of the weakest solitary stars.
