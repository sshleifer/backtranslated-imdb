Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and Hollywood for his easy-to-use softball filmmaking techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales far too far in favor of the formula with his new twist of a movie legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the mission of Ichabod Crane? played by Johnny Depp, delivering the only bright spot in this grim movie ?? To the heart of the mystery that involves the seemingly random and horrible murders of a legendary headless knight, the story unfolds as if it were purposely trying to be predictably disgusting. Contrived as a bedtime story for children, the introduction of a monotonous character is bound to exciting non-engaging chase scenes that, with unexplored characters fleeing their lives, produce as much fright and excitement as the nightmare before Christmas. <br /> <br /> Play in an endless bundle of old trees for the environment and a big-eyed, big-eyed blond (Christina Reechi) love interest and Burton has a movie that takes the old legend of Sleepy Hollow and managed to do so like a Disney movie without charm or fascination. The dialogue was agitated and ridiculous, severed heads were in large numbers, and there were enough monologues revealing plots to embarrass James Bond. Even with the support of Emmanuel Lubezki, Hollywood's most sought-after director of photography today, the wonderful performance of the surprising name recognition of Depp and Burton, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to be missed.
