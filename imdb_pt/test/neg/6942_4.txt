Marlene Dietrich is magnificent as Concha Perez, the seductress who leads all men to despair in "The Devil is a Woman" by Josef Von Sternberg. Her performance has nothing to do with "acting" in any conventional sense, but she is incandescent, a true star in full command of her material. But she's the only good thing about the movie, (she's so good she keeps you watching that scum, I doubt any other actress could have done the same). <br /> <br /> The story is an astonishingly lame melodrama, (certainly Pierre Louys' novel was better), in which Dietrich's amorous Shell ruins the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero with a rigidity on the frontier with petrification. And to Von Sternberg is an ugly-looking movie (perhaps according to its rather ugly subject). Bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough to remake it as "That Obscure Object of Desire," with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of everything, until the selection of two different actresses in the same role. Neither film is the director's best hour, and while Bunuel's version might be the best, it's Dietrich's performance that you remember.
