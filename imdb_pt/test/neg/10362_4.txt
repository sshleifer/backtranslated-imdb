This film was extremely disappointing, I thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy', but make no mistake, it's not at all. There are almost no weed-related jokes that come to mind, I do not even think they smoke any weeds in that movie. The marijuana field is merely a plot device. <br /> <br /> My impression after watching this movie was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write a script full of (their idea of) smart dialogue and make a movie. The product is mild dialogue supported by mediocre acting, to say that this film has no 'hook' is a huge euphemism. Do not waste your time or money.
