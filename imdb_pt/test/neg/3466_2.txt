I thought this movie would be good. It absolutely was not, despite the top Oscar-winning actors. I may have laughed once, and never heard anyone else in the theater laughing. Ren√©e Zellweger's pancake makeup was very improper. Everyone seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running in imitation of clowning, but failing. I think maybe the movie sounded well in development, but something was lost in the translation. Was the roar really like that? I think not. Everything seems a bit artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is in sepia tones, just like all the other films that happen in the 20's or 30's. There simply is not much originality here.
