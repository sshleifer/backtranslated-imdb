NO WAY ! I hated Grandma. First, she's very tall - of course she is, it's Tom, who's the brother, who's playing her - and I hate what she does when she combs her silver hair back, but: there are funny parts in that movie. For example, the fact that each single actor seems like V.G. (very German), and also that they think that even when left alone, they should pretend that that guy (Tom) is their "grandmother" or something. I especially liked - not - from that moment when Charlotte leaves and starts walking to the nearest gas station for help. Suddenly she finds herself in the middle of some woods (where were they before? No one dares explain) and turns, turns, turns like a ballerina, looking at the stars ... and ... ignoring the fact that GRANNY BEHIND HER , READY TO GREGAR !!! But anyway, the music was not so bad, the haircuts were fine and the ending terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... I wish I had the German version.
