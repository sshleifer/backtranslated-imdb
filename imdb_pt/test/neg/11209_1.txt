Ask a thousand people what is the biggest unintentional comedy of all time, and they will almost invariably tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are wrong. American Ninja has these two turkeys slaughtered for a number of reasons, not less than being a script that was clearly not thought of. Although I fully support the B picture industry by keeping slobs like Michael Dudikoff at work, a little work on the product would have gone far. <br /> <br /> For those who give a mouse poster, my next paragraphs will give significant plot pieces. <br /> <br /> First, when we are given some information about the titular hero, we are informed of his date of birth, relatives, parents and so on. are all unknown. I do not know about you, but I hope the US Army takes the search for facts about your people a little more seriously. They also manage to spoil the continuity of dates fairly efficiently, though I do not remember well which dates were wrong and when. This is actually one of the less obvious flaws of American Ninja. <br /> <br /> It has been pointed out before but a common fault in many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted by a large number of antagonists, he said antagonists. attack one at a time. More recent films like The Matrix Reloaded defy this convention, but almost every movie in the 1980s makes the audience shout, "Hey, why do not you attack at once?" Martial arts movies tend to be much more impressive when the fights are more extensive than one by one. <br /> <br /> The central premise was originally a joke, but in the light of recent events in which the US military can not. crushing a multitude of insurgents simply because they will not delegate to the experts, seems strangely ironic. Filipino Renegades are stealing weapons from the US Army's local division for sale to wealthy clients. No matter that such a robbery made the army blame the local businessmen, or even believed responsible, for a rectal air examination, after all, this is an action movie from the 1980s. The funniest part of the movie is the climatic battle, however. As Joe and Jackson combine posing and fighting in an art form, the evil Ninjas begin to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with a previous commentator that this movie should have been called the Ninja Holocaust because I am willing to bet a total of at least three hundred Ninjas from evil during the movie's runtime. In addition, the Black Star Ninja begins to fight with rocket launchers, laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous implements that are not only badly thought out but are poorly executed. You will never see a laser beam effect that seems cheap. <br /> <br /> What is more important is that the film takes itself so seriously. During the scene where Joe meets his former mentor again, I dare not laugh at the heinous dialogue. Not that I know any modern Ninjitsu practitioner, but the logical part of my imagination has difficulty believing that they have spoken like this any time in their history. During this mentoring scene, I kind of hope the old man tells Joe that he must prove his manhood by cutting his own head with a plastic spoon. <br /> <br /> In total, I gave a 1 to the American Ninja. is a special score in my system, because it is reserved for the worst, most terrible and offensive films I have ever seen, or movies that make me laugh without even trying. American Ninja is definitely an example of the latter.
