I always hated this slow show. I liked Cartoon Network shows like "Dexter Lab" or "Megas XLR." But I've never really liked that piece of crap.Basically because it has stupid characters (the good or the villain seems to be mentally retarded) they have stupid voices (especially Bubbles But it is very annoying, the stories are very, very stupid.A few episodes could have been interesting, but almost always the show becomes childish and tacky.There was no nice character, the music was horrible, and the animation is the worst I've ever seen Evena five-year-old boy could draw better I do not see why everyone seems to love this piece of crap. "The Powerpuff Girls" seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made Fortunately "Foster Home for Imaginary Friends" by the same creator was much better.
