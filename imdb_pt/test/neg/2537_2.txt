The abyssal Indonesian action movie of the legendary Arizal triumphantly sculpts a model for the future Cinemax as 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while at the same time buries the poor action star Pat O'Brien with a script and three hair gel cans to permeate his impressive mullet of 1984. His physical talent resembles a Mark Mark plus femme and his next credit would be Chris Mitchum's second violin as "Tom Selick." Powerful. At least the action is irrational and uninterrupted with some daring Asian stunts risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teenagers and / or meth addicts with no concept of reality. A poor extra is stung by an electric cutter and many others are killed by being hit on the head by foreign objects such as a motorcycle wheel or a cardboard box. The classic scenes of rape are tasteless and priceless and quoteable, like: "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with so much exuberance and fervor of the third-class polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: a crazy guy eating live lizards. The film also holds the record for most cars driven through the walls. 2/10
