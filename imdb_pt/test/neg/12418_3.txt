If you decide to watch Wild Rebels, do not expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationships and structure of a biker gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you are looking for an expos√© about the collapse of the American educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie that looks at how rural police departments are junior to a well-funded and well-organized gang, Wild Rebels is the wrong movie. But if you're looking for an absurd movie full of scene after unintentional mood scene, horrendous acting, a fine paper plot and community theater production values, Wild Rebels is the right movie. <br /> <br /> Wild Rebels is the story of a stock-car driver named Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). Rod decides to give up after a bang of fire (which Rod leaves completely unharmed despite having only cotton pants and a London Fog jacket for protection). With no plans for the future but wandering aimlessly down the southern back roads, he stumbles upon Satan's motorcycle gang (a gang being three of the dumbest guys ever to have zipped a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share ). This group of thugs spends their time terrorizing a rural town in Florida committing atrocities such as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox. These idiot trunks need someone to act as their driver during some of the larger crimes they have planned. Apparently, these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to perform daring prowess that only an experienced stuntman would be able to keep the car in the middle of a gravel road during a chase at low speed. Eventually, they hold a bank, enter the low-speed chase mentioned above, and have the worst armed battle with the police they've ever put on the movie. I could go on forever but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> I hate the term "so bad it's good," but this seems to appropriately describe Wild Rebels.
