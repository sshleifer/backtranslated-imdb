It would be very easy to make this movie look like fun: a program girl is shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy, but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her yearn for knowledge, as well as for sex. Unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the gunshot with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse, a key that can unlock the power of using nuclear weapons. Just call it joking, and at least some people will show up at the theater. I'm not sure how many went to see this four-year movie when it debuted in New York last April, but I sincerely hope not many. It sounds like a lightu movie and playful pinku, but it has art-house pretensions and is really incredibly annoying. Many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but the aspirations of this film only make the time that elapses between the sex scenes is excruciating. And then the sex scenes are not good! I saw some very scandalous things in dirty Japanese movies. I've never seen this country produce anything with such monotonous sex. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only thing worthwhile in this movie is the body of the leading actress, Emi Kuroda. Otherwise, this is pure torture.
