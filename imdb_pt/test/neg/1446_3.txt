It seems that Dee Snyder has run out of ideas in the middle of the script. The second half of the movie is basically just a repeat of the first, which makes the movie very annoying. In short, Cop's daughter is sucked into a chat party where she is sexually molested / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snider). Cop rescues her, the psychopath is put on therapy / chain. The psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played again. Within all of this, there are many inexplicable plot elements: Why was "Captain Howdy" psychotic in the first place? What about the deviation of a personality to the bum of the Bible? How does he kidnap all adults and manages to sew their mouths without fighting? And maybe the biggest mystery not solved at all ... how does a 6'2 "man with pink hair hide completely behind a 5'6" average build woman? These are just some of the questions I had watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Snyder was trying to make some kind of comment about a) the "dangers" of online chat rooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christians. sexual customs, and c) the effect our distorted Puritan society has upon us as individuals. If so, he failed. The film is too poorly meant to entertain, it does not matter to convey social messages. The torture scenes are stupid and boring, bordering on the fool (especially when Snyder enters one of his "pain and death" monologues), and everything else is just plain stupid. The "call tracing" scene is really lame ... when will the police get caller ID and * 69? The young partner of the main cop character is particularly terrible ... he should not be working as an actor, basically. And the audio in the final scene of the showdown is really bad. I think they could not afford two boom microphones? <br /> <br /> The rest of the performance is not horrible, but neither is good. The policeman is a beautiful note, and his outstanding quality is not very believable. Dee Snyder is not that bad, but he growls and mocks too much. Robert Englund (who deserves better way) puts on a rather fun performance of a hypocritical redneck. If you are a big fan of Robert Englund, the film is probably worth seeing only for him. All others are forgettable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, we have seen all those plot elements made before and done better in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HELLRAISER, AND TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of these instead of watching this turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
