This movie is widely admonished as being a copy of Will Smith's feature, Hitch. This movie was annoying. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as boring as it is unbearable. Govinda looks way beyond his prime. He's not at his best doing roles like this. It is equally unconvincing as his performance in Deewana Mastana. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan is in his eye-hurting "better". And that's in the few scenes where he remembers to put on clothes. It could have been only through nepotism that the scenes of this sore eye could be saved from the trash can from the cutting floor of any movie. <br /> <br /> Another case of Bollywood embarrassing himself with his shameless cloning. Another case of most Bollywood audiences is embarrassed by making it a success.
