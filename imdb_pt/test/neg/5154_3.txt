My mom took me to this movie on the drive-in when I was about seven years old, which is thirty years ago. She had no idea that a family movie would be so violent. My clearest memory was of the pained face of the boy's father when he was stabbed in the stomach and dead. This image haunted me for weeks. I had learned that I lived in a world where a person could stab my father at any moment. How could I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You should realize that this stabbing is not fantasy for a seven-year-old. It is as real as witnessing a real event and has no place in a child's innocent mind. It is sad that we still do not understand the impact that violence brings to the lives of our children both in our children and in our society. If only parents protected their children from images of violence with the same vigor that protects them from images of nudity and sex.
