Because that's what Hell Ride is practically. Larry Bishop and Tarantino celebrating Weinstein's money with the promise of delivering a movie at some point. I'm all for fake boobage and drink as much as the next guy, but do we really need the movie? There really is nothing worse than the reheated secondhand remains of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because the Hell Ride has nothing of the raw, unpolished feel of the era it's intended to honor. No, this is smooth and shiny MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the quirky, pseudo-hip cinematic world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and were successful for a reason. Hell Ride is just a second-hand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the hilt when it should be raw, the "super cool" look coming out silly and forced. <br /> <br /> There is no reason, for example, for such a simple and totally empty story has to be told in a complicated way, going back and forth in time. It's just a post-Tarantino quirk. There is also no reason why the dialogues have to be so meaningless, people pounding their gums as they say NOTHING: at least when Travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction it looked cool. Dialogues here mean little more than pseudo-sexist positions. There is also no reason for a rock'n'roll guitar to crawl aimlessly throughout the film. Perhaps the least impact of the Ride of Hell is when it tries to be quasi-existential. There is a hilarious dream / illusion scene in the desert where the bishop eats the peyote and sees the colors. I was half expecting an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this abysmal dump is Vinnie Jones's boobage and monologue about his wing tattoos (and perhaps some of them the outer shots of the desert). A lot of boobage and hot, half-naked girls. Now this is something I can get, but a movie they do not. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other immitators infinitely more talented.
