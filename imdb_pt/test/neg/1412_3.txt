I went to see this movie mainly because it looked so good in the trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson must match the greatness. Instead, it just continues the Williams movie series lately. What's wrong with the movie? More like the right thing: the set team does a good job around Robin, and as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That being said, this movie just was not good. I really only recommend seeing it if you want to see what it would be like if Jon Stewart were to run for president and win. To say that he won is not a spoiler since it was in the trailer. The concept and idea are really fun, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes have just been recycled from his old comedy pieces, and there are very few moments of laughter, and most are dumb. Like most comedies that turn out to be bad, all the funny parts are put in the trailer. There really are no surprises there, but come on! Part of the movie looks like a novel by Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn! People expected this to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more of a Flubber.
