First of all. Should Cameron Diaz be allowed to take action again? To call it poor performance would be an insult to poor performance. This was a historically horrible performance. Any little chance that Diaz had in being a serious actress is now completely ready after that. Ristamente horrible. <br /> <br /> Two, the film was extremely boring and not very thought-provoking. I can sit and reflect on human nature without having to watch the terrible actors, play a terrible story. <br /> <br /> Third, there was not a single nice character, and worse, it seemed like this was done by drawing. You should not like or feel sympathy for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted them all to simply die to be honest. Aliens included. Boy included. Everyone was just a big shot in this movie. Everyone literally just moved and they called it movie. You could barely distinguish the zombie "employees" with ordinary people because they all looked like zombies. <br /> <br /> Finally, nothing really makes sense. From the reactions and emotions of the characters to the literal plot, everything seems random. This is just a really bad movie, disguised and expressed as a "thinking man movie", which should be confusing. Give me some time. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.
