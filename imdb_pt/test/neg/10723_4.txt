I thought the movie was below average. The performance was good, but not great, the story was funny, but it did not go that way. The director dropped the ball in this movie. It was not James (Jim) or Tea. IMHO was the song that killed her. There's a scene where things fall and Jonny Cash's music is playing - the man was so depressing (not funny) that it killed my mood. After that, the movie could not recover. The deportation scene had a potentially fun situation, a good performance - I even smiled, but the music again was not suitable for the scene. The music kept me from being pulled into the movie. <br /> <br /> I say it had potential, but it was poorly done, I would even say rushed into the final production. A kind of reminiscence of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. The release of the theater was good, I thought so after watching it, but the release of the film exorcist: the domain was much better. Same story just different director. The same must be done here.
