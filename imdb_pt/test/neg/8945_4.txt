A few years ago, this movie had been scheduled for broadcast on TCM UK as part of a retrospective of Tod Browning? but what they really showed was the remake of 1937! my brother watched (and, in hindsight, followed the original scene practically up to the stage)? although no classic, he said it was a much more satisfying viewing experience than the previous incredibly creaky version ?? <br /> <br /> Being this the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, I had high hopes for it ?? but these were nullified when it became clear after the first tedious conversation that the main concern of the film was to appease the still unheard of sound technique and consequently the result is stage and extremely static. The plot of suspense is not exactly breathtaking; even less appetizing is the ostentatious British-Indian scenario (with the affected accents and the high-class behavior of the characters - not to mention the overuse of idiosyncratic expressions like "I say", "yes" and "now look here"). "rendering all laughable more than anything else!") In addition, there are some unintended trinkets: Margaret Wycherly (as a false medium) pleads with Inspector Lugosi Police (if the undeniable presence of her canvas is already evident) to give her some time "to discover" who is really to blame for the double murder (the evidence points to her own daughter, played by Leila Hyams!)? she hears a beat and is deluded in thinking that the spiritual world really made contact with her? but then Lugosi enters the room and, in her unmistakable accent, says directly to her "I hit twice? You did not hear me! "in which my brother and I almost fell to the ground in convulsions of laughter !!, the issue is really sloppy, too: during a wide-angle scene of the main set, a microphone is seen being quickly removed from the camera's reach? even worse, some cases where one person walks off the screen, ostensibly in the next scene, to another part of the set, but each shot is made in the other actors for an absurdly long time, so it seems to take an eternity for that person to walk a few steps away! <br /> <br /> THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR marks the third non-horror Browning Talkie that I watched even though both this and MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deal with murder and the occult and therefore , have yet to be connected to the genre.a lot has been said about the apparent loosening of the director with the arrival of Sound: however, despite flaws, the 4 horror films he made throughout the 30's are infinitely better than the others I always and found it classy and bizarre enough to suggest that Browning was not as much at sea during this time as it has been suggested ??
