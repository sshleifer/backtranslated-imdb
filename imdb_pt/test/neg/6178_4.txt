I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. At that time it was at 8.0 and I thought, "wow, that should be good." I thought wrong. The beginning of the movie actually retains what the plot promises but then goes exponentially down below its basement. I think without Richie Nix's character, it could have been good - though he is the reason the plot follows the path he follows. The character is very radical for my taste and hard to bear. In addition, the journey the protagonist takes from the beginning of the story to its "climax" in the end is partially irrelevant and could easily have been omitted - the alternative is that I just did not get the picture. <br /> <br /> Although I must admit that it is "easy to watch," and I had no problems sitting around all over the movie, when it ended I was a little impressed with the ending. All in all, quite mediocre.
