I get out of very few movie shows and this movie has managed to become one of those I could not stand watching. With regard to the prizes you have won, those awarded by Turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens award was to think that somehow a comedy layer was "acquired in the translation," as the captions helped to divert attention from the horrendous performances. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the exhibition, I participated. , the presenter spoke briefly about the history of Turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that ancient Turkish cinema was aptly called "stage cinema", since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people of the theatrical scene. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this movie fits into this category. English speakers who read subtitles may think that Turkish is a naturally loud language and attributes the whole scream of the film to it, but native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated voices. You could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors, but the biggest source of "dialogue cry" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the film. Not surprisingly, his background is in the theater. My guess is that, in response to their high-pitched speech, all the other amateur actors have also raised their voices, turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> Put on top of it all. a plot that develops in the rhythm of a snail, you get an extremely annoying movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films that portray the entirely rural life with shallow and uneducated characters. Since "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish films of all time, the Turkish filmmakers seem not to be able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country. This is interesting only in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and direction as in Zugurt Aga. Most of the time, however, it is extremely annoying and frankly a little embarrassing for the native "urban" Turks. Rural communities make up a neglected and uneducated part of the country, and while that provides good material for comedy, it has a huge cost to Turkey's image. <br /> <br /> A member of the Western audience whose only exposure to Turkey is This film will undoubtedly think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I would like the filmmakers to realize this and leave their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and remain faithful to the majority of the country, who lives in cities that embarrass the metropolitan areas of Europe.
