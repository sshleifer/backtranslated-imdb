Inglourious Basterds It's the worst Tarantino movie he's ever made. It is full of its usual ingredient, that is, sudden dialogue, brutal and sudden violence, but everything seems deja-vu. The direction is typical of Tarantino and nothing seems new. It's almost as if he had copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> There's nothing new or exciting about Inglourious Basterds, to be honest, it's just a war drama that is not funny, not brilliant like Pulp Fiction. Basterds is supposedly Tarantino's tribute to Leone's Spaghetti Western, but it seems to be poorly articulated and out of place, especially with the continued use of large sub-titles and the balance audience bid.
