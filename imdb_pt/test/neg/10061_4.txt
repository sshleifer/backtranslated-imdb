This is actually one of the weaker films based on the work of Agatha Christie, a lifeless and confusing mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and budget!) Of his predecessors ("Death on the Nile", "The Evil Under the Sun") and Donald Sutherland is a pale shadow of Peter Ustinov with regard to screen detectives (of course, he plays a much less interesting character than Poirot). The film manages to run aground as much as in Christie's plot force alone (all his plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
