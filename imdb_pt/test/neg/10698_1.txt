Norris plays a Chicago cop who comes across a devil's apprentice? who wants, well, to create Armegeddon. He finally kills the creature, picking it up, throwing a 24-inch piece of solid gold, not too sharp, about six feet long, strong enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So it's the rest of the movie. Much of it consists of CN and his companion driving cars and talking nonsense. The Israeli (or Arabic) child is ostensibly to humanize the CN. IT'S OK. It does not work, it does not make sense, and the plot advances, the call, not at all. In addition, no police officer is invited to leave the country to be interviewed by other police officers. It's ridiculous as a premise. The whole thing is bad. Unfortunately, it's not too bad to be fun or extravagant. Simply bad. But - you can see how Norris was trying to find the way to the success of the Walker series: Texas Ranger.
