No wonder this movie went well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a superficial film that attracts superficial people. Two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who struggle and look for a lost dog. The film supposedly explores the dynamics of the relationship, however, the relationship is too small to deserve such exploitation. This couple has a dimension: they fight, provoke, then make love and fight a little more. There is a brief moment of tenderness that does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with one another because of their poisonous and volatile relationship. Beautifully filmed, excellent punctuation, but with nothing of merit in the script or the characters, this short is just that.
