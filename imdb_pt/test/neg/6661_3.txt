I watched "Gristle" mainly for the presence of Michael Dorn, since I liked his role in Worf in Star Trek TNG, but had never seen him out of his makeup. Dorn seems to have a good presence and probably has the potential for a lucrative actor career. This film, however, gave it little dramatic challenge, except to prove that it can, in fact, use the word "F". <br /> <br /> It seems that this film was made by someone who considered himself a type Thought, with a social conscience. Yeah, by 1965. Today, the themes are so elaborate and taciturn and confusing that even Spike Lee's dreadful "Bamboozled" looks good by comparison. This crime-capturing movie has an intricate labrynth of double-, triple- and quadruple-crosses, but the plot scheme is so complicated that it collapses on itself in the first 30 minutes. Especially after that point, I just watched the moment, and a faint curiosity about how each scene would unfold. There's a great cast here - you'll recognize virtually everyone as much better movie character actors. Why are they all in it? I suspect it was 1) The work, and some money, even if modest. 2) Maybe the director knows all these acting-class actors and social connections around Los Angeles - you know, maybe they participated to support him, like a movie guy fighting in the third and fourth layers of the Hollywood scene. I do not know ... but the movie was kind of overcooked --- not really "finished." I gave a 3, although my affection for the actors involved did not diminish my admiration for the previous work. Let's hope everyone has moved on to more professional projects, more carefully done and more complete since then.
