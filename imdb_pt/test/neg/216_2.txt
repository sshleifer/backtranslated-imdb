How do you take a cast of experienced and well-known actors and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Shielded. Six co-workers in an armored car company decide to steal a large consignment of money. But as soon as they reach the first base of their plans, everything unfolds quickly. With a plot like this, you'd think it could not be that bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or so of this movie, we see what appears to be 6 normal types of people. They play, laugh, drink together, etc. Then suddenly we find that they are planning to steal their own business. Hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold and cruel world, even though he is a decorated veteran, a cool guy, and a dependable employee. Oh my gosh! So in the last 40 minutes of the movie, these ex-regular guys almost all turn into cash-mad psychotics, willing to kill themselves for money. In the last scenes, Mike, (Matt Dillon), enters into a suicide attack for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The spectator has no hint before this end that these men are so relentless and bloodthirsty. It's absolutely unbelievable and "B Movie" is almost too kind to this kind of tacky plan. I'd say do not waste your time - pity no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this photo.
