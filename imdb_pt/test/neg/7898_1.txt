Hmph Soul Plane is supposed to be a comedy of "black comedy" from a well-known movie, Airplane. This movie, it's black comedy made at its worst. Stereotypes can be funny and often are. But in this picture, it's disgusting. Okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything that people associate with "urban" culture nowadays. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Tom Arnold in this movie, is the saving grace of this film, if it has ever had one. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart makes a poor leadership figure here ... his appearance in this movie will likely grow annoying for many. Method Man and the appearance of Snoop were by far the worst. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not pay to see this movie ...
