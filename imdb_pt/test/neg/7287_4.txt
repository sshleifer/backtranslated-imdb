I'm finding that I get less and less excited about the Disney sequels for the movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for direct films is not the same, but these films do not even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen the previews of Stitch-The Movie, you'll see my point. But I digress, this movie reaffirms my point. The animation is sloppy, the story lines resemble the Saturday morning cartoons and not all of the original voices are there. I was very disappointed not to hear the voice of Michael J. Fox. It was so obvious that the person who made the voice of Milo was trying to sound like Fox, but did not come close to succeed. <br /> <br /> If you say something, my 10- and 6-year-old kids did not even watch the whole movie.
