The reputation of "RVAM" preceded it. I first heard about it in one of those Medved style movie books, "The 50 Worst Movies of All Time" or "The Golden Turkey Awards," or something like that. Each review of the movie basically said that this movie was so bad it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally came to show it, I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. <br /> <br /> However, "Robot" was not so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, this is definitely a "Z" movie. Some of the voice dubbing (as is often the case with the imports of K. Gordon Murray) are very extravagant, and the film itself seems to be structurally a kind of Frankenstein, since a huge part of it seems to be footage of an ancient "Aztec ". Mummy "movie, narrated with a voice from the main man.A dead offer: anytime the question" Then what happened? "Is asked more than twice in the dialog box, you are looking for reassembled scenes together with little regard or "What happened then?" is pronounced at least four times in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Even without the structural problems, the plot, and dialogue do not translate well into an older American audience.For example, as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the background story.It includes an observation about Dr. Krupp, "a doctor who has suddenly transformed himself in an evil criminal "and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy holds.Without background, without explanation, he just" suddenly turned ill. "Obviously, this was intended for a rather indiscriminate audience. > The decisive argument, however, is the "Robot", the supposed "showcase" of this film. This robot is the robot's worst special effect since "Submarine Kingdom" or even "Santa Claus vs. The Martians." Compared to this pile of trash, the Tin Man of the "Wizard of Oz" looked like the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the casting in T2. The Aztec mummy itself is well designed and executed; He is admittedly undead, familiar enough to look like a mummy, and yet distinct from the "Boris Karloff" curative collection, familiar to most American audiences. But who designed the robot in this accompaniment had no idea of ​​the concept ... or no budget. They could at least have given him some knees, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen thrust games on high school playgrounds that are more convincing.) So the movie basically stops. This seems a bit misleading considering the amount of time the movie spends accumulating up the battle itself. <br /> <br /> Despite all these problems, the film is not horrible or incompetent as a Coleman. Francis's film or a Larry Buchanan movie was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of the Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like a Coppola movie. It's kind of boring, boring and silly. The actors are competent (in a manner educated in cinema B) and reasonably photogenic; The Doctor. Krupp, in particular, seems to be enjoying himself a lot while watching, plotting and getting carried away with his cape and the "Phantom Of the Opera" suit. I always found myself cheering for him, even though he was the villain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've seen much, much worse. File this with "Samson Vs the Vampire Women", under the "Interesting Mexican Juvenile" quiffs.
