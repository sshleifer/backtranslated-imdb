I can not believe some of the reviews here in the comments. The film is dated, of course, and from our comfortable point of view in the CGG era, many of the special effects are profoundly unconvincing now. But even allowing it, Helen de Troy is so bad it's almost laughable. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible, horrible, with no characterization. The performances suffer as a result, you can see the likes of Hardwicke and Andrews squirming in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous and banal lines of cod. Writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrible didactic script that allows the viewer to decide for themselves. The beginning of the film shows the historical past as if no one had heard of ancient Greece; I know they had American audiences to take into consideration, but the paternalistic way that we are told everything twice to make sure we understand the action is really horrible. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not believe the above comments describing this. film as a great epic movie. Even allowing comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience, this film really stinks.
