The previous reviews are very generous. This film is a waste of electricity and plastic. On the other hand, I had so much fun giving friends to watch and describe them beforehand as "beyond belief!" "No word can express how I feel about it." "This movie will move you." As expected, friends took these elusive comments as enthusiastic endorsements. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had of foisting on people was worth the $ 5 I paid for the movie. On the other hand, an (ex) friend says that I owe him 90 minutes of his life. I particularly liked the "gun eye view" of parts of the movie. Truly incredible in its absurd.
