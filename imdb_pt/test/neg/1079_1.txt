I must admit, I've been against this movie from the beginning, but I've tried my best to be unbiased, I really did, but the idea of ​​remaking a sophisticated, witty, fun and quirky British classic full of personality has to be dubious < <br /> The people in my house were watching this, so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about movies (I studied them at Uni after all). <br /> <br /> Expected for such an American movie, the film began with a chase that was not bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are believable and this alone increases the brand. <br /> <br /> However, the characterization was lousy, the stop ball bids could very easily have been mended of any American blockbuster that you could have had. unhappiness to watch and lacking all character. <br /> <br /> Seeming to have a distorted angle on the original film with a failed initial theft, the US version does the predictable and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland Character. This allows our American cousins ​​to have many opportunities to search for sycophantic revenge, with tearful eyes, against the "evildoers," which it commands to foreseeable excesses. This is never so obvious as in the scenes with Charlize Theron (oh beautiful! Oh so beautiful! Look at her beautiful, sore Bambi eyes, all!) That were completely nauseating. Their entrance scene, in particular, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider that were both a) more fun and b) had a better start because they could not disrupt a game like they could with British cinema that was already full of spark , people you genuinely feel something and moments of inspiration. But I disagree, the inclusion of a pretty girl because of this seems to be the most aggressive maneuver I've seen in a while and exposes Hollywood's cynical desire for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like any of these actors by the way, and you agree to any of the above comments, DO NOT COME SEE THIS MOVIE! If I had the opportunity to watch 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in that, I would have declined. Likewise Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is fine if you like that sort of thing). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all set-pieces are designed in the most transparent way possible for you to think: 'Wow! He is smart! ',' Coo! He's cool! ',' Hey! What a tough guy! Then there's the "PC-joke" who has "comic relief" scattered on his forehead, but whose mood content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two movies like that, you can easily confuse the two as clones from Jerry Bruckheimer's stable. Not that Jerry is hopelessly horrible, by the way, but he just uses the clichés in excess, as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> Here is where I have to clean. I did not get to the end so I could not even say if the brilliant ending in Michael Caine's version did it but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare movies that if I've seen it in a movie theater, I would have come out and staged a little protest outside. It's not just that there are other identical numbers from Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine, but do not bother with the rest!) With all the glitz, glamor, sass spark and pantomime of such a movie but I could not recognize nothing from the original. <br /> <br /> So if you're expecting 'The Italian Work' and not 'OCEAN'S 14', though poorly written with a less established cast and characters, some insincere elements and cardboard cut-out script, then do not watch ! I do not care that people like some nonsense fun, but this is a criminal work-ax that does not deserve to be paraded under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt completely justified in my outraged and angry reaction when I first knew the movie would be made. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Q. Some of the action sequences are not bad, so add an extra '1' if you like that sort of thing.
