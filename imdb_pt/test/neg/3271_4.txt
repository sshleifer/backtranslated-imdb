Perhaps, like most others who watched this movie long after its television debut, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in the old, obscure way, which is exactly what 'Slow Burn' is. Except for the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very good. Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a wealthy artist, Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, Brian, who lived with his mother, Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) in recent years. In a fashion of Phillip Marlowe-esquire, Jacob Ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of Brian. But once Jacob traces Laine, his discoveries open up a lot of problems. Perhaps because the events in the film move very slowly, there is never much suspense for this little thriller, not even in the end with the final routine of revealing the culprits and their motives. <br /> <br /> However, as said before This movie is probably one of those that will draw attention to the then relatively unknown cast of actors, which includes both the young Eric Roberts and the adorable Johnny Depp, who plays the stepson from Laine, Donnie. That may be reason enough to try it on ... if you can find it.
