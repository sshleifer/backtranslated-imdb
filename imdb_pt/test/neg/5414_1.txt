Where to begin? One guy has an Indian pot he's cleaning, and suddenly Skeletor attacks. He hits a woman in the neck with an ax, she falls, but then gets up and apparently is not hurt. She runs into the forest and it turns out that there is a basement of a mall in the forest. She meets an employee of the dealership and Skeletor attacks again. Fortunately, like any good utility worker, he has a gun and shoots him in the face. It does not work, everything starts to catch fire. <br /> <br /> Cut to some people walking through the forest. Although they have been walking together for some time, they sit and introduce themselves to each other. They probably would not have done it when they first met? Anyway, they are Delta staff members "disguised" (disguised, I suppose, because that way they do not have to pay to wear them in uniforms). Cute girls are several things, like a sniper school instructor, and oh, I can not remember the rest. Does not matter. Eventually, they all draw their weapons and immediately begin to point them at various things. ? Anyway, they find an old Indian sitting in the woods. He wants beans. You know, like pork and beans? He murmurs some things, I can only assume that is the premise of the film. I have relied on having heard the premise of the commercials because you can not really understand anything he says. <br /> <br /> So they walk through the forest a little more. All dialogue is an almost military BS cargo. I mean all this, as in every word. Like "It reminds me of when we were in Kabul" or "It reminds me of when we were in Laos." Skeletor attacks again. Let me give you a summary of a basic attack. One of the female characters is crouched behind a tree and she points the gun at the guy approaching the horse. For some reason, she does not shoot, but she yells several times for someone else. Then, when Skeletor approaches, she jumps from behind the tree so that Skeletor can stick her spear into it. Then everyone starts to shoot. Bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees. Apparently, the people who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. They do not make sparks. <br /> <br /> So, Casper Van Diem is suddenly driving a truck, trying to run Skeletor down. He misses and the truck slides to a halt. Van Diem is apparently apparently slid into the seat and hit his hip on the window handle or something, so he crawls out of the truck and he explodes. Later he is in the woods dying and everyone says a lot of BS almost military. They meet a couple of boys in the woods and blow up their "disguised" status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the Army. They hit guys for some reason, so they leave. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen, people grumble, camera shakes, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it comes to one <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Sci-Fi Channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone hitting on their movies, so they put it to us remember how bad movies can really be. Do you think our movies are bad? Well, you did not look bad. HERE IS BAD !!! Okay, now that we have it out of the way, the rest of our movies are pretty good by comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Well, it's just a theory.
