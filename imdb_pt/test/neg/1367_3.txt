"The Brotherhood of Satan" is a stupefying combination of conventional horror elements mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with his father Charles Bateman (as Ben) driving west with his beautiful blondes: the hot Ahna Capri (as Nicky) and the daughter Geri Reischl (as K.T.). Things get stranger and stranger to the trio as they approach the town of Hillsboro, which is being dominated by a satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When dull travelers hit Hillsboro, the "action" changes to the most interesting set of characters in the movie: townies L.Q. Jones (as Pete, the sheriff), Strother Martin (as Doc), Charles Robinson (as Jack the priest) and Alvy Moore (as Tobey). Their interaction is sometimes fun. So everything is very silly and predictable. Mr. Martin is the highlight (as you would expect); he considers the possibility that a satanic cult is a "rooster and bull" story, but it is (of course) its leader. The final "Come in, Children" is intriguing; unless, perhaps, it was the original title of the film.
