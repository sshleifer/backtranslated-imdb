This is a situation of the Emperor's new clothes. Someone needs to say "It's not a funny movie, original (etc., etc.), this is an inferior movie, do not waste your money on it." The movie is useless, and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash. They are very realistically just themselves. They do not have lines, they do not act. The American dream is not to create low quality movies or anything of poor quality and quality; is to achieve something of quality and thus success. Only people who are desperate to praise any movie that is not made in Hollywood (can not have been made in Hollywood, right?) They would try to attribute any kind of quality to this movie. It is worse than "Ed Woods", another film about a filmmaker without standards. These movies should not have been made, and you should not go see "American Movie".
