If you are an American 'TOURIST' looking for a 'trap' here it is. This "Trading Spaces Visit TOSCANA?" There were many stereotypes. Little attention was paid to the development of characters and entanglements. TO YAWN. Highlight of the film: the pitch of the flag. Poor boy! I thought he was going to lose an eye!
