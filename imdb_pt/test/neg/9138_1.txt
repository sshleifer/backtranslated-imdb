I've seen all 3 now. I just can not believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to others, but simply by their own merit, or lack of. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how the average rating for this movie is higher than 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 8 movies out of 10. They were thought provoking and very well done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or negative number was available, I would have given this rating in its place. What a total waste of time was watching this movie. I thought after the first 30 minutes that I should turn it off, but then realized it was just an initial (very) slow movie. I thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized that it would not get any better. <br /> <br /> It is very tedious to watch and with no redeeming quality. Do not take my word, watch it yourself. Be sure to see the first two movies before this one. If you see this first, I can assure you that you will never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than that "job". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when the credits role in the end. It is when your penance on this earth is complete and you can give up 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering you endured watching this "movie." If God is truly merciful, he will be more generous.
