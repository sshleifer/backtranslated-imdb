I decided to attend this show and give it a try, but I thought it was boring, and more importantly, not funny ... Dull. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sarcasm and the characters are all bland. , there is a lot of talk and the character Lorelai ... continues talking and so on ... During a second look seemed to suffocate the characters, the joke does not work and all love and romance only What is already a show of crap .. .. I can not believe this show survived after the pilot .... This seems to be a show that forces the line 'Listen to your parents' .... No real drama exists .... /> Should have stayed a pilot ..... and a pilot alone ...
