This movie has some good lines, but watching Rourke's imitation of Dillon is little more than masterful left me wanting to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> In addition, in my opinion, the rule of movie number one is to make the main character someone you like. You may not love the character, but you should care what happens to him. This is achieved in Barfly with the hilarious joke about the fights with Eddie the bartender. The main fight in Factotum is when, completely unprovoked, he goes to the character of Lily Taylor in a bar, punches the floor and calls her a prostitute. <br /> <br /> The whole thing just did not work. . Again, some big lines - some funny laughs - but like a movie in general, it's a failure. Mediocre attempt to reinvent something that was brilliant, and you can not go through it. Next? Let's redo Breakfast at Tiffany's with Kate Hudson.
