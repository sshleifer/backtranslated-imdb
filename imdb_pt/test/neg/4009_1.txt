It has a bit of that indie style that was modern in the 90's and that puts an expiration date explicit in the visual style. Characters are uniformly apathetic and feverish. Street thugs in Greece wear new clothes out of the box with no creases or blemishes. They all seem to visit the same marine hairdresser. They all exhibit the same low IQ evenly while making their underground business deals dispassionate. When things go wrong, all this because they are not real Greeks - they are sun boys born in a strange world of the city at night. It makes a big cry about disgruntled immigrants, but never bothered to investigate problems with Russian / Kazakh / Albanian cultures. If Giannaris had the right perspective on this project, he could have made a wonderful production of Bel Ami. The fleeting glimpses of boy-toned flesh is the only spark of this generic small programmer.
