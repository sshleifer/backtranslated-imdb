I came in right after watching this movie, feeling it was so horrible that at least your comments could be fun. But all of you evildoers seem to like that. And so, since I want the work done correctly ... <br /> <br /> From the opening shot, the film establishes its contempt for the public's attention, showing a totally normal picture of an irrelevant bridge by a long, long time. So he goes for a slow-motion skateboard, which is at least a bit cool, but then makes up for that flash of excitement by overlaying the most disgusting music on the soundtrack I've ever heard. A girl screaming in French whispering over what sounds like plywood sheets pounding together. Whoever decided that he needed to be there never skated, I guarantee. It seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience. <br /> <br /> From there, the film is about 50% slow motion. Do you know what's worse than a free slow-motion shot? A slow and free movement of * nothing happening. Here's a guy walking down a path. Here's a guy sitting. Here's a guy looking around. Here's a guy looking at another guy. After a while, I started watching the movie in double speed, bringing it back down whenever people appeared on the screen making a real dialogue, which was rare. Once, surprisingly, I slowed down the film to find out what a girl was saying, only to find that the camera was showing her speech, but the sound was another horrible and horrible song and her real voice was not audible. <br /> <This reminds me of some great advice I've heard about writing - if you have nothing to say, do not use extravagant tricks to pretend it does. Go back to work and think of something to say. All these camera tricks, like slow motion and strange lighting and lenses and weird music, is what the absence of content looks and sounds like. A lot of people apparently bought it and they realize the emotional gravity and deep meaning, but I think they're projecting it into a movie that did not do any creative work.
