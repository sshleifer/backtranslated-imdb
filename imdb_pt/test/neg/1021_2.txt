Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good celluloid and actor efforts. A formula movie is not necessarily bad if it pays off its promise, what this movie does not. It's a grueling mix of movie clich√©s that can be traced back to a thousand different films of the past. It is full of random and empty twists that add nothing more than aimless action, like a journey from the protagonists to a ghost town where villains (inexplicable) follow them. This was obviously invented as an excuse for a shooting and an escape scene bordering on the absurd, with people coming in and out of doors and running through the windows while firing pistols at each other. This makes someone believe that someone told Becket that there was a ghost town in the foothills of Chile and he said, "Oh, great, let's do a shooting scene there." <br /> <br /> Do not waste your rented money. on this. It's a bunch of random pieces of hundreds of different movies put together to call an action drama.
