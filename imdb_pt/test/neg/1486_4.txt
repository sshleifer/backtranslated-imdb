There was some good suspense accumulation everywhere. The cinematography was surprisingly good considering this minimal budget. We witness occasional spells of good acting, however, this is quickly emptied by some pretty extravagant lines. Understandably, there would not be much intellectual talk to have, sitting in trees while a crocodile is chasing you. Silence would have been golden here. There might have been a bigger joke in suspense than vaguely saying, "I sat in the closet for fear of my brother ..." Something tells me that there is a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a powerful crocodile of 15 feet. . You decide. Throughout the movie I can not find a connection or, by the way, sympathy with the characters, maybe it's because they do not develop one throughout the movie, character that is. There are some scary occasional cases when the crocodile infiltrates the characters, again dazed by some questionable scenes. In one example, we must be terrified by an ear floating in the water, but then we sit next to a decapitated corpse without limbs, and we worry only with a broken finger. A definitive roller coaster of a movie when it comes to logic.
