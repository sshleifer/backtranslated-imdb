Honestly, the people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 to the pulp fiction. This is the level we are dealing with here. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad, but it's not like "OMG, the best movie since Pulp Fiction!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie variety. Personally, I found my interest in the movie declined after the half-hour mark. The plot defies logic and belief. You have to listen to the part about why the wife did what she did to "save her husband". Okay, right. I guarantee you would leave the theater thinking, "Hmm, now that does not make sense." This is a movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief. <br /> <br /> Those who said the soundtrack is good were probably listening to their MP3 players. He absolutely killed the movie in some parts. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, watch the movie only if you do not have anything important to do. I give it a three because there is a long sex sequence at the motel that is decent.
