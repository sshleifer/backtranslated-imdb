Mario Van Peebles tries to follow the route of Jean-Claude Van Damme and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes to AWOL to preserve himself, though the government will not accept it, so among the simplistic plot, Van Peebles protects villagers . rebel forces and defeats an improved version of himself in this disappointing movie. This blatant steal of the Universal Soldier (which is so much more fun than that) simply does not lead to anything. The main problem is that the film is so incredibly inert. Van Peebles just waits and there is not enough butt to justify a vision. On the other hand, the film resembles a competent version of R.O.T.O.R, although where this bad abyssal film was hilarious, it only produces occasional laughter in its ridiculously unconvincing action sequences. Also as R.O.T.O.R does not make sense in his narrative and basically the film is incredibly annoying. In addition, the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the film needs a real action scenario to work because the material is very annoying. In all respects, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (Bad)
