The film gets a score of 3 because it dared to be very different. It features a cast acting while you can listen to your thoughts and desires! This is really a weird movie and an experience I will not forget. The only problem is that the experiment, while interesting in some respects, is usually very monotonous and uninteresting. In fact, it's amazing that a film by Norma Shearer and Clark Gable can be so annoying! The film is based on a play by Eugene O'Neill and really looks pretty stagy. In fact, it would have been better to just keep it as a stage production - it simply did not translate into anything for the big screen. <br /> <br /> So, this movie is recommended only for stubborn cinemancos. and those who love Gable movies so much just have to see all of their movies!
