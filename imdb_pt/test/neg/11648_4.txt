The plot was not good. <br /> <br /> The special effects were not. <br /> <br /> The acting was not very good. <br /> <br /> others, I felt that there were innumerable holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending was pretty unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Personally, about the "blowtorch in space." <br /> <br /> Blow torches have their own oxygen supply (hence the name "Oxy-Acetylene torch"). Two hoses come out of the torch: one for a bottle of acetylene and another for a bottle of oxygen. <br /> <br /> So a "torch" would work well in space.
