I've seen almost every Kurosawa movie and dozens of other Japanese films as well. In comparison to these other films, this is a fairly medium to weak film. The plot features two brothers at war - none of whom cared much for me - and it is very confusing to track who is allied with whom. Music and cinematography are very good, but the special effects are sometimes terrible - rubber heads flying with the same realism as the school average! In addition to these complaints, the end of the movie DESTROYS completely and PREPARE the entire image. It turns out that the end is not true, but was completely "falsified". What is the purpose of this, then? If you've seen this movie, understand that there are MANY better movies out there, so do not give up!
