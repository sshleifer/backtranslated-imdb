The absurd premise of this film has to do with Argentina claiming the Falkland Islands, having failed in force in 1982, impregnating the European women with Argentine sperm, thus diluting the ethnic purity until favoring Argentina. Okay, right. The recognition is made by our hero / villain and cad, Fabian, who uploads his pillar-of-fish cameraman to pose secretly filming his encounters with the Falklanders, including his courtship and eventual conquest of a woman, Camilla. An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary, this film favors us with a lot of tedious sightseeing shot of the hip .... yada, yada, yada. The film has no potential for plot and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla go through the usual moments of embarrassment and uncertainty as they move from the handshake to the bed. "F * ckland" is only for those movie purists who can appreciate the jigglecam austerity of Dogme Indies.
