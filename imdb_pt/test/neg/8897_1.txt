My only reason to register on this site was the opportunity to write a review for this movie. I felt I had to get rid of some of my anger by writing off of me. <br /> <br /> The movie "Babas bilar" must be the worst movie I've ever seen. I truly believe the script may have been able to become a very good movie or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the cast seems to be on paper. Put the script into practice and the cast can not deliver. There is a lot of action, it happens with many things and you can not help but wonder why this happens. And then the cast, the actors make such a weak effort that you almost start to cry. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time in hand, I would say you can see. If not, no.
