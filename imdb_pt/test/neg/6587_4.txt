I borrowed it on a friend's DVD the other day. I really did not know what to expect. I have not seen many Russian films, and I do not think I've ever seen a Russian war movie. Perhaps this has made me expect something different, something more along the lines of an imagined Russian mentality. But, whatever the expectations were, they were ashamed, as it is a fairly common war movie. <br /> <br /> The complete formula of following some young people from recruitment, through training, deployment and some battles, is well known. We have seen this done many years ago as well as more recently (as happened to Jarhead). Of course, there is a difference here because the film is about Russian soldiers rather than Americans, as is almost always the case. But in general, this could easily have been a Vietnam movie. I think it only underscores my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union of Vietnam. A country that should have been a push for a superpower made the war drag on for years with a terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The good points in this movie that I felt were good photographs are some beautiful ambient shots) and decent effects for what I guess must have been a rather low budget film. What has disappointed me is mainly the story itself. It just can not bring any emotion into me. Mainly because character development is bad. And to really feel something when people are slaughtered you have to make them people, not just faceless cardboard cutouts. They can not do this in this movie. It's also very long, and it seems like a trend of late. In my opinion, a movie of more than two hours duration has to have a lot to offer, and this movie does not cut it. There is also a disturbing song that is put like a wet blanket over each scene. Especially in the action scenes, this is very disturbing, not that you need action music, but something more than just a slow keyboard music would be cool. Otherwise, the production values ​​were good enough, it was not where the problem was. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to see this movie. As a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, war is a drug? Which Russian filmmakers have watched many American war movies to do something original? Regardless, this movie is a little cliché, lacking in spirit and, although it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks the development of scripts and characters. In the end, it ends up becoming one of those war movies that can not make you think, and fails to add something to the genre. I've seen a lot worse, but a lot better too. I rate this 4/10.
