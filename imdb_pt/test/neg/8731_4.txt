I suppose I should drink something like that with a grain of salt. These lab films (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab), always fail in one dimension: there is an understanding that single people playing have discovered secrets beyond one's understanding until now. Of course, they pay a price because their experience has the same shortcomings as that of Dr. Frankenstein. There is always something they did not anticipate. There are so many things, from pure science to fashion to young women, to extravagant cover-ups that do not work here. The young woman is certainly searching and the doctor can not help himself, but he could have been a little discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing. Things go wrong and, because of that intellect, it gains tremendous power, including an understanding of how it came about. Rock Hudson looks pretty in shape here. He never gets to do this, though. He wanders around with lots of cliches and nonsense that lessen the basic question. Once she had her revenge, a more appropriate thing would be for her to deviate and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand fashion.
