I would not say I'm a big fan of the inventive nonsense genre, so I may not be the best audience for this show. Although, being a critic, I have a sense of what I personally like and dislike, being this the last. <br /> <br /> A lack of humor is a big detour when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy, cool and lively for about 4 minutes and after that you get bored unless it is the animation of the badger a couple of years ago (?) That's the exact opposite, with a stiff script and all over-overacted its simply silly and very very annoying to be subjected to. Unfortunately, since it had a large market ahead and a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
