Asmali Konak has become one of the best TV series coming out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following of followers with continuously broken rating records. Personally I do not agree with the singers becoming actors (hence, Ozcan Deniz - the lead actor), but I think the numbers speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> In relation to the film, it was disgusting to see how much anyone could destroy such a plot. Years in development, this film was able to oversee all the stories of descendants that existed in the series. Not only that, cultural errors were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving family members dancing (Greek style) and breaking boards, which does not exist anywhere within Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some argue that the film should be taken as an independent film, not as a sequel to the TV series, but this theory has a big drop, the way the film was marketed was that it will continue from where the series has stopped and will conclude the series once and for all. . So with that note in mind, me and everyone we know, we'd ask for a refund and we agreed to stay outside the theater to warn the other victims.
