Top Gun without internal animosity. Or class. Or money. Or cruise. An excuse for an up-coming cast of close-to-great actors to market their ability to lead a matinee, this really does not have anything anyone can enter. It's a shame, because Charlie Sheen's opening opens with great promise, which is wasted almost immediately with an absurd wedding piece. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a changeable actor for me, but in this movie he is well, particularly the action sequences. Michael Biehn is a first-class action hero, but not a protagonist: Charlie Sheen is, by all accounts, the protagonist, but never an action hero. There is a cast of hundreds of people who are also noteworthy. 3/10
