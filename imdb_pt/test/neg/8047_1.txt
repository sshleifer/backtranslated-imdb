... a film arrives that can be absolutely terrible from the opening titles to the studio logo marked at the end of the final credits. This was such a film - the kind you can not stop watching for fear of losing a moment of its ever-decreasing quality. <br /> <br /> Forget the low budget that is indicated by a slow and monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a crowded presidential race with no traffic or discernible location. Forget the confusing logic needed to remotely make the actual plot seem plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider offers some of the most intimate dialogues while completely failing to hide his shame. <br /> <br /> This clunker is terribly stimulated, bombed by a trail that is simply laughable, and seems edited by a third grader. All the while twisting scenarios to cover up the most difficult to film an inexpensive presidential plot: make it look presidential. <br /> <br /> I honestly fell asleep briefly on the last roll and when I woke up I ran. back so as not to lose a single excruciating picture. Try this game of drinking: take a picture every time you see it blatantly imitating another movie much better. You too will fall asleep. Since then, 'The Man' with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy, I have not seen such a deliciously irretrievable project. I can distribute copies as Christmas presents. Zero stars. A thousand laughs.
