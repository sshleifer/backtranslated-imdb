Lucille Ball can not sing or perform or dance. This makes the quality of your MAME performance even more terrible. She is not allowed to do the clowning that made her a hit on TV, so she has to rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Mrs. Ball has never learned this ability since none of the tenderness moments are hot. How does she really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words she says. This vacant look of Miss. Ball is to convince us that she is emoting, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, every scene in which it is is flat. <br /> <br /> In addition, when Mrs. Ball opens her mouth to sing, we immediately realize why the studios nicknamed her voice to all the other musicals she starred in. early in his career. It was said that she demanded that her voice be used, so this is a mistake of the ego and also of the leadership. It gets worse when she's singing and needs to "act the moment" without words. Whoever thought he was going to work forgot who was playing Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell did the role on stage and in the movie AUNTIE MAME. Also, I am aware that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for her performance in the original Broadway musical of 1966. None of these women were known for their sung voices, but both could have accomplished it better than Lucille Ball. Why they were with her is the worst flagrant miscasting. <br /> <br /> The only person who leaves unscathed is Bea Arthur. She is big and wonderful, catty and common in all right quantities. Unfortunately, you expect this movie to take off and invite you to join in the fun. But the movie never does and you can not. No one but Bea Arthur seems to be having fun. <br /> <br /> Another negative criticism is given to director Gene Saks. Saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and film, including the Broadway musical on which this film is based. None of these skills and knowledge is helpful here. The poor quality editing and story-telling in this film is below a director of its caliber. This blatant mistake in running the movie is not Ms. Ball's fault.
