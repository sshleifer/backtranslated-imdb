Well, now this weird movie. It was listed as a comedy, but I certainly did not find anything to laugh about. In fact, I'm struggling to find something positive to say about this movie. Oh, here I come. Alex Ferns is not bad in the lead role and I did not choose the end for a change but outside this does not have great direction solid two dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama. I would really avoid having to watch this movie again and think that it would not benefit any of the working class characters you are trying to portray. I found it hard to empathize with any of the characters and did not get enough information about the main character Jimmy to believe in his motives. Best avoided.
