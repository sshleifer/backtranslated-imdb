Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent film that unthinkingly uses the Middle East conflict as the backdrop for an action movie invented for a comfortably sheltered American audience from the Midwest. The conflict, like those involved, is simply used as a cannon fodder to glorify the young photogenic Americans who proudly kill the Arabs for the sake of "freedom." But the worst thing is that the action scenes in the film are sloppy and uninteresting, which prevents the Navy Seals from acting like an irrational shooting. The character of Charlie Sheen (Hawkins) is disgusting, obnoxious, ignorant, reckless and, most of all, racist. It refers to the Middle East as a "hole" and its inhabitants as "cloth heads." Throughout the film, the characters of the Navy Seals are glorified through the use of the Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. They massacre these people indiscriminately with an attitude free of consequences. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese who is shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his language before shooting him while making another humorous joke. Apart from being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (although predictable) pro-American stance of the film is also revolting. This can be seen when the Lebanese-American journalist informs Hawkins that the terrorists can not speak because "they are religious fanatics". Hawkins then retorts with 'yes, and we are the Navy Seals!' The implication is, of course, that the Zealots are insignificant alongside American military might. Moreover, even after insulting the racial heritage of this journalist and treating her as a sexual object, the script demands his inability to resist this disgusting thug and she ends up sleeping with him - because he is a US Navy seal. This marginalizes the journalist's character, making her submissive to Hawkins's "superior" pro-American attitude, despite his insulting behavior toward her. Beyond ethics, this turnaround in history also has little credibility as a drama. <br /> <br /> The script is also amateur. Most scenes are simply chained without any thought for the development of mood, plot or character. The 'music video' scene on the golf course, for example, is just a poor eye drop. And the two scenes in which Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are also useless. In one of them, he jumps from a car bridge just to show his teammates how hard he is, and in the other he chases a tow truck on a bike and pulls his car out of it. None of the scenes have an accompanying anti-climax, both are highly unlikely, and have no influence on the plot as a whole. They are just candy designed as a vehicle to show Hawkins' American heroes and are bad substitutes for character development. Most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly written as - in fact, this affliction affects the whole movie. In addition to the African American Navy Seal and his wife, as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, all other team members seem unfamiliar to the public, so when the climactic scenes roll there seems to be no one to cheer and the death of anyone to mourn. <br /> <br /> In such a film, action sequences can potentially rescue production. But here they do not. These are misdirected, poorly lit and show poorly executed acrobatics. In fact, their direction is so weak that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, resulting not only in the incomprehensibly difficult scenes to follow, but also in a complete lack of fear and suspense. Poor lighting only increases your impotence. The explosions seem fake, gunshot wounds are not convincing and one of the more daring acrobatics involving a Mercedes crash over a tank looks like a scene that was staged in a backlot and then poorly edited. <br /> <br /> The closure of the Navy Seals puts the coins firmly in the eyes of this production. First, there's the obligatory slow-motion scene "fleeing the big blast that should have killed me" with Sheen carrying Biehn on her back. This was obviously the standard scene intended to be the star of the movie trailers. Then there is the end in itself when the remnant of the Seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean, is rescued by a submarine. This submarine had indeed gone home much earlier, but of course he had miraculously returned at the last minute. On top of everything, despite the violent and stressful ordeal of the Seals, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, with some of them still bleeding acutely, everyone can laugh warmly as they bless America with a roar. Predictable? You can imagine this ending as you watch the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film indulgently uses the Middle East conflict as a vehicle for the macho tendencies of all Americans. The Arabs are treated condescendingly and contemptuously, and their massacre in the film is used as a foothold to glorify the use of American military power against a "lower" minority group in an environment free of consequences. The events of 2001 have pointed out that such overweening and overconfident trivialization of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a gratuitous consequence of the pastime. The Middle East can no longer be dismissed as a hole full of raghead heads that clash against each other (to quote Charlie Sheen here); it is now a place where involvement can lead to serious consequences. Today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest very close to home. So at least the Navy Seals look pretty silly nowadays; but that is to be kind. This is a highly ignorant film, whose production values ​​and professionalism are equally suspect. Navy Seals is, ideologically and artistically, a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience.
