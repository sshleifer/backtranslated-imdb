O Sexual Lives of Potato Men, what foolish devil did you create? This is a movie you watch, smiles a bit during the runtime, and then when you mention it to others who saw you, you just can not help but smile as you speak. But it is not that Sex Lives of the Potato Men is actually a funny movie and that inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it, is that the movie is so bizarre; It's so insulting and it's not shameless in your attempt to go through a gentle laugh to do with sex and sex in general that you can not help but have your mouth in a smile. Keep in mind that what follows the smile is a sinking of the head; a consequent shaking of the head and an increase of index finger and thumb to both eyebrows while you gently scrub in an attempt to reminisce your time watching this crap. <br /> <br /> But that's what the movie is, it's crap; it's rubbish very brave and shameless, but rubbish none-to-less. Who invented this idea, put it on paper and spread it through the industry, trying to get it, or must be very brave or very desperate. It is strange to have a film that is definitely "about" something, but that does not, under any kind of circumstance, have a decisive narrative. This stems from the idea that most European cinema is artistic and its stories are ambiguous and open, and themes prevail over most other things. In Sex Lives of the Potato Men, the same situation and technically the same joke are repeated over and over again and this is an ideation that consists of: 'Sex is a very, very funny thing'. These ideas might be more appropriate for an American movie, so it's no wonder that after a while watching this movie, things start to seem a bit out of order. <br /> <br /> The film begins and ends the same way, creating a sense of a circular journey; a circular journey that went absolutely nowhere and absolutely nothing was achieved. Three guys sit around a table talking and what not. Your boss joins them and the conversation is limited to any raw, disgusting stories, situations or scenarios that anyone can imagine. The strangest thing here is that whenever a man says something unpleasant, the other makes a face, but he has an equally filthy story to give in return, creating a contradiction in what these men find to cross the line and what they do not do . The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people who join Tolly (Coleman) whenever the movie finds it appropriate to play a third guy to make some more nasty sex jokes or break some quirky stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has problems and deeper problems but issues that the film is more concerned with exploring because of humor rather than studying. <br /> <br /> So what's the status of Potato Men's Sexual Lives? The three or four men are in crisis, and for the duration of the movie we will play the role of the unhappy fly on the wall when we witness the dirty play these people make over the course of a week. If the mood swirling around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then to Jeremy things are scary. It all starts quite innocently and it seems that there is a woman he likes and one who also likes him in return but when the essence that Jeremy is only a stalker creeps on is when the jaws drop. Jeremy's character is used and placed in a way that makes unrequited love and persecution in general seem "funny." Jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing letters of abuse to Ruth (Davis), echoing some kind of psychotic person most associated with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter to Clarice in 2001 in Hannibal. But whatever sympathy we may have for him at this point is utterly false when the true origin of his relationship is revealed later. Suddenly, we as a public feel a lack of pity for him and for whatever reason he did what he did, in the first place looks cowardly and unpleasant. To say what it was would ruin the few surprises hidden inside the film. <br /> <br /> It's sad how, in one of Jeremy's letters, he writes about something or other saying that he has "no artistic vision?" "just a big mess". I hate it when the words spoken by the characters echo the movie they are in. Potato Men's Sex Lives do not exploit someone's psyche or particular interest in a fetish or because they feel the need to make as much sex as possible, he just uses them as a front to accumulate in ridiculously dull jokes and situations. Instead of having group sex and exploring what leads a person to look for it, it makes a joke with no fun (tickets with numbers!); instead of getting into the mentality of a fan of sadomasochism, the movie has someone hanging on a roof in the basement and warns everyone about "salt and vinegar" while it climaxes. Ferris covers his face in disgust and the camera fades to the next scene without much noise. It's a relief the film does not have audiences overseas. This is a section of British culture, in fact the British mentality that I pray will be confined in our backs and ignored accordingly.
