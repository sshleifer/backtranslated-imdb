Yes, that's what I felt after I finished watching this movie. The acting is below average and the special effects are horrible. Actually, the worst I've ever seen. It's a very low budget film. There is no way this movie can scare you, there are no scary or scary moments. Mr. Bone eater was another funny creature to me. It could have been so much better, but alright, they did not have a big budget. The movie can not convince you that you're watching a horror movie, lol. I would name this movie The Time Eater (waster). I'm sure you would have a lot of better movies / etc to watch. You still watch if: 1. you do not have anything else to watch. 2. you can watch it for free. Not worth renting at all.
