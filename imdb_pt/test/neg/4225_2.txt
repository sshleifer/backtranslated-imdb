I think the letters were stacked against the Webmaster, because from the beginning there was this itchy feeling, like something was wrong, but I could not put my finger on it. So it hit me. Nicknamed For a while, they administered most of the lines as voice onscreen, with just a little hint here and there, until it became painfully obvious. This is the kind of dubbing that irritates the nerves, with nothing remotely funny about it. I hate to dub, but at least, however, misplaced, poorly dubbed martial arts movies tend to have a sense of humor about it. <br /> <br /> What I wanted was a movie about a hacker doing real hacking and stuff like that. Maybe like a verse from the Hackers movie table (being about the person trying to keep them off rather than the people trying to get in). What I got was a poorly written, absurd, sometimes murder mystery with a ton of bad chase sequences, a supposedly inept hacker who was castrated without his little ego, and a director who obviously did not know how to handle a camera . I just wanted to get there, get the guy's camera and shoot the damn thing anyway. The issue was not much better. The acting? Well, I guess if the leader did not have such a bad script to work with, he would be at least watchable. The main villain was fine, too, but pretty much everyone was a joke. The dubbing did not help, but the acting was pretty bad even taking that into account. <br /> <br /> Before I get into something worse, let's cheer up with some good things. Well, one or two. Despite the rudimentary graphics, I really liked the cyber world, how little of it was there, and would have much more watched a movie mainly about, in and around than the warm atmosphere outside in the 'real world'. The fake print looked cool, but it turned out to be useless in the scheme of things. The heart device, which reminded me of Guillermo Del Toro's Cronos, was interesting, though, as a plot device ripped directly from the Escape pages of New York, it was terribly conceived in the long run. There is a point where the thug is unconscious and our hero is right there. Why did not he experience the impression of the bandit's thumb (since the heart device was activated by the thumb)? However, some interesting gadgets and cybernetic things if they could have been used better. <br /> <br /> Now, who here dares compare this movie with Blade Runner? Both movies happen at some point in the future and there is some kind of romance out of the ordinary, more or less in both films. There is the investigation of a murder, but I have seen many movies with a murder in its center that are nothing like Blade Runner or Webmaster. Identity, for example. It's about where the similarities end. Period. There is no comparison as there would be between Blade Runner and Hackers. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director with a great mind for art direction and knows some fundamentals of film production, such as where to put the camera. Webmaster is cheap, and not just because of the budget. It's cheap because of bad writing, and because it often takes the easy way out (like writing in a character who barely appeared first to save the girl at the end to take her to Point B alone without the Hero). so he could do his thing, very convenient. Or, the attempt to sympathize with a character we have no reason to care about. Or, futile things like the car mounted to hold them just enough for someone to get away.). <br /> <br /> He tries to be cool, tries to be exploitative, even tries a finish that is not at all surprising, and tries to be exciting. But a lot of almost identical chase sequences, bad writing, editing, horrible shooting, bad acting, etc. does not make an exciting movie.
