This movie is not so good. It is very stupid, very annoying and very poorly done. I actually only saw this movie because one of my friends said that I hated this movie. Although I did not hate them so much, I still thought it was a really bad movie. The only thing that is remotely good at this was that it was a little fun sometimes, and I also feel that if it had been done a little better, it would have been just as well. What I mean by a little better is that if it had been totally reformulated, would not have looked like it had been filmed for a film festival, and if the script had been improved, it would have been a good horror film. it is not, but instead what it is now, a low quality film. The acting is atrocious. I felt like I was watching a couple of teenagers act like a Halloween show or a Thrill ride or something. The killings are very cheap (as is the movie itself), and basically everything else is low class. Overall, this movie is really bad and you would not miss out on anything if you decided to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 5 stars
