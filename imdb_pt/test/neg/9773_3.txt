The name of this movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie would have exciting and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The sands of the desert were interesting, but this film advanced in a snail's pace. It all started well with an underground cave and something coming out, but then tried to get involved with the lives of some very unpleasant humans. When they found corpses, or should I say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason? Sometimes it became a little different, for something was following them in the wilderness. Some kind of black mud or something that started eating the flesh of humans. As the flesh was chewed, a bag of bones began to creep behind the remaining humans. The reason for this black mud as we discovered was very bad, ants? Unbelievable! So the ending did not make sense. I think the motto of this movie will be, when you have an itch and see an ant, kill it quickly before the ant's friends smell your flesh.
