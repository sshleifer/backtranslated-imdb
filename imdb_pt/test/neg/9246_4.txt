Very fractured to be pleasant, too loose to be interesting and too clumsy to be tolerated MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by the very bad film. Like a Ken Russell movie at its worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST remade by amateurs, MR LONELY may have seemed like a good idea on some pieces of paper (no script, you see) and a free holiday somewhere but no final, we have a widescreen movie that seems to have been made by movie students whose parents told them that everything they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the filmmaker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) Quirky and deliberately out of order. This ends up being annoying and indulgent ... and meaningless. What's the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this movie about the illusion of Hollywood. Maybe Korine wanted to redo GODSPELL ... well, the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh, and there are some subplots like footage of FITZCARRALDO leftovers, including Werner Herzog, nuns and a plane. Add violin music and slo-mo melody all melancholy and melancholy, add James Fox who seems to expect it to be seen as bold (as in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup on widescreen. It may have been fun to shoot, but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine the American Pie Camp with food poisoning.
