"Tales from the Crapper" is bloody, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and eschatological. But okay, I was prepared for all this from my previous experiences of the Troma. What I was not prepared for is that it is also bland, boring and annoying. Very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like "Class of Nuke'em High" remained intact; in its place, we have endless fart jokes (to the point of wondering if Lloyd Kaufman is getting senile, thinking that adults think high fart is so hilarious!) and a cynical and brazen exploration of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to know that should never have been released in the first place. Oh yeah, there's a lot of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn movie probably offers a better plot, higher production values, humor, and, above all, more RESPECT for the intended viewer than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> Q: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "How to Make Your Own Movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.
