Stranded in Space (1972) MST3K version - a not-so-good TV movie pilot for a never-done series, in which an astronaut finds himself trapped as Earth's evil twin. Having a planet of the same size and mass orbiting on the same plane as the Earth, but on the opposite side of the Sun, is a well-worn SF chestnut - the idea is more than 2,000 years old, having been invented by the ancient Greeks. In this version, Counter World is run as a "perfect" Orwellian society. Where, for totally inexplicable reasons, they all speak English and drive final model American cars. After escaping from his hospital, the distracted Terran is chased by TV and intrepid Cameron Mitchell, who, like his minions, wears double-breasted suits and polo-neck sweaters - an elegantly evil combination that I intend to adopt completely. if ever I become a totalitarian sovereign.

So in 1991, the opening credits of "Stranded in Space" run under some photos of three people falling on a transmitter of matter and disappearing. It is a sequence that has nothing to do - not even thematically - with anything that follows. Just to add to the confusion of the B-movie nerd, one of the actors in this shoot, Kay Lenz, later appeared in a 1994 film called "Trapped in Space". Knowing that this fact could never save your life but you can score very large points and admire looks from other junk movie enthusiasts - if you could work on a way to maneuver the conversation to the point where you could slip it casually without look like a total idiot ...
