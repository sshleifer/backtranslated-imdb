This movie starts very well and shocks you. Most performances are good until Patrick Swayze (with his Texas Twang - everyone looks British - even the Muslim) appears, and proves he can not act. You can live with it until the first fight scene, where they all fall apart. Why Patrick Swayze fights villains with an ax when he just shoved his sword into the ground 5 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> There is more loss of spades a few minutes later, and people knowing about other people should not know about. Other critics have mentioned "Troubled Production" and it shows. <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not even care about the fight scenes, of course, the CGI Dragon was weak, but the plot was the biggest disappointment.
