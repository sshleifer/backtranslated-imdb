A spacecraft crossing the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently drifting into space. The crew investigates, hoping to claim their cargo and acquire the ship. However, once aboard the ominous ship, his own ship mysteriously strays, leaving them to defend and fight against no other, then Count Dracula or Orloff, as this creature calls himself. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad start. I mean it follows any number of typical science fiction / horror plots. Genres already exist enough that even the most original story inevitably invokes comparison with some other film. But when you start with a quite typical horror convention, the legend of Dracula and vampires in general, and combines with a rather typical science fiction convention, a crew happening at something and getting isolated to fight against what is forced to filmmakers prefer to have a bit of brand intelligence to print their own brand in the family genre of the genre. Director Darrell Roodt, who also wrote Dracula 3000 with Ivan Milborrow, is primarily responsible for this total failure. So no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing on their sleeves, except in their arms. <br /> <br /> This movie begins in a menacing way, with a very bad voice made by Caspar Van Dien, essentially providing enough exposure to explain who crew on his ship is. I should also point out that Van Dien's character is called Van Helsing. And oh, very cleverly, this Orloff character is from the Transylvanian planet in the Carpathian System. No joking. I mean, come on everybody, we understand. And again, do not be silly and use those names unless you have something special reserved. <br /> <br /> So, after the introduction of Van Helsing's crew, we essentially have a movie about this prey crew. on a spaceship with a lurking vampire. <br /> <br /> I am a very forgiving onlooker when it comes to low budget movies. Occasionally, they can be brilliant, see the first two Raimi Evil Dead films. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the wages of 3 kids, like Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike the EVIL DEAD movies, there is no talent behind the camera. In front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but I will give the actors some benefit of the doubt. It even seems that they do not know what to do. The best actress in the group, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, is killed quickly and the always pleasant Udo Kier is reduced to being a vehicle of exposure for the viewer as the late captain we hear and see through a video diary. Grant Swandby is also good as a teacher, but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and walks in a wheelchair. And, yes, it's a WHEEL chair, since there's nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors, well ... I'm sure Coolio actually tried to be scary after being transformed into a vampire, but, well, I do not find it annoying to qualify as scary in most people's book. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak also do not provide much. Lister is never more than the black and muscular stereotype of IL. Eleniak, in fact, seems unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid-thirties, but seems a little worn and uninterested in the length of the movie. This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff played by Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can not remember who exactly the vampire should be. He introduces himself as Orloff, but at some point he recognizes himself as Count Dracula as well. Who knows. In any case, you will be absolutely amazed at how lame this vampire is. Have you ever watched those horror shows that local networks would have in their slot machines? Yeah, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor who plays Orlock, must have found it almost impossible to focus on such ridiculous clothes. I'm sure he's still being bothered by his friends. <br /> <br /> There is not much to the plot. The vampire is the last of his kind and wants to go to Earth for some reason, and also, there are some comments about wanting to defeat the character of Caspar Van Dien, Van Helsing. Most of the crew are turned into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and pistols to try to defeat them before they discover the old bet on the cardiac routine. Yes, that's right, bullets, yes, the year 3000. Keeping in that disconcerting vein, one of the key areas where the team hides while fighting vampires, or vampires, since there really is never more than one threatening It's full of old Soviet posters and insignia and stuff. What? There are also references to God / religion being antiquated systems. But those references just confused me. Did the Soviet Union make a comeback? Is there any point that Roodt and Milborrow want to do with it? He never goes anywhere, looks dumb and the posters, etc. seem cheap. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the film is filmed and edited with competence. The cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it is clearly done by professionals and, I had no problem with the special effects. The ships look like ships in outer space. Although, as I write this, I remember how horrible God is when the captain's body looks like when the team discovers it. What were they thinking? Why did not someone say something? See how hard it is to say something positive about this movie without falling on the negatives? I think that ultimately is the thing. Whatever the good point you try and grant this science fiction / horror disaster, you get overwhelmed by the lack of quality. <br /> <br /> Poor Udo Kier.
