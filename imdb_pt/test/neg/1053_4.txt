Most Lorne Michaels movies seem to fail because they are essentially just extended versions of skits that could barely make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a direct character of "SNL" - a great and adorable little friend (in their opinion) who does not know anything. <br /> <br /> David Spade takes the role of Thankful Overwhelmed Everyman. He is paired with the Exciting Overweight Slob and they support Miserable Miseries as they travel the country to Save Dad's Business. <br /> <br /> The plot, for beginners, is really defective. The whole premise - Dad dies and the rich and stupid son has to save the family business - can be traced back to almost any movie you want. Like any SNL-style film, it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a skinny man be "funny" together. <br /> <br /> The biggest "influence" of the film is the 1987 comedy classic "Plans, Trains & Automobiles." This movie is great because the plot is not obsolete and recycled. It's basic, yes - a guy who travels home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with an idiot. But it's real, dammit. That makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is pure clowning and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we do not feel anything for them and we do not care what is happening on the screen. "PTA" has walked the line between scandalous and totally believable and relatable - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into an accident turning into a fight with a dead deer that does not really is dead, so wake up and destroy your car. <br /> <br /> The whole destroyed car is completely stolen from "PTA" and it is strange how much material in this movie really resembles Steve Martin / John. Candy movie <br /> <br /> Farley is simply too nasty to find kind - I never liked seeing him in movies and it did not change my mind. Spade has given very little to do, serving as the most ungrateful character in the film. <br /> <br /> Dan Aykroyd is wasted as Bad Baddie who plans to destroy Dad's business. The ending is a joke, not in a "funny" way. More like an "Oh God, are they serious?!" way. <br /> <br /> Some people like it, it's cool. But I just can not get into it, nor do I thank all the things I "borrow" - not just counting "PT & A" - without any credit.
