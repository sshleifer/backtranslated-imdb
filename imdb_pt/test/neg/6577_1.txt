What is it with studios like Paramount that has a number of successful films proven in their hands, and find that it can screw up with the budget and the formula? Paramount spent less on this movie than on TMP, which does not seem bad until you realize there's a gap between when the movies were made. The $ 40 TMP cost would be equivalent to about $ 75 million in 1989. This film is the reason why Shatner never had a fair chance to direct other films as well. Every time he turned around, the studio was cutting budget and making demands on the plot. The fact that this was the only plot Roddenberry and Shatner could agree on made the task of steering enough, but after all the machinations were done, all that ended was an erratic story and a poorly executed charge . special effects not worthy of the original series, let alone a great movie. The most obvious examples: - All Phaser effects have been severely depleted and fake in appearance. "The shot of the Enterprise going to the great barrier was so obviously a picture still in frame being pulled away. At least the popsicle stick that held the Enterprise was cut off successfully. - God "chasing" Kirk up the mountain ... Egads, they may have just cut off Godzilla shots by climbing the volcano at the end of "Godzilla 1985", and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion of the film to make electric rays come out of their eyes to Captain Kirk in distress .... Yes, friends, I have a real problem with the appearance of that last scene, especially. <br /> <br /> Thank God Star Trek VI was such a redeemer of a movie ...
