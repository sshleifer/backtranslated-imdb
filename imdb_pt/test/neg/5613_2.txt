This movie was made because the concept translates well into a two-sentence summary that can be used to attract investors. That is, the premise is interesting and salable. I mean, I rented from the synopsis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no coherent storyline, no full-fledged character, no real comedy, no cool scene, no surprises and no good acting (except Jon Herder, he does something with very little). It's as if the people who lit this thing never read the script, but only the synopsis. And if there were enough people like me, you might even have made some money. <br /> <br /> For the future viewer: do not waste time, there is nothing funny or interesting to see here. To the creators of the movie: hey, you made your movie, so what if it's not so good? Most people can never see themselves or work on the screen.
