This must be one of the most annoying and arrogant movies I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos reached new levels of pretension. Of course there is practically no plot, even though this part of Greek history is material for great films. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually, chaotic) scenes in his mind and built an entire movie around them. Death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the film, but unfortunately it is the film itself. A totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no character development, nothing, zilch. I'm usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters, but, man, he was able to create one-dimensional characters. This is annoying to us and degrading to some of the actors. He even managed to get one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, to look like wood. <br /> <br /> And going to the heart of Angelopoulos's cinema: No, we're not idiots. We do not want chewed food. Please tell someone that this symbolism has to be subtle. Do you really underestimate your audience or are you simply incompetent? Personally, I think he tried to make a Greek underground. No matter how he tries, he can not reach Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace: Photography, costumes and music.
