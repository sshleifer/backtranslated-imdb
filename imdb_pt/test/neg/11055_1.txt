THE SCREAMING is a low-budget horror film that was filmed on video. It has reasonable acting, poor lighting, a weak history and some of the worst effects of monsters I have ever seen. The plot has a college student being pressed to join a cult for his attractive landlord. The cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. That would have been a funny shot in this group, were it not for an idiot script and the low price of production. The monstrous effects are horrible and the picture quality makes it look like you're watching a home video or a public service announcement. I think anyone who sees this will agree that the films should be shot on film.
