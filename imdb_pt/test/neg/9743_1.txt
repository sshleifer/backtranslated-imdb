I vaguely remember this movie. I remember this for the only solid reason that it's the only movie I've ever left! and since then I have never seen him available to rent ANYWHERE !! I can not ruin anyone because I can hardly remember! Thinking, looking at the cast, looked like a winner, with John Landis driving, but good god, they must have been paid too much for this nonsense !! All I can remember is that the father disappears and the family tries to find him, trying to put a real picture on the disk drive of a computer. I left after about half an hour of it. I must confess, I'd love to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it really was that bad! <br /> <br /> Would not surprise me if it were all black actors on the List! I mean, was Christopher Lee there? The legend of all the bad guys, who had been in Star Wars and Lord of the Rings? Like I said - movie listed on black, The Stupids!
