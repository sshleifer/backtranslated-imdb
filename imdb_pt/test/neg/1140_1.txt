I watched the first 30 to 40 minutes of this movie on television the other night and I can agree that this is by far the worst of the show. None of this is funny, even Randy Quaid can not save this mess. Eric Idle was not funny in N.L. Euro. Vacation, and it's even worse here. The only funny scene is where they are at the airport and a guy dressed as Santa walks by the camera shouting, "Did anyone miss this?" how he holds a prosthetic leg ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star out of ****
