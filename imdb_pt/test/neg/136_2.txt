I'm trying to find something of value here. The best I can say is that Truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious, painful, childish, irritating, illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love. If that was your goal, then he succeeded, but the solution to your exercise is really a bummer to watch. There's a scene that screams for a parody: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face with Deneuve's. resources in a landscape. All I could think of was that all the time it was "glacier," "ice pack," "two solitary fishermen using army surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesota." The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. The tropics are presented as paradise, and things progressively worsen as they cool down, hell being French Calvinist Switzerland. That was kind of funny.
