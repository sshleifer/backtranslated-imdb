I admire the effort of trying to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the film is done so badly that most people I know could not sit through it. The film has been relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events occurred, but it is horribly written and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing about it. The musical choices do not flow well with the movie, it looks like someone just plugged in a CD player in the background to put the actors in the mood. The acting ... well, what's acting? The only people who act are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable in that role. As for the development of the relationship between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it is like watching a train accident. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness your "sincere moments." This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to send a message (it could have been a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. This is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. In fact, as a native of Estonia, I am offended by this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than just a homemade excuse for phantom chasing low-budget movie. This could have been so much more!
