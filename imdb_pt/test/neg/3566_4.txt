Surprisingly, this Kieslowski movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes clichéd script that also seems an unsatisfying observation job at times. There is an isolated boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night he watches a woman who lives in his building. Looks! that he wants her. He is one of the young people who are not good at communicating with the opposite sex. However, he likes this woman, when the woman arrives at his house with a man, Tomek is in pain. So we understand that Kieslowski tells a story about an isolated boy who needs a woman to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else, because he may know that it is his salvation. One day, he stops that woman, suddenly he looks like a shy boy, but proves that he is not, so he explains almost everything. She lectures and refuses. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems begin when Tomek visits, the story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman at first woman refuses, but after a short time, she begins to change her mind. This reversal makes the film cliché first. Is Tomek's personality strange? or the result of poor observation? I disappoint with this character, this is my opinion and I will try to say why. When he goes to her house, Magda treats him very friendly. She asks what you want from me? To kiss me? make love with me? Go out with me? At this point, I remember people who say she is a femme fatale. Watch? Returning to the scene, Tomek rejects all proposals. Because? Why is he shy? I do not think so, but his communication is frank, okay. After the leg scene at home, some events make the movie miss the mark. I think the purpose of the film is (it should have been according to the story) to show us that there are some people who suffer from lack of affection and to save from this situation is not easy due to lack of communication and being indifferent especially for men. I mean, at the moment, what does the movie say? It is murky and disappointing. It is seen that he is not hungry for love or a woman or sex. So what? And the scene of the suicide attempt supports this weakness. For him to touch her legs, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I mentioned before, some say that Magda is a femme fatale. Totally not. She strives to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid having contact with him? No. Does she insult you? No. Does she amuse him? No. And she cheats on you? No. She has some problems with her (ex) lover, so she is not O.K. However, she does not take revenge on Tomek. She is not an angel, but neither is she a femme fatale.
