"A lot of the movies I've done probably could have worked well for 50 years, and it's just because I have a lot of old-fashioned values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. 1. Although this movie is a remake of "A Guy Named Joe", it also uses a lot "A Matter of Life and Death "and" Wings of Desire. " <br /> <br /> 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt at being Frank Capra. <br /> <br /> 3. Spielberg has often said he wants to make a "Frank Capra movie" in the vein of "It's A Wonderful Life" and "Mrs Smith Goes To Washington." Judging by the recent attempts to do a remake of "Harvey", it seems that Spielberg still maintains this dream, the director is not satisfied with his last 3 projects in Capracorn. <br /> <br /> 4. Critics of the time hit "Always," claiming that the elaborate action sequences were distracting from the movie's novel, but that's not really the problem. The problem is that "Always" needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg can not film any line of dialogue that does not end at an exclamation point. <br /> <br /> 5. The movie is full of comedy that just does not work. Spielberg's comic tastes are not very sophisticated, and seem to be plucked from the 1950s follies and the Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated antics may work in the cartoon universe, but in a movie it looks like a strange marriage. <br /> <br /> 6. The main couple in the movie is brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films are always apprehensive about sex and intimacy, but this movie goes to extreme extremes: she's a smart kid and a crazy old man. They are more annoying than kind. <br /> <br /> 7. The film contains a good scene, in which John Goodman argues with Holly Hunter, but mostly the characters in the film are very annoying. There is no subtlety, all exaggerated emotions, all projected jokes, all sequences filled with unnecessary occupations. <br /> <br /> 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg to conquer the audience. After his failure (and the financial financial failures of "The Color Purple" and "Empire of the Sun"), Spielberg abandoned the color cinematography of "Purple Color" and "Empire of the Sun" in favor of the darker "blacks and blacks ". white worlds from "Schindler's List", "Munich", "Minority Report" and "Saving Private Ryan". From now on, "less light" and "dark cinematography" have been equated with "serious themes". <br /> <br /> 9. After the financial success of each "dark film", Spielberg returns to his colorful cinematography and falls flat on the floor once more. "Amistad" followed by "Schindler's List", "AI" followed by "Ryan" and "Lincoln" will follow "Munich." These "colorful" movies are always criticized for being cheesy, sentimental, grumpy and corny, but the truth is that if you remove desaturation, all these "serious" movies would feel the same way. Since the 1970s, Spielberg has tried to differentiate himself from the other bandit directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.), pretending to be an "optimist" and "humanist." He himself would affirm this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 1970s. The reality, however, is that he is probably the greatest sadist of all these directors, the very shape of his films, often undermining their content, their box office performances, always commensurate with the dazzling displays of carnage. <br /> <br /> 11. Spielberg's failure to connect with any of the characters in "Always," and the pleasure he demonstrates in filming forest fires, falling planes, perfectly encapsulates the rest of his filmography. People running dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks, etc ... that's what Spielberg loves. The moment your characters stop talking, everything is self-destructive. A film like "Amistad" failed, in other words, because few blacks died and many whites spoke. <br /> <br /> 12. The flight scenes of the film are not up to the standard established several years before in the "Top Gun". Of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it is difficult to make things cinematographic. <br /> <br /> 13. Failures like "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. are often more enlightening than the most successful films of Spielberg. They reveal the steel skeleton under the technique. They show how the amusement park ride is when it is not running, revealing the vacuum under the broken machine. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? There is a good sequence here (two actors in a room, simply improvising), but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
