"The Core" finds "Crack in the World" (1965 made for TV). The acting is the stock, the foreseeable suspense. Once you subtract the whole plot ripped from "The Core" - basically the manned drill machine - you end the plot of "Crack in the World." "Crack" was an excellent film starring Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, working in South Africa, drilled the crust and "drilled" with a nuclear device in order to provide a constant source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, also a brilliant scientist, disagrees. He believes the explosion will not pierce a simple hole, but will form cracks in the crust. (Possible spoiler) He's right. To prevent the resulting slit from destroying Earth, they must place another nuclear device in the path of the slit. <br /> <br /> Although I posted a spoiler warning, I do not know if I messed up anything for any of the movies. And since "Crack in the World is only available in very rare VHS format, if my decision not to reveal whether the backlash works is probably academic." In short, I classify "Descent Below of the average.
