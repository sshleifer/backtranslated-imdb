I was watching the beginning of this on a Friday, noon, while working on the computer at home, relaxing a little after a hectic week, and cleaning up some files and answering some communications. It was interrupted a couple of times, so I had trouble getting all the details right (though it's hardly a Hitchcock job, where missing a detail may be weird all through the story), and moreover it was not exactly a catchy part. So during a commercial, read the only previous review here (for "mgconlan-1"), and you can practically agree with its details. <br /> <br /> It's not quite in the category of such a horrible movie that it's fascinatingly good, but I'd like to get on the tape when I run again (instead of seeing it as airy), so I I can go ahead as needed and see the parts I missed this first time. <br /> <br /> Give a "3 *" because of the attractiveness of the four main characters.
