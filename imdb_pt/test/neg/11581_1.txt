I can immediately admit that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. And that's not saying a bit, because I consider myself a bit fond of when it comes to low-quality film. But this is beyond evil. This movie is so horrible that there is more fun in it, it's bad. <br /> <br /> Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strengths and nothing positive to say. I'll just talk about some of the points that sucked. First, the CGI has to be one of the worst I've ever seen. I can not believe this movie was made in 2005, the CGI reminds me of something I might have seen in Babylon 5 since when the CGI was new and fresh. It is poor beyond belief. Second, all actors seem to belong to the worst kind of daytime soaps. And looking at their resumes I see that I'm right ... Third, being able to create huge reptiles is no match for the other technology they invented in this movie: the pistol without recoil with infinite ammunition! Seriously, Michael Par√© shoots 100-200 times without reloading on all other scenes ... As if that were not enough, there are also airplanes that change shape! At first they are regular fighters of the F-16, in the next scene they are something completely different, and in the third scene they are F-16 again! If you are buying stock footage, please do not mix it as well! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there's a lot more to say, but I think I'll stop. You all understand what I'm saying. Honestly, I did not think this kind of movie was made any more. It's like something Ed Wood would do. Completely ignorant of quality, not caring how it all seems ... It's almost incredible at all it's horrible. If I could give 0/10 I would, but 1/10 is the lowest score. Then that's it.
