Maybe, if you've never read English literature, or just watched the Hollywood version of any book, you might find merit in this horrible movie. Has Shoreditch's directing and scripting ability. The adaptation of the BBC in 1995 is very nice and close to the book and captures very well the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy. <br /> <br /> The characters in this production are very bad, Sutherland as Bennet looks like a total clown. Bingley also acts like an idiot and it is unbelievable that he is my friend of Darcy. I can not imagine how Judi Dench could have accepted the part, maybe she thought it was a surrealistic comedy version. <br /> <br /> Quotes from the book are put out of context. Huge pieces are missing, the important episode with Wickham is overturned. <br /> <br /> Mr. Collins is nevertheless very good, and rises above the other members of the cast. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that we did not pay to see. Wait for the DVD and use to prevent a table from falling out.
