A ridiculous comedy given a shaken-up direction. I love one of the comments here: "It can not be done today". Well, neither could 'The Philadelphia Story' without a car chase or two. However does this mean that the image is worse for wear by being outdated? I do not think "Susan Slept Here" was good for any generation and should rot peacefully in the memories of Debbie Reynolds-buffs. There is no glow in this story of a screenwriter who clings to a much younger girl for "script research." Dick Powell makes his farewell appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him. Reynolds is pale. Produced by a Harriet Parsons - it gives its famous mother Louella a number of inane chips. * 1/2 of ****
