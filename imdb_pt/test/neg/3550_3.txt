It starts really interesting - the story unfolds around the main character, who runs a "cleaning business", specializing in cleaning up crime scenes. As a former police officer, he is faced with some strange situation when a job suddenly "disappears officially." In addition, he discovers some relationship with an investigation into police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the deeper he stays at the bottom of the story. The good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play in a suspenseful story with some twists - but only until the last 25 minutes. (so far 7 out of 10 stars). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the movie loses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shooting, involving the daughter of 14 years, a betrayal of friendship and an unjustified justice outside the development of the character ... why not have Cutler giving up his investigation because of friendship? or have the daughter discover some facts? or ... many possible finishes of much better stories are imaginable ... a truly lost end!
