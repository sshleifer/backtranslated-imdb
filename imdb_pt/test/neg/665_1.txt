After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the production of this abysmal film. On the one hand, as a general commentary, the plot was literally unbelievable and full of incredible clich√©s all around. The same is obviously true for the dialogue that favors the lowest common denominator and can deliver absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The acting was terrible too, with Kane showing, throughout the film, the three distinct and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed, since each prop was easily distinguishable from its real-life counterpart. Overall, I would not recommend to anyone considering to see this feature, because it certainly will waste 83 minutes (nor 90!) Of your life.
