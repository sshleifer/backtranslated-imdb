New Orleans is nothing like it is portrayed in this disaster of a movie. Quaid's attempt to speak with a cajun accent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks like this in New Orleans) is terrible. Plot = elemental and meaningless. This image refers to itself as a mystery, but a mystery involves a gradual process by which the viewer receives clues and twists throughout a film. There is none of this here. "Big Easy" tries to overcome the banal stereotypes of New Orleans. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - the real Big Easy is nothing like the town where Quaid & Barkin makes its way.
