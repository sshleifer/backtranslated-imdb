Oh yes, I have to agree with the others who describe this as shocking. Working on this four-hour feature is uniformly bad, so bad that I find it impossible to believe that any of the actors in that production could earn a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the cast. Each one delivers their lines without seeming to have any kind of involvement or emotional investment with any other character. No one seems to have a true relationship, familiar or not, with another. The direction is also shocking and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Were the movie editors sleeping? <br /> <br /> The costumes look authentic for the Regency period, but the fabrics look like twentieth century and the colors (especially the blue colors!) are shocking and I do not believe they were available in the early 19th century fabric century, except perhaps in silk. <br /> <br /> Also the hair: men have obvious haircuts from the 1970s, and women have "big hair" - especially the woman who plays Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All female characters, young and old, are very cute, but this does not make up for the lack of acting skills. The actress who plays "Anne" seems to be almost forty, while Anne Elliot should be 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we found the woman who plays Anne believable? She spends much of her time staring thoughtfully at the horizon level, whether inside or outside. I still wonder what that should convey. Repentance perhaps? Yes, this production is regrettable! <br /> <br /> The actress who played Louisa was truly terrifying. She screams, screams, laughs, and leaps like a rude child of twelve (my apologies to a twelve-year-old reading this) that I found myself eagerly awaiting the moment she let go. How this behavior must attract an adult man is beyond me. Most would recoil when she opened her mouth to laugh and scream. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Captain Wentworth portrays someone so insipid and colorless that one wonders why a woman might jump on him for eight years. > The return of the pair at the end is not done or explained convincingly. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that's right. No, there has to be more than that and it's not explained in the movie. <br /> <br /> I consider this production two stars: one because it is the work of Austens and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. The only reason I could watch the entire production was that I was sick with the flu and I picked it up from the library. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, check out the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this movie even if you have not read the book.
