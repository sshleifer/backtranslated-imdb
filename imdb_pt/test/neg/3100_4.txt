It has been said that some directors make small budget photos resembling blockbusters. Albert Pyun makes small budget photos similar to the A / V high school project films. This film was virtually non-existent in all departments. Virtually all scenes take too much risk, experimental lighting and camera work are terrible, Rob Lowe apparently equated to being dishonest with acting, and the poor, insipid Euro-pop figures prevent the movie from quitting. On the plus side, Burt Reynolds does a pretty good job with what he gets (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent and Ice-T puts on another long string of B movie thieves. Not the WORST job of Pyun (Urban Menace), but certainly not his best (Mean Guns).
