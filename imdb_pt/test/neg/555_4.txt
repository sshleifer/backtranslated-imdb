I can accept the fact that this was the NEXT carateco boy so Ralph Macchio could be happy retired from the series, and while Hillary Swank is great for the role ... the plot for the movie is just terrible. <br /> /> Mr. Miyagi's old friend from World War II dies, leaving his widow to care for his rebellious granddaughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline is still the hero because the local ROTC ... which I will explain in a minute, go out to get it. You know what to do ... Miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> It's corny, it's cheesy, it's the 90's .... but that's neither the long nor the short. My first case of "huh?" Why is there a "military division" in high school? I thought this thing came out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As far as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a school? My next complaint is that during the prom scene, bungee jump activists to scare people .... why? The thing I noticed over all 4 movies was in the end the jumps suddenly turning face after all the nonsense they put the main character (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in part 3). This movie is no different. After Ned and friends basically sabotage the prom, they blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank the whole movie ... Ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like, "um ... no" If you go face Pathetic turns at least make sure the characters did nothing much above the top, like blowing up a hot rod. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love affair between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... tacky, but nothing to melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the trash that Ralph Macchio did in the first three films. <br /> <br /> I'll tell your own movie after watching the first three movies. I can accept it more or less as a spin off ... but I can not accept the whole military thing, too uncommon to be taken seriously. Now, if Ironside and his team were wrestling / soccer and he was the coach, that would have been more convincing. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is fine ... the rest is the same as anything, the only highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, which was cool 4 out of 10
