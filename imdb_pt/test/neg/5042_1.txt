The acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like I'd just gotten the script that morning) and the quality of the sound and movie made me think of the 1970s movie about the bombs of the week. The only thing that told me it was not really a 70's movie of the week was the reference to DNA tests. But for me, being Eastern Orthodox, the most notorious thing about it ... the movie ..... was the total Romanization of religion. Romania is 88% orthodox, but you would never know it: Father Soren is Irish. And I would have known this even if I had not seen the actor play the Irish pub Michael Sullivan in episodes of "Fairhaven" of the series Star Trek: Voyager. The bishop wore Roman robes (and for record even Orthodox bishops do not wear their vestments unless they are saying the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). About the only non-romanist paraphernalia I saw was the 3-bar cross at the church door, and even then I had to squint to see. The first reviewer said the producers did their research. Well, if that's true, they spoiled the religious aspect of the movie.
