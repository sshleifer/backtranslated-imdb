By strange coincidence I began to watch this movement right after Brice de Nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worse than Brice de Nice, so I was really looking forward to something better that would make me forget this horrible failure. Unfortunately, the OSS-117 again left me disappointed - I do not know, maybe it's just a problem with translations, but since "Cons Diner" I have not seen any French comedy I would call very good. Even when I look at the reviews on the IMDb, only people in France are giving high marks to the OSS-117 ... For me, this movie did not work - in some parts, it's so funny how much real. James Bond films, in other jokes, were a little predictable or very cheesy.
