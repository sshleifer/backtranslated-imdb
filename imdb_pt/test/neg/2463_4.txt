"Once again, we have a movie that contains about 20 minutes of entertainment - mostly involving the occasional funny lyrics of the band - in a 90-minute package." For someone old enough to remember, this is along the lines of the first "Bill and Ted" without the plot. If that does not say enough about how brainless this movie is, think of Jack Black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and being that your selling point. If you really enjoy listening to Tenacious D because of your musical prowess, then knock it out and buy the soundtrack. Do not waste time on this. If you're a junkie looking for a good bad movie full of laughs, you're still barking at the wrong tree. No matter the power of your friends, you still want to show up at Grandma's Boy again.
