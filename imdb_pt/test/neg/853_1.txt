When I first looked at the back of the cover of this movie, it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to a memorable 82 minutes. And it certainly was memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you wonder how that was possible. How could it have been released on DVD? Of all the movies available at the video store that night ... we might have chosen the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me at all. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story because of the main character's suggestions? Of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with, this is now my favorite. The character Foggerty, the village idiot, played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making color films. If there is a single movie that you definitely should not see this year, please be Puckoon, because I do not think it could be worse. I still wonder if this could have been the worst way I spent my money, and believe me I have made many bad purchases over the years.
