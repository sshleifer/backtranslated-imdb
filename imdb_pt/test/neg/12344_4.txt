The film gets a little interested with the son interested in a teenager his age. Clayburgh's timid-looking husband is killed in a car accident as she prepares to go to Rome and sing like a diva. Matthew objects, but comes together. He connects with the girl again, but this time, Matt is using cocaine. Her superb voice, lovely and impetuous mother is in the center of attention. She does not know how to handle Matt's addiction. The movie crawls in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong part and Bertolucci may have had his head on the moon while driving the image. The Moon has a great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save your time. I'm maybe very generous with 4 *.
