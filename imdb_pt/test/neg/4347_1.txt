I had no idea what this movie was, it jumped from one plot to one plot erratically tying up incoherent ideas with one another. it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The timeline does not help either. We begin today, we recover the past and we return to the future only to return to the past. <br /> <br /> This movie is also filled with horrible lines and cliches themes like princess and the poor, "you can not even have me in my death" lines, "you do not even love me enough" line. clich√© to the max! <br /> <br /> The fight scene was terribly tacky, the lighting was constantly lost, which compensated the CG with the actors (meaning you could say that some of the scenarios were clearly CG). <br /> <br /> Although the society in di moon was quite interesting. <br /> <br /> I really would not recommend yours to anyone, avoid if possible. <br /> <br /> If you found this comment difficult to follow, the film would be equally as bad.
