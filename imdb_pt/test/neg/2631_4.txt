It turns out that I got this supposed horror movie on a Friday night, I wanted to go to bed! Tell me .. Is it a 3-foot raincoat twerp on a gurly bike that should convey some kind of fear? Not here, yet Mi-bass is still able to beat the shit out of the janitor (Antonio Fargas), who is three times his size (?) Uh-huh. And the end is so unfortunate ... leaves you with nothing to move on! I found myself asking, "Is that it?" <br /> <br /> Acting is as good as a low-budget movie. The aforementioned Fargas offers decent performance; but it's my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn is perhaps one of the worst actresses ever to perform in Tinsel! Sure, cute face, but bad acting.
