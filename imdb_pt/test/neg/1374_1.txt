It does not take much fun to slow people down. Having to listen to Mencia insist that he is brave to make "retarded" jokes is intolerable. Also, you do not need balls to bite the chapelle show. The shows of racial games, the racial olympiads, it seems that many skits are merely reworked skits from Chapelle Show, which are much less funny. <br /> <br /> But the most annoying thing in the show is his insistence that he is just marching to the beat of his own drum, when in fact he is marching to the beat of many overworked and overworked drums. which were played many times. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate it as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no, Carlos, I'm not trying to blame you. If people like it, then continue. But I personally think it's a bad show.
