I rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it is one of those rare and neglected stones that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy Unfortunately it's not one of those movies. I'm not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentalism or worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. It's supposed to portray a struggling migrant workers community that tries to deal with the difficult realities of their life. That's a good premise and could have contributed to an exciting story, but the execution made me switch between irritating and amused myself with ridicule. <br /> <br /> Here we have a community of simple farm workers. who migrated to the US in search of employment and who have become accustomed and abused repeatedly of wicked white men. And when I say evil - I mean evil. All the white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic and abusive devils whose only purpose in life is sexual depravity entwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it were not so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious. <br /> <br /> The portrait of immigrants is also an example worthy of exaggeration, except for the fact that it goes in the opposite direction. Immigrants are holy, clean and can serve as ointment for boo-boos and ouies around the world. I could not help laughing when I saw these "field workers" presumably digging into the ditches every day with their notoriously clean clothes and carved haircuts from a top salon hairdresser. A little restraint and a more evenhanded hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie evoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic giggles.
