I think many friends of people who have acted on this thing must have realized this because I'm telling you, it's just awful. The acting is worse than the bad soap, the effects are like something you would see in an episode of Doctor Who from 1970, the story is, well, there is no story. And they keep using the same 2 minute song again and again. And the werewolf? Is it like the muppets they used on Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the guy who ran this thing is terrible and should never direct anything else, except maybe the part of his son's school, but even so, he should pay the public to watch it. Ghost Wolves is nothing more than a joke in bad taste.
