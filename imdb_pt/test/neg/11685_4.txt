First, there are some holes in this movie. We see, in the beginning, that a boy dies while playing the game. But who was tied up in the delivery truck of the package containing the game? How did the driver put the package in the mailbox when he was tied behind the wheel? It's not like he's Mr. Fantastic. Wow that in the first 15 minutes ... The actors are second-rate, get the "Bad Guy" played by Patrick Kilpatrick (who?) Exactly he appeared in an episode of everything on TV and some minor roles in poor films (such as This one). So most of the acting is like TV dramas, I can live with it, but the graphics or special effects are horrible. The disembodied "Game" voice sounds like a poor Hal clone from "Space Oddessy 2000". What they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping like monkeys from Planet of the Apes. The aliens had transparent bodies like shadow zombies. In most cases, the film was only predictable, since it had no hidden hook or agenda. The story was a good idea, but most of the good ideas discussed during lunch were never developed beyond this good idea.
