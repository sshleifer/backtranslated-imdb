Oh man! This series has to be the worst possible anime I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> It started new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot-headed. <br /> <br /> So he kept falling more and more down the slope as the series progressed ... and I would tell the reasons why. <br /> <br /> Okay, they basically destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early on, reliving his 50-year-old dead girlfriend, who is drippy, sappy, and a total loss of time They introduce a pervert named Miroku, who is supposed to be a kind of religious figure for the show. (Which really bothered me because I was out of place and stupid.) So they introduce a killer demon named Sango whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his washed brother. <br /> The big evil of the show, Naraku, although starting as a very good guy, lost his touch after a while. (It got really old too fast, and it bothered me that he was the only villain in the show who did anything.) All characters became woodless and unemotional. And so, the end of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. Nothing happened. Naraku was never killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fell completely in love (because he was still all in love with his 50-year-old dead girl). The batch holes were left open. The animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. And nothing changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And they expected me to (like other fans of the show) to be satisfied ?? I was disenchanted, angry and annoyed as trash. I at least had high hopes that there would be a good end to the series. Instead, all I got was a commercial dragged into the manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime about swords and things like that, I strongly recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". This show moves forward and goes somewhere, besides having a very good animation as well. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this little excuse for anime, in the best way you can.
