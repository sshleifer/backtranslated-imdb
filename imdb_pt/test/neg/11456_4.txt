This movie is dated in many ways, it is sensational. You can laugh at it or shake your fists in anger. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with many problems in American history, but with typical white-male-Christian-American paternalism: The main character is one of those I can do-and-all-and-you -have-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-a-face. He is so pompous and should not be taken seriously at any time. What a horrible creature! His wife is a weak woman for the first part of the film and a character still very crying, but stronger in the end. Too bad she still forgives his arrogant ways after he left her a second time. It's sad that the character has not really changed. Even though she ought to portray a strong, independent woman in the end, she is consumed by worry about her husband in search of adventures. So 2 out of 10 feminist points between us (and those are just for good intentions ...)! The problem of Indian suppression is treated very well, but there is a new, patronizing story. And the fact that all African American characters are typical stereotypes makes the film even more hypocritical. I was so enraged most of the time! So, a point (to try) of the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know the movie was made at a different time. I love old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of those dated points of view. But that was disgusting! <br /> <br /> What saves this movie are the parts without the main character. Mr. Dix's acting is far superior and presumptuous. Maybe that's why your character is so unpleasant ... I liked Mrs. Dunne, though his temper sometimes infuriates me. <br /> <br /> But I must say that the famous scene of the race for land was amazingly made. And the way the Oklahoma deal was portrayed made the movie worth it. It's amazing how civilization came from the dirt and dust of the nineteenth century. And I do not understand the problem that some have with the church scene. I thought it was very funny and fun. Maybe it should not be, but I liked it. Then, 9 points for those scenes and the impressive narrative of the development of the state of Oklahoma. That makes about 4 points in all!
