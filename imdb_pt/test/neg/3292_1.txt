How can such things be done? Seinfeld, Arrested Development, The Office etc etc did not kill this old-fashioned, boring crap? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm really a fan of Michael Rappaport and I have enjoyed his various appearances and supporting roles (Copland, Friends), but in that he sucks, but anyone would fight with this script . <br /> <br /> My wife likes that. But she's Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sitcom, you'd understand why she'd find it so funny. <br /> <br /> Just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with it, I guessed the next 3 or 4 development plots / lines would be while watching for a while and was correct almost word for word! I felt very smug. It annoyed my wife how she hates it when I do it (I can understand why, but I felt good, so I messed it up!)
