Well, since it's called Holocaust Porno and directed by Joe D'Amato, I got into this movie hoping sleaze ... and while I got it, Holocaust Porno was a big disappointment as it's so damn annoying. The title suggests that the movie will feature porn, and that's not wrong - Holocaust Porno is pretty much just porn, and most are just the same thing over and over again, I was moving fast before the end. The first sex scene is between two women and I have my hopes, but after that, it degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the movie (for the first hour!) Is made up of conversation, and you can imagine how much fun it is sit down! The plot focuses on a deserted island where, believe it or not, something strange is happening. Naturally, it is not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists, who happen to be sexy women, land on the island. They have sex a few times and some strange things happen, so more than an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for women ... This must have seemed like a good idea an original porn movie - a zombie who likes to do it, but it's not surprising that it does not work well. The film is only ten minutes from the two-hour mark, and that's too long for a movie like this. I have no idea why the Porno Holocaust is as long as it is; if they had just taken a minute out of each sex scene, the movie would have been less than ninety minutes, and that would have made it much more tolerable! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear (it's a long time before there is a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place), and when it finally shows up, it's a big disappointment! I realize that this is a low budget trash for B movies, but D'Amato certainly could have tried a bit more and have something better than that! I will not even bother mentioning the acting, atmosphere etc, it does not make sense. Holocaust Porn is basically just your bland porn movie with a slight hint of horror, and I can not recommend it!
