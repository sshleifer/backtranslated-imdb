A vehicle for Michael Caine. It's reasonably well written and there's something good about it, but it's actually a mess - it's not funny enough, it does not scare enough. It's a flabby modern cockney thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the premise - that even in the refractory moral interior of East London people do things for the right reasons. A surprising result for the first proper fight that Billy Shiner promoted his paranoia. The second half of the movie makes him chase shadows to deal with the disappointment of the first result. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was the inability of director John Irvin to do more of the relationship between Shiner and his lieutenant. / substitute branch Frank Harper. Harper's, a British Tom Sizemore, understands his role well, while those around him seem to have ignored him. Feather. 4/10
