Another of those fragile stories, along with most of the forgettable musical numbers. Powell and O'Keefe as advertising fighters are quite forgettable. However, there are two brilliant moments. Hubert Castle is the most intriguing wanderer you've ever seen - your "drunken walk" on the wire has to be the most spectacular balance ever recorded in the film. It has to be seen to be believed. The other is Sophie Tucker making a bow near the end of the movie. Your magnetism, your professionalism, your absolute talent for being yourself - well, the charisma is not learned - you have it or not. A great lesson for all possible cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Campos in his last participation in the cinema is completely forgettable.
