THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, "Oh, it's a bad movie from Hong Kong." Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it sucks. This incredibly stupid Jackie Chan movie, ruined by us, yes we Americans (I'm boiling with rage, ooh, I think I'll jump out the window!), Has Chan like a New York cop chasing a gang, avenging the death of Your Friend. Sounds cool ... but it's not. Do not waste your money renting it. To prove that he could make a better police film, Chan made the incredible story of the police (1985).
