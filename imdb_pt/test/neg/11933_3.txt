The series finally reaches the bottom of the pit with this fourth movie, which was (thank God) the last. None of the three sequences did live up to the original very entertaining, but this particular film is nothing more than a blatant attempt to explore the name of "Magnificent Seven" and Bernstein's musical theme. The production values ​​resemble those of a TV movie and the characters are forgettable and indistinguishable: in parts "II" and "III" you could not remember their names, here you can not even remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inadequate choice for the role of Chris, but no one could have replaced Yul Brynner in our minds anyway. Do not waste your time.
