I got tired of several attempts to sit down and watch this "Gilmore Girls" show. This puzzled me because I just could not figure out what that was. Was it about a young woman having a young baby in her life and never growing up? Was it about her daughter being more responsible than her mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the hell is this show? Finally, I just did not care. The cast makes me want to scream. Writing is not "smart" or "smart" is syrupy and tedious. <br /> <br /> So, why did I watch? Because I've heard so many good things about it and I'm not giving voice to an opinion until I've seen it. Knee-jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I watched them a few times. The first time I saw this, I saw her mother running around like she was 12 years old and her daughter acting like she was 40 years old. Maybe that's what attracted me. I've never liked any of the "Freaky Friday" movies - not to say it's so, but there are some similarities. <br /> <br /> I also have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her, "What is this show?" A very intelligent, generally articulate young woman could never give me a direct answer. So I asked other people who liked that - they do not know either. <br /> <br /> Gilmore Girls is turning into a TV show that is like an "art film." Many of us do not understand, but those who will desperately try to find a meaning where there really is not one, just to be "unglued." Yes, I find Laurela Graham's irritating Lorelai - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, nasally, WHINE. An entire hour of it. Wow. And the rest of the cast is as memorable as the cheese sandwich yesterday. The town is cheesy, men are weak, grandparents are boring, and unfortunately, I find nothing rescuing any of these characters or caring about anything they do. It's like watching paint dry on the wall.
