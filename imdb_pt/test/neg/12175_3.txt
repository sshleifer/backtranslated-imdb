The appeal of this film has to be the artistic style of the Euro, because there is absolutely no substance. A lot of things happen that seems to be going somewhere ... but it never gets there. <br /> <br /> It's hard to come up with 10 lines of commentary because this movie is a totally empty experience. . There are lots of cool photos of a graveyard, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what can go through surreal humor and a weak existentialist ending. These elements weaken each other. Only when you may be liking the scary mood are there some silly heads with bouncy heads or zombie sex. So as not to scream out of boredom, you cling to the minimum plot - and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogical. It's as if someone picks up a few B-shaped films and puts them in the blender. <br /> <br /> What comes out is mostly a film about meaninglessness and not a good movie. Clearly, it will impress that category of art fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. Everyone else should stay well away from this dark mess.
