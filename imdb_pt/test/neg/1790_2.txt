I've been a big fan of Lynn Peterson since her role in the 1988 blockbuster movie "Far North," and even loving her in her other film "Slow" (2004), where she plays "Francis." by far its strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as I'm sure you all know (or should), plays the critical role of "Driver." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than Lynn's incredible performance, I'm afraid that this movie does not really have much going for it. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait - there was something else - the incredible creativity of editing to remove swearing for viewers. Memorable lines like: "You son of a gun!", "You son of a bitch!", "Shoot!" And "Well, forget about you!" O.K. Bye. <br /> <br /> Q. Does anyone know where I can get another poster from Lynn Peterson?
