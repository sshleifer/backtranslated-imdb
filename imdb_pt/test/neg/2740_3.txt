I just watched Descent. Gawds that horrible movie. Right away, they describe a lava geyser and a note says it is miles below the surface of Washington state. Guys, there are no geysers on Earth's bottom like this. They thought it looked clean and in typical Hollywood style they threw in. And then there was nicely that vomited lava. He dropped a stone and I heard a noise. The steam would have gone well before a lava explosion could, if ever. <br /> <br /> And the acting was very bad too. Micheal Dorn sank to a new level of employment. <br /> <br /> What a dog in a movie. I bet the vote is not bigger than a 3.5 <br /> <br /> It did not look like the SciFi Channel spent much more than having the handsome kid Perry as an attempt to draw.
