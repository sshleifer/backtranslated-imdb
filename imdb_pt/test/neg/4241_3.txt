The hot female numbers on this show are breathtaking. They can also speak as if there is no tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would go to the bathroom quickly. How much money do they earn in all the people who make the text, hoping to be called back to win, $ 100,000, or whatever. Boy, now this is a fake !!! Can I buy shares in this money maker? Let's face it, with the technology now, thousands of people could be calling every minute. And with ten thousand channels and nothing worthwhile, thousands of people watch this show. "Oh, I know this answer!", Is probably a super common line among listeners. With these super hot guys constantly saying that the lounge needs the caller, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Often, someone passing by is surprised to be talking to the host. Many of them sound depressed and worn, probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get some change in their pockets. Wow, the producers should be just tidying up. No wonder there are so few commercials. The commercials are ready to give time for more (mostly losers) to come and wait, wait, dream and fantasize about - what? --- earning enough money for a gas tank and a dinner at Mc .. something? I just watch now and then on my brothers' TV, because he likes to watch when he's at the computer. I sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and I look at Mel (one of the hottest women on TV) and laugh at the blow in front of me. So I have to leave; even if I do not! People who have an active life, can only take this show in extreme moderation. Honey, get into the movies, on TV, or something. Many of us are in love with you! Even with the super cuchitos, I'm impressed with the show still in progress!
