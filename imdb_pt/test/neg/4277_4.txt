This version of Mansfield Park, though extremely accurate to the novel, did not have the compassion I felt for Fanny, who is crucial and central to this Jane Austen story. This was due to the total lack of ability of actress Sylvestra Le Touzel. She had no appeal and sometimes seemed to be lost in space or out of her depth. The scene she has with her uncle, where she breaks into hysteria, was hysterical. She exaggerated a lot on the crucial scene and I really felt sorry for Henry Crawford having cared for her. <br /> <br /> The opposite side is the portrait of Mary Crawford, by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actress, in a very difficult part of making the character witty and egocentric, selfish, but vulnerable to love. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Fanny. She is gentle, but with a ruthless sense of what is right, and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration. The Fanny in this adaptation is very meek and subservient, almost without thinking until the end of the series. As much as I wanted to like this Fanny ... I just could not. <br /> <br /> I suggest skipping this version of Mansfield Park for the real thing ... the novel. Fanny will not disappoint ... you will love her!
