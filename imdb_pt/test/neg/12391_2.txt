It seems at least vaguely possible that this film has been an inspiration to "The Sopranos" as its main character Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a success that has so many problems from his past and his profession that he is in therapy. trying to deal with it all. Everything finally peaks at its 10-year high school reunion. The problem was that by the time Blank arrived at the meeting I stopped caring. Frankly, I found this movie a drag from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He had potential. There was a reasonably good cast, led by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, playing Grocer, their arch-rival in the hit business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blank's high school girlfriend whom he got up on the night of the ball, and a limited role of Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, psychologist of Blank. That quite talented cast never seemed to come together, though. The drama had no intensity and the comedy had no real humor. What I thought had the greatest potential to be a comic plot was Grocer's proposal for a successful man's union, but in addition to becoming a joke, the idea was never developed. As for the novel, someone wondered why Debi would think about letting this guy get back into her life. <br /> <br /> There was some laughter, but nothing really caught me, held me and I spent most of the time. movie wondering if this thing would ever start to click. That never happened - not for me at least. 2/10
