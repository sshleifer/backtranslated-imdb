This movie is not worth a review, it just made me decide that I will not see the next Tarantino movie. And I used to love Tarantino's movies. Not artistic, not funny, not witty, not funny, nothing, just bored and stupid. If this movie had been Tarantinos first, it would have also been his last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino has to control himself, otherwise his next movie will be 3 hours meaningless, boring and nothing cool. dialogue. He seems to have fallen in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> After finishing his popcorn, there is no more reason to sit in a theater.
