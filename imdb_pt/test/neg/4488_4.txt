This movie has the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great writer and this movie had every chance of being as good as The Notebook, but what separates the two is that the notebook had a team of dreams takes on McAdams and Gosling, but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum <br /> <br /> I felt many of the scenes were unequal purely because of their performance, a lot of emotion in several scenes are lost because he can not act, leaving a clumsy and unequal situation, Amanda Seyfried gave a great performance just to get Tatum to drop the ball and the weather was lost and the scene did not recover. <br /> <br /> This story deserved to be released right, but what it did was a handsome boy who can not act. Tatum should stay with what he's good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, though horrible, like GI JOE, intensify and fight. The less he talks, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think of me as a boring hatred of Channing Tatum. I entered this movie with an open mind because I have often been surprised by the film. I like Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave Tatum the same chance. I did not see him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just for his performance in this film, which unfortunately was a disappointment
