A tedious mix of puerile endeavors in humor with the romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this poorly made movie with any taste of reality. When the action begins, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters his apartment, discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who tells Reno: "Well, at least it's with someone you know," resulting in Reno's decision of never having another roommate. this decision told the viewers by means of a soon abandoned narration. The plot then proceeds ten months, where we find that Reno is actually true to his word about avoidance of roommates, although this seems to beg the question due to his conquest of a living lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with who he has matrimonial plans generated. The plot quickly changes to a Hollywood strip club, where Reno's Uncle Charley, enamored of a "dancer" he finds very desirable, sinks over the clubhouse bar after seeing the charms displayed by the object of his affection. It is evident that Charley was aware of the defective condition of his heart because he created a video tape during which his comment leaves his large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood for Reno, and we see the latter decide, unlike his Vow, interviewing the candidates for two roommates as tenants, with him and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner. Following a futile sequence involving bizarre tenant candidates, whom Reno and Holly, unsurprisingly, find it inappropriate to live with them in their homes, they, unknown to one another, choose a tenant of the opposite sex, with mistresses manifestly cold in relation to choice. of your partner. The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) seem to have little discernible sense for their existence, as well as highly aural fornication with a wide range of partners, and it does not take long for jealousy to ruin the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly. Reno is committed to patenting and marketing a type of sports travel bag, and as he gave an engagement ring to Holly, the potential success of this enterprising venture is of great financial importance if he intends to advance in his marriage plan. Unfortunately, the voracious team of Chad and Nicole, whose action is ostensibly tied to lust, will likely disrupt any future Reno marriage intent. The direction is slack, clearly far from satisfying the basic needs of the players, although a script of irregular composition provides sparse material with which the actors can work, and improvisation falls in an embarrassing way. As a result, the performances are undifferentiated, not aided by irregular editing, while the way of working with the camera changes as abruptly and frequently as the backlight of a firefly. Filmed with a low budget and on-site, only a minimum of skill is required for design processes, but a larger measure of value may have been put on the tasteless D.J. background soundtrack, usually strident and almost always invasive. A good deal of discussion was stimulated by the final sequences of the film, which are apparently not expected by a viewer based on what came before, but in reality they probably comprise the only portions of an ill-paved screenplay, and it's fair to do the work almost despite the poor quality of production as a whole.
