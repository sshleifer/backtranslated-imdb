I realized this at IFC last week and found it to be typical of the short film indie: heavy on style, little on substance and originality. Is it a surprise that an opening film starring an attractive boy (and blonde to kick) with messy hair from the 70's and really cool clothes for school? In addition, the film comes to the end of the 1970s, what works for some ("The Virgin Suicides" by Sofia Coppola comes to mind) but not for this director. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared this to the work of Harmony Korine and I accept. However, I do not see this as something positive (what has he done lately, anyway?). "Bobbycrush" is really just a waste of time and energy for everyone involved. If you happen to see late at night on the cable, turn on the channel and watch something else.
