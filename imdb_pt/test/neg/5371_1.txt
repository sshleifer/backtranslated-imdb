This show is absolutely ridiculous. Yes, of course it's fake. But it's agonizing to watch. I personally know minds influenced by more creative films that could "make" seem real. The young lead could not be more unconvincing. He reads everything he says. Should we really believe he knows what he's talking about? There are plenty of ways for Blair-Witch to appear. Fear does not procreate from what appears to be "legal" and computer generated. Nor does it generate proverbial lines like "What was that? Did you hear that?" In addition, there are convincing psychics who not only "want to be on the screen". Another DUH factor is ... how these producers think we're actually going to buy that paranormal activity that will magically happen in two or three days (if we're lucky) they'll film. I think not. A week of 2 or more on a website would be more compelling. It's also disarming that they think, including "NASA radar checks" and computers that show that guys really scare us. And IE: Exorcisms should not be staged like the movie "The Exorcist". When will they get it right? Possession of the Devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. They not only snarl and lower their voices like Linda Blair or fall in love with Courtney Love on a drug spree. As stated, better concentrations in "psychic ability" would greatly assist this spectacle. We want to see and hear EVERYTHING that is supposed to flash before them. Not cut out for other bs stories. On a final note, Shooting Stars does not generate interest when you showed fake UFO photos ahead of time. I can emphasize again that the young brunette who hosts this show is absolutely horrible. Avoid this show. To the scare: watch old episodes of the Mystery Not Solved ... not the new ones (the recapitulation understood everything wrong). But this is for a different blog.
