This movie had the potential to be a decent thriller, but it was hampered by only having about twenty minutes of good screenplay, which was mostly used in the beginning. After that, holes began to appear in the story that allowed the passage of a truck. The film followed a downward curve from good to bad, from bad to ridiculous by the time it was completed. Not recommended.
