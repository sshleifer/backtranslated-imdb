This is a very famous Ninja movie, but it is not a good movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some figures, you want to know a few things about Ninjas to see this movie. This movie is for ninja fans only and wants to make nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie are the best. You can only see Ninja figures and fight in these scenes. Among these are below average, almost as bad as a movie. Acting is bad. Sho (Black Ninja) is the best actor in this movie. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can not fight well. The scenery is not good either. It's so simple. Franko Nero approaches his best friend in the army and war. He also protects him from the mafia, but he is having sex (going to bed) with his wife and his friend knows this, but do not say anything to Nero negative. Is this possible in life? What a friendship! <br /> <br /> Finally this movie started a genre; Movies of ninja. There is also the ninja master Sho Kasugi, but some fighting scenes are not realistic or fast, even with the shoo. This movie is below average, even if it's a classic.
