Well, for each one of them, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the most horrible version I've ever seen-as subtly differentiated as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketer. The only reason I watched the movie until the end was that I hoped it would either improve or become unintentionally funny. No luck. <br /> <br /> No disrespect for Zefferelli's supporting cast or staging, but nothing can compensate for the spoiling of the main character. I saw Hamlet well portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rude warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. etc. But IMHO this picture was just an abundant lack of intelligence along with weaker hams.
