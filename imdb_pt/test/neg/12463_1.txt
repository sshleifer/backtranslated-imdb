I just wish I had the good sense to turn this movie off at the beginning when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead, I gave the benefit of the doubt and hoped it would improve. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake I made. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the film. The movie has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack, but can not. The lead is a girl who tries to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, she can not do that either. They are in love, though God knows why. And in the end I was hoping they'd all kill each other so I would not believe any of those kids would stain the world again.
