This movie was only two nights in a row on ITV1 .. dear oh dear. Someone actually bought it with the strength of Robert Carlylse .. OK, I missed the start .. but what I saw was so bad I thought, no ... I watched in shame for the stars that were in it. Nothing was based on reality, I doubt things would progress as they did in this movie. Everything was bad about this movie. OK, cgi .. but not the reality. The writing gave the impression of a cliff-hanger order .. I'm sorry, I was not impressed. Yes, stereotyped It was not possible to guess the end. From what I saw the military had the upper hand, people doing heroic things were given next to no time to do their things, just would not have happened that way? It was worse than leaving your brain at the door. It was annoying .. like someone said .. yeah, right .. of course it would have happened ... no !! The credits mentioned Quebec and Canada .. so it was a co-production, lost the third party concerned .. I will have to go back on this site. I'm not usually that critical, but it bothered me.
