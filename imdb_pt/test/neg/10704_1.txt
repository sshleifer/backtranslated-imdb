I do not think this can legally qualify as "movie". The plot was so fragile, the dialogue so shallow, and the lines so terrible that I could not believe that someone actually wrote the lines below, said: "Holy sh * t! This is a masterpiece" and then really released it to a producer. I, for one, am still stunned and will always remember this movie as the hallmark of America's degeneracy of intelligence - that, and "Crossroads," of course.
