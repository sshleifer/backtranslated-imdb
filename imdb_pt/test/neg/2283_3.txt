I bought a tape of this movie based on the recommendation of other IMDb users and I have to say that I was very disappointed. I am a university teacher and I showed this film to my class; they voted unanimously that it is a terrible movie. I think if you like the old Dark Shadows series, then maybe you'll like it. (I liked Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the '70s, but now I think it's awful.) The first half hour, at least, has the virtue of some fidelity to Wilde's novel. After that, the story deviates from the course, at least compared to the MGM version of 1945 (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is really the only thing watchable throughout the production. Many of the other performances are bad, the music is melodramatic and the film's look is terrible. In fact, it's not a film - it was obviously filmed on video and has a characteristically claustrophobic BBC. The opening scenes are particularly poorly lit, women's outfits are terrible (men look good), and many of the characters - including Dorian - look like 1970s rather than Victorian hairstyles. The film does well to include much of Wilde's dialogue, but the narration in Dorian's voice contains a lot of junk that directly contradicts Wilde's character. I am a big fan of Oscar Wilde, and I fear he has rolled violently into his grave when this monstrosity was made. His only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent without being heavy. I have not seen any of the newer versions, but if anyone is interested in seeing the story well told, I would have to recommend the MGV in black and white from 1945 on this one.
