Spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype of punks. This documentary is biased and guided, not objective. Cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview can be used to get the respondents' spoken word out of context. When you watch the movie, the idea that comes from interviews with punks is that they are very dumb. Band members and other punks seem to be low-key and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers. I doubt very much that if some of the interviewees knew what Spheeris was creating or the final product would be allowed to be included in the project. This film puts the punks in a bad light, making them seem unintelligent and simple. The Spheeris movie should not be taken as a representation of the punk scene L.A. If you want to see a good punk documentary watch "Another State of Mind" with Youth Brigade and Social Distortion.
