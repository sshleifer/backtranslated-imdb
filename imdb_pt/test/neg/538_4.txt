It is perfectly certain that people die in an animation, but there are too many deaths in this. Begin from the beginning, the story is all around battles, fights, death and revenge. It continues for an hour and a half. It was interesting at first, but I got really tired after the show was halfway there. Unlike other animations, this is a lack of humor. There are not too many interactions between the characters as well. The good thing about it is that the sword fighting scene looks really good and the characters look cool.
