Did you find the title funny? You did not? Well, that's because you're tense. Learn to laugh, because if you are not laughing, you will not be living. So please reduce your standards to what you believe to be funny to a mere child. Now do you think it's funny? Not yet ?! OK, this is because you are full of yourself and take offense very easily. If you're not laughing, you're not living. And if you do not like me, send me hate messages so I can write another review and tell you how much I get email and try to distort it, making it look like I'm an idiot. Are you laughing at my hilarious title? Not yet?!?! OK, that's it! You're a racist! You have to laugh or you are a racist. Why else would not you laugh? Oh, it's not funny! No, that can not be why. I want it to be funny, then it is !! Laugh damn it !!!! Please!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK, that's it. Where's my notebook and pen? And where is my Richard Pryor DVD? I need to write some jokes for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... dinner. Thank you thank you. <br /> <br /> It's basically what you get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please do yourself a favor and change channels when the program of this hobo appears. Even the basic cable channels have 100 times better things than that. I'm not even saying that because I hate him. I am serious. This show is like watching the grass grow. Not sure, at least the grass does not steal jokes. I am sincerely trying to save your time. I even tried to watch his show. I said to myself, "Maybe it's not that bad." But no, he is. I completely delete it when I watched his show. I tried to compose myself during the commercial break and focus on the program, but I could not. I zoned again, I think I was thinking of something more interesting, like redoing my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yeah, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> Here's my last thought - There are so many things you can do with 30 minutes, plus watch this guy scream for nothing for half an hour. Do not watch a program that tries to push racism on your face in vain. I can support shows that try to ease the tension of race wars, but this guy just provides more racism rather than stopping it.
