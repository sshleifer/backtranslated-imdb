I'm sorry, but I can not even agree with some comments on this horrible piece of sh ... <br /> <br /> English is not my native language, because I'm a German citizen, so please do not blame by inappropriate grammatical structures or something * gg I can not understand why this movie has such a high rating? 6.3 ??? Are you kidding me? This movie has no meaning, not even a good performance ... <br /> <br /> When I looked at the comments on The Da Vinci Code, which has - I think - almost the same rating, I had to hit my head on the table, because I watched Schneider 00 directly after Sakrileg, and oh my god, there are worlds between them. <br /> <br /> Most of the posters in this picture rip all the tabloid movies to pieces. while assessing this crime of making movies with a 6.3 and calls Helge as a genius. Sure, he knows how to make money, but I think the main point of his opinions is the fact that German is not his native language and you simply ignore - or rather do not realize how much crap is said in the phrases . OK, I must confess that some scenes are funny, but after all, a 6.3 is too much for my compatriot;)
