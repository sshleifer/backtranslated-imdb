Christophe Lambert once said that he was still making movies just to make easy and good money. When I see your latest releases, I can believe that. Beowulf is, in short, the "good" part of bad movies: there are some good scenes of emotion, in fact. The actors themselves are not so bad. But the plot is silly, the music like "Mortal Kombat" has nothing to do with it, the ending is really bad ... <br /> <br /> Actually, the only good thing about it is that I am my friends could laugh about how uninteresting it was. I even wish I had wasted my money on something else. <br /> <br />
