I was one of the many idiots who were sold out to pay for it at the theater, even though I paid $ 4 for matinee prices (before 6 pm). <br /> <br /> The story of the remake was ho-hum, the CGI Morlocks were lame, the Eloi were Rastafarian to imitate today's fashions (no, I did not think the girl was hot), girlfriend's killing The hero's modern era was somewhat cruel, usually just a sad and bad remake. <br /> <br /> I'll take Rod Taylor, Weena, and the bright-eyed surfer and morlocks about this junk at any time. My opinion is that many of the critics who like this horrible remake are small children, which explains neither the good taste nor the true value of the old classics, who are largely disregarded by the confused and always desirous young people of today. <br /> <br /> When the 60's version came out (I first saw it in the 70's for fun in the summer), it was very impressive and still holds. You do not need to have an abundance of CGI in a movie to make it better. Much of this seems false. I can not say enough about how disappointingly bad the Morlocks looked and they ran and jumped like they were in a kid's video game. 3 stars out of 10
