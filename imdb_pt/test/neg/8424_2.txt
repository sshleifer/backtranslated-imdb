Forget any documentary full of angst! This movie is actually a comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose aim in life is to sing addicted circuit party tunes. The only problem? Colton Ford can not sing! And the film cuts whenever it seems ready to explode into music. However, Ford and the equally insipid boyfriend Blake Harper lament and rush back and forth in their tops, determined to turn dreams into reality. Even more funny is "manager" Kyle, who seems to have the I.Q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips looked like a bee stung him. How grown men can be so self-delusional? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers do not seem to have any POVs and the film is poorly structured and wildly unequal. Very little background information is provided on the three leaders. Such inclusion could have made all three seem somewhat different from the aged stereotypes of West Hollywood.
