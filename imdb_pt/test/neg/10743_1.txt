I had enjoyed the Masters of the Horror Series until I found this pile of child dung. <br /> <br /> This piece of anti-Bush propaganda disguised as a horror movie comes out as an episode of the original Batman made by Michael Moore. Political satire must be clever, however, it draws a ten on the simplistic scale with all the style and credibility of a L. Ron Hubbard film. In its extravagant and foolish form, it accuses the Republicans of stealing elections, going to war for no reason at all, treating soldiers and women as mere guns. He even takes a hit on the second amendment and religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero when the president laughed with joy over how he orchestrated 9/11. <br /> <br /> I think the end should be the moment "we support our troops," but I think they would be more offended than satisfied with all the effort. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the Hollywood elites are sitting in their Malbu mansions patting each other for this "energetic" work while uninformed anti-war drones call it genius. <br /> <br /> Time to adapt to new children with aluminum foil hats.
