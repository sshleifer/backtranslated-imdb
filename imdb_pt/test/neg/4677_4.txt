Archive this one in "How are movies made like this?" column. An indie version of Macbeth, style 70, adapted faithfully (but without purpose) in a conventionally conventional style of black comics. The cast gives a chance, with Christopher Walken calling eccentricity like McDuff, and with Maura Tierney rising above the insipid script as Pat McBeth. The other actors are wasted, as is the time of the audience. Knee adepts of this brand of whimsy may like it, however. 4 out of 10.
