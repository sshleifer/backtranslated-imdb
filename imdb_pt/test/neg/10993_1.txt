One of the worst movies I've seen in 2009 so far: The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a stupid comedy. <br /> <br /> As nothing happens, the void is filled with long and boring dialogues that do not happen. makes some sense! <br /> <br /> The cast is famous, but it brings no emotions but to advance the piece quickly! <br /> <br /> And this happens in a luxury seaside hotel that looks really dingy. In comparison, the "Shining" is amusement park! <br /> <br /> NB: many users find it's located on the French Riviera! They are wrong! It is not the South of France (Nice, Cannes), but quite the opposite: Cabourg and Normandy, to be simple D-Day beaches! That is why the sea is as gray as the sky and there is no sun!
