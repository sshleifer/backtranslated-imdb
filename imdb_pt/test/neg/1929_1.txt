Dear Mr. Seitzman, or whoever I am responsible for Mr. Seitzman does not find his legitimate fate to be eaten by grumpy Wolverines; <br /> <br /> I do not know you and therefore I can not comment on your character; as far as I know, you give to charity and help old ladies cross the street. Still, I must insist, for the common good, that you never write another script as long as you live. Put your pen down, get away from the laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to pay attention to the begging of injured brains, I have watched a movie or two in my life, and I believe you will find my advice useful: Do not include love scenes in which exaggerated teenagers name parts of their girlfriends' bodies after the United States. If you must write a scene like this, please do not name the breasts "New York" and "New Jersey"; causes unnecessary speculation about which cities occupy the nipples. Besides, it's almost incomprehensibly stupid and annoying. <br /> <br /> 2. Do not just rely on John Hughes movies to reinforce class distinctions. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not hit the audience over your head with exhausted cliches. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain, and that clears them of their worries. We understand. Yes, the roses continue to bloom in the greenhouse of Kelley's dead mother, though all the other plants have begun to rot. It is a symbol of their love. It is also very painful when applied by blunt trauma to the back of our heads. For God's sake, Mr. Seitzman, we understand. We all understand, all over the land. Amish people, the hard to hear, babies in gestation - we all get it. <br /> <br /> 4. Do not require actors to perform mime sequences. Ever. No, never. <br /> <br /> 5. Did I mention that you should relieve the banal symbolism? Because the public can trace the parallel between rebuilding the restaurant and building the relationship between Kelley and Sam without any help. Truly. We understand that. <br /> <br /> 6. Go through your script and select the following lines, and any lines that resemble them: "I do not know what we are anymore." "I do not want to lose you." "He's like the rest of them!" (And your corollary, "Daddy, you do not even know him!") 7. Yes, yes, she's in heaven, running in a field. We understand that. <br /> <br /> 8. And in other news, we understand. <br /> <br /> I've seen dozens of terrible movies in my life; I never expected to suffer for his art, and I would have just left the theater, but an elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" painted sideways fell from the sky and held me to my place. <br /> <br /> To close, your writing gets in the way, you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
