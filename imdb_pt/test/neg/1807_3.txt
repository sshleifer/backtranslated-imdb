Review of the film Heart of Darkness A book that is well known for its eloquent words and complicated concepts can be turned into a movie good enough to portray the deep meaning of the book? So far, this goal has not been achieved. The Heart of Darkness was tempted to be turned into a movie in 1993, but it was a flop compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It's hard enough to turn any book into a movie. There is always concern that it is not so descriptive or meaningful. So why the novel, The Heart of Darkness, is turned into a movie, I have no idea. There is much description and hidden meaning throughout the book. When I just read the words clearly, I think a person would think it was too boring and would not get the symbolism. I think that's what happened in the movie; the film just read the story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The film did not follow the full storyline of the book, big changes were made that I thought would make the movie worse. For example, the manager was not together on the boat with Marlow and the rest of the crew, the spy instead. I think he took some important conspiracies and got the manager's big disappointment about Kurtz. Besides, Kurtz was not even on the steamboat when he died, which made the journey even more futile, which only became annoying after a while. And when Marlow told Kurtz's fiancée about his last moments and words, it was by no means descriptive or important, the bride did not even bother. <br /> <br /> As for the acting, none of the actors did a very good job, except for the actor who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz was not too bad, and that was an important thing in the book. In addition, other characters like Marlow, the manager and the fiancé did not do justice to the characters they deserved from the book. His acting was not very exciting or memorable at all. Overall, I do not think this book should have been tried to turn into a movie. I think it's good to use some of the themes in a different story, as in Apocalypse Now. But to follow the same exact story line as the book, it's just embarrassing.
