I must admit I liked the previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and dumb at the time. I was kind of thrilled with the return of the family guy until I saw the "new" crap they were throwing. No surprise, it was just like the old crap. All the idiot jokes were there, including the flash backs, but this time they added a joke about an old scary pedophile who seems to be in ALL THE LAST EPISODES. this is just one of the boring guys the guy in the family lives on, and for some reason people keep watching. not funny, it's just annoying. let it die. <br /> <br /> Maybe the family guy was funny at some point, and the cheap laughs and gags were original and new, but now it's no funnier. If you really find a funny family guy, you should be retarded or retarded.
