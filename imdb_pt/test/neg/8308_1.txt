I watched DEATH MACHINES as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics' (with releases from Crown International Pictures) on DVD. While working on my multiple sets of DVDs, I'm loving many of Crown International's films - especially the scary, erotic and psychological thrillers! <br /> <br /> DEATH MACHINES is not one of them. <br /> <br /> After seeing movies like MALIBU BEACH, THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS, it's hard to say that this is the worst movie. always done; but it does not have much to do with it. <br /> <br /> No plot; really no story to speak of. <br /> <br /> Is not the performance evident? only the actor responsible for Tony, who was terribly played (with the fake Italian false accent), made any attempt to "get into character." <br /> <br /> The result is annoying and pedantic. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is why ... what forced the filmmakers to make this movie? <br /> <br /> They thought the story of: 1) three ninjas, 2) two competing crime bosses, 3) a bartender / karate school student character; and 4) was his pitiful love-interest nurse so compelling that the world would not be complete without this film being made? <br /> <br /> It is a waste of time and money for you, me, the producers, writers, actors and the director.
