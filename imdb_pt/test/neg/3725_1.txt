I want the 99 minutes of my life back that were wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrible! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I'll never look at them the same way again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd came as no surprise. Everyone knows they could never act. Fortunately, only Dan tried an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was confused about the location of the movie or had never actually spoken to someone from Minnesota. I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to watch the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere with nothing better to watch or read.
