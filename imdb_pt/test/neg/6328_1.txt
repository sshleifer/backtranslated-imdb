I got this movie on TV late at night. Honestly I saw most, and all the time I was sitting in complete and utter disbelief. <br /> <br /> Is there a genre that is more useless than soft-core porn? If there is, I do not want to know that. Softcore pornography combines all the horrors of pornography (terrible production values, disgusting acting, shit scripts) with the timidity of the sex scenes in ordinary movies. So the end result is exciting and not even fun. This movie also takes the rather strange approach to a science fiction scenario, and it works horribly. All sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality scenario, where the team of the future learns about physical love. And yes, it's as confusing and silly as it sounds. <br /> <br /> But there have to be some good points, right? Well, there's a ... Krista Allen is incredibly hot. This is about the only thing that was less than horrible in this movie. I do not know what it is about her, but she has an incredible sex appeal. The rest of the cast looks like the porn-cast standard. Unattractive women with ill-made fake breasts and men who spent a lot of time in the gym turning up grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany, judging by the haircuts and clothes. <br /> <br /> To summarize things. If you enjoy the presence of Krista Allens on the screen, you can watch it in the brief moments in which it shows a little of its seductive potential (most of the time, it tries to articulate bad lines of dialogue). If you do not like Krista Allen, then you can also stay away. <br /> <br /> I consider it 10/10 for the sex appeal of Krista Allens, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value. since this is a crappy porn / science fiction hybrid that really is not like anything I've ever seen.
