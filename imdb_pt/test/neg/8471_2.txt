I watched this cooking show a couple of times before I wanted to tear my hair out. Just one question ... Who CAN NOT prepare a simple meal in 30 minutes when all you need is at hand, already bagged, sometimes pre-cut and you have very little to do other than cut some vegetables. In addition, almost all cooking shows on TV are 30 minutes away and most of these chefs do all the prep work (except for Sandra Lee) during the show. Oh and yes .... they do full meals too. <br /> <br /> Love the comment from the guy who hated the "EVOO" comment. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of stupid tag words. <br /> <br /> So you have the obvious ... a tall, gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience. She laughs at her own lame comments, mugs often to the camera because she wants to convince us that she is as good as she thinks. <br /> <br /> NO, she's not the "cutest thing". She is a 40-something woman who is not DE-LISH.
