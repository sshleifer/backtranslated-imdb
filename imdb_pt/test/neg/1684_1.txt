This is probably the most annoying show I have ever seen in my entire life. It's indescribably the most annoying and dumb show I've ever seen. All about it is just plain bad. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A different situation comes every week for parents to deal with their children. <br /> <br /> I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several seasons. The script is bad, really bad ?? It contains both joke and unethical joke that you normally see in the movie R or NC-17. Especially for the young boy, in whom all he does is give pleasure to himself, is this what is called family humor? The cast is also horrible because all you see is really a BAT Realtors, period. <br /> <br /> Final Word: This show is a real torture !! This program provides an image of how the irresponsible parent can be (using wrong power instead of understanding). It's zillion times away from reality. Listen to Kenny G would be a god send compare to that. Watching the washing machine spinning around would not hurt your eyes as much as this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 Note: the show is so bad that even the cast's mother pulls her daughter out of the show.
