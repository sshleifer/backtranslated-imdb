Simply put this movie is without any substance. Just take my word for it and save you the time it is a complete DUD !! I would say the characters are one-dimensional, but that would imply that there was some kind of character development. I thought Eric Roberts would jump at any moment that was so close to B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> The girl of the 70's is beautiful ... but unless you're a fan of her pursuer, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid .. Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie went straight to DVD for a reason ... that being ... it's a train accident !!!
