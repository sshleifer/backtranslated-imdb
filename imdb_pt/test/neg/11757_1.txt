Yes, why? Among the filmmakers who emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, some. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, irritating sometimes, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. The "Psycho" of Van Sant, however, gives me a break. Because? I wonder. One shot per shot massacre of one of the classic perennials. The color was shocking, the performances were atrocious. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A sick joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who wore it? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is an excellent actor, but in this case he could not make us forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this performance, there would have been "The Hours" for her, "The Minutes" perhaps. So here I am, speaking ill of the work of one of my idols. The question remains: Why, Mr. Van Sant? Maybe, in President Clinton's words, because he could. I'm afraid this is no excuse.
