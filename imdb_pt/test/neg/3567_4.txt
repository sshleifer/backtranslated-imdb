Would a different translation make it colder or scary? Are captions too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? Does it even matter? You may have heard that great actors can make reading an exciting phone book. Well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. <br /> <br /> If this is not about homosexuality, murder, break up, psychopaths, insanity, deviant psychology, then it's about acting - acting helped with a lot of dialogue, so enjoy the acting or muse about how exciting the dialogue is really. <br /> <br /> For English speakers, "Twelve Men with Anger" may be a better choice. There is a bit more interaction and you can judge whether the acting is consistent with the dialogue. You do not have to wonder if you're missing something. <br /> <br /> I would recommend Andy Warhol's "Empire" to those who like this movie.
