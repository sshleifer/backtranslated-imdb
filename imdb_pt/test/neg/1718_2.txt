Tycus is one of the worst direct movies for video films that I see at all times. <br /> <br /> I'm not amazing that this product does not appear in the cinema.Bad Visual Effects (The beginning is terrible) Bad actors (I do not understand why they appear in this movie the great Dennis Hopper) and Poor screen Nonsense . My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. SENTENCE TO TYCUS: Do not watch this movie.
