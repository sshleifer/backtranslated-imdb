Taking this along with the rest of the Marx Brothers' box set, I was disappointed in almost everything besides A Night at the Opera. This stinker is prolly the worst I've seen so far, with the smart lines left out and the characterization is unfortunate. The playwright is so obscenely stupid in this game that it's hard not to attack the television and try to strangle him. As it is, the Marxes seem to do better when outsiders are brought in to wreak havoc, and are much better off when they have a good gag or two, at least. The material here is obviously written to anyone, and it really wastes Marx's talent. Avoid. Rating: 3/10
