This movie is # 1 on the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, with "Lessons for a Killer" in second place. <br /> <br /> The acting is lousy (sorry, Sandra Bullock, but even her the performance was horrible!), the soundtrack could have come from a bad movie and the story was ridiculous. It had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mostly of one-syllable words. But unlike the ordinary action movie, there was no real action in this movie. Bored <br /> <br /> The only reason I continued to watch was in the hope that at one point there was at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this one .
