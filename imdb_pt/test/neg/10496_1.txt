I watched this as part of a marathon of vampire movies with research intent, otherwise I would not have been able to watch it all the time. The first scene in which a bunch of vampires in very bad wigs are apparently electrocuted by several slow guns wielded by an aspiring Van Helsing even slower ... in black and white ... with a loud voice, sets the pace for the the rest of the film. The fight scenes look ridiculous, the dialogue would be funny if the acting was not so bad, what goes through the plot does not make sense, and the production values ​​bite (from the pen overturning Spike's coat worn by the hero up to A of cheap magician that his vampire leader does around). <br /> <br /> I've seen some bad movies (check out The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone, or the Raven with a very young Jack N.), but this is my worst vote of all time.
