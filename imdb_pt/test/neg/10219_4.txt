By Randolph Scott standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointing star and heavy-handed western. Two or three of the characters could be dismissed, while two or three other characters could get more prominence. (The humor must be completely rewritten.) De Toth deals well with the action - as always - but his understanding of the general narrative is weak.
