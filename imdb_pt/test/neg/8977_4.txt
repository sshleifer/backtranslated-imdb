Deep Sea 3D is an incredible insight into an underwater world that few have had the opportunity to see firsthand. From the opening sequence, as a wave approaches the audience that momentarily surrounds us in the ocean, the filmmakers make full use of the IMAX format. A field of jellyfish seems to fill the whole theater, a shark approaches us, predators attack behind rocks and devour their prey. It is beautifully captured under the sea feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Our ears, on the other hand, do not receive the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sound so ridiculous that it spoils positively the pleasure of the visuals. Depp sounds a little bored while Winslet sounds like she's reading a bedtime story for the village idiot. I was shocked that an actress of her status could have thrown her performance so wrong. The script is rather silly and contains little depth. The soundtrack is full of strange and unrealistic sound effects, which I presume to be funny, but actually distract from the material that should have been allowed to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman provided an excellent score that gives a lot of impact to the ups and downs of seafloor life when it is allowed to play without the bubbling bubbling sounds or crawling crawfish strokes. <br /> <br /> The film is a technical marvel, but with its children's script, annoying narration and sound effects out of place, it can not be taken seriously.
