Lead director Dutcher revels in this look-at-me film in which he attempts to gain worldwide acceptance for tarnishing the otherwise optimistic Mormon world of missionaries. Some of the performances are fair. But some roles are unrealistic, that is, the sinister (and not paternal) President of the Mission etc. The film takes a good look at how some missionaries might struggle with their faith, but the missionary program he claims is far from his concept of it, in terms of being optimistic, cohesive and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this film is the Dutchman's self-inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the filming and screenplay look like a college student project.
