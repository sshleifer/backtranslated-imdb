Like almost everyone, I noticed this turkey in the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It is easily classified as one of my favorite episodes of MST3K of all time. I really could not imagine trying to watch this movie on my own ......... it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe stars as Actor, an aspiring talented FÃ¡bio who lives in the age of the cavemen. We, the viewer, are asked to suspend our disbelief as he knows alchemy and chemistry and manages to build a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes. Okay, right! There is also a very attractive actress (can not remember her name) who wears a hub-cap as a breast shield. Oh, and I can not forget the crazy Asian side Thong. He had the easiest role in the film since he did not utter a word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without speaking ..... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The movie is not viewable anyway and should only be viewed in the proper MST3K format. . If you watch this version, you'll laugh silly! <br /> <br /> "I'm huge !!!!" Rating: 0
