Ed Wood, perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time, has left us so ill, they delight in being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent. James Lay and his financial backers (Mom and Dad, it looks like the credits) created in Dreamland a film as badly done as any of Ed Wood's films, but without any charm or innocence. Dreamland simply stinks, and about the only good thing about this 90-minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that James Lay and his co-workers will never make another picture. <br /> <br /> I must mention some of the dramatic lengths that some crew have taken to avoid being associated with this awful image. I'm sure the production controller, once seeing the complete film, demanded that his name be changed in the credits for 'Donna Snartlebutt' and the bookkeeping by 'Brutus'. One can imagine "Brutus" with his roll of $ 5 bills paying the crew at the end of a day of filming. <br /> <br /> I will not mention the many technical issues with this pathetic little video, but I must mention a few comments that compare this scum with the work of David Lynch. You know you became a real stench when your mom joins the IMDb and publishes such an amazing BS - no one, save for violent mental patients, could ever confuse Lynch's "dreamland" with anything. What a horrible insult against Mr. Lynch and his work. <br /> <br /> Go back to the film school, Mr. Lay.
