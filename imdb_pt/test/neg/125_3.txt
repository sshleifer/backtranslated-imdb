It's a totally mid-length movie with some semi-positive action sequences that make the plot look a bit better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam movies. parts of the plot make no sense and appear to be added to use the time. the final plot is of a very basic type that does not leave the viewer guessing and any twists and turns are obvious from the start. the final scene with the flask backs does not make sense as they are added and appear to have little relevance to the van's character story. It really is not worth watching again, a bit disappointed in the final production, even if it is evident that it was filmed on a low budget, certain videos and sections of the film are of poor quality directed
