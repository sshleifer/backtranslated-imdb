Reading the comments of other reviewers, the review of A666333 articulated most of what I've felt throughout this film - predictable plot, clich√©d versions of lesbians / heterosexuals (eg heterosexual woman becomes lesbian and concludes that her husband is aggressive and abusive). <br /> <br /> In addition, the score was extremely disappointing. It was soft, gentle, sentimental elevator music - another cliche common in lesbian movies. The film would have had some interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music. Some scenes about sex and eroticism also seemed to me attempts to excite and increase shock value, including parts of the final scene of performance. The conventional moments "hot and steamy" were as boring as the overly sentimental score. For example, during the pool scene, women are kissing and then the camera slides along the glass of abandoned wine, the water flowing, the sound of their heavy breathing on the soft noise of the waves. <br /> <br /> The elements I liked were the costumes and the bows. They are well choreographed and the development of the attraction between the two characters seemed very natural during the training scenes. I honestly smiled during those, and during the last scene with the police officer. But they were not enough to balance the negatives or make me enjoy this movie.
