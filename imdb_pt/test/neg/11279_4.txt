For a film made in Senegal, based on Carmem, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film bears no resemblance to the story that became famous as an opera and other films. <Br/> <br /> Ms. Gai as the title Karmen is very good to look at. His fiery dancing burns the screen, as is the case with his torrid love scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a Karmen that aims to please all sexes, but a real Carmen, she is No! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Ms. Gai in other films where her talent is better worn than here.
