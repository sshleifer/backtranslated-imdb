I tend to look for good movies, even the bad ones. Unfortunately, this movie is one that fails miserably - and the fact that there is only a positive critique of this picture shows that many critics of IMDb share my pain. <br /> <br /> I do not usually watch sequels, but I just had to watch it since I love "Baby Rosemary" so much. What a mistake that was! This simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most of the sequels are lousy - though fortunately few are as bad as that. In fact, in my mind, this is not even really a sequence, it's a satire about how bad a sequence can be. The film is highly recommended not to see at any time.
