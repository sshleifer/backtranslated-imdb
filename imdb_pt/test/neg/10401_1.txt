Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all time. He may have made more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, your first try was bad. <br /> <br /> Kubrick had good reason to try to make the film disappear from the map: it looks like a movie by Ed Wood. It has weird narration, cheap shots, bad dialogues, sinister songs reminiscent of his horror and science fiction from the 1950s, and what seems to be relatives of the cast of "Reefer Madness" going mad for no reason at all. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can see an underdeveloped Kubrick there. It is a psychological / horror study of war. The characters became dehumanized and insane. There are people playing more than one role. There are pictures on the faces and specific facial expressions of different people. And there are some interesting photos there. But really, this is a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not discouraging you from watching. If you can, you are joining a select group of people and thousands of people around the world who have had access to it.
