Watching this movie and listening to the comment, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this piece. The first clue that he can not fully understand the work is that he struggles to put the film in seventeenth-century Venice. Which sounds really strange, yes, that misunderstanding the movie would mean trying to make it as accurate as possible to its location. But those who have studied Shakespeare know that while he puts most of his plays in exotic locations, culture and values ​​are always contemporary in England. This does not detract from the film, but shows a lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford kills the movie, he's getting so serious. He succeeds in sucking all the jokes out of the script, leaving all production flat. Each drop of passion is eliminated from the characters. Even Shylock's speech, "We Do not Bleed," is a light and awkward speech of a choleric who seems to be just saying and doing what he does because he should. The lovers are solemn and contained too (Joseph Fiennes offers some of the most romantic phrases of cinema this year in an almost inaudible whisper), Gratiano (who has to promise to behave at one point) is more sober and collected than Bassiano (who does with which he promises to behave), Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with Lorenzo pouting. <br /> <br /> In commenting on the mild and diluted court scene, the director expresses his shock that an audience laughed at Portia's phrase: 'A pound of flesh, no more and no less'; ultimately concluding that he had to strain the release laughter. "The Merchant of Venice" is a comedy and Radford mocks the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of the story are just the most daringly provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film has no intelligible focus, but cuts through some of the funniest scenes. The characters are forced to high drama veils, so they come out sounding like Ibsen characters reading Victorian poetry. And the comic ending, where all the good guys go to bed happy, is drowned in a dignified despair that seems like they are finding a tough peace with impending death instead of reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio leave the film holding their hats as aristocratic mourners. <br /> <br /> The film is poorly done because the creative powers that are do not understand the script. It's severe where it should be hysterical. It's reserved where you should be in love. It's Michael Radford, where William Shakespeare was supposed to be.
