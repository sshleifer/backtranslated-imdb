Connery climbs aboard the buffoon train Moore in this stink of a movie. Throwing out everything that made Bond successful in the first place, this movie further degrades the Bond character by playing it in the Inspector Gadget category. Be smart, is not it. There is no style here, only second-rate actors acting on cheap sets. It's a shame that Connery could not lend an element of class here, but that does not happen. Everything here smacks of mediocrity, including Connery's bad wig. Maybe if I had snowed and given the choice between watching "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck" I would choose the first. If you want the real James Bond, get any romance from Ian Flemming.
