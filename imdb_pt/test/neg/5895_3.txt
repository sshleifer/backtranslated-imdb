Am I the only one who thought the purpose of this film was graphic violence? I did not know anything about Leigh Scott when I rented him, and I would not have done it if I knew that most of his earlier films were horror movies. I'm not into this, I was just waiting for an informational documentary from the September 11 report. <br /> <br /> Instead, I had an almost incomprehensible and violent movie. The only good thing about it for me was that it made me want to read the report, to find out what the heck this movie was about. <br /> <br /> I wrote this because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in movies and on TV that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews I read.
