I turned it off for the first five minutes. It is very sick and disturbing, the moment I turned it off that was when the beautiful white horse was left in the slaughterhouse and his skull was pierced by a small instrument. This creature lay on the ground in shock before it died. The narrator said that the animal dies instantly, that did not happen. I do not agree with graphic realism regarding animals, insects or any living creature. I was very disappointed as I had just watched 'Eyes Without a Face', which was a brilliant film and this short film was attached, which spoiled my night - how could I not hurt a fly, no matter watching this wild documentary . reading other comments on this page, I had noticed that they used words like aesthetics - this is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound, but not aesthetic.
