A group of people goes deep into the jungle for various reasons, and finally finds a lost city (where apparently they are King Solomon's Diamonds) and a super-gorilla race ... Now, you know you're in trouble when you put well actors like Linney and Curry in a movie starring ... a talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Okay, what else ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie is ... well, missing just that. The first hour (!) Of the movie they are not even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with subplots after subplots (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do it ... it's just not anymore funny. <br /> <br /> The effects of the film are just so-and-so (and very bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now the end .. The father is not looking after the death of his son, but only interested in the diamonds? Uh-huh ... just movie people, only movies. <br /> <br /> A complete waste of talent, this adaptation of Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10
