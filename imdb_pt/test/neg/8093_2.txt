Highly flawed, but almost watchable "comedy" that runs like the Farrelly brothers reject. The most criminal thing about this is the cast. I could not for a minute believe in Jerry O'Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstuds, who could lure any woman to the edge of a hat, nor could I believe (the very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a tough tough cop! The story is predictable, but it manages to giggle on a few occasions, though the 'coarse' scene, meant to be a 'comic shock' (one involving an amputated testicle and another placed on a sperm bank) is simply simple. horrible. If this movie is on TV then it is worth watching if you are extremely bored, but please do not waste your money by renting it !!
