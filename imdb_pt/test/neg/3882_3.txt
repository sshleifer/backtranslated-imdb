I was marveling at the movie looking at the promos and went to see it FDFS The movie was horrible to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they go to London things are funny but slowly the <br /> <br /> The subplot of Manoj Joshi is funny in places, but it is not wanted and it increases boredom <br /> <br /> The drug part is funny , especially the monologue of Govinda <br /> <br /> The film goes aimlessly just like a small child wrote <br /> <br /> The break brings a twist in the story, but then I lost hope <br />> <br /> The second half starts well, but the way things are treated makes a mockery. Arbaaz-Jackie's angle is half-cooked. How come people do not identify them? <br /> <br /> The climax is quite funny though stupid Priyadarshan is not at all in its elements, from this movie, he started to make excrement and his movies got bad and bad The music is good, SIGN, TERE BIN stand out and also AFFIRMS the work of the camera I s good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has white in his beard to make and looks old but he acts well despite the role he has often done thanks to his comedy by acting with things that seem bearable. Govinda seems out of shape, bad and his act except the monologue is too annoying Govinda seems too much pressure on him to return and Priyan can not use it Paresh is well in parts but in general only repeat act Manoj Joshi is funny in places Sharat Saxena is fine Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff seems to be overweight and acts in her sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad Lara Dutta screams for glory but can not act
