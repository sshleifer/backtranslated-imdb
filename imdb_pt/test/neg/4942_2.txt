For a thriller to eliminate fear, suspense or any emotion, the story must be believable. There is nothing believable or realistic about this movie. The protagonists have several opportunities to escape or turn the tables, but they manage to ruin everything. The antagonists who supposedly planned this and customized their transport specifically to arrest people for sure left many makeshift weapons out there. There is actually a scene where the "smart" girl has a gun on the bad guy's head and decides to scold him instead of pulling the trigger. This was a completely predictable and brainless thriller. Each character was one-dimensional. The "victims" were the usual, brainless sheep that deserved to be slaughtered. Is there anyone on this planet capable of writing an intelligent thriller?
