The only reason I rated this movie as 2 is because Channing Tatumis is handsome, but the whole movie lacks emotion and was annoying to watch. Usually I love a good novel, but this was just a waste of time, I did not shed a tear, although it contained sad content that simply was not acted very well at all. I'm not movie critic, but I just advise girls to avoid it, unless the only reason you're watching is to see Channing Tatum lol the rest of the movie is bullshit and if he was not in it (not that his acting was good) I would have stopped watching so much faster. It's a shame, because if the right actors were chosen for this movie, it could have the potential to be a real loom. .. If you are looking for a good cry or a movie for a feminine night in ... give a present to this fault !!
