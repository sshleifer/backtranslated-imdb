ABC prepares its repertoire company for another unrealistic representation of rural Australia. Fire hero, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend), a prostitute in the city, pregnant with Baca Joe's brother (I think it's all good), Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, ). Then there's Uncle Geoff, the Big Daddy of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams at speed. Only the saving grace is the Russian actress Natalia Novikova as the crazy boss of Baca. She's great. I can not understand why John Waters took the role of Lilly's husband psychologist. Must have needed the money I expected! Still, it will not last long, since Lill and Baca will be wearing it. Just watch this lemon to see how an Australian show can be bad. Frankly, I'm ashamed.
