This movie was horrible and the only reason it was made was because the story appealed to the far left. I consider myself moderate, so I could see this movie as the pile of crap that it was. Although I'm not a fan of Bush, his dislike for GW is not enough reason to see this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the film was filmed in a low quality movie that looks cheap instead of artistic. In addition, the characters are seriously devoid of depth. Chris Cooper's character was a poor parody of George Bush; more suitable for Saturday Night Live, then a dramatic film. The rest of the characters are walking cliches and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better films. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
