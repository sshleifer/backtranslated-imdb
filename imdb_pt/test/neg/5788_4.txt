Someone commented that Charlie Sheen's character should be a court martial to do whatever he wanted. You may be right, but that's how SEAL really is. I served for several months with a SEAL team from Norfolk, VA. In fact, I must say that they used our ship to position themselves in Europe for a few months. I was the mail clerk on board and every day these guys tried to get their mail. Since only one person could pick up the mail every day, we would issue a ticket for one person. Each day a different SEAL appeared pretending to be someone else. Well, after the third time I said no to them until I had proof of who they were. They were NUTS !!! I thought they were going to bust my cage, gag me and steal the mail. Luckily, I not only had the president by my side (the Navy), but also the federal government (the American mail). That was the only time I saw the SEALs stop having what they wanted. They were allowed to leave the shore unlimited, where we had to get back on the ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France and the two SEALs only got a 1-week detention on the ship while a Mariner was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and he got a court-martial. Is it any wonder why the SEAL retention rate is above 85%? As a SEAL you are God. So this film does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a SEAL acts and thinks ... unfortunately it's so unbelievable to normal people that it seems fake.
