I was in the second year of college when this movie came out and I had never seen it until last night. I finally decided to watch it because I like to dance well and because the film had so much cultural impact. After watching the movie, I'm completely stumped by how it had another effect besides putting people to sleep. <br /> <br /> History is absurd when you think about it. Does anyone really buy into the idea that this brewery full of old, headstrong steelworkers and keepers could keep their clientele with the high conceptual dances that those girls were doing? They would all have gone to Zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art." Can you imagine the reaction from the real-life versions of that audience to that bizarre TV watching the theater dance thing she did? Please. It seems plausible to me that there might be a woman working on a steel patio and also a dancer - after all, both are physically demanding jobs. But I did not buy for a second that this girl worked in a steel patio. And I did not buy for a second that I was looking at a real steel patio. Steel work is dangerous. You do not keep your workspace looking like a garbage bin and you do not end up losing a member. I love some of the empty shots, like when two welders are sitting on the welding of large corrugated pipes. What the hell are they doing there? Or when she's cutting six inches of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. She was obviously directing and just started cutting random things. <br /> <br /> But such story holes can be neglected if the movie is fun or at least exhilarating in some way. Flashdance offers nothing to balance this, though. <br /> <br /> The horrible dance. It's the spasmodic style of pose that ruined American musicals until ... well, are we really outdone? The sensuality that the film seeks is ruined by Jennifer Beal's complete lack of personality. I mean, I'm a 42-year-old man and when she should be eating lobster, my only reaction was to think she should get a lobster bib. <br /> <br /> You can not really get behind Alex and her dreams because your character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more things than her. <br /> <br /> The love affair is flat. He appears as nothing more than a horny boss by one of his workers. Zero passion. <br /> <br /> Even the final scene in which she dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other guys is unsatisfactory because the reaction of the panels is unbelievable. What serious dancers would not turn their eyes to Alex's cheerleading routine? In short, the film had nothing but leg warmers and large sweatshirts. Oh yeah, there's a good bit of nudity when Alex "rescues" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a little risible of hypocrisy). Other than that, the movie is a waste of time. I wish the MST3K team was still in business. That would be good for them.
