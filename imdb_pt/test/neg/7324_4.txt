I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie was not good at all. There was no nice character in the picture, and the plot was almost nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Ms. Masterson is a great actress, but she just could not get the character "tough girl". (She had similar problems with her character on SECOND CHRISTMAS DAY.) Maybe she should prevent these characters, especially those with a nasty female child, from having fun. <br /> <br /> Evan Rachel Wood was not impressed. Her character was a simple, simple brat, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> In the interest of full disclosure, I could not even finish watching this photo. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.
