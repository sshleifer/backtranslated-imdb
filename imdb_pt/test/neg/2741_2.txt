I'm a very tolerable guy when it comes to movies, even B movies. I usually watch some B movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good to simply terrible. I usually set my expectations very low before watching these types of movies, and even after doing that, the Descent was just awful. I did not really care that they were stealing the Core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. Some scientists are concerned about Earth's seismic activity and must travel to the depths of the Earth in order to stabilize the mantle. So what we have is a monotonous and long montage, in which two dueling scientists played by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts have to work together on a secret mission called Project DEEP. The man in charge, General Fielding played by Michael Dorn, is secretly withholding vital information from assistant Marsha Crawford, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Completing the cast is Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a missile expert who created the "Mole", a drill that is used to plunge into the depths of the Earth. <br /> <br /> In addition to some good special effects, and scenography, nothing about Descent is worth it. The film starts off a lot of fun, but it boggles quickly into a grueling story about uncontrollable seismic activity that was made to death in other films like Core. The descent also has a bad script, with useless and forgettable dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. Attempts of comic relief are painfully bland. The plot has holes and some of the subplots are left loose at the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> To end this movie was just an inexpensive way for everyone involved to get a paycheck. There was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. In addition to some beautiful special effects and scenery projects, this film fails on all other levels. The story is from the Hollywood trash can, and the characters are uninteresting. The descent will simply lead to boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
