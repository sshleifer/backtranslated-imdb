This movie sucks. There is not much else in that. The final fight looked like Walker facing my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. I found the commercials more interesting. The twists and turns of the plot could be seen a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this movie was that it was over. Avoid this at all costs ... unless you like bad Chuck Norris movies.
