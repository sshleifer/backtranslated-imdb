I'm glad I never attended this show when he left. <br /> <br /> I just wondered why it lasted 4 years. It reminds me of the terrible '80s with fake people, fake clothes and fake music. How did I survive growing up at this time? <br /> <br /> The acting in most episodes that I watched is forced. This makes very boring shows. The plot lines are not very interesting, as the old Twilight Zone shows. The old show inspired the imagination and made one look forward to the next show. <br /> <br /> Stay with the old Twilight Zone shows and spare yourself the pain of seeing the trash.
