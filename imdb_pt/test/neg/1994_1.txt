I just saw this old, stinking boiler on the TV. Best viewed with a very large jar of Dr Jurd's Juice Juice, this exploratory cheese feast is hilariously bad. On the plus side (very skinny), Raquel was in her physical height, she looks good, and you can see a good part of her, since she plays a go-go dancer; she had great legs, to be sure. There is also a small interest for screen fans in the Los Angeles ca. 1969, and to identify actors in small parts who have dedicated themselves to better things. Veteran Ron Rifkin ("Brothers and Sisters") makes an initial presentation as "Sailor", the bartender "queer addict", who takes Raquel to the bad guy. You can also recognize the armed security guard on the run-and-run scene - it's a very early appearance of Gordon Jump, who made such a beautiful performance on 'Soap' as Piece of Chelief Tinkler. <br /> <Flareup's 'plot', as it is, follows the troubles of an exotic dancer (Welch) running away from her murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic Hollywood sludge production line - a number-by-number roadmap, pedestrian direction, quick takes, edits and effects, ultra-catchy popular music, plywood sets and matching performances. <br /> <br /> The cast is as scary as the script. Although Raquel is able to perform fair performances in the right vehicle, this old clunker is so bad that she really has no chance, nor the audience. One of my favorite moments comes when Raquel wakes up at the hospital, sees the Las Vegas police officer chasing after her ex-killer and asks, "How did you get here?" - to which he naturally replies "In an airplane". Ah, mankind ... And you will not be able to take your eyes off the doctor (Michael Rougas), who has what may well be one of the worst journeys in the long and sad history of the bad appearances. I guess I've never seen anyone stay in such a bad place before. <br /> <br /> Rachel Joe's love interest (James Stacy) runs through the film with a stare that is somewhere between confused and embarrassed - and no wonder. This bomb puts the cast through virtually every TV clich√© in the book, from Raquel's spectacular and terrible return to the terrible nightmare setting, to the sheer shock of the "romantic" ride along Leo Carillo Beach. Spoiler Warning - The only interesting thing in the whole movie is the ending, in which Raquel finally regains her own strength, and hilariously enacts the title, setting fire to the evil one. Whoever the stunt double really earned his money in this - he climbs like Yorba Linda in a heat wave. However, even this rather spectacular scene is compromised by the fact that one of the crew moves towards the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many bad things about 'Flareup' that it's strangely convincing; I wondered if this could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen done. The answer seemed to be a resounding 'Yes' ... until I saw the film that followed, Roger Corman's classic 'heat cage' 'The Big Doll House', which takes Awful to a new level. I can vividly recommend these two shlockers as a double bill. You will laugh at yourself silly.
