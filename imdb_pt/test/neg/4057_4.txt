It's amazing what you can see if you wake up at 2 in the morning and turn on the television. I did not know they showed movies like that. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who reused movie locations or used other locations for his own films. <br /> <br /> The marks on this film could only move the camera angles and add some time, and they would have a XXX movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, just a minimal dialogue that led to stripping and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the whole movie, but there sure were lots of really big busts and hot lesbian action. There was also male / female action, but it was only about 25% of the film. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing came to mind in watching this movie that may interest those who are buying high definition DVDs. Sony declined to license Betamax to adult filmmakers and adult films on VHS. You can guess what happened to the beta max, as the adult movie industry makes millions of videos. Sony has again refused to license Blu-ray to the adult film industry and has just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which high def system will disappear.
