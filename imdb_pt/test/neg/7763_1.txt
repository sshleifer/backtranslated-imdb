"Sex and the City" has great things to do. The problem is that he is overwhelmed with a number of negatives that actually detract from the final classification and review of the six seasons. <br /> <br /> The good things about SATC are that many of the conversations look like real life, the romance stories are interesting, and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that few women act as full prostitutes. These four women have so many partners, even lesbians in a few episodes, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes to total absurdity. The men on the show are mostly described as shallow, degenerate, liars, cheaters and buffoons. The foul language these women use is so much greater than what normal conversation implies. Why do writers do these things? Clearly, to be over-the-top and get their attention. <br /> Another thing that bothered me (without ruining) is how some of the relationships ended. They simply did not look real to me or to others with whom I discussed it. <br /> <br /> But even though I gave the show 2 stars in the end, I'm happy to have watched the show. I really watched every season several times. I recommend the show to anyone who does not take offense with profanity and soft-core pornography. I could have done less with offensive language and nudity and sexual acts, but the novel was very good and the saga ends very well.
