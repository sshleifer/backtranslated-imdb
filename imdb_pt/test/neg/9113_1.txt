I love most movies and I'm a big fan of Sean Bean, so I thought I'd like at least that movie. Also, I'm Canadian and this is a mostly Canadian movie so I was prepared to take a serious break. Nothing could have prepared me for the trash that is "Airborne". Steve Guttenberg as an action hero? Give me some time. The acting throughout the movie was so bad that I'm having trouble sleeping tonight. Now I have only two wishes in my life. <br /> <br /> 1. I hope you never have to watch this movie. 2. I wish I could take those 6 hours back. Oh, wait, the movie has less than 2 hours - it looked like only 6 hours ... <br /> <br /> Do not watch it. Seriously.
