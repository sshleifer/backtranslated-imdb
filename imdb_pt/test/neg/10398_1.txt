This leftist deity trivializes Dante's great work, distorts the genius of the author of all recognition, inserts hateful ideology, incompetent satire, and silly political commentaries everywhere imaginable, and deserves a place in the Eighth Circle, Tenth. Bolgia with the rest of the counterfeiters. Sandow Birk reserved himself a place beside him. <br /> <br /> Stocking Hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian conservatives is a work of literary sacrilege, not to mention an extreme liberal bias. It is, however, not original, tedious and banal. Nothing in Birk's unworthy and heretical revision is less relevant to the original text or is somewhat amusing, comical, or enlightening, despite its presumptuous claim to the contrary. <br /> <br /> I could have eaten a roll of video tape and gotten a better movie. I regret the two hours of my life that I lost seeing this insult to the very concept of poetry. Calliope will cry forever.
