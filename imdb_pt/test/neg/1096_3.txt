... And boy is gentle <br /> <br /> I saw it on the cable channel Bravo on a Saturday night and here in Britain we often have these "erotic" movies, arriving at night on the Bravo. This follows a WEIRD SCIENCE type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> When you saw one of these movies, you saw them all with a lot of bimbos looking like they are advertising silicone implants. Come on, I've actually seen breasts in real life (I'm sure some of us have them too) and they walk from one place to another, where they defy the laws of physics, if not gravity. Sex scenes are tedious affairs in which a well-wrapped skier rubs himself against his co-star without any dialogue or sound other than some muzak and when climax looks like both are having a bad attack of constipation. The girls themselves are very pretty, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are wasted on such soft-core movies. <br /> <br /> And if it's a fantasy of yours, I'd recommend the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy
