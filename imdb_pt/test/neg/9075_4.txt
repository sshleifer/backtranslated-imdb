I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangular friendship between a girl and two boys. While living this situation and getting lost in it, I expect a similar story to inspire me. <br /> <br /> My main concerns are: - Why (a) and how (b) does the triangle form? - Why (c) & How (d) does the triangle degenerate? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a clear answer: "because it's better!". <br /> <br /> (b) here, it's an open triangle: all three share things together. Mine was closed: everyone knows the others, but the three are never together or talk about what is missing: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer spoken explanations but prefers visual and emotional assumptions. : the end comes with sensuality, sexuality arising in the triangle, or more precisely, when, for a member, deep feelings are linked to intimacy and, as for the second and the first, they can be divided. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the film and in my story, silence is proof that something is not right .. And in an ironic and painful way, the tool for those sad times, is always the telephone : I lived this terrible phone call planned: "Call me back: I'll wait for you" ?? and when the time comes, the phone is silent. A variation is also shown, when the line is connected, but it refuses to speak? All these scenes were very difficult to see for me. <br /> <br /> If the film was a big help, it also has many flaws: <br /> <br /> about the boy's family problems <br /> <br /> - why the scene of the shower on the DVD cover is cut into the film? <br /> <br /> - how does Mickael finally enter the hotel? <br /> <br /> Is Cl√©ment always seeing Salome? he says "no" but has her address; and who's the girl with him at the bar: his girlfriend? how can she know about the address ??? <br /> <br /> - what finally happens to Vanessa: the ring in the final shoot is a proof of commitment ??? with whom ?????
