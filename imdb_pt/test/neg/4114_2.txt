Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This playful film version of his 1950s tale about time travel and the effect it can have on de-evolution is not well-known from theatrical performance (did it exist?) And exists now as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week . What appears to be a science fiction ghost thriller in the opening scenes quickly misleads us as computer-generated graphics are replayed unchanged throughout a supposedly different movie. travel back in time where a large company sells sexists in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles. A foot / butterfly slip while in one of these endeavors and the course of evolution is altered with the resulting waves of time rolling over the planet changing everything to plants and animals that eat man. Of course there is a beautiful maiden who knows how to reverse the process and a handsome man risking his life to act according to his orders and everything is finished. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's the story ... and the most amazing fact about this unplanned and unpredictable mess of a movie is that it has attracted a few talents to portray the flat characters in the comic book. Edward Burns (all fan and handsome) is our hero of the day, Ben Kingsley is the corporate guy with a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the creator of better known women and Wilfried Hochholdinger as a pervert - all are superb actors and should have known better than to line up with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who enjoy this genre of science fiction monster thrillers, the creative department has run out with some of the most sinister animations to hit the screen in a long time. A must miss. Grady Harp
