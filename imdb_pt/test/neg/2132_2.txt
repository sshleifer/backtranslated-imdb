movie I've seen. Actually I think it's one of the funniest episodes of the MST 3000 I've ever seen. Not that this was good, but for anyone who has seen Hands: the Hands of Destiny know that this was not two bad things. The monster in the movie looked terrible, everyone wore swimsuits and the plot was laughable. I still have no idea why they made the monster, they never gave a good reason. The lead woman had to be the meanest girl I've ever seen. They would have done better if they had thrown the girl who was killed at first as the leader. On the plus side the dolphins acting was great !!!
