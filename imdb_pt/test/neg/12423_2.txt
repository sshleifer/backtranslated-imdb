Oh gosh! Oh gosh! Oh, darling! Thinking movies like this were made, and probably enjoyed by thousands of people on drive-ins, really confuse the mind. How innocent we were in those days. To be honest, this movie sucks. The hero is so wet that you can hear his dirty, wet steps in every scene. My Lord, but he is just one of the many terrible actors who appear in this turkey. No wonder the MST3K has chosen. The story, as it is, revolves around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe he's the actor driving the car) that he gives up and "walks in with the wrong gang" Oooooh! Scary stuff. However, the wrong class turns out to be the equivalent of The Three Stooges and their "hand-me round" of a biker girl. As an example of how this whole thing is lame, the writers have obviously ruined their brains to invent a scary name for the biker gang - that is, four people can be called gangs. The result? The gang is called the Angels of Satan! I'm not kidding with you. <br /> <br /> This mediocre acting and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, creates a wonderful film of beer and chips. But otherwise, it's just the worst kind of junk. <br /> <br /> Like I said. Once, this may have been considered good. But today it only makes you laugh (and shrink) with every passing minute. Avoid except for a good laugh. And make sure you're more than half drunk too!
