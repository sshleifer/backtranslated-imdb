I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it really gets more fun every time. Perhaps the most enjoyable are the paradigms of tired characters that the film offers us: the dark male protagonist all American, his blonde girlfriend, the nerd of the theater with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonist athlete and the brunette girl # 2 "However, we are introduced to two magic martial arts experts with mules running a convertible. If anyone can explain this, please contact me. Among other highlights are Bobby Johnston's portrayal of the athlete's character, Dell, and his trademark line, "That's why I keep it close." Watching Johnston's performance comes as no surprise that his career has fallen fast in the realm of soft-core pornography. (SPOILER) Also, after several displays, I still have absolutely no idea what that great demon in the end says at any time; are just electronically muffled noises. Oh well, this is probably for the better. And finally, why are all the demons so slippery? Is wet skin scarier? It certainly did not help in this movie.
