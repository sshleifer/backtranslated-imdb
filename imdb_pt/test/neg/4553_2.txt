This may very well be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I usually do not watch movies like this, but I was forced to watch it at school. What torment! <br /> <br /> The story is as common and boring as it can be: Boy knows girl on the Spanish coast, boy and girl fall in love, but love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love . At the end of the film the film becomes a kind of strange kung-fu movie where the white guys fight against the guys in black. Horrible! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad it makes you laugh. The dances in the movie that I think are cool are so simple and laughable that even I can do them! And Georgina Verbaan is possibly the most annoying person I've ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijenhuis is on his way to becoming Dutchman Ed Wood. Your movies are so bad they make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Victor LÃ¶w, however, gives a surprising good performance and Daan Schuurmans also acts well. <br /> <br /> So, please, for your own good, do not watch this movie. However, if you like to see soaps, this can be well worth it. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> 2/10
