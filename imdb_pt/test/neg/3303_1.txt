Above all, you should not take this movie seriously. It takes itself seriously, unfortunately, but this can not be helped. This ninja anime flic has to be the greatest achievement in ruining what could have been a catchy story, if not original, with bad twists, ridiculous scenes that kill time, and a scandalous appearance that will make you laugh or moan (or both , like me). <br /> <br /> Although I'm typically a fan of ninja / samurai anime (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin to name a few), this has to be the exception. For the record, from the technical point of view of his time, this film was very well animated and built. It's just the plot that stinks. The authors of this film clearly decided (for what rational reason I do not know) that they could somehow compensate for the lack of a script if the character was on the other side of the world in search of a treasure he (he learns) that his father fought and died for. In the process, he rescues a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in an Apache village, befriends a ninja clan whose members try to kill him, meet more family members than he knew he had in the strangest places, and circumstances (and to whom everyone subsequently dies at some point in the movie). <br /> <br /> Even so, these ridiculous twists could be excused, but then come the two "guest appearances." # 1: After having a ridiculously clich√©d clash with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain". At this point, you're probably saying "What the fuck? !!" This "meeting" serves a single purpose: it totally discredits a film that attempts to add to itself an educated academic record. I found it disappointing that the authors had all this work to search the US from 1860 and failed to realize that the true name of "Mark Twain" was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that he belonged to Captain Kidd. I can hear the moans of disgust now. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are the scenes. These scenes show several characters running, with the landscape moving statically back, for several minutes, and there are many of them. It's these scenes that make this movie, 2 hours and 12 minutes, seem to last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a movie with bad subtitles that only asks to be made fun of, that's it. Feel free to mock as many as possible and enjoy yourself. Just do not take this seriously. 3/10
