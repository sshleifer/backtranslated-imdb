I watched this movie knowing it would be awful, but it would not break the ground new and revolutionary in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. The plot is Deep Rising with raw effects and HORRID action. The lines in this ... well ... wow really there is no way to put this movie down because I think the words have not yet been created in the English language. The sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually doing something good. You will not believe your eyes when you see how many movies they rip off without even trying to hide them. There are scenes / plots straight from Deep Rising, Alien, Jurassic Park, Predator, Jeepers Creepers, and the list can continue indefinitely. However, unlike any of these films, this just falls short of the celluloid stool. The most unbelieving thing about this movie, aside from the way he tries to be competent, but fails, is that Gimli is crazy about himself. How the hell can they afford John Rhys-Davies, but no decent effects, writings, actors or ensembles. Really horrible ... and not the kind of evil that is good.
