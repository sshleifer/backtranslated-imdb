Police officers Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon escort five black juvenile delinquents who cross the country and end up stranded in chicken coops when their van breaks. After a deadly confrontation with a racist white whip with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. One of the teenagers uses a nonsensical spell to call Killjoy, who finally appears mid-way in a lower makeup job and bigger, greasier than it looks like he could slip off his head at any time. He then begins to kill the stupid characters while gushing some of the worst comments that have been heard since Hee Haw was canceled. <br /> <br /> The acting of the "teens" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the FX stinks and looks much cheaper than the first movie. Although I've liked him in his earlier Troma movies, Trent Haaga (trying to imitate Jim Carrey here) is horrible and it's no match for Angel Vargas's over-hyperactivity in KILLJOY 1 (which at least had some stupid laughs). <br /> <br /> Another nail in the coffin of the Full Moon studios, whose reputation as a direct fun franchise to vid completely disappeared since TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER days.
