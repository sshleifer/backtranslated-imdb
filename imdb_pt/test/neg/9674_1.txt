This is pure CRAP, and probably the worst biblical theme film ever ... Absolutely inaccurate, I mean, they put Sodom and Gomora BEFORE the great flood. They described Lot as a friend of Noah's, though he lived after Noah. To make matters worse, Lot later became a pirate and attacked Noah's Ark during the flood !!! And what about the trader coming on a boat that is moved over the water with a bicycle mechanism? And he exchanges alcohol for food and water, and then Noah is portrayed as an alcoholic! Mockery, and continual blasphemies, one after the other, and this goes on and on ... and ... The filmmaker and all the participants certainly made sure the front row in hell with this garbage ... <br /> < > Please take this crap, because it will save you almost three hours of your life.
