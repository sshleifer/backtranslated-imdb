It's going to be a blue Christmas if you subject your family to it. I loved the original movie, and this was not worthy of being its sequel. In fact, for all intents and purposes, it's not your sequel. Only one character from the original cast returns. Granted, this character happened to be hysterical cousin Eddie, but he just is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie. His niche is that of the eccentric relative who does crazy pranks - next to Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this movie to be a hit, and he was definitely not there. As far as I'm concerned, a movie is not a "vacation" movie unless the good Clark Clark is in charge.
