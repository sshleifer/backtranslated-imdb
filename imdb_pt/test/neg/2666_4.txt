Michael Myers, the crazed psychopath, not so young, who seems to be bursting with all appearances, is resurrected by his Druid brethren to further destroy his family members and anyone else who is in the way. Gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael, who originally preferred chokes and kitchen knives, learned to swing an ax and use all the means necessary to take his victims, and the result is a horrible movie, made of patchwork and dollars, practically unchallenged by some genuinely scary sequences . Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story simply so that someone could be called a star. You will not want to cover your eyes during this, but will shake your head with the fall of John Carpenter's classic creation.
