Romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for "below average" movies and source of frustration for viewers. This is a perfect example of that and got a place in my "top ten films". <br /> <br /> The story is far from being creative and the jokes are weak. I found no reason for a single laugh all through the movie! Characters are simple and the performance of the actors is simply good. History develops slowly, is tedious and predictable. The end is also predictable and coated with sugar. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon, when you have nothing better to watch in my humble opinion.
