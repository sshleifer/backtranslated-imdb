My age: 13 James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help Detective Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, to solve a series of murders in which the victims are crucified. Since Cole arrived on the scene, he realizes that the killings have changed a bit and thinks there is a different killer. He becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered and Campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. Campbell investigates the mysterious Cole and discovers a very dark past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Steven Seagal fan. I like action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not much fun to watch, incredibly stupid, and obviously the acting performance of Steven Seagal is absolutely horrible. Keenen Ivory Wayans is not that bad, though. The only thing left in this movie is the occasional good action scene, though most come around because of insanely stupid reasons. The plot in this movie is totally meaningless. I did not care about that. The whole "glimpse" of Seagal's character was stupid, all the fights and mafia fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. Give this movie a miss. <br /> <br /> Australian classification: MA 15+: High Level Violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 out of 100 (very generous)
