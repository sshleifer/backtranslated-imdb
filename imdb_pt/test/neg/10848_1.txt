Do not buy this movie for comedy worth as I did, I did not find it a little funny, but so miserable and lame f is unbelievable. I gave it to a friend for Christmas who was very funny (by my side) I heard recently that he watched and told me that I am an ehole! <br /> <br /> There is nothing more frustrating than watching a super bright, dramatic, poorly punctuated scene in which the camera is sitting on a tripod and does not move ... the film's work is truly pathetic, and I can only say DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE !!!! !!!!!!!
