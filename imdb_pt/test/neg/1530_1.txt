Not for the first time, I am out of order with the majority view. Oz is a terrible and pretentious voyeuristic series. Manufacturers have their cake and eat. Oz, In City, etc. are used as ultra-raw signals that the apparent difficulty is a complete fantasy. This allows viewers the weakest intellectual excuses to watch novels tempered with everything that is bad about humans. <br /> <br /> When you watch an episode, please remember that while the dirty mouth, violent, absurdly coiled, imaginary, unconvincing, sickly drama unfolds before your eyes of approval, several hundred children in the poorer parts of the world died of bad food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is exploitative drama at worst. It appeals to the most basic instincts, but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fort to pianissimo more often than a Mahler symphony. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is relentlessly ugly and utilitarian. Liberties taken with realities are stupid. Here's a dandy nightclub, coming to Oz in its elegance, with a ridiculously blurred eye contact lens in one eye, brandishing a stock of drugs no one detected. Here's a murderer wimp bleating about death from the heat of the universe, begging to be killed but of course being turned down by the brute he approaches and making some unlikely throat slashing. <br /> <br /> The action runs on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic and stupid spectator to always think about what happens next instead of the trash that has just been shown. Do not worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will happen in a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Finally, Oz is obviously pretentious. You need not feel embarrassed to be carried by the flow. You can watch and tell yourself that producers, writers and actors are doing everything with a big wink (or same word, but for a change of vowel) to the audience. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a moody onlooker and apologize on the grounds of cleverness, postmodernist, etc. Oz production team skills. They appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane. <br /> <br /> Truly, a despicable series. And every hour it shows, rewarding its creators and actors, and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary, hundreds of other children die whose lives they could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible, successful and widely praised series.
