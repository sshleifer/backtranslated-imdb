Look at Dick's work. <br /> See Jane's work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a nice house. <br /> <br /> They have a Latina maid. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches Spanish to her son. <br /> <br /> The son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> Dick is promoted. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a thug. <Br /> <br /> See Dick take the fall for the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane leaves the job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane Dick & Jane turn to crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot device, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> See the robbery. Be grumpy. <br /> <br /> See Dick & Jane finance the company's pension plan with theft money. <br /> <br /> Yay. See the final credits. <br /> <br /> Ok, so you have the plot. In addition, Dick and Jane take care of one scene for another. One bad linking with the last or the next. The whole thing is terribly episodic by nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey did not bother bringing his "A" material, he just seems bored and a little embarrassed about the whole thing. But, when you're getting another $ 20 million, why bother? Tea Leoni is frantic. I think it would be frantic not to be blamed for this failure. <br /> <br /> There is something wrong with Dick and Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The script is not funny. And it is not well planned. <br /> <br /> But it can be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane is perhaps a little too real. Maybe it's not funny people lose their jobs in a situation similar to Enron, when real life still lacks a happy ending.
