This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. What a waste of the obvious talent of Michael Imperioli. Disgusting movie from start to finish. All I can say is that this director is not an "author." You never enter the game, in the character's head, in the incredible talent with numbers that the real Stuey had. The coca scene is bad enough to throw your shoe on the set, it could have been a great scene if it had been filmed for movies and not for the stage, with the camera on the other side of the house hovering over a drug mirror while oo drama is going far in the background. The scene in which he wins the big league is just ridiculously ridiculous. This should be displayed in Film-making 101 - What not to do in taking photos.
