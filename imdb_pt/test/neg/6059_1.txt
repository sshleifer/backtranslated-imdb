Eh. I watch this movie in the classroom because someone recorded it and brought it. I was expecting a half-hearted attempt to portray the myths of Herakles, and as the commercials looked serious, I was expecting something that was half decent. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes after the movie, I realized it was a total CRAP. The only things in the movie that are almost true to the myth are the least (and I mean naked). Parents, half brother, and jobs seemed to be named correctly. Other than that, the rest of the movie seemed to be a gigantic inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say this was not much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version was made for small children, so it was not very serious. This film, with all the sex, violence and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, but the story presented in this was almost inaccurate as the Disney movie.
