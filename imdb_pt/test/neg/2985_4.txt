Sometimes you just have to have patients while watching the indie horror. If you can just make your way through the early scenes at a slow pace, sometimes a real gem will come ... This (unfortunately) was not the case with "Satan's Whip". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" tries to drag us through a tedious festival of snoring, with no real return at the end. I'm guessing that black and white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however, it's never explained why most of the blood is blue, and I found it increasingly annoying as the film continued. The story itself is not so bad, and actually had some decent originality and content, but the acting is simply pathetic. This, combined with the slow pace and lack of any royal blood (red), made "Satan's Whip" forget quickly. I'll give a rating of "4" for some witty dialogue that made me laugh but that unfortunately could not save this boring waste of my time.
