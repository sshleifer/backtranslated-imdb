I've never seen so much talent and money used to produce something so bad in my entire life! As stated in other reviews, one who's who of talent, such as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland and many others were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as a story of Agatha Christie. I keep thinking about how it could be with the same cast, done the right way. <br /> <br /> The film is even less intimate than Christopher Reeves' Superman films. The big cast makes production even less effective than in those films because there is not enough time to meet someone. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack made me wonder if the wrong video was in the studio's case. Music became increasingly offensive as the plot progressed. It is hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from previous scenes was more offensive. From someone who has seen most of Christie's movies (that's what got me into it, was one of the few I did not see), I miss that. It's not an Agatha Christie movie. Golan-Globus is best suited for producing wrestling movies in real time, rather than the comfortable atmosphere of the English mystery.
