Clossius says that "Baltic Storm" is banned in Sweden. That is not correct! Instead, you can buy the movie almost everywhere, such as at gas stations, malls, the internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it despite all the tricks to keep interest. The film only attracts conspiracy theorists, psychopaths and other people who live in la-land and those who "know the truth." <br /> <br /> Working in a museum with the Estonian disaster as a theme, I met them all! I have heard of every theory that exists as cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, Russian, American, Estonian, Swedish, and Finnish intelligence, often in different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some normal people asked why we did not show the movie? A question just made by them who have not seen this terrible absurd movie. <br /> <br /> Once again, "Baltic Storm" is not forbidden in Sweden. It has some fun qualities, but what the heck is Donald Sutherland doing in this movie?
