No one expects Star Trek movies to be high art, but fans expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a confusing and implausible plot that just left me shrunk - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to see the well-known characters interacting in another movie can not save this movie - including the scene scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite. <br /> <br /> I would say that this movie is not worth it. rent, and hardly worth watching, however, for the real fan who needs to watch all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.
