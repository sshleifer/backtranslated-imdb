There were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. She's extremely hot in this movie and that's the reason I chose to watch it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry Incredible villain and I always get excited watching him in movies (even at home alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all of you Australians and Poms, this is a rare treatment. The ex-Neighbor of Neighbors star of the 80s, dressed in drugs that sell drag. <br /> <br /> However, neither of these things nor the fact that the film is about the culture of drugs and raves has made this movie remotely interesting. The script was monotonous, the performances common and despite the scenes with JD and any scene with Sienna, I found everything about this very cool movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
