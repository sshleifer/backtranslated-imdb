This movie could have been great. It is not in my opinion. The plot is fragmented, the publisher seems not to be able to choose between Guy Ritchie's narrative style and a simpler one. There is a great deal of emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. Too much if you ask me. The characters are very shallow and stereotyped, I would like to see more depth there. It's hard to identify with the main character. As a result, the film remains shallow as a whole. <br /> <br /> The film says it gives the viewer an inner insight into the British criminal subclass, most notably the Essex subclass. Soccer-hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroin and violence, lots and lots of violence. Violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. In this movie nobody seems to use your brain, we are looking at a bunch of animals in clothes. As I said, there is not much plot and the narrative leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> If you're a man under 30, like hardcore violence and gore and think it's fun, that this is a movie for you. If you are looking for a movie that portrays real people with a well-developed plot, suspense and depth as well ... you can skip this.
