I have lived in Istanbul for 24 years and I (I suggest 39 years of experience) know what Istanbul has spent all these years. Faith Akin is still very young (born 1973) and falling into the big mistake of being an ORIENTALIST when looking at Turkey (as well as his other film Gegen Die Wand did) This film SERIOUSLY misses the Turkish life contemporary and confuse the audience by giving clues (quite false) as to the geographical and cultural aspect Anyone who spoke Turkish could easily attest that many bands and underground groups represented in the film (Siyasiyabend by one) are VERY MIXING and their members can not even speak an appropriate language that they can not be taken as "representatives" of contemporary Turkish music. Much less crap than many Turkish listeners do not even know. <br /> <br /> We, the Turks, have long been accustomed to the "superficial" Westerners who look at Turkey with some orientalist point of view: trying to fit the real Turkish image into their mental molds. new in this film is the fact that now a Turkish original director (Faith Akin) is making the same mistake: Looking at Turkey with some fake Western glasses and struggling to portray him as if he understands better. All of a vain effort. <br /> <br /> Just ask any friend your Turkish: What kind of musical documentary is this without mentioning the names: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? .. and many others that have shaped the true MUSIC we are listening to today? <br /> Faith Akin has a long lesson to learn before babbling and confusing the minds of others with false images about contemporary Turkish music.
