This movie has ALL the clich√©s of all the movies of terrorism or of airplanes of passengers. <br /> <br /> However, it is not totally unacceptable, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and perhaps Enberg). <br /> <What is incredibly bad, however, are the computer animations they try to pass as live action scenes. Boy, oh boy, the CGI scenes in "The Last Starfighter," filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). The sensation of cheepnis actually causes shivers down the spine. <br /> <br /> A pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and good taste.
