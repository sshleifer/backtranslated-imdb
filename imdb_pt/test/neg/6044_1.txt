There is a lot wrong with this movie. Greico with a wig, old scientist time machine fixer, tough guy Jones who gets back with a shotgun that has three rounds, spider people with tentacles and bad teeth hands, etc. The makeup was so bad and they only had a few spider people visible on the screen at once (Aliens Cameron technique could have been used) instead, they chose to dress each person spider the same way ... evil. The good thing about Greico's acting is that he hits his own on each syllable as if he's counting how many words he can speak in the script. It amazes me that with all the information out there on DVD reviews, there are still people so make movies. This movie could have been worse, as I do not know. Oh and one last thing. I'm going on a SCI-FI movie hunt. People who direct this channel should not be allowed to procreate to continue the nepotism that exists in Cinema and Television.
