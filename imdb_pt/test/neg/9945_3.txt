I've heard a lot about the inventive camera work and direction in this movie. I thought they were both a mess <br /> <br /> also some truly terrible acting. the main 'heroine' in the film is annoying and unbelievable and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation. everything she does or says is stupid, and she usually seems to mess people up. If she could fight, I could forgive her. <br /> <br /> In general, all the women in this movie are stereotyped who need a man to save them. and all the men in this movie are smart with little strength to save anyone <br /> <br /> this is a poor movie, and I ask you to avoid it. watch something like "the sword of doom" instead, I hear its much better than this confusing confusion of a movie.
