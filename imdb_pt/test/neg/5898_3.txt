I rented the DVD at a video store as an alternative to reading the report. But it's basically just more terror. <br /> <br /> While the film may present some report information in the drama, you are taking the producers' word - there is no reference to the commission's report anywhere. in the movie. Not one. <br /> <br /> Action everywhere is very bad - virtually all the stereotypes of government agents, each thinking that they know more than anyone else. There may be some truth to it, but it really does have a bad Hollywood stereotype. IMDb ratings and user reviews tend to be more right than wrong, and I've started to take a look at the ratings before renting whenever I can. <br /> <br /> I wish I had on this.
