I'm at a loss. This whole movie made absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg movie for football. The cut of the camera, the rhythm, everything so copied. I thought the subject was not serious for them to handle as it was. Yes, we all know that Southerners like football and beauty contests. Should we be inundated with this as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I was expecting young talents gathered in the style of the Society of the Dead Poets or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely put off by the movie. You did not get the characters. It was directed by characters, but you did not understand the motivations of anyone or their actions most of the time. The boy who is a mother is obsessed with being a soccer player. Why is he so silent? What is your business? Do we really need the scene with him "tasting" his heterosexuality? Why should we care? The film gave us insights into these children's lives and offered no loving care. That did not make sense. <br /> <br /> And why show a movie about a team that lost? I know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? Give us some feedback for these guys working as hard as they did with all their "conceivable" problems, damn it. We have nothing. We had a little speck at the end of the movie telling us that Mojo won the following year with the 3rd stringer (Lee). Why did not you follow that story? What would we get out of this? The movie took you along, but it did not get you anywhere. I just felt that something was missing. It looked like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least these two movies took you somewhere. Friday Night Lights was about a team of losers who lost their star at the beginning of the movie. The actor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed with him, what was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood, but he could not play, so why be sure we'll get his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the play-offs ... should we believe they are high school teenagers? Those men looked like college seniors or professional gamblers at age 30. Who were they trying to fool? I know the other team was looking intimidating, but that was crossing the line a bit. I liked their brave element negotiating with the black team, but again, how that fit the overall theme of the movie. Nothing collected. The characters knew more about each other than we do, and it feels strange to me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was shown. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee.
