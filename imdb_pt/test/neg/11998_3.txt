Wow ... I suspected that this is bad ... But now I see myself just speechless ... Honestly, no word of mine can make this movie any justice ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll try to say something ... <br /> <br /> This is truly a unique gem. One of the worst types. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - given his past as an actor - doing a fight with a Toltec wizard zombie during the movie's climax ... ??? A real stroke of genius, no doubt. <br /> <br /> It rarely happens that I laugh loudly when I watch a movie alone. It happened countless times with this one. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, the man, the accents ... And the dialogues I heard them speak ... And the acting itself ... I just could not. I can not believe what I was hearing. <br /> <br /> That fat uncle who farted so loudly (when he walked to the house with his nephew) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> Mamas! Yes, there are little tits! And female ass! There's even a naked girl in a bathtub having a beer ... <br /> <br /> That "stretch your mouth over your face" -That was the bomb! A real highlight. <br /> <br /> The aspects of the comedy were totally foolish. I just could not believe what I was seeing and hearing. For a while I even thought they were unintentional, shaking their heads in disbelief. But in the middle of the movie, I began to take a broader view. I think I took half a movie to dull half my brain, to finally get it. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time believing this movie ... But it's good, really, I guess. There was a black girl walking to a very small closet, opening it and then saying "Wow, look at all the storage space!" And she said it like she meant it. I mean, that's a good dialogue and good acting, right? <br /> <br /> Oh, and it may be unnecessary to say: Lash La Rue's whipping abilities suck the asshole into THE DARK POWER. It is very sad and pathetic to see. This is all part of comedy, of course. Or wait, I may be wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was amazing with the whip! It was the publisher's fault. He screwed up everything, cutting his lashes and everything. Or wait, it could have been the camera operator. He filmed from the wrong angles ... So why did not Phil Smoot say anything? That's it, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'll just stop talking about it. I have nothing significant to say except that I expect my brain to recover from that experience ... soon.
