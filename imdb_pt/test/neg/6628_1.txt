The Chairman of the Board of Carrot Top and its AT & T commercials are living proof that bulky stool is available in orange. It is not available, however, as HBO charges for such junk. Blehhh! The saving grace of COTB is that it certainly fills out direct suicide lines across the country, perhaps providing employment for thousands of therapists who lost their jobs when the recovered memory treatment was discredited, although (unfortunately) Carrot Top probably contributed to the sponsor of AT & T aligned with the increased traffic of viewers' devastated HBO phones. I can visualize the hordes of traumatized TV viewers, phone in one hand and fully loaded .45 auto, on the other hand, dialing desperation last minute before leaving the plank of life to escape the spectrum of the orange hair monster of the COTB echoing in their synapses, as the agony of meningeal swelling, burning and irreversible.
