On the pure theatrical side, Last Stand was great, since the reconstitutions and the soundtrack are a lot of fun, but there are better reports of that battle found elsewhere that, while not as long or flashy, are much more historically comprehensive. <br /> <br /> Certain little details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek hoplite shield and the erroneous pronunciations of various names and words, really devoured me. My guess would be that because "Last Stand of the 300" aired on the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the History Channel was just trying to keep up with the hype of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a historically accurate representation in every possible way, you would be luckier elsewhere.
