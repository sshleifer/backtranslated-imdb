Susan Slept Here turned out to be the swan song of Dick Powell as an artist on the big screen. Of course, he directed a few more films and often appeared on television until he died. It's a shame he did not come out with his performance in The Bad and the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin made so many better movies, I'm still not sure if what possessed him did it. The premise is absolutely laughable. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter who is looking to do things more serious than the fluff he is writing. He got an idea for a movie about juvenile delinquency, so two friendly cops in Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon put Debbie Reynolds, 17, at her door. She is not a very bad child and they do not want to put her in the system. So they give Dick Powell Christmas time. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone out there who does not see a problem? The term jailbait immediately comes to mind. In addition, Powell has a girlfriend, young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition here is beyond me. <br /> Susan Slept Here has an Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for best song, but lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have a few funny moments together and Alvy Moore like Powell's factotum and Les Tremayne as his lawyer also laugh. <br /> <br /> But it is not enough.
