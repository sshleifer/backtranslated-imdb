This movie is so horrible that it was literally a hard job to watch. I wanted to eject it from my VCR and throw it across the room, but I kept thinking (foolishly) that it would turn out to be funny and that everything would be fine. "You lose, we win, yay!" This movie should be seen for anyone who has ever entertained the thought that Jackie Mason was funny. After that, beat them on the head with this film until the tape breaks. And if you're even thinking of renting this crap (or worse, have it!) I have one thing to ask you: have not you even looked at the cover? I mean, with that crap, you can say with just one look how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This movie sucks.
