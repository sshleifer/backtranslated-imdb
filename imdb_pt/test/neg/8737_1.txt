A friend and I went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. It was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. It lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. It was so bad that we laughed all the way. Since that time, we rated films based on Kill or Be Killed as the worst movie of all time. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's so bad that it's funny. Not worth a second look for sure. I just can not do more than a 1 because I do not think the filmmakers want it to be so bad and I can not give credit for an accident. Excuse.
