My God, this movie was nothing more than filming by numbers. Struggling seller can not go in New York, the mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, struggling seller moves to California and becomes big, then loses big, then back with the simple life, then hits the bottom of the pit trying to get back to the top. I do not think I can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. Case in question (Looter?): When John Kapelos's character calls to say that he and his girlfriend were coming to Santa Cruz to visit, and James Woods says there's practically no chance of him coming, you knew with 100% certainty that they were coming to the next scene or two. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Sean Young looked fine.
