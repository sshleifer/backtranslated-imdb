I had to rent a few movies for my cousin for the New Year and she chose The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2 and we just watched the two movies while she's sleeping I realized I could get some comments in. :) Although this is a very tacky drawing, it really was not that bad. You have to admit that for children, these plots are new to them and could be a great introduction of these stories to them. Odette discovers that Derek secretly kept Rosthoe's magical secrets and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but he being a guy, he usually does not do that and tells her that he can not reach her. magic without your help. When a witch named Zelda puts her hands on them, she discovers that Derek has taken the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps Odette to retrieve that information. <br /> <br /> Princess Swan: The Enchanted Kingdom Mystery is silly and predictable, but for children I would honestly say it's a chance. It's so rare that we have these clean designs nowadays, so I'm going to cut the film down a bit. It was strange to see all the voices change suddenly, I grew up with the first one, so I think it stayed in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
