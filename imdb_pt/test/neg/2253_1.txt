Tarantino's previous films were from a guy in love with other movies. This is from a guy in love with his own writing. It's not Inglorious, it's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The whole purpose of a movie is to entertain - if you catch the attention of people's heads and remove their haircuts in a fun way !!!! - and if there is an unforgivable sin that a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust. <br /> <br /> The film is just a collection of endless and terribly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at multi-language desks. . There is even a scene where 3 people talk for almost 45 minutes at the same table, before, fortunately they have all been filmed. I wish they had been killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut up. This style of table talk is a trademark of Tarantino, but in other movies, I really cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. . Here, I could not care less. All of Quentin's movies have enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a widespread feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. <br /> <br /> Is it violent? Of course there is torture and scalping in abundance, but you would have to remind me. Fortunately, the film was so thin that I can not even remember seeing it earlier in the day when I even saw a headline in reviews on MSNBC. He is without tricks and apparently dying to write a movie. romance. But do QT a favor and spare us the movie. <br /> <br /> I got out of this movie halfway and would never recommend anyone to see it, no matter what kind of quarantine fan he or she is. <br /> <br /> I give 0/10.
