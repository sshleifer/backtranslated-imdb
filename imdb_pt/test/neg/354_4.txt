You would hardly know that a year later, MGM put Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE, which shines with the technical know-how of MGM. How far they have come in a year. CHENEY is a very stormy early talkie. The camera barely moves. Shearer is his usual charm and Rathbone does well in a romantic leadership role. They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly at the source of the microphone, which mitigates against a dramatic scene flowing naturally, but the play is a sturdy and entertaining workhorse so someone can have fun if the expectations are not too high . Oh, by the way, the plot involves a ring of high-class jewelry thieves who infiltrate society to attack their victims. There are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. An Oscar nominee for Best Screenplay Adaptation.
