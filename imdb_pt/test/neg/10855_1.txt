This is the possibility of the worst and most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and I know there must be a good film about the experience. Is not it. The "acting" is horrible and the plot non-existent. <br /> <br /> Here are a few incidents from my year in living quarters. <br /> <br /> 1) An elegant young man who unknowingly went out with a transvestite. 2) The best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and another with the nickname "the brick". 3) A couple that fucks very loudly. 4) The boy who gets all the girls 5) The boy from Northern Ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Student concussion, some of my mates ended up in the hospital 9) The discarded joint that started a fire. 10) The Flood 11) The boy who wakes up on his floor to find that each piece of furniture has been removed from his bedroom. <br /> <br /> And if I can get to that list in 5 minutes and in real life, I'm sure some writers can do better, a lot better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after a Sleeper song, where's the Britpop soundtrack?
