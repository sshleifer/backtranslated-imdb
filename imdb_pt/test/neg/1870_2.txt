I do not know why the IMDb lists all the Ghoulies movies as theatrical releases. They were all direct to video movies. Even with the Master Puppet series. Why has not anyone noticed that yet? Okay, somehow you stumbled on Ghoulies IV, probably invading an old abandoned video rental store from 1993. You looked at the rebates section and found this ... Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? There is no need to review this movie so critically. It's the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because ... it was 6.50 .. I knew it was not Kubrick stuff. And I was right. A DVD without remastering, with no extras, not even a trailer, sports a movie without assistance. <br /> <br /> In fact, it contains the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... that really did not get many. "big" roles beyond these two films. And I do not see why ... He's not such a bad actor and it's a lot of fun. But I think if you star in the Ghoulies movies, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot, Bobby Di Cocco, who despite having a slight resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), does not retain any of his acting skills ... A complete idiot who is just clumsy to watch. So there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star, I do not have to look for that. She looks very sexy, despite her costumes, her character and all she does risking the credibility of the film, which is no easy task for such a film. <br /> <br /> So there are the Ghoulies! Who can also let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking, no mistake. 1, but Ghoulies IV goes one step further. Instead of being puppets, this time the Ghoulies are actually KIDS in suits !!!! The filmmakers decided to rush enough to insult moviegoers. Also, there are only two of them, and they are not the main highlight of the movie, since they do not appear in much of it. However, sometimes they are absurdly amusing ... And they are not bad this time either. <br /> <br /> That's hilariously bad, it's amazing that I was really capable of liking it. I do not know why ... Some of the dark humor is really funny, although the script is most of the time effortless. Imagine Satan's only threat to you being that he will "kill you, slowly ... sorrowfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least the Full Moon had no involvement this time around. They did? Yes, a very bad and cheap movie made with production value, but not as bad as being in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
