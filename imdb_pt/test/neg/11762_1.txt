The few scenes that really attempt to describe the revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Scout troop that tentatively snakes through the swimming holes. When Sharif or, please, God, Palance experience the oratory of fire, they sound like Kurtz swallowing an insect. The exhibits of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba filled with smiling fish in the ocean and a positively Vaudevilian hypothesis about how the Bay of Pigs came to fruition. What does that leave us? A comedic dental scene; an excess of arrogant Hollywood peasants who go to the camera like a moving train; and, just for fun, a pass√© of homoeroticism that is not limited to the maniacal and maniacal maniac and uninterrupted by Fidel. Never trust a Medved, but even a broken watch is right twice a day: this is a HISTORICAL movie.
