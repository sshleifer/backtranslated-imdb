Early talkie feature based on a popular play. A murder was committed and a group of people hire a psychic to conduct a session to see who the killer is. While the lights are out, there's another murder ... then it's somebody in that room. <br /> <br /> What follows is a murder mystery that is obvious, dull and shocking. Most of the cast surpasses itself to a ridiculous degree. They act as if they are on stage (where you have to exaggerate) and looks silly on the screen. The most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Dracula") who REALLY exaggerates as a police inspector. The static direction of Tod Browning (who has always been overrated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for the finalists of Browning and Lugosi. I give a 3.
