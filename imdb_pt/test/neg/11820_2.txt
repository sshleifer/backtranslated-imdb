Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of B movie, where the limitations of the genre really act as a kind of liberating influence on writers and directors? classic drive-in movies such as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat" emerged from this environment. Unfortunately, his former Confederates from American International Pictures were out of breath in the 1970s, particularly in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often produced second-class imitations of Corman's films, sometimes featuring their own stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one such film. It's basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House," with some of the same stars doing many of the same things. Yes, this is a co-production of John Ashley (yes, the same John Ashley who was the hilarious Elvis wants to be in "How to Make a Monster" and paired with Debbie Walley in "Beach Blanket Bingo") with all signature brands of their productions? Female prisons where all except perhaps 2 or 3 main characters including prisoners and guards are Filipino actors in predominantly non-speaking roles where we see supermodel-type women taking on the role of revolutionary militants and where the main joy of the film is derived from the rudimentary exploration of S & M. <br /> <br /> The picture I saw most recently was terribly damaged (good ole Will Viharo described it as "Yellow Mama, Yellow Mama"), but I think even in the best conditions photography and direction are extremely routine. Is there also very little visual value here? it should not have much to do with the film itself because it was always clever enough to at least give your films some extra production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film look more impressive. This movie does not look impressive, does not have an impressive soundtrack, and you feel embarrassed by those who show a little talent. The only remotely interesting performances come from Pam Grier as a moody prostitute to escape life, the Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as his grotesquely self-indulgent pimp, and Sid Haig as a cowboy-style mercenary. The story puts Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low-budget female version of "The Defiant Ones," but does very little with the melodramatic possibilities provided by this premise. It's basically just an excuse to make sure the two protagonists can still stop for a good fight in the mud as they try to escape together from prison. This is all in the spirit of good fun, but the film ends up failing even as exploitation because there is a certain edge and crudity that must be present in such scenes that are replaced under the hand of this director with a kind of predictability to yawn. <Br /> <br /> So the movie will have little value for fans of value of hard-core exploitation? at least in the version I saw, is no more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" of more than a decade before, and much less interesting visually and thematically. For those who like to laugh at movies "so bad they are good," this may be fun, but it's not at the top level. People would be better advised to look for "Caged Heat" or some of the others who revel in their own brutality to the point of becoming a camp; this is more like less ambitious efforts, like "The Muthers", of Cirio Santiago. Unfortunately, the best thing about this particular film is the title and presence of Pam Grier, who was best in other films at the same time (particularly "Coffy" by Jack Hill). This film may illustrate an intermediary point in Miss Grier's journey from Corman's secretary to the B-movie, Queen-for-A-Day, but beyond its historical "meaning" as such, will have little value even for the Grier because she is given very little to work here. <br /> <br /> It's worth jumping, unless, of course, you can see it in a movie theater with a lot of friends and lots of beer, like I did. And yet its value is questionable.
