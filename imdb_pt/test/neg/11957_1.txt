This is an extremely horrible movie. And if you think you've seen another horrible movie, just like this before, you've probably seen it. You probably saw Scarecrow 2 made in 2003. Yes, that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the idea from the movie. And not only did he steal it, he really could have made it worse. I bet even the actors were afraid to tell people they were in the movie. Also I have to mention that the director was trying to compensate the tack, showing as many breasts as possible. Also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. In fact, this is probably all that the director has seen, and tried to put together a decent movie, which will never work.
