I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was completely surprised at how completely wrong this movie was. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this farce. The biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and I honestly could not tolerate watching the movie with my children. My children were surprised that even they knew that Lot did not even think about when Noah was building the ark. I think NBC should be ashamed to let producers mock the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ... PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE !!! I considered burning my copy, but I have every intention of writing the producers and sending them the scripture references they should have read before making this movie !!!
