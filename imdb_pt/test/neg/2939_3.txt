It surprises me that someone has found this movie touching or moving. The basic premise of the film seemed to me an excellent, yet provocative, idea for a movie about a rare type of relationship, but one (if I can judge from the real-life examples I know) is extremely deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film is cheaper - poorly scripted - and although it has a number of very beautiful pictures, I did not find anything special. Probably the biggest problem is that it's too short and poorly composed to give the audience enough time to emotionally invest in the characters: we do not really care about any of them, and so their stresses and obstacles really do not touch us. <br /> <br /> I think a REMAKE - of the script - with some character development by some really good writers - could improve a lot. It is instructive to compare this movie with Brokeback Mountain, which the writers did at far higher levels than the scriptwriter - screenwriters who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and accomplished their task. with care, planning and excellent skill! However, people seem to only redo movies that do not need it! You're not really missing something if you skip this: I found it very disappointing, and you're only saved from receiving a star from me because of the daring and good sense of making a movie about that sensitive subject. .
