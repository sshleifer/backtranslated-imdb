I can not understand why you would give this movie more than 4 ... It's only right that it takes me back to the 80's and the "good old days of horror comedy," but that genre has not improved since then - it's still so 'LAME Low budget - low tech - bad acting - bad story - nothing scary and not funny ... in fact, there is not much to say about it. The so-called monsters are terribly bad! I mean, we went back in time to when they used to make the plasticine monsters and shoot the fame scenes to frame ... I really do not understand why anyone would invest the money to make this screenplay for a movie - but I think it could have been almost OK if it had been a bigger budget movie. <br /> <br /> The recommendation would be - please do not make the mistake of wasting your time with this, unless you want to get tips for a bad Halloween make up! Personally I like independent movies and anything out of the box, but that just did not do it for me, at the very least.
