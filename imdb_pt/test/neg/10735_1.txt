I can overcome political parody; even though this was supposed to be a "Masters of Horror" movie. <br /> <br /> But what I can not overcome is the shameless use of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washes. political statement of the terror maker. <br /> <br /> For me, it was purely insulting to desecrate Arlington and our heroes. I have family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) would even portray Arlington's graves being disturbed only makes me want to vomit. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante, and I end up with MOH.
