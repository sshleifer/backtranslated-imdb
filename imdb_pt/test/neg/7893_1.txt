I'll be honest - the purple airplane with Snoop Dogg in charge is a fun visual joke. It would have been a decent concept for a 30-second commercial, or maybe a 3-minute video clip. But the producers have committed the old comedy concept of extending 30 seconds of footage to an hour and a half of film, and the results are predictable. The rest of the 89 minutes is filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes, offensive and - worst of all - painfully bland. The worn out plot screams under the weight of his inventions. Best to avoid unless you are drunk or high.
