I'm having trouble finding the words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historical judgment of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duke of Praslin is a tragic and compelling story which, I feel, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. Although cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, it could in no way compensate for the film's terrible structure, poorly written script and, above all, horrendously outdated characters. The worst were the Duke's sons, so eccentric and disgustingly false that it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and angry. deeply disappointed.
