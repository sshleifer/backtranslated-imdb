First, the title has no relevance to the film. It all started well with a good development, but it got annoying when he could not tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which only increased the value of annoyance. There were many pregnant breaks in the movie that seemed more filling than anything worth doing. The plot never revealed who did this crime to him, although a good plot had allowed the disclosure. The end was nothing less than "hey, we ran out of budget, let's stop here NOW !!" ... If I had written a novel that ended like this, I would be at the top. Garbage Garbage Garbage !!
