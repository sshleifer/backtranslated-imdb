I have seen many movies over the years and I am a big fan of comedies. <br /> <br /> But this comedy call almost brought me down to tears. It's undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen, the worst. <br /> <br /> I remember hearing about this movie from a friend and decided to see it. If I could, I could go back in time, I would. I'll regret it as long as I live, the time I've spent watching this crap. <br /> <br /> The plot is so insane; it just does not make any sense and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish mob and a German headhunter who stand behind Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), the Scottish crowd after $ 50,000 dollars and the Germans after his head. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to escape The Pest, it takes the form of many disguises. But in doing so, we witnessed some of the most annoying, worst, mind-numbing performances, dialogues, and sounds in movie history. This movie really bothered me; until the end I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I spent so much time watching a movie that would surely lead depressed people to almost certain suicide. I mean, how can there be hope when a movie like this can get permission? <br /> <br /> I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about The Pest is that people really like it. . Because? What's funny about a man who is boring from the first second to the last? A man who can not act? Who has an annoying voice and a confused face? <br /> <br /> I felt him thinking that the film would improve, certainly would. This did not happened. Usually, you want the good guy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish mob to find and kill The Plague, anything that would get me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal that happens in this movie, it is simply annoying and confusing. The jokes are dead before they are even counted. I'm sorry for cameramen who have no say in how the film is made, but actually have to film this nonsense. I would not be surprised if they are getting advice. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and run out of food and water than watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> I do not think I'll hate more than that.
