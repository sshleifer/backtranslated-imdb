In addition to the beautiful images thanks to the director of photography of New Zealand, Alun Bollinger, this film is not worth to be seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is so fragmented and lost that it is hard to know what is happening at any moment, and when you think you are following, the direction changes again, like a lost bipolar puppy. <br /> <br /> The musical track is horrible, depending on very emotional pieces that try to force the audience to feel a certain way, as if the instruments were acting as a queue of emotions? 'be sad here'; 'be shocked here'; 'feel fear here'. In addition, the repetitive samples used repeatedly let the public on the verge of laughter. Gone are the days of silent movies, where musical instruments were the only portrait of the voice? but you would not think so while watching River Queen. <br /> <br /> The narration was so used that one has to wonder if this film really would need some accompanying image. It could easily have been a piece of radio, though it would still be difficult to follow the story. <br /> <br /> And the ideas stolen from Jane Campion's The Piano are too obvious to be ignored. Are not just shots on the beach and forest almost identical to those of the Piano ?? maybe some of these boil down to Alun Bollinger's camera work at last ?? but the feeling of voice and the levels are also surprisingly close. And who could forget when the Holly Hunter character has her wings cut off, in the shape of her index finger being cut off by Sam Neill. Does this remind you of when Wiremu has her finger on the amputated trigger, and surprisingly also with an ax? I thought that way. <br /> <br /> On the whole I can not recommend this movie to see, unless you wear some headphones and just go with the scenery in mind.
