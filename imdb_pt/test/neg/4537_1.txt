Comedy is a tough beast to conquer. Ishimoto fails in all accounts, as writer and director. Some things, like making funny movies, just need to be left to professionals. 1 out of 10. Awful. It was not funny. I tried to laugh but it was not funny. I was not the only one, no one else at the Chicago festival was laughing either, at least at the screening I saw. Simply too bad, sorry :(
