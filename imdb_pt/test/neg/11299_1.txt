Synopsis: The sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a major budget production that totally fails to deliver; Not only is it not as smart as its predecessor, it's not even a splatter, suspense or horror movie, just a totally annoying time waster. Do not be fooled by the hype of the media, and particularly the stories about people vomiting in the movies and with mental scars for the rest of their lives because of the brain-devouring scene: in the movie this only appears as ridiculously bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum are stating that H is not "all bad" and "worth watching on the big screen," etc., is beyond me; and it's also not "so bad it's good," it's just boring. I usually respect the opinion of other people, but in this case I have to say that they clearly can not say Shine - Ola fucking. Maybe they have been victims of the media hype, maybe they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by the excessive use of backlight, smoke, and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is totally devoid of suspense; instead we have endless scenes of Lecter passing through an English-speaking Firenze, a totally unconvincing and uninviting plot with more holes than a fishing net (after watching H, I stayed up half the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, and when I wrote them I quickly filled 6 pages in little type before forcing myself to stop). Instead of wasting your time and money watching this on the big screen, I advise you to wait until you get to the TV in a few years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Below are some extra bones that I have to choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - It's the continuation of SOTL, despite the fact that which some people in this forum are claiming. And even though SOTL was a very difficult act to follow, there are sequences that are in line with its predecessors (SOTL itself was the continuation of Michael Mann's Manhunter, based on Thomas Harris's Red Dragon, and even though the first episode was a very nice film, SOTL was even better, another example would be the Alien series started by H director, Ridley Scott - both for the theory of diminishing sequels). In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a movie to be absolute crap. <br /> <br /> - This movie has a renowned director, is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the cast is strictly A list, a great cinematography, big budget, first line writers, yadda, yadda , yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church. So, what went wrong? I think a lot of guilt has to go to the producer of the movie, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here's my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter", which, for all its qualities, was a commercial failure. Disappointed, he gave the rights to Hannibal Lecter's character to Orion - for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to do SOTL, and the rest is movie history. DDL then had to wait for another ten years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally appeared with the sequel novel. I think at this point the DDL lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his slice of the cake before he dropped his cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that I find quite annoying this movie is that it is being given so much undeserved hype in the media; I mean, it sucks, but one of the most profitable productions of all time, so there is no need to give free publicity. And while most critics argue about how the scenes in Florence are Dantesque and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the simple fact that this film is an absolute, total failure is not mentioned. But there's more: not only is Hannibal being exaggerated, but it's also being used as a media agenda for a myriad of "documentaries" (usually leftovers of similar productions in the wake of SOTL) about serial killers. , cannibalism and profiling. However, not only does H not pretend to be realistic; Lecter also stopped being a serial killer (he now only kills out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), the profile is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: Lecter feeds the brain of Paul Krendler, drugged, in such a way that makes him (er) unconscious alive - self-cannibalism. Try to make a documentary of it. Much has been said about the acting: especially if Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the actor Hannibal Lecter) usually gets a lot. of praise. I think all these discussions are debatable. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (ie, Liotta, Oldman and Moore), but the script simply does not give them anything to work on. The same for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not being challenged in any way. And by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all of his films, except in H he has to do a bit of murder and is being paid the $ 11 million amount to do it.
