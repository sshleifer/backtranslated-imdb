This movie was completely painful for me to watch. I understand that indie movies do not have the same features as other mainstream movies. But there are basic elements of film production that you normally want to adhere to. First, skip cuts. There are numerous in the opening 15 minutes of the film. There are pictures in which it looks like two separate shots of the same shot have been edited together. What I mean by that is that one character will half-line from one socket, and the rest of the line is different. Secondly, the dialogue. I understand that many writers struggle for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. As this film is very specific to its location, the dialogue should be spoken in a specific tone too (example: set a movie in Boston, but people use the West Coast slang with a Chicago accent). Even with this understanding, it is still difficult to follow some of the lines that these actors present. These are just the two most vivid problems I encountered with this movie. There were a few others. I do not mean to sound like a stern critic who knows nothing. I have years of experience in the film industry (most important of the independent low-budget film). I also understand that with many directors, there is often a method to their madness. I was unable to figure out this method used in this movie. This makes it difficult, when trying to decide whether I see this film as an example of unique style in filmmaking, or just another low-budget and poorly placed film. I sincerely hope it is not the last. If anyone has any idea why things were done in a certain way, or if you have any thoughts / opinions about it, I'd love to hear them. I hope I can understand this movie more and my current opinion can be changed.
