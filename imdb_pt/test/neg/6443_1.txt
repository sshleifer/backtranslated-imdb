My wife and I have seen this abortion from the beginning. I hated it right away, but my wife got addicted to it for a few years. For me, things got worse and worse, and the characters were all, no doubt, sad and depressing, with no redeeming features. My wife then got tired of it and stopped watching altogether. Occasionally I'll take a clip of him or go through it when I'm surfing on the channel. There's always someone yelling at someone or doing something horrible. There never seems to be lighter moments or happiness of any kind. That was always my main complaint when we first saw it - no humor. Writers seem to have no idea about drama - they seem to think conflict is a drama, and of course that's just one element of it. Light and shadow are extremely necessary and actors who can bring something to it. I'm sure Eastenders' actors are competent, but they have nothing to work with. It should be the most depressing showbiz job. I can not understand why the British public watches and loves it. What on earth says about our psyche? I've heard it's "just like in real life" - it's nothing like my life or the life of someone I know, otherwise we'd be throwing ourselves at tall buildings or public transportation. The topics he addresses are far from being seen by the family, but are still shown in pre-basin. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I did not expect to see them at 7:30 or 8:00 at night. The program is great and should be avoided at all costs.
