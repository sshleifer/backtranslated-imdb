this is the TV show of the 90's, not the 1979 movie. It seems like three episodes totaling just under 90 minutes. Before watching, I thought it was one of the versions of the movie, and I immediately noticed that I had a TV show. I did not care much about that. I just felt that the story was not there, and there was not much in terms of excitement or drama. I was looking at the elapsed time on my DVD player frequently, as I was really bored. I also thought some of the dialogue was, to put politely, not good.plus, I thought the acting left a lot to be desired. but that's just me, however, it's a good clean and healthy family entertainment. Certainly there is nothing offensive here. Children will probably like it. For me, The Black Stallion is 4/10.
