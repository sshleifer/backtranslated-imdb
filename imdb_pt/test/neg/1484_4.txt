Maybe it's time to declare 2007 as "The International Year of the Film Crocodile"! The "primitive" ridicule came first, over a crocodile named Gustave (!) Ruling the marshes in Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2," a low-profile, made-for-TV sequence for a forgettable original. Third, there is this incredibly derivative and soporific of Australian terror and finally, I have not yet seen the promising "Rogue." The latter will probably be the best considering the involvement of the next Australian horror talent Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"). "Black Water" is certainly not a complete waste of time and film, but it is another nonsensical survival film that confuses the agony of real life with terror. Forgive my frankness, especially since I sincerely feel sorry for the people who have gone through this ordeal, but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whimpering for over an entire hour is not my idea of ​​pure suspense! Three young men travel through northern Australia and decide to spend a day fishing in the remote areas of the swamp. It was not long before a gigantic, ferocious crocodile turned its little boat and devoured the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam can barely escape the reptile's hungry teeth when climbing a tree. Even if it remains invisible most of the time, the croc stands patiently waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it sounds a lot like the "Open Water" plot, in fact. Replace the numerous invisible sharks with a gigantic invisible crocodile and the open sea with an equally unexplained Australian swamp, and there it is. Ah, well, "Black Water" at least features some rare moments of excitement and an awesome water monster. It has to be said, the croc looks fabulously cool and you eagerly count down every time it descends from the water. The three-headed cast does whatever it takes to keep their characters interesting, but how do you do that by sitting in a tree all the time? The concept based on real facts obviously causes a number of constraints, such as limited images of fantastic shooting locations, dialogues, and amiable character designs.
