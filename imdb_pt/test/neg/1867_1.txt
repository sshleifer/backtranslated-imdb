All movies containing "funny sound effects" should be recorded. If there is one thing I hate, it has to be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when someone is hit by the head. The only movies I've seen to do this are Ghoulies IV and Hobgoblins when they're at the bar, and Pixie is pounding on the red-faced guy with a bottle of beer ... or rather shaking it with a bottle of beer, because she never really hits him with it. Yes Ghoulies IV is a drug. But I have to ask myself, did not they want to make the so-called "Ghoulies" move when they supposedly spoke? Their faces are almost as static as the masks used in Trolls 2. Hell, I can make a better mask with construction paper, some rubber cement and a handful of glitter. That sucks.
