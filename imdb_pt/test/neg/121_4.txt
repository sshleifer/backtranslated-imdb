Isaac Florentine has made some of the best Western martial arts action films ever produced. In particular, US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can say that Isaac has a true passion for genre and his films are always full of events, creative and clear, with some of the best fighting sequences that an action fan could expect. In particular, he found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented actor and action actor, as you might expect. This is confirmed with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately The Shepherd simply does not live up to their abilities. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that JCVD ​​looks better here than in years, especially in the fight he has for almost no reason in a prison cell, and in the final confrontation with Scott, But look into your eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There is nothing in your eyes at all. It's like he does not care about anything during the whole movie. And this is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> There are other dubious aspects in the film as far as script and visually, but the main problem is that you are totally unable to empathize with the hero of the film. A genuine shame as I know we all wanted this movie to be as special as it genuinely could have been. There are some good bits, especially the action scenes themselves. This movie had a great director and choreographer of action, and a great opponent for the JCVD ​​to face. That could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back to zero in action movie bets. <br /> <br /> Honestly, a pity this did not happen.
