Just by adding to the chorus of people who have deemed this 'unredeemable' I will state the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS clearly stated by some of the other commentators: The "movie" is videotaped (what kind of camera I use) I do not know, but the cameraman had in AUTOFOCUS (!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes it in and out of focus. In many of the scenes, the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. That's all screaming "Amateur." <br /> <br /> I also noticed that in the middle of the cornfield, you hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is turning on the lights ... loud. <BR> Also what is with this single source of enlightenment that follows (and often 'drives' the actors) when they walk around. It looks like a presenter with that "in camera light" that follows people around like a searchlight. There was no "credit" for the lighting / DP design and I know why. The filmmakers saw no need to have someone who really knew what they were doing by lighting up that image (note that I did not say "movie"). So be prepared for a single spotlight as the only source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the film. UGHHH !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically inept production I have ever seen commercially released. I "bought" this title because I like bad movies. It's usually so bad you can laugh at it. This is so bad that it is unacceptable. Nine's Plan of the Outer Space is "Citizen Kane" compared to this title.
