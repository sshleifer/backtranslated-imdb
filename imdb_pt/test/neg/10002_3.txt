Not even the Beatles could write songs that everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is not a specialist, he is the best of all when it comes to thought-provoking action movies. The nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film, the emergence of the movie star turned rapper was in full swing, the performance took a back seat to the regional accent dominating each man and transparent acting. This was one of the many ice movies I saw as a child and I loved it, just to watch them later and shrink. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters with basic lives until a burning tenant is about to set fire to a map with golden implications. I hand over Walter to quickly and neatly configure the main characters and location. But I blame everyone involved for producing Lame-o performances. Ice-t and cube must have gotten very hot right now, and although I enjoyed both their careers and rappers, in my opinion, they fell into that movie. It's about ninety minutes of a guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point where you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief. Now this is a movie, it's not a documentary, so I will not waste my time recounting all the stupid twists in this movie, but there were many, and they got nowhere. I get the feeling of seeing this that everyone on the set was so confused and just playing things on the spur of the moment. There are two things I still like, one involves one scene with a needle and the other is Sadler's huge 45 pistol. Bottom line this movie is like domino pizza. Yes, I'll eat this if I'm hungry and I do not feel like cooking, but I'm well aware that it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.
