Beware, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> Suspense on the credibility of Collier Young's pioneering producer team and Ida Lupino also known as The Filmmakers (with Lupino coming in with some direction without credits). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is the 'danger' and Ida Lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the movie 'woman in danger'. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a junkie junkie (no, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupine is the lonely war widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to do some work around his house. Things come down from there when Howard makes Helen a prisoner in his own house. <br /> <br /> Howard has an unpleasant secret, not that he can reveal it. You see, awareness is a real challenge for him. Keeping this, that is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming and finding his employers dead. That's part of the movie problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he is free to wander from town to town, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He can not remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. Its violent, threatening and antisocial tendencies are triggered by the smallest and most common of things (a flirtatious young man, inadequacies involving war, for being rejected for service). I do not know how he managed to get through the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman, but still left alone for periods of time, could not you figure out a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan, I think, is defeated by the material. It seems like he's exaggerating in his hand. His series of twitches and spasms and the bursts of dementia, all very tangled, have a sense of robustness, something made and robotic for them. At this point in his career, he probably played this character to some extent, ten times and shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (we did not) through displayed pieces of humanity, as he being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relationship with a group of children who will not judge him. Lupine just has to act with coldness and anguish, which she is more than capable and does. <br /> <br /> The photo had something to do; what would be the possible resolution of the conflict? Then, of course, there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Of slight interest, there was a recurring motive in which the camera captured Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree ornaments). It indicated something happening, or about to continue, in his head. Horner (Vicki 1953), who made his reputation in production design, does a great job of making the house look like a prison. Credit also, the art department RKO always trusted for the work in the house. In the end, the sub-standard work of directors, they all have much better movies to their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
