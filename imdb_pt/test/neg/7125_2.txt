I'm a big fan of Ju-on's first four projects. I possess them and see them every few months. I lend them to co-workers and friends just so they can have a good scare with the quality of Japanese cinema. I think Takashi Shimizu has created a great story, and presented it very effectively on these four plots. <br /> <br /> I was a little excited about the premiere of The Grudge 2 in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before watching the original four. Grudge was really good. Of course the originals are better, but I received a good Halloween scare from American Grudge 2004. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 started badly and came down from there. I kept hoping it would get better, make sense, show Shimizu's talent - nothing like that happened. What's great about Shimizu's work at Ju-on is the story. True, it is generally said in a disconnected style that you have to think about connecting your components, but it is still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of free character deaths that you never had time to start caring about. <br /> <br /> The issue was atrocious. Disjointed (as in Japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of the sequence of scenes was exhausting. I just kept thinking, "This is so stupid" and "No - did not he sell that much?" It made me want to get out of the theater, run home, and watch the original work, just to make sure Shimizu did not always make that stupid, generic, boring, unresponsive little dick and played along. <br /> <br /> If you really have your heart in watching this movie, I suggest you wait for the 2 months to rent it. Same. Two of the five people in the theater with me left about 45 minutes. I debated whether I should do this alone. Going home and cleaning the house, in fact, seemed like a better way to spend my time at that moment. <br /> <br /> I'm truly shocked at how bad this movie was. Let's pray, Sam Raimi does not put any more money into making The Grudge 3. It's not worth it anymore. Sigh.
