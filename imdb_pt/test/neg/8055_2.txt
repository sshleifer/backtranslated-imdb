This movie has a lot going on. Another reviewer comments on the disjointed and episodic nature of the film as reflecting the director's memoirs - alright, if that's how it was written and performed. Instead, what we have is a direct narrative - part of the time - that jumps up, down, and over, leaves us hung in some instances, interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances and just does not work. <br /> <br /> There are also some plot details that simply do not work. For example, why drag a body to a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, unlike the night time period? Why leave your sheet flat on the body? Why did an artist who knew Joe's character for a short time decided to leave him "everything" (even if it was not much)? This subdirectory has been little developed to make this work punctual. By the way, why even the man is an invalid or an artist other than to provide free money and nudity scenes? Could he easily have been a photographer or an opera composer? Incidentally, how does one classify an apartment in an opera house - particularly without some clear connection to Opera? The coincidences are also too obvious and obscure and inexplicable. Why the guys took everything in the warehouse and "disappeared"? If Tim was a 10-year-old schoolmate in a town as small as Bangor, how could Joe lose him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other to a job. <br /> <br /> Some of the other subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend (s) and the sister wanting to escape, seemed to fill in.) There are some good ideas that could have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting short . When completed, this movie made little sense and offered even less.
