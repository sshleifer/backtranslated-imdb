Screenwriter-director Patrice Leconte takes on a universal and potentially bottomless theme - friendship - and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce, despite first-rate actors, good cinematography and elegant production design. It's all in the plot and the plot is laughable. "Teach me how to be nice," art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon), and that sums it all up. We learned almost nothing about friendship, and Daniel Auteuil may be a good actor, but in a minute we believe he could be the selfish aggressive script that depends on him. Just as we expect the farce to be over, Leconte pulls out one of his usual cathartic acts, rapidly advancing from damage to disaster. Like the precious Greek vase of François, everyone and everything in this film is false. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet, part of Coste's business partner, Catherine, who looks optimistic and sexy despite a major setback.
