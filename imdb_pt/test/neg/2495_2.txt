I read almost every great book about the Manhattan Project. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its scope was immensely massive - it rivaled US history, perhaps only for the space program of the 1960s. There were literally MILLIONS of people involved from all walks of life in various places (mostly clandestine) across the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they could not speak to the person sitting in the cubicle next to them, let alone his family. Logistics is overwhelming, especially considering the considerations of communication, security, and transportation during the 1940s. As an example, my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract. with the federal government for the Manhattan Project. His job was to supervise a team of about 30 other carpenters, who are responsible for fabricating concrete dumping forms for the huge research facility in Hanford, Washington. That's "everything" he did, six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, accommodation, sanitation, hospitals, and supplies as much as Oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid. Just think about it! Having said that, it is simply impossible to do justice to the matter in a two-hour film. In Joffe's defense, however, I would say they had an impossible task, particularly because he chose a diverse script with multiple graphics, multiple angles, and multiple characters. What, exactly, was he thinking, and how could he be so arrogant in thinking that that would work? This is Hollywood, I guess. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY have so many flaws that it would take a book to list them all. Horrible casting. Terrible writing (and politically motivated). Bad science. The portraits of Groves and Oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright offensive. Despite the script's very obvious agenda, it's still incredibly bland and sloppy. <br /> <br /> These flaws were listed elsewhere in IMDb, but I was particularly impressed by the fact that scientists had so much time on their hands - softball, horseback riding, partying, semi-formal dinners, ballet, etc. ., not to mention the novel, and, of course, circulating political petitions. According to FM & LB, if these great brains had gotten rid of their duffs and actually spent some time in the lab, instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could have won the war before D- > One last complaint - - FM & LB mentions that "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were the coded names of the two atomic bombs, but does not mention that these names were a semi-good jab in Groves ("Fat Man" , by heavy stature) and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy", by his slight stature). Another reason why Paul Newman should not have been in this movie ...
