Ignore the extreme vows about "House of Wax," it's by no means a "1" or a "10." I'll try to help someone think about seeing "House of Wax" or those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what the trailers should do. There's only one thing right with the trailers, if the producers can not put together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it's almost certain that the movie is a big sucking party. But a good trailer just tells you that some things about the movie are good, this does not give you much idea about the total package. Here, a little research can be valuable. "House of Wax" starring Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than her Canadian colleague Sarah Polley or her co-star Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his film debut. These are not good signs, but if you're like me, you ignore them and see the work of the production designer, Grace Walken, responsible for the "Ghost Ship" look. Once again Walken's work is worth to be seen, so much so that it seems that 90% of the film's $ 30 million budget went into production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she had to do throughout the film (fingers cut, lips glued, tied, and lots of fussy things). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than her in "The Next Next Door," about a big crap to have a big weight problem. <br /> <br /> Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and staff. And judging by what was on the screen, this may actually be true. It seems like everyone has donated their time to get their first credit from actor or team. Unfortunately, either from inexperience or jealousy about the pay gap, the contributions of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers are less than zero. <br /> <br /> Steven Window's inexperienced work was as terrible as seeing and working in the league with an incompetent editor such as Joel Negran (enter "Pearl Harbor" here) they manage to get most of the value added by the group of production design. Rather than delaying and viewing the scenarios, Window filmed these things in low light and with the oscillating camera job. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Low illumination, an ADD type camera and an intense cut are what you use to hide the cheap and low quality production design; is not what is needed when the film's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets. <br /> <br /> Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer though aside from the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the film does not take itself seriously as a horror movie and is mostly parody (insert "Van Helsing" here). Murders are thrown by laughter, too extreme to be scary or even scary to anyone over the age of six. The audience was particularly shocked when a certain heiress from a high-profile hotel got her homemade face crossed by a steel bar, though her first half-cooked striptease was the only genuinely scary thing in the movie. Another highlight of the comedy was when Cuthbert sticks his finger in a railing and is cut off by the bad guy. <br /> <br /> Good scenes happen at Trudy's Wax House, a wax shop that has something to do with an enclosed sugar mill, Siamese twins, and many run-ins (which Cuthbert takes to bathe). All of this was supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida, though from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan's country (the locators of attention location - the gulf coast is not known for its rolling terrain). The script apparently intended to create the connection (bad pun) between the two pairs of twins, but sometime during production or post-production most of the dialogue about it was trimmed. Since what's left over the double connection does not make sense and does not get you anywhere, you wonder why it was not cut too to reduce the boredom factor. <br /> <br /> What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first class horror classic, even with the existing cast. What faced them in the face was the chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a city of wax. Being a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception, prone to create an illusion of reality. Here they had an opportunity ready to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an Impressionist painting, the city creates the illusion of reality at a distance, but reveals itself closely as a highly stylized waxwork. Of course they would have to find a director and a visionary DP to take the thing forward successfully, but everything else was already ready for that to happen.
