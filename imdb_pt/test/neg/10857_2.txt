This film is juxtaposition of several characters of super tough bikers, vaguely connected, but without a real plot. Some of the scenes are well filmed. If they took the same cast and crew, and made a movie called Gent, which was the coolest character in the movie and created an interesting and continuous story, it might be decent. So get ready for a series of tough character intrigues, who do nothing but bike the desert all day and cause trouble while everyone is never burning and keeping their hair and clothes perfect and never needing to look for a house or money, etc. There was a kind of background story about the characters going through several people who were killed and a treasure that probably should be the plot.
