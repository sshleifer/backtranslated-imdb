While traveling with a team of flaws for the Miss Galaxy dispute, the plane piloted by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) crashes into an isolated, where Noah's Ark is protected by the Jurassic pig. As the group struggles to survive, the alien monkeys plan to use the ark to destroy the human race and rule the planet Earth. <br /> <br /> I like parodies, but "Miss Castaway" is an offense to human brains. The terrible story and the special effects are very, very bad indeed. There are spoofs with Lost, Castaway, Jurassic Park, Sixth Sense, Titanic, Planet of the Apes, Lost Ark Hunters, Congo, MIB, Perfect Storm, , "Austin Powers," "Shark," "Mission Impossible," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "Star Wars," and "Hulk," but the problem is that most of them are very silly and not funny. In the end, the trailer is better than the movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mission Almost Impossible" ("Mission Almost Impossible")
