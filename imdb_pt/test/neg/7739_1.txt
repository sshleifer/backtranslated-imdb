Every kid eventually learns the lesson that just because a girl is beautiful does not mean that she is good. Well, let me tell you, at age 19, lessons learned. It's hard to say what's worse: Kathy Ireland's acting skills or her ultra-high voice; which sounds like a rattling rat in helium, scratching its tiny claws over a blackboard. With an incomprehensible plot in outer space with dwarves who want the bones of Kathy Ireland for some obscure reason, this movie is wrong on many levels. If ever there was a candidate for a revival of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, that would be it.
