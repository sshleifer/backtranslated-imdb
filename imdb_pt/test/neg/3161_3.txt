This is a movie with a lot of potential, well done and acted, with a rather rough and inconsistent screenplay. A young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment because flattened husbands in the shop where he cuts stolen cars are aggravating her son's asthma. Husband ends up in jail when the car stolen from an ex pat is tracked to his shop, ex pat ends up being kind, generous and naive shmoe (and quite a cardboard and learned almost nothing from him), but ends with the girl, who "commercializes" despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband. I hope this film succeeds in Czech, where it will be welcome because of its obvious premise - "Former pats may have money, they may even receive our women, but they are old, soft and our women want to be satisfied, we may be poor, but ... Now, if Evzen could keep Marcela happy so she would not have to play with her, or if he already had a family in Italy ... but that would complicate matters.
