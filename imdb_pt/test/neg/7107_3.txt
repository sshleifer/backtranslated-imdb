The film is very fast, bizarre and colorful, it's like Mad Max at speed with tons of colorers and makeup. Also very caricatured, as said this; cartoon sequence appears here and there. The plot is also very cheeky, but I think so too. The thing that really drives me crazy in this movie, are the characters, they are painfully annoying, especially Rebecca played by Lori Petty, she is really annoying (I believe she is the most annoying creature I have ever seen). The editing is also annoying, very stylized by MTV. Another thing that is missing in Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. The humor is not very funny either. However, many people love this movie, most of them are women, and this is not strange, because this movie is about the power of the girls. Tank Girl this is a true girl movie, and the best example of a hate / love movie.
