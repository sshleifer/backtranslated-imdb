... I usually hate puns, but this seems to be the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard." I suspect I'm not the first. And I'm sure many, many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders. It certainly bothered me right away. But there is much more wrong with this film than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I were a parent, I would be irritated by the violent turn that comes near the end of the movie. confrontation with the coyotes. (Though, for me, at least you've injected some action.) And from the standpoint of conventional writing, you can expect coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict (Wow, you have a cow "widow" ... maybe your "husband" was killed by coyotes? No ... there is a much more stupid explanation.) And what kind of farm is that? Otis promises to protect all animals from damage, but it certainly does not seem to threaten humans. They make reference to the farmer being vegan, but what is he raising pigs for? In the animal stories of all the children - Babe, Charlotte's Web, his name ... the reality of farm life is at least touched. Maybe our friendly farmer is doing some kind of rescue shelter (there's some reference to that, but that's never explained). But all the farmer gets is the abuse of a horse in a scene that was supposed to be funny, but it left me seriously wondering if he would end up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. And what the hell is the deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without the ball joke. <br /> <br /> Add some really terrible attempts at emotional scenes, an almost complete lack of laughter, and those UDDERS, and you have the worst children's movie I've seen in ages. I usually just post on IMDb to highlight a movie that is not so well known, not to beat the current # 2 hit box office. But this movie pissed me off. It was taking up space in my local theater, space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. There was good family entertainment this summer - in fact, there were at least two more children's movies playing in the same multiplex. But I can not see something like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can fool families with an extra $ 30. At least I had a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that at 35 years without children, this movie was not made for me. But there's no excuse for a childish movie as lazy and terrible as "Barnyard" in the Pixar era. I was bored with the "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly did not piss me off like "Barnyard." "Shark Tale" was a weak attempt at street hip hop, but there was some laughter. Incidentally, you could call Nickelodeon at any time of the day and see something more fun and clever - which is why they should be ashamed to put their name in that trash. <br /> <br /> giving it a 2 out of 10, just because Pip The Mouse was sporadically fun, and Maria Bamford had some fun lines as the wife of the farmers. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmer. They did not really explain who she was. They did not explain many things. Especially not because Sam Elliot - the supreme "man of man" - had an udder wiggling around. Creepy.
