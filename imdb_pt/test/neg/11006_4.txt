Director John Madden of Shakespeare in Love gives us another very bad film in Ethan Frome. The plot revolves around a new Reverend who arrives in the town of Starkfield, where he learns the story of the sick wife of crippled man Ethan Frome and a romantic date with the maid. Adapted by Richard Nelson from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edith Wharton's novel, this film is not interesting, at least thanks to an abysmally weak script and the misdirection that turns supposedly poignant scenes into laughable schmaltz. Still, there are other aspects besides the movie that works - cinematography is well done, Rachel Portman contributes a great score and while no one is at her best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan work well in their roles . But overall, Ethan Frome is just marginally worth it and is easily overlooked.
