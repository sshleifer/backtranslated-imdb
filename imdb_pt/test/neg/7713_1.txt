I'm furios! It's been a while since the last zombie movie I watched, so I was really looking forward to watching a good zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A reasonable story but terrible acting, filming, dialogues and nauseating clich√©s and jokes. I have not even seen the first one that is supposed to be worse than this ... now I'm curious about how bad that could have been! The movie is full of mistakes and jokes. Who on earth analyzes DNA using a blood sample? Why did these "special forces" who "went to hell and came back" fight like spoiled 6-year-old girls? We saw ferocious zombies biting, incidentally, hundreds of them waving their arms at our two "heroes", knocking them to the ground and then releasing them without even a scratch. I could go on talking about it but life is too short and I've already wasted a few hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the film industry.
