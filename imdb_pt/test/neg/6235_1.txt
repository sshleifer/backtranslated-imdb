What a movie bomb. The story goes nowhere and it does not get anywhere. Leave the theater goer with his arms up saying "that's it". What happened to Redford? He was once a righteous actor. Now he thinks he can appear on set and do some scenes and it's a scene. Wrong. What a film without emotion. I do not want to be so cruel, but what a crap. Unbelievable amateur shit. If I were in this movie, I would be so embarrassed that it would not show my face. I tell you, if I was associated with this movie, I'm in trouble. This movie will fall into the annals of cinema as the king of the bombs with which all others will be compared.
