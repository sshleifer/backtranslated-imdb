Army soldier Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapeze trapeze, is criticized for daring stunts without a net and for alienating his high-frequency cohorts; In the meantime, there's a 'camp show' set up to put soldiers and Army personnel on, and the entire M-G-M studio came out to join the fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (unctuously), featuring artists such as Kay Kyser and His Orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter and the M-G-M Dancing Girls (who seem to be dressed like vegetables). Red Skelton does a little bit cute with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comic parts suffer from an apparent gap between the artists and the supposed audience (they remain silent until the editor criticizes them for exaggerated reaction shots). ). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a night of jumping at Carnegie Hall (unlikely to be accompanied by the classic pianist Jose Iturbi, whom Judy calls "hep"). The production is brilliant, but the manic energy seems false, fabricated. ** in ****
