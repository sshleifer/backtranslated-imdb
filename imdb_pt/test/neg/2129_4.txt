I really wanted to like this movie, because I have admiration for the cinema to take the Italian breath (especially Jaws rip-offs!), But the simple fact is that the Monster Shark is not very good. All signs of this are a large piece of trash; we have one of the kings of the useless cult film, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiw, assuming the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give the best of this sort of film has to offer a rush for money, but somehow the film still manages to be quite obsolete. The fact that the 'monster shark' does not appear very often is probably a good thing, given the creature's design, but there is never enough elsewhere to pass the movie without it. The plot focuses on a resort off the south Florida coast (or rather somewhere in Italy) where several local people have appeared in the water with arms and legs missing. It does not take long for local authorities to decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it is up to a heterogeneous team of sea experts to capture it alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film is that it always seems very meaningless, and just like in character development or storytelling, even the least demanding viewers are likely to get bored in no time . . This type of film is hardly famous for being brilliant, although the entertaining element of films like 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' are unfortunately missing for most of the runtime. The thing I love about lead actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to be taking himself seriously, no matter what movie he's in (although he's only done four). This is certainly the case here, although Bava never really allows him to fully immerse himself, and often it feels like a spare wheel like the rest of the movie. Much of the execution time is spent observing the various characters of American beer, and it's not very fascinating; although Bava manages to come along well to the end with a fun bustle of action as the central monster finally manages to wreak havoc on its possible captors. Overall, there is not much to recommend this movie. As mentioned, I really like this sort of thing and even I found myself bored on several occasions. Only for the Italian hardcore horror fans!
