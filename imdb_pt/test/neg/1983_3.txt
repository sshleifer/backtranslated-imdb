I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I saw this movie because I heard there are autobiographical aspects in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow images on the walls. So the narrator always says abstract phrases like, "A child sells a fortune, but her box is empty now." This is really disturbing and was not really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is. The film shows how Kinski's character treated the woman and how he kept them under control. If there are actually some aspects of Kinski's life in this story - then he really was a pig. So there's no need to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you like junk movies to laugh at.
