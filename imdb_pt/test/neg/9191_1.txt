This really is an exercise in shivering. Dressed as a tribute to firefighters, it contains stupid scenes of "we're just a bunch of crazy kids" in the middle of the parts "my God, this can be really dangerous." Mostly he's just an idiot. You can not believe for a single minute that real firefighters do. It's so awful I could not stand watching sometimes. If my daughter had not hired him and insisted on seeing him to the end, I would have had no choice but to turn him off. <br /> <br /> The thing is, I'm a John Travolta fan. Every interview of yours I've seen just raises my opinion on it. I think this was strictly for the money. I'm sure he'll be happy when he's forgotten.
