Back to college I studied marketing and, despite having lost many classes and never paid attention, I will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing, namely: it is not what you sell; It's how you sell it! This principle applies fully to the "Devil's Triangle", since it is basically a beautifully wrapped and attractive, but empty package. Writer and director Richard Winer knew exactly what had to divert the viewer's attention from the main inaccuracies, so he laid out some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a scary atmosphere, such as the sinister voice of the narrator Vincent Price and the eccentric. music of King Crimson. And I'm guessing that the little dirty tricks of Richard Winer worked very efficiently, since there was a huge hype of the Bermuda Triangle going on in the mid-'70s and literally all movie production? whether it was an inaccurate documentary or a scary movie exploit ?? covering the theme made a lot of money at the box office. "The Devil's Triangle" overwhelms you with unstructured and often irrelevant data, but the severe dramatization of the facts and of course the frightening and intimidating voice of the all-powerful Vincent Price creates an atmosphere of fear and shiver. The narration constantly jumps back and forth in time and covers a huge amount of "strange occurrences" and "mysterious disappearances" of ships and airplanes in the Bermuda Triangle over a period of almost a century, but the reports remain extremely vague in every moment. and the eloquent mr. Price invariably ends each chapter with the ominous words "just another unresolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle." After a few cases, the whole formula becomes ridiculous and almost pathetic, but I think it caused genuine mass hysteria in 1974. The documentary expands a little more on the most notorious mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle, like the five military 19 which inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the USS Cyclops ship, but still in these chapters only a minimum of useful information is given. Cameras never at one point are underwater to explore the depths of the Bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the supposed real-life witnesses to the dramas look suspiciously like staged acting scenes. If you are looking for an objective and informative documentary about the Bermuda Triangle, I certainly would not recommend this movie, but if you want to sit and listen to the mesmerizing voice of Vincent Price for almost an hour, this is your chance!
