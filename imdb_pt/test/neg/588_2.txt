I did not like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this, but seriously, I was really bored watching it. There was virtually no action. Although the soundtrack of the classical orchestra was very good. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this movie appears on TV, I feel like changing the station instantly. Not because it's a bad movie, just because I know what I'm doing when I watch it - total and total boredom. It's a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into science fiction ... because it just was not real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood half of the movie anyway.
