This fantasy was absolute rubbish. I thought Michael Moore cornered the market in ridiculous anti-government films, but this was much worse than anything he ever did. No wonder critics of the British media complain that this is driven by tabloid journalism. This movie is the biggest fantasy of a left-wing lunatic that comes to life on the big screen. Anyone, even slightly to the right of such aggressive Bush fanatics, should be shocked if ever there was any funding to be done. I am sure you will do well in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It is hard to believe that in these days of insane Muslims who blow up innocent passengers there is someone in the UK who thinks that Britain should surrender in the war on terror. I do not think it's the country I admired for being alone against the Nazis almost 70 years ago. All hail Neville Chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement!
