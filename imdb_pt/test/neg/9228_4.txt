That's what this movie really takes. A big piece of cheeze. This movie is about a kind of double brother and sister Bonnie and Clyde who creates their own party line to lure their victims and arrest them and kill them. But for what reason? Just for the fun of running away from it? In comes Richard Hatch who comes across a wishy washy ladies man. A true BAD version of a ladies man. And he gets involved in finding out who's behind all the murders in LA. He finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and the rest is for his fun and fun. But there are parts in this movie that really leave me as the scene with Lief Garret dressed in her mother's wedding dress acting like a young girl in front of her sister saying that he needs her and can not live without her and seeing as she beats him in the face dominating him. I can not believe it was Lief !!! Well, I guess I could. But it's worth watching, but only to see one of the worst Garrets movies he's ever made.
