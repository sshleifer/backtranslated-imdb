Another Indian legend you've never heard of before is loose. As the name implies, this is a vindictive apparition that likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they are still using them. As usual, ancient cemeteries (can we say, "Poltergeist?") Were disturbed by greedy land developers cliches building things. <br /> <br /> The CGI, if it had been better, could have made the effect more look treacherous, but they skimped on the budget, and it shows - to the comic effect. The unleashed creature probably should have been off the stage during his first murders - which could have added some mystery or imminent atmosphere of destruction - but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like, and it was not impressive. The killings are just poorly done, again with poor CGI. I think ancient spirits always kill using cheap special effects. As for the "victims," ​​they seem to laugh at any moment while making silly screams. It is always obvious who will get it: a character with only a few lines appears, strange noises are heard, CGI points fly, leave the character. Repeat (several times). <br /> <br /> Still, there are some chase scenes with the monster that really made this watchable thing. Unfortunately, the director seems to be using this as a device to use (so it's often used) when he can not think of anything else for his characters to do. Overall, it's very silly, but I've seen worse. This movie is cheap, but it is curiously fun to watch.
