First, this is not an adaptation of a Stephen King book, short story, novel or anything else. From EW's website, and his review of the show when it aired for the first time, "... he never writes for audiences, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. "Stephen King" (CBS, July 16, 9-11 at night), is no exception. "The series would apparently be (as others have already mentioned) a series in progress, and it is by which we never saw the end after the cliffhanger left us.But this was never clear to the viewers who wondered how it all ends. When the series went on videotape, she introduced herself as having the " final never seen before! "" Should have said, "the end should never be seen!" <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** The end was the only significant part changed for the video (although parts of the whole were omitted), and that changed the ending was what destroyed the story. For example, instead of our two intrepid FBI agents realizing that they were now labeled as crooks and fleeing from the evil Jude Anderson of The Shop (as originally aired), Jude simply walks up to them ... And they shoot him. . Bang, dead and without real emotion to talk about the scene. Same in part with Harlan and his wife going poof. Whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff-hanger, in the video, they simply get out of the cock-a-doodie car. <br /> <br /> *** End Spoiler *** It was a sad ending to a well-made mini-series, and makes the video not worth buying, or even rent. Honestly, save your money and your time.
