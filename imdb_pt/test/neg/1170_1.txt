The title tells everything - Ed Gein, the butcher of Plainfield. <br /> <br /> It's not an action-packed horror movie made for teenagers rich in energy drinks. This would fit into a well-established genre, the kind some people find amusing, something like "Halloween" or "The Chainsaw Massacre." <br /> <br /> This is dark, slow, filled with chopped corpses and silently evil. There are few crash cuts, no monster point of view, no loud electronic sound. I do not know who it's meant for - ghouls, maybe. <br /> <br /> Beneath the credits we already see pictures of skulls, hanging carcasses, fur wrapped around the backs of chairs, that sort of thing. And they are disgusting enough that I could not help but think that this movie should be very good to compensate for this opening in Grand Guignol. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is not. The acting is uniformly awful, as in a high school play. The script does its best to sink beneath the vulgarity. Ed Gein, who has killed only two middle-aged women and perhaps his brother, chases a young, bloody woman through the Weir Forest, and she is wearing only a modern bra and bikini rather than underwear. Gein also beheaded a night watchman, which he never did in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> The direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, police discover an abandoned car with blood strewn across the windshield. There is nobody. The nice young sheriff turns to his boss and suggests that they look for the victim, who may still be in the neighborhood and live. The sheriff, without any motivation, shouts at him, "Now you just FORGOT this! I do not want you to get OUT OF THE HALF COCKED on anything!" It should be no more than an exchange of business views. Why does the director have the sheriff so angry? Characters of various types listen to radio programs or records that play old jazz pop songs - Louis Armstrong's "Is not Misbehaving", for example. This is - what - rural WISCONSIN in the 50's? And the characters insist on music that appealed to the Harlem Cotton Club customers in the 1930s, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. No. The radio would play "Wheel of Fortune," by Kitty Kallen, Theresa Brewer, or Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between music and events adds anything to our understanding of what is happening under the images. Someone involved in the production only liked old jazz pop songs, that's all. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is only so much you can do on a low budget, but it can take light years ahead of this massacre. See "Ed Gein," with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his propensity for corpses, and with a budget that could not have far exceeded that. <br /> These comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. This is as far as I've got. If anyone finds that this tale is well executed and fascinating in some way, he should try to find some insight into his taste. It's below mine - and I consider myself quite deformed.
