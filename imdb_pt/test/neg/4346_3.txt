Not "confused" in the sense that, "Wow, this movie is really complex and therefore hard to follow!" But confusing in the sense that, "Gee, this movie really has no idea what it's doing!" <br /> <br /> THE DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a collaboration between Hong Kong and South Korea, but it is total nonsense. A film about parallel universes mixed with time travel mixed with a love story mixed with folly. <br /> <br /> The movie has the kind of concept that confuses the mind. Again, it does not confuse the mind because it is so large and complex, but it confuses itself in the sense that it is so ridiculous and one can not conceive of someone who has such a horrible premise to begin with. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the DREAM OF WARRIOR makes sense, and that's because the whole movie should never have been made. It's awful. The only saving grace is the actress who plays the warrior (not the female protagonist). <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
