I received a copy of this movie from a friend for my 21st birthday, which he obviously got 99p from a bargain bin. <br /> <br /> I've never been so frustrated when I watched a movie - it was tedious, Adam West was wasted (literally) and in retrospect I can not remember anything about it. My lack of pleasure grew so much that the second the credits rolled, we broke the cassette and hung the tape in the living room. Just for precaution, we put fire on the cover.
