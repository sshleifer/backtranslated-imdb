I must begin this comment with a kind of admission: I suppose I have only a soft spot for the original TV series of the 60s-70s. I think the filmmakers have spoiled everything since the release: in an alleged remake, the audience was looking for reflexes in the hip, athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III), or cool, with that, Michael Cole, and so on. Instead we have Giovanni Ribisi as a poor little rich white boy who looks pathetic, as if he were in all his roles (in the office where I used to work, I once had fun creating a fake movie poster, climbing a number of actors as members of the office team; guess who I play as the stupid son of the CEO?). The Danes are just like the new Julie, but none of the characters have much to do, as the story just lies there, bogged down in convention. So it's pretty forgettable in addition. What was I talking about?
