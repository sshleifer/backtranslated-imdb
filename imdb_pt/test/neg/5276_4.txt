The German regional broadcasting station WDR showed both "The General" and ODC. On Saturday I saw "The General" and I thought, it was not too bad, but it was not very good either. But yesterday I saw the ODC and hung up after about an hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the lead actor, the film was totally confusing and looks restless. "The General" told the story and ordered, but ODC just wanted to be legal. There is a reference in Guy Ritchie's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" movies, but he does not have the coolness of these films. <br /> <br /> So in the end I would rate 3 out of 10!
