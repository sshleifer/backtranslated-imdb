According to Milan Kundera, a porcelain cat holding a red rose is denying the crap. Well, criminals guilty of doing this series probably wanted to show how to do a total opposite of the porcelain cat holding a red rose. Because the teenage sleazoides Beavis and Butthead are enthusiastically from the place where the sun does not shine and their insanity infects the whole stoopid series. MTV received MUCH baffle from its nudity beauties, while THIS is receiving positive reviews on IMDb. Well, newsflash for everyone - your butt's cool too, if you come out showing in the middle of winter - something these two would probably do. Still, there's no need to make a movie about your ass - and yes, those two would probably do that too.
