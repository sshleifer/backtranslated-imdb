This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who is the sole survivor of the accident of an allied reconnaissance aircraft in Belgium in January 1944, is a mess. The title would lead you to think it's mostly a story about Belgian armed resistance groups, but this seems to be just a backdrop to sustaining a stupid love story between Ted and Claire, the woman who takes Ted. is a committed member of resistance, but it is Claire who decides, in the absence of Henri and against his wishes, to give shelter to Ted. <br /> <br /> Crucial plot details make no sense. Central in history is the recovery of the recorder in the inactive plane containing the navigation codes and the target positions. But in the opening scene we see Belgians plundering the plane, members of the resistance between them. Why did not they recover the valuables at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to come and keep the plane? And the whole matter of transferring Ted out of the area was conducted using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have been just a simple exchange. Heavy music tries, but fails, to give some weight to this lukewarm enterprise. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between Ted and Claire. At first, Claire is dedicated to taking care of Ted from near the death and, when Ted begins to recover, they are physically involved (whereas Henri is conveniently removed from conducting businesses of resistance). Julie Ormond does an acceptable job as Claire, but it affects a French accent that I often find impossible to understand. Her responses seemed a bit weak at times - when informed of the deaths of several members of the town, she reacted as if she had just learned that the local grocery store was without peaches. Like Ted, Bill Paxton seems to be just reciting his lines; his performance is so uninspired that it's embarrassing. A true American pilot can evidence a personality so flat, but does not contribute to the convincing cinema. I did not feel any chemistry between these supposed lovers. <br /> <br /> The stupidest is the way Ted and Claire act as holiday lovers. Perhaps the sexual release of such heavy situations is understandable, but to seem totally unaware of the gravity of the situation is difficult to understand. At first, Ted is sent to an attic room and Claire worries about his entrance into the house. But as things develop, he not only walks into the house, he dances with Claire with loud music, walks into the neighboring barn to play baseball with a local boy, and ends up traveling by car with Claire to a nearby town. The young man seems to be more committed to his role, but he is harmed by the script. He has an incredible ability to be at crucial events without being noticed. And when he delivers sentences like: "Have you ever seen someone hanged? They seem to be dancing but can not find the ground." <br /> <br /> You feel like the writer is talking and not a boy of thirteen. <br /> And by the way, there are scenes to show that the Nazis are terrible faces. <br /> <br /> Comparing this film with the brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" on the Polish resistance, or the equally stellar "Lacombe, Lucien" on the French resistance, one realizes what really is sad.
