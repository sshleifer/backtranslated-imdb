No one will confuse THE SQUALL for a good movie, but it sure is memorable. Once you play Myrna Loy's performance as Nubi, the hot-blooded Gypsy girl, you probably will not forget the experience. When this film was made, Miss Loy, exotically beautiful, was still being cast as a foreign, generally Asian and generally sinister shrew. She is certainly an eyeful here. It looks like his skin was darkened and his hair was curled. In most scenes she is barefoot and wearing little more than a skirt and a loose peasant blouse, while in a scene she uses nothing but a patterned towel. I suppose I am concentrating on the appearance of Miss. Loy, because she is by far the best, if not the only, to tune into this ancient antiquity and keep watching. You certainly will not be drawn to dialogue, which is impossible. In a typical passage, Nubi looks out of the window at the caravan that starts off and becomes poetic: "Always the gypsies, they sing, strange and sad, when the great sun has a breath of fire that burns, and when the pale moon looks behind the cloud and breathe cold air like death, they sing. " Poetic or what? Lovers of purple prose will have a picnic. I can not help wondering, however, whether in her last years Miss. Loy chose not to remember her involvement with this project. <br /> <br /> Like many of the early talkies, this was an adaptation of a recent Broadway hit. . The theatrical version was inaugurated at the 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and lasted more than a year. The play provoked a famous episode involving comedian and theater critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have an aversion to characters who spoke in thick dialect or pidgin English. According to a very repeated anecdote, Mr. Benchley squirmed uncomfortably in the opening part of this program. The setting of the Spanish village (moved to a village in Hungary for the film for some reason) gave the actors space to practice their accent with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience reached its limit when, during a sequence of family dinner, a door exploded. opened and an actress dressed as a gypsy girl came running into the room yelling "Help! Help me!" She then threw herself at the feet of the mistress of the house and exclaimed "Me Nubi! Me good girl! Stay me here!" At this point Mr. Benchley got up and announced to his companion, "I, Bobby, I, the bad boy, I'm going now," and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The film version offers numerous examples of unintentional humor, but never comes close to Benchley's intelligence level. The melodramatic plot relates to the Lajos family: father Josef, mother Maria, and son Paul, a student of the neighboring school. We would consider this affluent "upper middle class" family, as they are landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is abruptly turned into tumult when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their house is invaded by, yes. Nubi, the gypsy nubile girl. She arrives at their door during the title storm - symbolizing tempestuous emotions, I would say. The girl is fleeing from an abusive relationship and asks for sanctuary. After considering the matter, the Lajos family agrees to hide it from their angry lover, who appears shortly after, but is rejected. Nubi becomes a servant in the house. Gentleness motivates the family's decision to accept her, but soon the small-to-nothing conniving Nubi paid back seducing all the physically capable men in the neighborhood, beginning with the servant of Lajos, Peter, and then climbing. to son Paul. Nubi breaks up Paul's relationship with her fiance Irma (played by Loretta Young as a teenager), causing him to be disapproved out of school, and then induces him to buy his jewelry by stealing the savings from the maid Lena (ZaSu Pitts). Lena, in turn, is still mourning the loss of her own fianc√©, Peter, seduced and cast aside by Nubi when she turned her attentions to Paul. Finally, Nubi keeps an eye on Josef's paterfamilias, and I suppose, if the time was longer, she would have gone after Uncle Dani, Maria, the village priest, and God knows who else. <br /> <br /> I think it goes without saying that such a scenario easily lends itself to parody, but during the first half of THE SQUALL it exerts the undeniable fascination of a daytime soap: we watched, hypnotized, while the Bad Girl works her spell on men. -folk and wraks havoc as an irresistible force of nature (almost like-- a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But as the machinations of the plot flutter in the extravagant amusement, it disappears. During the later scenes, Nubi is not emphasized and the focus shifts to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while these people become a real drag. The child in particular behaves like an absolute heel, but parents never recognize it or face their own shortcomings; everything, they tell us, is Nubi's fault, that unlucky bum. <br /> <br /> The men in the cast are dull. In addition to Miss. Loy, the only actress who can perform on the talkies is ZaSu Pitts, great as always. The mother of the Lajos family is played by Alice Joyce, a longtime silent star who was out of her element with talking papers and who retired shortly thereafter. The cool elegance of Loretta Young provides a good contrast to Nubi's obscure fascination, but her line readings are so strange that they're adorable. No, there's only one reason to watch this movie, and that's Nubi herself. I can not think of another actress who could have played this foolish role and managed to get out of the half as well. I'm not an objective observer, though. I have a desperate passion for Myrna Loy and I will see her in anything, even in THE SQUALL.
