I watched this movie with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranian. <br /> <br /> When the tape started, me and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake. at the end of this cave like area. I told her to close my eyes and it did not matter what happened in not opening them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and after a few seconds they began to scream. The Nazi's faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds, the videotape jumped from the VCR and landed in the box and the top closed. Me and my girlfriend were unharmed. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the videotape was placed in a wooden crate and stored in an enormous deposit of identical wooden boxes, never to be seen again.
