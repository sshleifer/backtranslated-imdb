Once again, Bronson's talent is largely wasted with this 1984 thriller, which is much more disturbing than most games today. The fact that "The evil that men do" is very disturbing (in their verbal and verbal representations of torture) not the problem. It is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. Curiously, this movie seems to symbolize the latter part of Bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same notoriously predictable and non-creative scenarios. This good actor is expected to rise again.
