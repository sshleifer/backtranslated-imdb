Having just watched Acacia, I think I have to agree with the negative comments here. I like Asian and Korean horror, and I had high expectations for this movie. Dude, I was disappointed. Watching this, I kept thinking, "Surely they only do this to get me off guard later," and for a while I expected something ingenious to happen. However, I slowly realized that the movie really is that bad. It's the cheapest money in the Asian terror market I've seen so far. The basic story may not be that bad, but the way it's filmed seems the most laughable plot of all time. The tree as a "scary" device can be good if used intelligently, but all the filmmaker does is give us different images of ... yes, a tree, again and again. He seems to expect the tree to do all the work for it in terms of tension and growth, but it looks like it is: shots of a tree. For the love of God! Slow clumps can be very effective, and a film that presents the viewer with only a glimpse of what is wrong can cause good crises but not Acacia. Of course, we have a glimpse of a child in a tricycle disappearing in a corner, and, once again, significant photos of the tree from above, or below, or the side, but these scenes are not scary. They feel silly, especially since you realize that the director means they are scary. They simply are not. <br /> <br /> In addition I agree with some of the other reviewers, that the characters are ridiculous. In particular, a character's "descent into madness" is laughable. However, what really breaks Acacia is the terrible issue. It's hard to understand why the scenes have been cut the way they are, but it's bad and kills any spark of interest they may have. It also makes me feel patronized because I can see what they are trying to achieve with this but I can not believe they think I would fall for such cheap stratagems. <br /> <br /> There are many great Asian ghost movies, and many of the bad ones, but this is by far the worst I have ever seen. They should be going through the 'what to put in ghost movies' list and tagged them all, but in the end they forgot to add the actual movie.
