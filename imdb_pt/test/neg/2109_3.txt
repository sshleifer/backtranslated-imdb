The movie begins in Mexico where a girl was cursed, she spits on snakes through green jelly and her friend tries all those crazy spells to lift the curse. He does nothing but sing a horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border and catch the train to go to LA to see his uncle to lift the curse. Comical hilarity follows. This movie has the same snakes again and again! There are snakes and pythons that never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes that does not make sense. The whole movie has some funny lines, some weak effects, but the most important thing is a great ending that leaves you like WHAM BAM WHAT DAD HAS ALREADY HAPPENED !!!!! The whole movie is about a 1, but the ending is a 10, so by my mad math he gets a total of 3. When blockbuster has nothing else you want, take it to mindless entertainment!
