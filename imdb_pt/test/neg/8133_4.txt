Julien Hernandez is certainly an attractive and personable person on the screen. In fact, his character carries this whole movie, or what it's worth. The problem is that, with the exception of his friend gallon (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / boyfriend for some of the characters), no one even comes close. Hernandez plays a director of 30 years of Cuban origin and unknown sexuality, who comes to Los Angeles and gets a job to make a gay documentary. In the process of finding a group of gay people finding affairs, he leaves ... but very, very. Even at 88 minutes, the film was obviously stretched and stuffed with various school-movie devices, most of which only end up uselessly interrupting the narrative (which is not much to begin with) or pointing to the general amateurism of cinema. <br /> <br /> What a pity, because there is a love story here somewhere, and the final three minutes, when Sebastien de Hernandez finally clicks on a wealthy West Hollywood sniper (well underestimated by Lonnie Henderson) and they share some sensual kisses with soul, works despite everything that came before. But we really do not care about any of the other characters or their situations: Why would the beautiful Dante have a Eurotrash for a boyfriend? He would not do that. And do not even tell me about the "rules" of Sebastien Paulie's friend to date - no gay man I know, hell no sensible person, period, would put such constrictions on himself or others. And please tell me how Sebastien picks up a peeled banana (which is usually a little shmushy, right?) Thrusting in his ass and have to go to the doctor to remove it? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won an award for this movie as a "short" - it probably should have stayed like this. All this said - I would expect to see Hernandez onscreen again, in a better scripted comedy with safer direction.
