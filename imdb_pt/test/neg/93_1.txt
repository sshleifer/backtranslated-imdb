I really liked The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (being the first Urban Menace (1999) I have yet to see). I know it was baaaaad, but the three leaders did a pretty decent job considering all things. <br /> <br /> This, however, was truly atrocious. Ice-T was terrible and he is the producer! I can not say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (which he apparently never learned to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I have ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones did very well in her small role, although she later made some atrocious and racist jokes on her radio show after the tsunami in Southeast Asia (and other occasions, alas). All right, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else leaves with any credit. Strangely, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (which are both very bad here) are much better on the Wrecking Crew, which was made along with Urban Menace at the same time as Corrupt. How this works, I do not know. I'll try to comment on Ice-T now, to see if he apologizes for the movie, or try to make us think it's a great play. to make movies.
