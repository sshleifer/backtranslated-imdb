Voor een verloren soldaat, for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to translate into film a complex and touching psychological study of that most magical moment in a man's life when he is still a child but begins to become a man . The novel chronicles Rudy van Dantzig's real-life experiences, as reported by boy Jeroen, during the last days of World War II, at age 11, while dealing with his incipient sexuality and his deep fears of abandonment when sent to the province. of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands by their parents because of the lack of food in Amsterdam and have not heard of them in many months as the postal service was broken .. The arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is painfully presented cheesy, with the soldiers providing vaudeville-style entertainment. Then a soldier, Walt, Jeroen's novels and the pair is presented as two playful males. They consume their love in a sexual experience. This took into account Jeroen's 11 years. The reality was a little different: Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt, 6 in all, in detail, but in oblique language. But there is no misunderstanding of its nature. Walt is awakened to an intense passion for Jeroen, during which he deals with him rudely, so that in his final meeting, Jeroen is injured and suffering a painful sore on the shoulder, where Walt bit him. During this meeting, Walt rapes Jeroen twice. Jeroen could easily have avoided Walt after their second encounter when Walt attacked him as Walt is clearly eager to maintain his abuse of the other soldier's boy. Why Jeroen keeps looking for Walt is a mystery of the human heart and not explicable by me anyway. What the film sets aside is the result: the nightmares, the doldrums, the frenzied quest across Amsterdam about the chance to find Walt, for Jeroen loved Walt, and nothing could shake it.
