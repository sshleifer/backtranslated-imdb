Sdiner82 clearly had not seen the film in decades, and his memory is terrifying. His attempts to paint Mark Lester's shaving scene as suspicions are completely wrong, as are his incorrect comments about the thug "stalking the body of the child." Lester is dressed the whole time the man is in the room, and the man barely looks at him. <br /> <br /> The scene is a crude attempt to show Lester's innocent curiosity about the body of man. <BR> <BR> Like everything else in this movie, it's badly made, but nothing more. Even sdiner82's comments about the Savalas character who "casually sent a German family to death, pushing their trailer off a cliff" is absurd (it was a single woman, she was already dead, and she was in a car). <br /> <br /> I suggest that sdiner82's critique says much, much more about his, away from the liberal mindset than about this worthless movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I bothered to look, was out of curiosity to see if it was done before or after Kojak. <br /> The film is a useless piece of the 1970s, but Sdiner82's criticism is the worst kind of slander. He closes his review on pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is clearly wrong on almost every "factual" subject he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he sought, which is disturbing. Now he can re-record copies of Catcher in the Rye.
