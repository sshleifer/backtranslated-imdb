My guess is that the producers of this low-budget horror / horror film wanted a serious movie, but the director had his heart set on a parody. So ... that's what we got. Set in an abandoned ship 1000 years in the future and populated with characters and props since the 90s. The set is some industrial complex, maybe a tanker, whatever. They use that's how the controls consist of old TV equipment racks. One place is obviously the employee's canteen and sports an old TV and VCR as well as a plastic water bottle cooler. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines, arguing over the story. The dialog box is full of terms that are very dated ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but maybe the 30th century is too retro? When the captain declares that the cargo of the ships is a load of coffins from the Transylvanian Station, you know that this is all an excuse. It's a bit of Alien, part JasonX, shameless theft of all the best science fiction and horror titles. At one point, Casper VanDien even tells his pilot to "do it" with a serious face. This movie would have been better if they had just let everyone go with the satire, but they kept trying to make the story serious ... maybe the sponsors were on set that day. Anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you're not too picky. FX is as good as the sets are bad.
