The Monkees "Head" is one of those peculiar phenomena that I noticed - that when something does not make sense, people will try to read things and give great deep meanings that their creator never intended. Such is the case here. <br /> <br /> The film is a flowing spectacle of The Monkees consciousness coming in and out of various sketches, blackouts, stage scenes, and so on. similar to your TV show. . But while the TV show has been played for laughter, it does not seem to be touched at all except a kind of deep, trippy pseudo-intellectual state that this psychedelic brand imposes. Overall, it's the Monkees who do the same trick, but now it's "awareness" because the laughing trail is removed. There is no point of humor or meaning for the whole thing; The song on "Head" must prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Monkees did not have an ability to compose. The songs are mostly junk; the only one that is even audible is "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the film. But the thing is, it was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and although it's above average for the Monkees, it's below average by the standards of Goffin and King. It's like listening to one of Peter and Gordon's old songs that Paul McCartney wrote to them: you may think it's a very good song, but then find out who wrote it and realize it's a waste. The music of Mike Nesmith is perhaps passable, the rest is useless. Davy Jones has, I think, what the filmmakers imagined to be "the sheer number" in the picture, since it is the only song presented as The Biz Show and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence, but also falls, only because the music is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I've always liked the Monkees, so the movie is a real disappointment. Of course, they were cheesy, but they were so cheerful about it. <br /> <br /> They knew they were cheesy and they were cool about it. But then they got ambitious. In "Head", they really play about being a pop-manufactured product, but the truth is they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something approaching it. "Boss" proves that they have failed in all respects. 1 * of 4
