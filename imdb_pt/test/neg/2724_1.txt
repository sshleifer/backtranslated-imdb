I am the only one to note that the "realism" of the nineteenth-century ship is erroneous. It's actually a 15th century, around 1620, if memory serves me, because the "realist" ship in the movie is the Mayflower, now, as far as I know, the Mayflower has NEVER been to Australia or tried a trip to to Australia. I do not know who handled R & D for this movie, but using the Mayflower and hoping no one would notice is a bad job. <br /> <br /> They even printed on the cover and on the DVD. I wonder how other people have noticed this little mistake? Not to mention that the movie itself was simply awful, I would have expected better from Sam Neill.
