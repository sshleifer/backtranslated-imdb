Ok, so this was done in 1993. Directed freely by Robert Iscove and written freely by John Miglis, it is supposed to be based on a true story. Hard to believe that someone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. For it was certainly obvious from the beginning that this lady was, after all, she could be. Tim Matheson, looking a little older than I remember him, played the empty-headed man who was looking for romance in his dull, empty life. Well, this came to him in the form of Tracy Pollan, a girl somewhat vague with perverted sex as her means of conquering her friends. <br /> <br /> Come on, phone sex, even in the 90's was an old hat. I can not believe anyone would fall into that old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And that cost him a lot. The most difficult scene to endure was when he finally threw the lady out of his apartment, putting all his garbage in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then had the stupidity of not changing the locks. That's when I had enough of this banal movie. It made me want the lady to have tried on me so I could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a walk. <br /> <br /> I give that chestnut 1 out of 100. That's how bad I thought it was. I think you can not blame the actors. But they were terrible. Did they really try to play this with a serious face?
