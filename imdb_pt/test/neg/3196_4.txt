I saw a big clip of this movie, which I'll talk about later, and then the cast list, and I thought I might give it a try. Basically, a lucky bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his arrogant cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and murder investigation Detective Dehling (John Goodman) all have something in common, they saw the girl of their dreams (married or no), and would do anything to please and be with her until she died. All three met and saw her "one night at McCool's," the bar where Randy worked, they are not aware of each other, but the three can not stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler from Lord of the Rings ). Randy talks to drummer Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, co-producer of the film), Carl for psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Green (Reba) McEntire) and Dehling to priest Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they were willing to do, their sexual contact with her and eventually they are all gathered in one place, all with the intention of being with her, and all involved with the final shooting that leaves one dead , one escaping (and eventually dying) and one stunned, and the unexpected guy she chooses (but at the same time obvious, because she is the obsessed Douglas sex). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to choose a favorite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with Cool Hand Luke in The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler copies the woman washing the car with foam on herself, and in front of Muchman sexy Also, not the most memorable movie. OK!
