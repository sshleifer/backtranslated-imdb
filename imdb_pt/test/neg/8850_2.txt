It would be promising if it was a student film. You never seem to know where you're going next, as if you decided on each of the following scenes when you were making the movie. As a result, much repetition and a cushioning rhythm. There is an absolutely confusing procedure by which ghosts affect people in this world: involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious graduate student, withdrawn behavior, red quarters, dark spots and then, suicides. Good luck finding out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. The characters are barely outlined, which could be OK, but they are completely uninteresting. It is very long and ends when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is absurd. Weak moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.
