This script was slightly original when it was written in 1935, but poor performances and inconsistent quality level make it impossible to recommend. Some of the vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see it so highly rated here on IMDB. Some scenes are worth it, it's like a movie that completely fails to entertain. If you like this kind of montage, run and do not walk and have "Tales of Manhattan" (1942) a wonderful film that accompanies the life and times of a finish.
