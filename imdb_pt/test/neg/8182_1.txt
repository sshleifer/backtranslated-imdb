This movie is strange even for a silent movie. Essentially, there follows the adventures of an engineer in post-revolutionary Russia who dreams of going to Mars. In this film, it seems that the producers KNOW that the Communists really screwed up the country, but also seem to want to make it look like they've done something good. <br /> <br /> So we come to the "Martian Scenes," where everyone on Mars wears goofy hats. They have a revolution after being inspired by the Earthmen, but are quickly betrayed by the Queen who accompanies them. Except it's all a dream, or is it. (And given that the Russian Revolution eventually led to Stalin's dictatorship, it makes you wonder if everything was allegory.) <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the For example, Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin is a good movie.This is just, well, silly.
