**** SPOILER ALERT **** My boyfriend, some friends and I rented this movie as part of a marathon of really bad movies. We kind of knew what we were getting into. But the lack of plot, direction and special effects really left us waiting for a big (or passable) fighting scene between the two main characters ... the poorly processed swimming snake and the super violent giant komodo (who ate people like digging ice (cream) ... we kind of got it in the end, but we had to be interrupted due to possible budget constraints or time? Its only redeeming quality is that it's ridiculously bad, with lots of salient details pointed out by other readers. film if you cut the onions to make themselves cry.
