I think this movie had a very bad production value. The lack of action makes me think that they should mark it as an old docudrama. You may not have money available for your production. I feel bad for being a Major League runner by Jackie Robinson. <br /> <br /> I believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day. He had to be very good at breaking the color barrier of time. Without realizing that this was a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> I wish there was more information about its creators. They may have been limited by the quality of the actors who were willing to take on the project. Maybe with no money to get good people.
