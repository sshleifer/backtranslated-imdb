I was also disappointed with this movie. To begin with, the things that happen to him do not seem so terrible to me (Excuse the Chauvinist chauvinist PoV). As one captor says explicitly, "Most men would pay to be in their position." To which he replies, "But that's not my choice." OK, OK, fair point, so how bad was it really? Please let us know. But now the kicker: He does not let anyone know until after the end of the movie (invisible). Not his girlfriend, not mentor, not the police, not anyone. Instead, it comes with the brilliant plan of f * ck * ng every girl he meets, so he can recognize the tattoo (or something) of one of his captors. I thought he'd had nasty sex enough during the 12 days of his captivity? Is not it time to take a little break from all this? For me, her, to say the least, ill-advised actions broke the film's "disbelief suspension." I picked up a book while watching the last half hour from the corner of my eye.
