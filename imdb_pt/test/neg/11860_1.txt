There is a difference between a "movie" and a "movie". A film, regardless of the quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gathers to do over a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a spectator I have seen examples of both. On September 19, I watched a performance by Donnybrook of screenwriter / director Jon Satejowski. Now, after reading the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the "finished" product) of this piece, I can safely say it's a movie. It's a student film. It is, for lack of a better word, competent, which means that the director knew how to record on a camera and capture moving images. The visual elements are mostly static and not impressive, and the dialogue scenes are reduced to most long shots, with little or no close to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual talent would have been appreciated, and would have been a long way to keep the audience interested. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there have been independent images that have shown that limited camera work can be overcome with a well written and engaging story, plus some clear dialogues. Steven Soderbergh "Sex, lies and videotape" immediately comes to mind. This movie, however, does not have any. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to fix his relationship with his father, then I feel like this movie misses the point. What I've discovered is that Davie's primary aspiration is "to change the face of rock 'n' roll." However, we see very little activity on your part to show this. While there is a dream sequence at the beginning, and an improvised performance of it in the end, all it seems to have are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has done many shows, but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time, SHOW DO NOT TELL THE PUBLIC. Anyone who has done a creative writing class knows that. In addition, Davie does not look like someone who would have been great in the 70s glam rock era; It looks like he'd be more comfortable in the early days of rock 'n' roll, posing as James Dean's less talented brother. Meanwhile, the rest of the films seem to happen randomly to somewhat clich√©d characters, and the plot of the story, which has little or nothing to do with the little main story, is brought in and abandoned with alarming frequency (ie the sub- of Terry). If I want to see a movie with this kind of casual construction, I'll consider watching "Napolean Dynamite" again, a movie I could barely make for the first time. <br /> <br /> As for the above-mentioned dialogue scenes, I think I should mention that they are few and extremely distant from each other. Is asking too much for the characters that speak? I do not think so. When the characters speak, they are short and agitated sentences; collections of such insightful questions, angry grunts, or wildly exaggerated explosions. These characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this, it's easy to understand why there is only a good performance in the film, that of Al Hudson, and it's only because he's doing an imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on the screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a resource director, would have been able to identify those issues and get the writer and the camera to correct them. However, with Satejowski being so close to the material, he simply does not see them, or if he does, he is not willing to take the necessary steps to fix them, because that will undermine his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive way is the mark of an indulgent and misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /> <br /> In the end, we were left with a poor high school set, imitating Zach Braff's incredible "Garden State," combined with the equally incredible "Velvet Goldmine", two much more worthy films of his time. <br /> <br /> Now, before any cast or crew get out of the word work to put me in doubt for this review, let me offer it. The best I can do is to compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make his own film and publicize it for an audience to see. However, the hopes that this film is captured and distributed are simply illusions of grandeur. This is a student film, nothing more, nothing less. If the film has any promise (and let's face it, at this point it will not come from acting, writing or directing), this is it: If, SE, the people associated with this movie are willing, then please learn with this movie, file it and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; do not attack your critics, or make friends or family do it for you. If you are able to do this, perhaps the next one is worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a "movie". <br /> <br /> I'm your audience, and I'm willing to watch.
