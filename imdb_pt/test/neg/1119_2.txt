The only reason to see this movie is Sung Hi Lee, the stunning Korean model / actress who plays "Muka Laka Miki" (give me some time) in this otherwise bad movie. <br /> <br /> She has a substantial part in this movie and seems to handle it well even though neither part is really interesting or well written. Even for a National Lampoon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. I may have laughed once, and this was probably just me being polite. <br /> <br /> Attention: watching this movie can be bad for your health for two reasons: 1) It totally sucks. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so incredibly beautiful that she can blast her brain from the back of her head at first glance. <br /> <br /> So do not say I did not warn you ...
