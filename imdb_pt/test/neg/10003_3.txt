Images of brass (the cinema is not a word suitable for them) are really rather bold. Its attractive visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high-class TV commercials. But unfortunately, Brass's footage is full-length on the pretext of wanting to entertain viewers for more than two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable erotic qualities, but rather soft and flaccid than hot, warm. Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved action from the 19th century to the 20th century, in 1945, to be exact, so there are murals of Mussolini, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the tattered costume of the partisans. But it is only facade, the historical context is completely contemptible. <br /> <br /> Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls in love with the amoral SS guy who always wears lots of lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile and well-trained Italian actress and clearly above the material. Its wide range of facial expressions (signaling boredom, hate, pleasure, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this photo and worth two stars. It supports this basically useless material with an impressive amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts would appear to her. She really deserves it.
