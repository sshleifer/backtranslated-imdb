Of all the compliments, we could not wait to see this show. We love crazy humor and creative stuff, especially from Australia and New Zealand. <br /> <br /> I admit this may not be a fair review, since we only saw the first 15 minutes. But we could not afford more misery - it was definitely the most annoying and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a TV show - it seemed like 15 hours. Songs can be (softly) interesting by themselves, but inserted by an interminable interval of 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene simply does not work. <br /> <br /> We are now trying to erase the memory. . If you want wonderful humor in a delightful and engaging movie, watch "The Dish".
