I have to admit that I was fooled by the title and the abstract on the back of the box. So I put it on the VCR and kept waiting ... and waiting ... and hoping something good would happen. But of course this never happens. The creators of this film must be tied to a chair and watched "Saving Private Ryan." Maybe they'd learn something.
