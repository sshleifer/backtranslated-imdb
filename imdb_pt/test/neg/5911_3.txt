Just read the other reviews here, and was a bit surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot. <br /> <br /> Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy can do an incredible comedy show in Stand-Up. . Great actors they are not. Enough of that. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? Oh, man. Every time the movie tries to trick you into believing that the good guys are going to lose, you know these scenes, "What, good guys lose? Oh, I see, it was just a trick," it's done so horribly wrong, you you can identify it a mile away. <br /> <br /> He had 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a bit silly that these comments have to be 10 lines now. Lots of people will fill up with crap, so they are eligible. Being brief is an art.
