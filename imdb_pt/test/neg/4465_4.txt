Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Comment: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that carry you back at any time. In this case ... our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972 that transports us back to a time when Austin Powers would have felt at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about these groups of children is not a gang! was a group!) who love to hang out at a cafe called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm weird last name ... wait ... spells Dracula back!) A new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. He offers them a night of black mass and black magic. To which they also say "sure why not, it can be fun!". Then, in no time, do they find themselves resurrecting Count Dracula from the ashes. <br /> <br /> This movie opens with a party rocking in some rich houses. He does not know the people at his party, but there they are all partying all night in his house. Doing drugs, going out and dancing on the tables. The filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely embraced by any young woman considered legal at the time. Everyone says words like "out" and "groovy" and end many of their phrases saying "all that jazz". So it's pretty obvious that it's the '70s. Above all, there's a band that sounds something like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean you're going to drown in all of the 1970s stuff. And as I watched it, I kept asking myself "how the hell did Dracula, in his black cloak, fit into all this?" And that's exactly what happens. Old Dracula seems out of place amidst all parties and rock and roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the movie are great ... but unfortunately, the music they decided to add to the process does not fit into anything and completely takes away the mood of things. Something horrifying or scary will be happening on the screen and suddenly a lot of trumpets and congos begin to play and you are completely taken out of the horror element. This sucked the movie atmosphere for me. <br /> <br /> But in spite of everything, putting all the distraction of the music of the 70s aside (a disease that the Satanic Rituals of Dracula also suffered) the film was very good. But I'll mention that. The story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In fact, the story is almost identical. Let's see ... a young lad inherits Draculas' ring and ashes ... check it out. He then decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into ... check it out. Black Mass to bring Dracula back to a desecrated church ... check it out. The list of similarities goes on and on. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are a few things that make this movie worthwhile. For example, the fact that the film is a time capsule for London in the early seventies makes the film fun. I kept laughing and laughing every time someone spoke in the '70s jargon. I could not believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! This made the movie fun for me, but we're here to be scared, we were here to see Drac kill some virgins and take revenge on Van Helsing's House. Did we get any of this? Well, yes. There are some good sequences squeezed there to satisfy old school hammer fans. In the first place, there is the sequence of the Black Mass that was above all satanic! They mention the name of many demons and much blood is shed. This sequence was incredible, but was confused by music at its most crucial moment. Then there is the actual resurrection of Draculas, which I admit was great from a visual standpoint. Some mist leaves Draculas grave and slow but surely the silhouette and face of Christopher Lees emerge from the fog. Cool shot! I loved! We have a Cushing and Lee facing each other in the end. And I could not help but laugh at a point when Dracula tosses a piece of furniture into the air. I laugh because he did it in every movie since Horror of Dracula. It is this Hammer tradition where the characters begin to throw candles and chairs at each other. And I think to myself, it's not your most exciting things to show, so an evil guy throwing a candle stick at our hero. Oh, well, any time, Dracula disappears in this one is very similar to all the other Hammer Draculas before him, the vampire is extorted and then we cut a series of pictures until there are only ashes left. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unintentionally funny movie by Hammer Dracula. He's stuck in the '70s, and while that makes it fun (and not as horrible as Dracula's Satanic Rituals), it still does not fit well with Dracula's universe we expected from Hammer. <br /> /> Rating 3 1/2 out of 5
