iCarly is all that's wrong with the world. All the main characters, but Carly and Freddy's brother are morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam hurts other people on a whim. She breaks a children's locker and he's forced to pay $ 100 to fix it, and everything she says is "hard luck" and goes on to smash Freddy's cell phone. It only caused at least $ 300 in damages and is more focused on getting food. What the hell?. The only time she feels guilty is when she makes fun of Freddy on the show. And that's only because Carly pestered her shit. <br /> <br /> Carly is "I'm perfect, all I do is cool". kind of girl Everything she does is for her own benefit and is often shown only with remorse for herself. What's worse, she encourages Sam's crap. Sam spoils Freddy's clothes? She laughs. Sam ruin a children's degree? She shrugs. <br /> <br /> Do not even make me start the mood. The trail of laughter is played every moment. Sam: He's not that hot Carly: Yeah, he's Sam: Yeah, you're right. MONTANTA AMOUNT OF LAUGHTER Show humor is to degrade others and say obscure words, and occasionally talk about trivial matters using similar phrases. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the 'super special techno effects' that can be made in Windows Movie Maker.
