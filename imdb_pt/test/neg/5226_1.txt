Wow, this is big anti-Christian prejudice! This is based on a novel by Stephen King and he wrote this kind of prejudice before and after Hollywood exaggerates even more. In this film, we see a Protestant minister and a Catholic priest, both acting like fools and being profane at the same time. Of course the Devil has taken over the city, so maybe his influence is also for these guys, but they are typical Hollywood portraits. They never show a minister who speaks and acts like Billy Graham, or his local minister or priest. And - another "given" - they make the character of Satan the most interesting in the movie. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow plays the Devil and makes him a nice guy. Ironically, Von Sydow played many of these roles after playing Jesus in the 1964 film, "The Greatest Story of All Time." Do you want to know why the actors are so screwed up? They do not know if they are God, Satan or anyone else in between. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who has played many unlikely roles until the last few years, is appropriately thrown into this story. He and the rest of the mean characters in the movie are not fun to watch. From what I've heard, King's book is even bleaker and sicker than this hate-filled movie. but better built. Frankly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve it.
