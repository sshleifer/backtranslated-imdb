Of course, I watched the MST3K version of this, but it's not really too bad, at least compared to others who deserve my cinematic hatred. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a troubled girl mistakenly sent for a "makeover". school, "called the Girls' City. Along the way, races, redemption, and madness (unintentional) happen. History and acting are a bit boring, as is action.However, the whole thing is fun to some degree , if you're absolutely bored. <br /> <br /> In general, just a simple 50's movie, but away from the worst movie ever, with some bright spots in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch the MST3K version, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> By itself, not so much, but I can think of worse methods of torture ("Spiker" someone ?).
