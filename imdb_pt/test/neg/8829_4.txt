I love Japanese movies - having seen at least 100-200. So it's obvious that I'm not afraid of Japanese movies. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for films that simply do not translate well for Westerners. They may be hits at home, but overseas they just do not look, well, ... normal. It's like the live fish my wife ate at a business meeting or strange PS2 games, such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things that are accepted there that confuse non-Japanese. This is probably the way others see things that Americans take for granted, like American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Well, the king of strange Japanese movies that just do not look right to Americans may just be ATAMA-YAMA. Now the style of animation is not the problem - it's different, but good enough. No, it's the very concept of the story and the ending quite bizarre. That's what makes this movie a truly unusual movie, and it goes something like this: there was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing on his head. It was little at first and he simply cut it off but again and again he grew back - so he simply decided to let it pass. And after a while, people began to live headlong under the shade of the tree. Strangely, while they were under the tree, they were small, but when they left, they were full size again. Then, after finally getting tired of it all and plucking the tree, the man drowned (!?) In the hole at the top of the head where the tree was! The end. <br /> <br /> See! I told him that this was very, very strange - but not in a good way like TAMPOPO or HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS - just weird. O-D-D .... strange! And unless you have a very high tolerance for that sort of thing, I doubt you'd feel bad knowing that this Oscar-nominated movie did not win. Frankly, that makes me happy, since I really do not want this movie to stimulate similar movies. The only reason I get a 4 is due to the nice animation, but not spectacular. <br /> <br /> This movie made my brain hurt .... Hope it's not a sign that I have a tree!
