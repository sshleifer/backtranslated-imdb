This movie makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List". Tarantino and the Weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. Green-lighting at P.O.S. so regardless of the friendships involved, it's just a bad deal. Larry Bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. The writer / director / producer / actor Bishop shows that his abilities are inadequate for any of these works. A southern vanity project, "Hell Ride" allows good actors to use the scenery ... at least when the camera is not focused on Bishop's fragile attempts to steal all the scenes he's in (which is pretty much EVERYTHING SCENE!) The last three words in "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
