I'll recommend putting this on the stack of "jumping" too. I was slightly excited by the concept when my fiancee rented, and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Forman drove it. Ah, well ... <br /> <br /> The costumes were cool, of course, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the costume department of any major Hollywood studio. There was no distinction between Spanish, English, and French-all dressed as if they were at the court of Versailles. The sets somehow did not evoke the qualities of the setting - the prison did not look like a prison, the mansions did not look like mansions, and the outside scenes seemed to have been filmed on a back ground, for all they were probably practical places. <br /> <br /> The score was dramatically lower than it could have been. I have been a fan of movie soundtracks since my youth, perceiving, enjoying and collecting, by which I mean more than John Williams. My fiancee is a professional film composer, an award winner who has had her work at Lincoln Center and a rising star in the industry. At the beginning of the movie, we had high hopes, and it actually started well. It deteriorated rapidly and, at various points - including the scene of the prisoners' release - reached a level of annoyance. I actually reached for the remote control to turn the volume down. Punctuation was never anything more than the most obvious choice to mark a specific scene tone, and it did not fit into the "soul" of the film (think of the music in Babel and you'll get an idea of ​​what I mean). He never achieved the greatness he wanted, but neither did the film. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, no matter how talented, was horrible. For the first part of the film, its mannerisms are so disturbing that they take care of its performance. During the second half, everything that was his character in the first period was gone, replaced by a whole different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like the loving son of Keith Richards and Lestat, of Stuart Townshend. I never had the idea that he cared about the role (which meant that the character cared about his life and his actions), or that the character was attracted to the writers as something more than an opportunist who, by any means reason, change his mind and decide to keep his principles at the end. Natalie Portman was very good, although her performance did not have the shadows of the growing insanity between her release from prison and Lorenzo's possession at the end. which I would have needed to call this a really effective performance. Alicia's character was never defined enough to really discern, and if it were not for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone watching the beginning of the movie and the end would not know they were not the same character. The teeth of the prosthesis were horrible, artificial, and disturbing, but that is no drag on Portman. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was just as well as Goya. Not worthy of the Oscars, but useful and generally believable. I do not know much about Goya's life, or his deafness, but it seemed to be added to the film as a requirement for biographical information, rather than anything that was used in the film. I am sure that this affected Goya's life much more than just requiring the need for an interpreter, but you would never know that. For the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted about 30% of the time through lip reading. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start with Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character. <br /> <br /> The script is like one of the "choose your own adventure" books that I used to read as a child: at various times in the movie, various results are possible, and none of the actions that precede them lead with any certainty to the way the film really unfolds. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its meager attempts to ferment the mood through little chunks of humor. The joke on the hands? Maybe it's because I paint (not well) as a hobby and I know what PITA's hands are for drawing / painting, but I've seen the joke coming a mile away, as well as the reprise in the second half. Has the baby ever been there for any other reason besides being taken by Ines? There may also have been a line of bread crumbs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (note: this review is a copy of a reply I made to a topic in the forum)
