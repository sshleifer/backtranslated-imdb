I clicked on the Encore Mystery channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see, Island of Dr. Moreau. I just took a few minutes of Shadow Conspiracy. An old man runs to find Charlie and grabs his arm. Suddenly, a Killer in a bright rain coat beats the old man on the head (with a side arm) across the street. After waiting for "C" to turn and look, the "A" tries to shoot "C" and clearly misses. "C" was a much easier target, the old could not have gone very far. Duh! There is a chase and "C" is in an elevator "A" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable, which is parallel to the "A". It hits and cuts the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a specialized shotgun, the "A" aligns itself in "C" from about 50 meters, but it is stupid to notice a motorcycle to climb and hit the pilot instead. How does Charlie get his parts? Daddy goes to the producers and says "Look, my son needs work ..." That reminds me of your stupid Sit - Com. All the actors are good, except, yes ... you get it. I usually have to take 2 or 3 minutes to wait for C.S.I. to enter. Let's see what I can do for the next hour. I know, I'll cut my toenails! Much better use of my time.
