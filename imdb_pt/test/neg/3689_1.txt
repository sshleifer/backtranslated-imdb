There are good movies, and there are bad movies, and then there is the Moscow Zero, such a bad movie that makes spending a month in solitary with an insurance salesman an attractive alternative to entertainment. With an incomprehensible plot about the gates of Hell opening into a labyrinth of tunnels under Moscow, the film is a mess of repetitive and senseless photos of a little girl running through tunnels, red lights floating and strange wall shadows, neither of which serves to mount any fear or tension, but rather provokes the reaction of "here they go again with the girl (or lights)" of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Directed by María Lidón, who for reasons that I can only conclude as shame, was Announced as Luna, the film is starring Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), a friend and colleague who disappeared in the tunnels. He calls for the help of a number of locals who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are portrayed by Spanish actors who try, with limited success, to influence Russian accents. On the way, they intersect with members of a kind of underground leather religious mafia headed by a burly Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he resorted to appearing as this, and the captive Sage Stallone (son of Sly), who seems to have been cast just so that Stallone's name can be included in the movie marquee. <br /> <br /> In addition to watching the troupe try to navigate through the tunnels with the help of a comically drawn map, and repetitive shots of them being followed or deceived by a pale young woman, not much else happens everywhere. The dialogue routinely alternates between English and Russian, with actors alternating frequently in each language, and whole conversations are uttered in half and a half in the other, with the only apparent reason being thus adding a frustrating dimension to the viewer, and above trying to discover the madly patched story. <br /> <br /> On the one thing that Moscow Zero hits, however, is the title, which could only have made a more precise description of that film if the word Moscow was omitted.
