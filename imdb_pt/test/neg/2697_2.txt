A former police officer who was thrown out of force by recklessness (and who could probably defeat Chuck Norris in a fight) is hired as a private bodyguard; your first customer is a useless type of playboy. It takes half of the film for it to be ejected from the force in the first place. Lots of great fight choreography, but the plot is strictly by the numbers, and the acting is as wood as the dialogue. Give this one a miss.
