Of the four main players here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I've never heard of (at that time) was what irritated me and ruined the film. Well, she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to play her and the VHS in the trash can. I'm referring to Kelly as a teenage brat, "Aunt Russell." Ironically, six years later, she played an impressive and extremely nice role in the person of "Rowena Morgan" in "Mr. Holland's Opus". <br /> <br /> Candy, as usual, is fun to watch as "Buck Russell". "or the title character," Uncle Buck. "Few actors were better at playing an unfortunate and awkward sweetheart than Candy. I liked your character here, but I can not watch this spoiled teen girl more than once. , in the first few minutes of the movie, the boy "Miles" (Cauklin) says the word "G-damn." How bad is that, having a six year old boy saying the Lord's name in vain in the movie? so it's no wonder that many of his child actors end up being mentally wounded, Caulkin being an example.
