I'm a big fan of horror, and I bought this movie of all the hype I was receiving on the bulletin boards. Well, let me tell you that I do not know who was giving all the hype, but let me talk about a few things. <br /> <br /> First of all this movie is not "a lot of things". It's NOT scary, NOT suspenseful, NOT overly bloody, NOT overly sick (except for one season MAYBE) was NOT wonderfully punctuated .... EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that a couple escape to a small island in Greece because they did a bit of malice in London. We do not even know what they did, but it's presumed they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler alert ** The male protagonist kills some people from his perversion of "cleaning the island of perverts" strangely. The murders are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects are bad. <br /> <br /> There is a part when he rapes a goat because his wife does not give him anything in the morning, but even this is done without any care. as is filmed. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is the only thing that is not totally predictable. I especially liked it when the "pastor" fart on the husband. Anyway, if you can rent this and have 2 hours to lose go ahead. It's nothing better than a cheese sandwich processed into moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
