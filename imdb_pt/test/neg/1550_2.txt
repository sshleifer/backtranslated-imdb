Well, the episode I just watched had the older "Gastineau Girl", complaining about why people keep mentioning her husband (Mr. Gastineau, a famous football player apparently). She seems not to be willing to accept that he is the only reason she is not pitching burgers, she has married someone famous and that is why she has cameras pointed at her. When challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does, she gave a wonderfully circular reason why people should pay attention to her: "I work a lot on my reality show." Then she said, "I'm not a celebrity ... I'm a personality." <br /> <br /> I'm not sure who this series plans to appeal to, except people who have had their intelligence removed. It certainly is not a model for anyone except prospectors, since the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all you say about rich people is that they have no financial problems.
