K, one day my dad got a movie with a cool cover. I got home with my mom and we went as we will watch this new movie that we have never seen before! .. Okay, so it started ... interesting start, cool robots and disgusting blood (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was Pluto, was not it?) ... Blablabla I could tell the whole story, but I'd rather not WTF NEVER Take a movie with an idiotic name and seriously, I NEVER NEVER judge a book by its cover (err ...). It sounded like an interesting movie. However, it was a slap in the face of science fiction films, its disgusting. I mean it was so bad I started laughing (I swear I tried to be serious) I DO NOT DESCRIBE STUPIDITY! It killed more than a million brain cells of mine that I can not even write a critique of descent. This is bad! Argh and I wana prepare you for something "strange" * COUGH TUG * mechanic p3n1 $ * COOK THOSE COUGH * Sorry I just had to say it, it's so funny, think of it as a comedy or some kind of parody for science fiction movies. His classic batman laughs, but in a new packaging, what the hell was this director thinking?
