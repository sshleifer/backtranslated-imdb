Pumpkinhead was itself a decent 80's horror film. No classic by any means, but a nice piece of fluff. Why then, now we were treated to a fourth movie in this franchise is beyond me. As in the previous sequences, there is nothing here to really connect the movies except the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we followed the dispute between the Hatfields and the McCoys. Part of the film is a romance of Romeo and Juliet when a young boy McCoy and his Hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. Soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed. The boy escapes into the forest and causes the witch to resurrect Pumpkinhead for some revenge. Acting is acceptable at best, amateur at worst. The titular demon does not appear for almost forty minutes and when he makes a pale comparison between himself and the original design. Overall, Blood Feud can not impress. It may be worth watching once, but it certainly is not an addition to the collection.
