As I watched, I was preparing to write an explosive critique of this "movie" (actually it's video), but then I saw that someone had already done it. I pretty much agree with him. But again, it seems like there was a lot of effort and millions of liras got in, so I guess you should give some credit for trying. Having said that, anyone who does not yet know the Lovecraftian world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think, well, I suppose, that it's not only really bad but it makes absolutely no sense. Thank God I read part of the other comment ('was it a bit lush, maybe?) Which revealed that this guy also did' The Shunned House '(which looked pretty bad, judging by the DVD box) so now I can avoid and save my mind from any further exposure to such profanity from the luster of HP Lovecraft
