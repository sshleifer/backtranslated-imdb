How do you make a totally nasty movie from a story by one of America's most famous authors? Watch this movie and find out. Maybe I'm overestimating the author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed with "The heart is a lone hunter" and was also waiting for something memorable here. Forget. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with her short haircut and clothes. I've never found her much to be excited about in almost any movie, anyway. Rod Steiger as a preacher? How insulting is that? Unpleasant characters, one after another. Well, maybe it's the book too, and I'm being unfair to this movie. I'm not familiar with the story beyond what I saw on screen and this was such a nasty movie that I could never recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> It's just one person after another in a backward city. Out of some cool cinematography here and there, there's nothing to recommend. How could one sit through 100 minutes of this is amazing. <br /> <br /> I did not even get into how bad this is directed. There's good news: this was the only film directed by Simon Cowell.
