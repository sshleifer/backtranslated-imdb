Know what? Family Guy started as something new, funny and more original. Random humor used to be funny. I actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to The Simpsons. After watching the new episodes that aired in recent weeks; I got fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was right about FG being dead when they brought the manatees and the balls of ideas. <br /> <br /> And seeing the show itself, I do not understand why my parents like it so much; There is nothing good about it. The "Intellegent" humor is funny and would have been funnier if the show did not depend on randomness.
