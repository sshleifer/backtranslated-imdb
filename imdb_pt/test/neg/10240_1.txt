How can anyone give something greater than a '1'? <br /> <br /> I thought "Hands, the Hands of Fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to intrude on my optic nerve. In fact, I did not think it COULD be worse. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. "Galaxina" is that rare movie in which EVERY ONE ELEMENT is painfully, agonizingly, incredibly bad. How many times have you watched a movie and commented, "Who the hell lied this thing?" From lighting to soundtrack, through the effects, through the script, to cinematography. . . Well, EVERYTHING, this movie is absolutely unbearable. It's so bad, I could not even say for some time whether it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's too bad even to be laughable. I'd rather eat a plate full of broken glass than sit down again.
