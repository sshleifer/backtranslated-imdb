Where to start, where to start .... hmmm ... as well as about some of the hardest, most artificial, unbelievable and camping performances imaginable? How about stereotyped "characters", situations and locations? Or how about a manipulative, nauseating and totally unhappy script? I can not think of an element in this movie that was original, worthy of being seen or interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to all of you, Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski fans - enjoy your collective fifteen minutes, guys because they will not be famous for much longer ...
