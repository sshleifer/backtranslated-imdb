Where the hell do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters? Firstly, the screenplay is one of the worst that has ever been found on a movie or TV screen and can only be described as a badly-proven Stephen King attack. At one point, the supposedly fearsome shadow hunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who is helping the man he is chasing, is as boring as "a cucumber in a burger." I'd be laughing if I was inventing, BUT I'M NOT! Equally ridiculous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. A cat gave it to her when she was holding it during a car accident that she had as a child. WHAT ???????? <br /> <br /> Second, for a horror movie, there is no sense of tension or threat. This may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during daylight. It is not very atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the acting is really horrible, and Pinion again proves that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable. Jeff Fahey is obviously on autopilot, but how can he blame him while he goes through an imitation of Humphry Bogart as Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We understand the joke that is not funny). The credit should go to Susan Paterno, an actress I did not know, she does her best with the horrible part she has and leaves the other more experienced actors ashamed. <br /> <br /> In no time is that. explained how the HUMAN character can understand what Van Husen's character is telling her. She obviously has some kind of diploma in crazy foreign languages. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, one moment is well done, the car accident involving Susan. The sfx is completely believable and if it were not for the hilarious storyline for this to occur it would have been applauded. <br /> <br /> All I can say about black hunters is that British terror will never recover from its endless fall if movies like this continue to be made and displayed. Avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague is much more frightening. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> p.s. the insinuations in other comments that the movie remains too clever for some are honestly hilarious. It is a weak defense when some claim "you did not like it because you did not understand". The letters after my name make a fool of me.
