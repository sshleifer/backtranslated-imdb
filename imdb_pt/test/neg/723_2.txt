At first, I thought that 'nasaan ka man' could be one of those new progressive Filipino films. as someone noted earlier, the movie does not look badly done. it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, good-looking actors, and nicer locations. <br /> <br /> However, the improvements are all purely superficial. if it were not for all the Polish and expensive filters, the "nasaan ka man" would feel like the typical local second-rate movie - hyperactive drama, predictable twists, "yes, right!" moments, crying, screaming and characters that you could care less about, everything pushed your throat. <br /> <br /> A couple of things bothered me about this movie. First of all, since when is it allowed to have sex with the adoptive family? this argument unrelated to blood makes no difference. second, a woman would not really tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it a secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? I know the director tried to make things look super dramatic, but I was simply forced to raise the brightness on my TV set.
