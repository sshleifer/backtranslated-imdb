Okay, I gave it to three to three! He deserves only one star without questions. <br /> <br /> If you are going to look at the film seriously and interpret it as a legitimate B-Horror movie then it will have a star. But I believe it's apparent in the first few minutes of the movie that we're dealing with it's a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> With this movie, my friend and I were watching with the power to turn it off and put something more "Hollywood" in it, but instead we decided to split this entire movie from start to finish. We laughed so many times that it was almost like I was watching a comedy. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible ..... The effects and sequences of death are so bad .... The complete crap story .. ... <br /> <br /> But the fact is that they are trying to make a serious horror movie ... Impartial! <br /> <br /> The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are entering a so-called "dark basement" that is clearly lit up, and they pretend not to be able to see hitting bones hanging from the bahahahaha roof simply terrible. ... <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh like this movie is bad, along with the fact that it was made in 2004 than to see this movie ... <br /> <br /> Wait, why am I writing so much? No one knows about this movie ... I doubt anyone will read it hahahaha.
