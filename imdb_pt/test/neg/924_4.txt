When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. Donald Westlake's "Enough" Travesty was one of my favorite stories of all time. After I watched, I was not so excited. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she did not like it too much, and she never read the book). In this film, they managed to take away all the charm of the book and turn it into bland porridge. A large part of the problem was William H. Macy. I really like him in other movies, but he played Thorpe (Terry / Carey) as a stammering and incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium to your nerves, but remains collected at all times, which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a large part of the story (plus a glimpse of 2 seconds at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny, but because it helps establish the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie, Fred's betrayal in the end is not so affectionate, because they do not seem so close. In the book, they become good friends, especially on Fred's side, which makes it even more ironic that he is responsible for Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from the cast, I love Adam Arkin, but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive, Detective, character traits that the Fred book has, which makes it more obvious that he fiddles with evidence and so , more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were very close to the book, and James Cromwell was great although he did not look much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene that was totally added to the film was far less interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent him to Seattle and blamed the mob's death. Kit was fine, despite being rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die, since she got a little boring. I do not care about the changes in the books to make movies, I know they are needed because of the size and the difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter than duller.
