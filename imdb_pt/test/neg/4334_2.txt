The evil bikie gang in this movie was called Savages, hence the title, but Minor Nuisances would have been a better name for this mob of weak actors trying to look dangerous. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they walked generously with their bikes very slowly so the victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bikes. Their leader had a bad butt, but still thought he could face the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she did not seem to know where she was in most of the film.
