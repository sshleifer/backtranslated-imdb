I can imagine the writers of this story thinking about this script: 1. Let's make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat and Silence of the Lambs. People like things from serial killers. He will sell ... 2. The killer must adopt some kind of standard. I know; he will copy it from a serial killer mystery novel. This has not yet been done, at least not exactly so. 3. Now, we need some way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy may be bedridden like in the Rear Window. 4.Lastly, we need a twisting end that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and the Suspects of Time. <br /> <br /> Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so do not waste your money. One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they adopt a perfectly good concept for the movies and put them completely down. I wrote better stories than that when I was in high school. I kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the turnaround was over, I was not shocked, just said, "Oh. Who cares?" The characters are two-dimensional. They have their typical movie personalities. This movie is just proof that stealing elements from other blockbuster movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this film 1 out of 10. Normally, I would get at least 2 or 3, but I'm so tired of the lack of originality. When will they learn? 1/10
