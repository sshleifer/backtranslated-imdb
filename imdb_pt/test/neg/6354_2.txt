They must be. I'll list them so you can check them out one by one: <br /> <br /> - The police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars in cash and drugs in circulation because they have no evidence. <br /> <br /> - When you get shot, you always grunted in the same way, and flew back the same way, even though there is never a mark on your body. Police are unable to identify the sound of shots, and do not think anything is suspicious when a police call disguised during a drug deal and high-level money is cut off by that shot. <br /> <br /> - Malicious men can hit dummies with a single shot, but they can not hit a big, bulky martial artist with 100. <br /> <br /> - If you throw a rocket at one parking lot, the next three cars in a row will explode evenly at 15-second intervals. <br /> <br /> - Beyond the last point, all cheap cars are always parked side by side. <br /> <br /> - smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much higher th the amount of smoke caused by four cars exploding. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are way ahead of any other gaming company that can fit on five floppy disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screensavers. <br /> <br /> - Flexible discs can be read even after they have been targeted. <br /> <br /> Semi-drunk boys in bars scrutinize the news when they are in the pub, and have a deep understanding of modern American military history, Agent Orange, and family trees of high-ranking military officers. However, they are only able to articulate their points using the silly-sounding dialogue coming from someone over seven years old. <br /> <br /> - Even though the fights seem to happen almost hour after hour in a bar, this bar has only one staff member, who serves the beers and takes care of security. Of course he knows the martial arts. <br /> <br /> - The gold medal of the Olympic athletes regularly makes the transition to corporate CEOs of software companies in a matter of years. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for a computer gaming company knows all about how to win a game she has never played, constantly praises her competitor's great games and can spread facts and figures about her rivals company - but did not know that they outperformed almost all other companies. in the field in large corporate mergers. <br /> <br /> Bandits always die in slow motion. Ever. <br /> <br /> Wives tell their husbands that they are pregnant for raving about the bravery of their men by killing bandits. <br /> <br /> - Wives make large amounts of their husband's police work; this may explain why she complains and complains a lot every time she needs to go to work. Although, do not explain why she loves him so much every time he wakes up in the morning and she can read about her killer escapades. <br /> <br /> It is quite typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnapping, killing tons of people on three different occasions and disrupting a series of illegal multi-million dollar deals in a week. <br /> <br /> - When trying to lose a car that is following you, it is advisable to continue driving under the speed limit. And if you're following a cop, the subtlety is not important - you can tailgate for miles, then park next to him. He will not notice. <br /> <br /> - All cops are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It's possible to kick a guy ten feet away. <br /> <br /> - People scream or scream in pain when they are punched or kicked, but when they have a broken arm, they do not make a sound. <br /> <br /> Bandits wipe their bloody axes with their handkerchiefs, and then leave them in their pockets for many days. <br /> <br /> - Pieces of wood, when swung with a heavy blow, break down robust stairs in six or more places simultaneously. <br /> <br /> - The photo and special features listed on the back of the DVD do not necessarily have to be on the DVD. The interactive menus advertised? Why not no menu at all! The index of announced scenes? Why not have the whole thing as a scene / chapter and do not need an index! Likewise, it's okay to use The Matrix's source and title in the tag-line, and not by any means a theft. <br /> <br /> With all of this, I am in shock that 12 of the top 15 credited actors have never acted anymore.
