I saw the original Italian film. It must be said that the acting and the interpretation are more polluted by the tendency generated by the TV to speak in a severely muffled voice, without moving the lips, to stretch the tones, as they appeared in the productions "That's real life" and "Let's get up." - our audience with a few tears - "play-screen". The late Massimo Girotti rises above the other characters by intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The film has some good tips, but (as in another comment before mine) it does not have a focal point and dribbles in many lesser and lesser-than-tangible scenarios, another drawn trend of TV productions, well known to Italians. A few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag (charm and aesthetics of the kitchen plus the sensual cargo of sweets, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.) Hammam and the fairies are definitely truer, it seems Ozpetek learned the melody of Italy in the early 2000s and is buzzing along ... I'll give him one last chance though ...
