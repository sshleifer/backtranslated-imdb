Yesterday I watched this TV production, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I did not have high expectations when it was a tv production, but the full movie was endless pain. I felt it lasted 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. Every minute was a long fight and I really struggled a lot to stay away from the "switch off" switch. <br /> <br /> The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who receives many patients with AIDS. and most of them die during the movie. It is difficult for Verghese to live, so his family is punished with his frustrations. However, this film has problems showing both sides, mainly focuses on their conversations with patients, and sometimes we see movies from their home, but we do not get much. The difficulties of showing more than a part of Verghese's life do not improve with the poor acting Naveen Andrews, a man I (hopefully) can not see in any good future film. <br /> <br /> I think you have 7.6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better movies on that subject in the market. Stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
