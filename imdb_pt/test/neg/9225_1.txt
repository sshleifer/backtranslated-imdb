If there's anything worse than this movie, I do not want to see it. I remember so many incredible things - a nun fell from a coffin to make a ferry for a little blond boy; the blond little boy worshiped as a god; lots of pictures of Peru as an ideal vacation spot. The Sendero Luminoso and Alberto Fujimori should dispel any notion that Peru is a vacation paradise. The whole thing is so terrible that Plan 9, or even the Robot Monster, is an aesthetic treatment by comparison. This movie must be bombed, bombed and bombed again.
