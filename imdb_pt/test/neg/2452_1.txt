When I think of TV movies, I always think of this movie, I watched it a few times in Sky Movies, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've seen this movie, I was just browsing, and I came across it here: -S. <br /> <br /> A microbiologist (Linda Flemming) goes on holiday with his son (William Flemming) at this vacation spot, do they meet Paul Johnson (taxi driver / bar owner?), and Kathy Johnson. <br /> <br /> It's like a strange romantic thing, William begins to fall in love with Kathy, and Paul falls in love with Linda. <br /> <br /> A guy faints in a street, he has some mark on his arm, Joseph (Joseph was a deep sea diver, who in some dive, saw a light, or something, and became the religion ), says that it will take care of that person, there is a gap in my memory, so there is a big break in the virus, I think Linda offers her help, to come to a cure, Kathy is infected (William notices a mark on Kathy's arm ), with the virus, so does Joseph. <br /> <br /> Paul says a few lines to Joseph, then Joseph trips away, the next time you see Joseph, he's healed somehow, that information is used to heal the infected, so there's a party at beach, the end.
