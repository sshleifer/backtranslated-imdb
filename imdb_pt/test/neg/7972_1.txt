Kristy Swanson plays an elite killer who allegedly toppled a TV reporter out of a gang of thugs, but once she sees this poor guy at home playing with her kids, she decides to wipe out the whole project and life of the TV reporter is spared. The murderer's life is in dispute as people who wanted this dead reporter now want her dead for not fulfilling her mission. This is the basis for a movie called Supreme Sanction. <br /> <br /> Supreme waste of time is more like it. We see Swanson's character beating, punching, and killing men much larger than her. And she is always one to two and fifty steps ahead of the group of murders that can not, for some reason, end this super hitwoman. Having a woman walking away and beating all these men makes the movie look so gay. It's very predictable when you find out that Swanson's character is going to win anyway, making the movie boring and unfit. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson is a decent actress who in her youth was always sexy and easy e.Supreme Sanction is not one of her best efforts however.
