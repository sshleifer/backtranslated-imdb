Hi, this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The day I watched this movie, I had a high fever. But I still watched the movie with a lot of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt like regretting it. Because, I lost 3 hours for this stupid movie. I could have rested instead of watching this movie. And I was really surprised at how such actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab etc. starred in this film. <br /> <br /> I do not understand if directors do not find a good story to make a movie, so why do they remain as directors? Why can not they sit at home and spend time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all the directors that it will be good for them if they request audiences, either by mail or the media, newspapers, radios, etc ... to send them a good story if they do not . find any good story to make a movie. I ask all directors again, please do not make such films.
