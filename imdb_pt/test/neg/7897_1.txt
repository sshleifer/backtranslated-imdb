This could be the worst movie ever made, in a league with films like "Howard, the Duck," "Plan 9 From Outer Space," and "Ishtar." I do not understand why I decided to see this movie, since it was a waste of my life. I also do not understand why anyone would like this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. The acting is among the worst I have seen, as well as writing. The characters are all stupid and there is not a funny scene throughout the movie. Tom Arnold is possibly the worst actor of all time - this movie proves this. There is nothing worthy of this movie. Do not rent, watch, or say it sounds interesting. It's bad enough I've seen it.
