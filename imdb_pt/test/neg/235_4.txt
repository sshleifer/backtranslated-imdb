First of all, I was not sure who this movie was - it seemed like a children's story, but there were things kids would not understand and would find it boring. There was not much, Bruce Willis was not stretched as an actor. He did a lot of looking sideways with that half-smile of his - unless you're a big fan of him, I would not bother. And if it is the story that you are interested in (guy who seems to have everything but is missing emotionally is taught lessons of a child), I would see about a boy. It has everything that was lacking in this film, humor, sadness and reality.
