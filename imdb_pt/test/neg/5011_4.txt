Necessary Roughness (1991) was a comedy / drama that tried, at all levels, to be a serious film about college football. A lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the movie's comedic highlights. Other than that, it's a very mediocre movie. They should have just made a direct and unrealistic comedy. Instead, the filmmakers try to play in both camps and end up at the short end of the staff. When will someone make a decent college football movie that is funny and realistic? <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless it's free on t.v.
