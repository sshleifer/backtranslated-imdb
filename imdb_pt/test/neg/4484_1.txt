After reading the reviews I am so relieved to learn that I am not the only person who was very disappointed with this movie! I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, I read all his books, most of them more than once. Of course I LOVED The Notebook and A Walk To Remember ... I have not yet seen Message on a Bottle or Nights in Rodanthe so I can not comment on it ... <br /> <br /> But I did Go see Dear John this past weekend and I was terribly upset! The movie was not good! When looking at the movie alone, and not thinking about the book, it was still a terrible movie. I have not had the rush and variety of thrills of this movie I have from other movies that I liked, especially The Notebook. I was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared ... never! From the beginning all I could realize was how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named John who is in the army and a girl named Savannah who is not .... the part about his father being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that accompanied the book. Everything was totally off !!!! First of all, in the book, Allen was Tim's younger brother, NOT his son! Why they had to change that, I do not understand. It made a lot more sense as it was in the book when Tim was just a little older than Savannah and they grew up together and Allen was the inspiration of Savannah to want to work with autistic horses and children ... that did not happen in the movie .... ugh ... And in the book they spent much more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night ... why did they leave those moments out ??? I could go on and on but I would run out of space! So basically, if you're a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, do not waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's terrible and nothing like the book!
