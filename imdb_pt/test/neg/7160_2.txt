This film was strongly recommended by a friend and, being a big fan of Brando, I ordered this film from Harrods and waited anxiously for it to arrive. I've rarely been so disappointed in a movie. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You can never like or care about any of the characters (except Brando, maybe). The acting was OK. History, what history? Maybe that's the point. It's war, after all, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so annoying that I kept checking my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Please do not waste your time and money on this. I can also add that this is the first user review I wrote, I just had to leave my feelings about this movie known. <br /> <br /> By the way, my all-time favorites are: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 and 2, one flew over Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you have not yet seen them, please spare time to do so. And Amadeus should be in widescreen 2.35: 1
