For me, it just did not look like GI Joe. When I watched as a kid, I just did not care. In fact, the part I liked most about this was the opening credits. They change many facts around and also transform history. Cobra Commander is supposed to be part of this stupid breed of reptile people in Antarctica or some frozen place. Although I always thought he was a normal guy, considering that every time you saw his eyes on the show, they were surrounded by flesh of normal color and not by the blue that his face was here. There's a lot of crap about it to try to make a spectacular movie, but to me it just ruins what I watched the series in the first place.
