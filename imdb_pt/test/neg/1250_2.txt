How bad is this movie? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work in The Sopranos, I chose this on Blockbuster based on his name and a story that looked promising. Still does, but this movie does not comply. <br /> <br /> Every turn of history is entirely predictable; I kept searching for the Lifetime bug in the bottom right corner of the screen. It's all there: the noble woman coming out of difficult times, the guy who can not live up to his potential, despite his best efforts, the boy who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. The identity of the mysterious stranger is what really made me want to play things on TV - I would have been more pleased with little Stuey waking up and realizing that it was all just a dream. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers may also have had a "The moral of the story is ..." shortly before the credits, once another reviewer pointed out this thing really rolls like a special after-school. Do not play, do not drink, do not use drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... please, how about a little nuance? How about some interesting bad guys? Writer / director AW Vidmer should be seconded to a special notice: not only the dialogue, the pace (within the dialogue and at both ends of many scenes) make this film at least 45 minutes longer than necessary (and believe me, it seems longer). The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the supporting cast (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep it from a "1" rating. All his good work is almost offset by the appalling work of portraying boy Stuey. I'm not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey - it's a Mafia movie, so let's climb up someone from Blue's Clues who can not do anything but exaggerate with a big fake smile ... next let's cast the taciturn, Disney movie) or just horrible direction, but these scenes are really painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in another film about this character and his story; It's a shame that Imperioli has already been used by this film. Horrible, horrible, horrible.
