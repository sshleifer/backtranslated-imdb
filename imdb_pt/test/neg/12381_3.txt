Is this as tacky as they come? the concept of a massive and indestructible alien bird is already pretty crazy for words, but wait until you take a load of the goofy creature as it appears on the screen! I tell you that I laughed so hard at this thing that I missed some of the expository speeches ?? So again, the latter is often so cumbersome in scientific jargon and laws of physics and such (in that I've never been good, despite my love of science fiction movies) it does not really matter anyway! The bird ?? first portrayed as a mere blurred form buzzing through the sky but later shown in all its dopey glory? is so absurdly silly that it would not be a cartoon in a Looney Tunes cartoon (see the series of snapshots that start with the creature at a distance and end in an extreme close-up of your face)! Director Sears had fared much better with his other film about UFOs, the beautiful TERRA VS. THE PIRES FLYING (1956) ?? with special effects provided by a master, Ray Harryhausen (talking about it, I just donated my last copy in anticipation of acquiring the newly released SE DVD from Columbia); also, it seems to me that some of the images that illustrate the bird attack in New York were taken from the destruction of Washington, seen in that previous science fiction classic! Again, the leads are played by gender regulars ?? namely Jeff Morrow (from THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (from TARANTULA [1955]); as with the SAUCERS FLY mentioned above, are these titles highly regarded and loved by the fans? consequently they are immensely superior to this regrettable addition to the cycle of alien / monstrous animals prevalent during the heyday of science fiction and beyond (incidentally, other voracious threats appeared in THE FLYING SERPENT [1946], which I did not watch, and The Ironic Update by Larry Cohen on Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, GIANT CLAW can not even reach a decent climax? which is so rushed that it looks like a "wash," to name a jet pilot of the film itself, whose rocket attack on the bird is completely ineffective (ie before Morrow realizes he is protected by an invisible barrier). to figure out a way to be able to penetrate it). Ultimately, beyond the intractable (and frankly tedious) technical asides, you get a sense of "so bad, it's good" watch this: after all, it lasts only 74 minutes ?? and in any case, the bird is such an unforgettable creation that puts a big smile on his face every time he appears!
