Recently I borrowed a copy of this film mess, which took me three sessions for three days to pass. This is another comment to make. <br /> <br /> But what I wanted to comment on first was the carelessness in the DVD's special features. It included a memory game, which asks the player / viewer to combine pairs of animals so they can embark on the ark. However, every time it reveals the chosen animal, the screen asks the player to find (or congratulate the player on finding) "is mate." This is a misspelling, since it should be "your mate" as a possessive pronoun, not a contraction for "is." It is an annoying mistake to keep repeating 16 or more times to end a game. Of course, it's actually a children's activity, but it teaches children incorrect spelling. <br /> <br /> And, oh yes, the game never changes. It's the same game with the same locations of the same animals at a time. Also, it does not keep score as the number of moves required to solve the game. Therefore, there is no lasting value or challenge for this. It's just a feature to list on the packaging. <br /> <br /> Put simply, there could have been more reflection and care on this "special" trait, just as there might have been more thought and care in this matter. Confused movie.
