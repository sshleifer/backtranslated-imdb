Set in the Philippines, Lethal Panther 2 is a bleak 1990s martial arts action movie that sees a reckless cop chasing after the nasty criminals who killed his wife. A fairly cheap production, with almost no artistic merit, this film depends on the quality and quantity of its action. But while there is no shortage of punches, gunfights and explosions, the quality is simply not there. The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this movie a real chore to sit on. <br /> <br /> The generally impressive Yukari Oshima is totally wasted, with his natural athletic ability overshadowed. by some excruciatingly bad wire work. The ballistic action scenes are an expressionless blend of heroism of "slow motion flying through the air while firing," crazy vehicle stunts and endless bandits lining up to be shot. So many better examples of the 'girls and guns' genre now available on DVD, I suggest you leave this well alone (unless, like me, you hang on to any old junk to be a complete ).
