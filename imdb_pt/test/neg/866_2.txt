This movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria has done. <br /> <br /> It looks like a commercial from start to finish. The "director" spent the whole time on a tripod, has no rhythm, no rhythm. It's illogical. what a mess. You can tell what will happen from the first 15 minutes, and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, how the hell was Perrugorria shot? Are you serious? Worst scene of anyone being shot ever! <br /> <br /> ------ end of spoiler ----- <br/> <br/> Bad direction, bad script, bad acting ... Really bad overall. I would not recommend this movie. It is a waste of money and time.
