The Vindicator opens with the memorable scene of a monkey in a cage attacking a small toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. This random act of violence sold to me and I'm happy to say that the rest of the Vindicator provided a real cheese feast. The Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who almost killed an explosion in his laboratory whose tattered remains are placed inside an experimental body suit / armor. For some unfathomable reason he is equipped with an anger response activator, a device connected to his brain that will make him homicidal if he comes into physical contact with anyone else. They give some stupid explanations about what a necessary defensive mechanism is, but I do not see the logic in installing such a device unless you want a cyborg-destroying machine. It is especially ridiculous when it is stated that the suit Carl is wearing is actually an experimental space suit. What possible need would an astronaut turn into the incredible hulk during a mission? He predictably leaves the lab and begins to fight the dishonest scientists who put him in the costume, along with the murderous ninja Hunter played by Pam Grier (No, actually). <br /> <br /> Vindicator himself looks pretty damn goofy. It's basically a guy in a mutilated gold foil suit. He also has a perpetually perplexed look in his eyes, which does not inspire fear or even compassion. I think you can not blame him for this, most people watching the movie will have that same look on their faces. <br /> <br /> The acting is really bad, flushed, 'I'm not sure what the character's emotions or thoughts are that at that point I'm going to jump up and launch my dialogue in a random tone of voice while I try not to look at camera acting school. The actor who plays the funky black scientist even struggles with this latter part. <br /> <br /> It is after this initial accidental death that the Vindicator goes after the scientists. Incredibly, the whole Rage Response Activator thing "touch me and I'm going to kill you" does not play as big a role as you might expect from Carl, who was going after his former colleges in a fairly independent way. There was a scene in which he brutally kills some street punks who push him. I know it's common for street gangs to randomly harass main characters in the 1980s movies, but surely one of them must have realized that it would be a bad idea to attack the cyborg guy even if he resembled the retarded cousin of the C3PO. How they do not seem surprised to see a gypsy cyborg dislodged walking down the street as if it were a daily occurrence to them. The only other time that this anger response enabler appears in the movie is when old Carl can not hug his wife. When Hunter tries to turn this against him, throwing it inside him so that he is forced to kill her, he casually observes that he has reprogrammed himself (Off-screen naturally), so that does not happen. They could have left out the whole Rage Response Activator thing and finished with a direct revenge story and that would not have made a big difference in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is an amusing sequence in the sewers, Grier and his friends trace the Vendor. Because of their armored leather, they are all armed with guns that fire 'vaporized acid'. For some bizarre reason, when these weapons are fired, they are represented on the screen by caricatured red lines that scratch their targets, the Ghostbusters. The Vindictor reacts by plucking a gas pipe from the wall and incinerating all Grier's henchmen in a huge exiting fire strip. The resulting fireball is so large and powerful that it comes out of the sewers of a man's hole and explodes the van that some scientists are. Oddly, Grier escapes by throwing himself into the deep water, despite the fact that he is closer to the Vindicator. This is one of several false fire bursts throughout the film, including the death of the black scientist when the vindicator sends his van off a cliff. (That's after they catch the Vindicator holding it in a gigantic piece of jelly - no, seriously). <br /> <br /> There is also an unsettling, long, out-of-place sequence in which Carl's treacherous friend, Ned Beatty, reveals his passion for Carl's wife and tries to rape her. It lasts about 5 to 10 minutes and is full of disturbing photos of the guy drooling over his wife's face, spinning on top of her and trying to take off her dress. It's disgusting to say the least and it seems really out of sync with most of the rest of the movie that is kind of caricatured and bigger than life in its violence. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie involves the Vindicator battling A bunch of other guys in battle costumes. For some reason, all these other guys are less clever than Carl, some of them being dispatched by his wife simply by having a protruding tube on his ripped side. Fortunately for Carl, the suit he's wearing does not have that crucial flaw in design. The only really memorable part to the end is Grier's death. Doing something I've never seen an evil do in a movie before in the middle of her confrontation with the Vindicator she decides that she does not really stand a chance against him and in a matter of factual way blows her own brains out with her pistol.
