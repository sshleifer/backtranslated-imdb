Why do I hate it? Let me list the ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman who plays a 12-year-old is just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> There's a fight scene where kids are throwing bricks at each other and it's considered funny - and this goes on for 15 minutes <br /> <br /> Strange how none of the kids is even remotely <br /> <br /> Title cards contain a lot of racial and ethnic slurs <br /> <br /> For a "family" movie the fights were very violent (they loved it when Pickford was punching in a boy!) and the humor was just stupid <br /> <br /> Seriously, 40 minutes later I gave up and hung up. The insults, the racism and the small children throwing bricks at each other came up to me. There was also no plot I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this movie was William Haines, who was one of the main protagonists of the age of silence. <br /> <br /> Just painful. Avoid.
