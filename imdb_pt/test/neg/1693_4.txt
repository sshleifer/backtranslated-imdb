Film version of the children's literary classic, very resistant but harmless, incorporating an animated portion in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very distinctive - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast (a 69-year-old Mason like a chimney robber!) To the inconsequential (Greenwood as an aristocrat confused) to the bizarre (Whitelaw plays several "exotic" characters - including a circus performer, an old witch, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The animated segment of The Movie, directed by a group of animators from Eastern Europe, is hardly inspired, but slightly pleasant in itself and, as usual, with this kind of thing, there is a variety of songs that a person has to endure, one of them in particular. he repeated too often for his own good. The film was directed by actor Jeffries, who had directed (with much more success) other children's films, such as THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and THE AMAZING MR. BLUNDEN (1972; I still have to watch myself, but it was released some time ago on R2 DVD from Anchor Bay UK).
