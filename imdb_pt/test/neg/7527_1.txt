The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall flat on the floor despite the extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a bland story and without inspiration, without imagination. Why so totally rewrite a wonderful classic of science fiction? Are today's movie audiences very attuned to the recording of H.G. Wells? George Pal's 1960 version told a much more captivating story, even with awkward low-budget effects, beach-looking Eloi and Morlocks who looked like Smurfs on steroids. <br /> <br /> The 2002 version must have HG Wells turning in his grave: 1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and stuck in a paradox of time is an old science fiction cliché. This totally distracts the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?) That made the 1960 version so captivating. This sets an unfortunate and upsetting tone right from the start that leaves the entire film in earnest. If Guy Pearce's character was so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein have realized the dilemma of the paradox of time? has not dawn on him 800,000 years in the future? of a Morlock no less, Doh !! What is wrong with time travel just for fun and adventure and curiosity - how incorporated into the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if you saw the first movie, would you realize what Pearce was doing with the time machine when he first saw it. George Pal's film carefully explains the whole strange idea of ​​'travel' through a fourth dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director goes out of his way to make Pearce's character look nerdy, an old stereotypically worn-out scientist. In the 1960 version, Rod Taylor was a bit nerdy too (at least around Weena), but managed to be braggart, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the 1960s version - abandoned in the remake - is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Exploding the Moon to destroy humanity is useless - and does not contribute much to scientific literacy. For more than 4 billion years the Moon has suffered impacts from much more powerful asteroids, which would make any nuclear device look like a rocket. Yes, science fiction needs artistic license, but that is just plain stupid and meaningless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying the time machine is stupid too. Apparently, our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to energize this thing. Disappointing, Pearce never goes back to the 1800s to tell his story to his unbelieving friends, a key part of Wells's story with the irony that in a week's travels time go to the future far and back. <br /> <br /> 6. Having Morlocks running around during the day totally destroys the ghostly and ghostly portrayal of H.G. Wells as dark creatures of the night. A real cinematic opportunity lost. In addition, Wells described Eloi as fragile and childish. These guys in the movie looked like they could face Morlocks if they were not so cute. <br /> <br /> 7. The clever Morlock ?? a sort of bleached Star Wars Evil Emperor - had potential but is so lame and distant that he tells Pearce to take his machine and go home! Boy, what a dramatic point! In the book, Morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it and struggle to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The hologram of the fake ball in the N.Y Public Library is too much. This does little of the idea of ​​human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that provided a frighteningly gloomy compliment to humanity. The distorted evolution is something serious. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the wonderful effects in this movie never compensate for a tired tired of a screenplay. Save the cost of a ticket & popcorn and go rent the DVD when you leave (soon no doubt), at least you can fast-forward thought the dull parts, just like our time traveler.
