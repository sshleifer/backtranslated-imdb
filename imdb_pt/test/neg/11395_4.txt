After watching this movie, I thought to myself, they actually covered the life of Errol Flynn! The film is very beautiful to the eyes. They really got the atmosphere of the 1930s and 1940s from Hollywood. The costumes were great. All the women looked fascinating, and all the men looked beautiful and elegant. <br /> <br /> Is this a serious film about the life of Errol Flynn? Nah! It's a fun movie based on all the scandalous things he's done in his life. <br /> <br /> Why am I criticizing this movie? This is a movie that had a lot of promise but failed to deliver. Duncan Reagher was very good as Errol Flynn. He was not as handsome as the original, but made you believe that Flynn was not just a handsome playboy who did not take himself seriously, but as a man who, though gifted with great talent, was upset and unhappy inside. Flynn's love life was a disaster, considering he had had so many failed marriages. He also lost many good friends during his lifetime. He also suffered from unrequited love for the elegant Olivia DeHavilland. The last scene in the movie showed Errol begging for Olivia to stay with him, and instead she left. He is shown in his tuxedo, looking really empty and walking slowly around the pool as he pours his drink into the pool. It was a sad way to end the movie, but it is a kind of adaptation because everyone already knows how he ended up separating himself from his alcoholism and dissipated lifestyle. <br /> <br /> This movie could have taken much more depth, I could have been better written well. Of course they showed all the scandals, but they never showed Errol Flynn's human center. Surprisingly, Duncan Reagher was able to put some emotional depth into the character of Errol Flynn, even if the writing of the film has not put any depth there. <br /> <br /> I'll probably never see this movie again, but I can still remember after watching this movie: "Wow, that could have been so much more .....!" I give this movie a D +.
