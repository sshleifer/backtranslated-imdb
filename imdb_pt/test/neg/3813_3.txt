Like "The Blair Witch Project" before him, Hatchet has earned its fair share of advertising from the bottom up (like an avid Fangoria Magazine reader, full-page ads are hard to miss); even after his medium theatrical run, the film is bound to subsist only on the hype around it, and will probably become a cult item at some point. With a MySpace URL and a powerful promise (if disconcertingly subjective) to preserve the so-called "old-school American terror", "Hatchet" will attract a lot of curious with its DVD release (where this statement is stamped on the disc itself). It may have been the great impression of Is not It Cool News on the ads that led me to approach the film with some trepidation (it seems that Harry Knowles and his minions will approve any movie for VIP passes and free food), but "Hatchet" me questions the idea of ​​screenwriting director Adam Green of "old school american horror": based on the evidence here, it means the insipid, late '80s endings of "Friday the 13th" and "Friday the 13th" Liberation. characters are unpleasant stereotypes (of the Chris Tucker type, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite Old Couple and Asian Tour Guide), whose interactions are marked by painful dialogues that try to be hip, and obvious attempts at humor (not so bad like "Cabin Fever," but still, the script has a lot of stuffing (the rustle rustle scene, for example), and "Hatchet" turns out to be as typical of any postmodern slasher of the last decade, distinctive feature of an expertly calculated advertising machine. I will give a slight compliment to the blood - if you can cross the padding between the deaths, red wine is definitely a marvel, and the only real reason to watch this.
