There is no Esperanto in this movie <br /> <br /> I watched this movie specifically because the IMDb lists Esperanto as one of the languages ​​used. But IMDb is wrong about the languages ​​used in this movie. There is absolutely no Esperanto. It's almost all English with a few Navajo words. Do not watch this movie if you are looking for Esperanto movies. Other options are "Idiot's Delight" (with Clark Gable), which has a bit of Esperanto, "Incubus" is all Esperanto (although it has been mispronounced), and there are some street signs in Esperanto in "The Great Dictator" Charlie Chaplin. There should also be some Esperanto spoken in "Gattaca," but I never heard any. <br /> <br /> In addition, the other reviewer is right. This movie is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Spend your time somewhere else.
