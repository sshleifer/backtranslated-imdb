I like the "Star Wars" series. I like a good and cheap sci-fi movie once in a while too. Heck, I even like the Nickel-and-dime works produced by Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> I do not like "The Ice Pirates", though. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it seems very cheap, you know? For a movie that was supposed to happen in outer space, it looks tight and closed like it's being filmed in the front seat of someone's Mazda. And the special effects, though appropriately extravagant, seem more than anything like rubber foam painted in metallic ash. <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not let things bother me, especially if the story and the characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> They are not. <br /> <br /> All the history, about these space pirates who decide to find an ice-laden planet they can melt and sell like water (a hot commodity in the future, I think) is as original as jokes, which is not a compliment. <br /> <br /> Humor comes around the crotch level (just like the castration machine you will see at the beginning), and everyone seems to have an angry attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Whoever has done, be ashamed of them. Good old Robert Urich tries, but he is a dependable actor aboard a ship that is sinking (or spacecraft in this case). <br /> <br /> I watched this about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time - no key. <br /> <br /> No stars. Despite the presence of Huston (a year before "Prizzi's Honor") and Carradine (at the end of a once-high career), these "pirates" should be on the board.
