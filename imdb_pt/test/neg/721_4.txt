I was loaned this DVD by the director of a movie with which I am working, in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero. Knowing his own style, I expected nothing resembling a "classical" interpretation of the text. <br /> <br /> What I have found is sometimes impressive, sometimes evocative, but often sinuous and tedious. Like most experimental tunes, I think in movies like this, powerful movie building blocks are created, even though they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format. <br /> <br /> So we have a Caliban who is more of a clown than a threat, and even Miranda does not seem very afraid (which is strange, since we know he tried to rape her at least one turn). A Stefano and Trinculo that are more annoying than funny. A strangely young Prosper who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posture. <br /> Curiously, I do not have a problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned ecstasy and his slightly crazy innocence are actually quite appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not say this is a bad movie, but experimental. One that takes huge risks, but is aimed more at art and film students and not at anyone with an interest in the Storm on their own.
