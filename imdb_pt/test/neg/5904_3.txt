Robin Williams is excellent in this film and it's a pity that the material is no match for him. This may work if you buy the "U-S-A! Number One!" mentality, but wise history nothing happens. It's a pity, since the movie is really trying to say something and it says it honestly. This simply does not bring enough emotional impact.
