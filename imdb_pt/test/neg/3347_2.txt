I must, given the charm of praising this viewers' movie, once again assume the role of the dung in the pot, as Lowell Weicker used to say, I'm scratching my head with the large number of compliments. "The African Queen" this is not. The taste of the period is wonderful, yes. The acting is good, but no actor, however great, can bring to life the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant table-and-dinner conversations here, and I do not care how much is taken from Joyce's text. Imagine spending an hour and a half like a fly on the wall at a Christmas dinner of a group of people not particularly interesting (it is not clear to me that it is a family, as one person suggested), having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie. Absolutely nothing happens. And nothing important is said, but it is said in endless duration. As I said, the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me. Speaking of mysteries, notice a good one and not this one.
