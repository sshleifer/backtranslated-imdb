I've loved every other Don Knotts movie, but I've never heard much about "How To Frame The Fig" and now I know why: I can not think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. This movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds but even most of them would give it a thumbs down. At best, there are brief moments of light fun, especially Don Knotts, playing the same nervous and sour person that made him famous. <br /> <br /> After the movie finally ended, I was curious to know if my teen could learn this. fatal flaw of the movie. We were in complete agreement: the character of Prentiss Gates was even dumber than the character of Don Knotts. <br /> <br /> Be happy that Mr. Limpet's films, Reluctant Astronaut, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken are out there to enjoy.
