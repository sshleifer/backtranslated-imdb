I have it on a double DVD called "Scream Theater" and it's arguably one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some really bad ones. The school is out, and three girls (who if they are teenagers I ate my hat) are talking about "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the strictest for a party of pajamas. Meanwhile, a psychotic has escaped from the local insect house where a girl's father works and is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green clothes, and sporting wide-eyed ... I think this is to show that he is crazy. Of course since he has a bone to choose from with that particular doctor, he goes to his home, whose location is apparently of common knowledge. Meanwhile, some types of idiots hit beers and scare the girls, and of course the crazy one also appears and begins to cut throats. And it's about that, as heavy metal music chugs along the background. Or maybe it's not that, but it's really all you need to know. Unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk, you'll find little interest here, and even though you're wasted most of the time, you'll probably find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10.
