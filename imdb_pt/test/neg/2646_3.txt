Although this was a well-told story, I found it very unpleasant. The main issue is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a sordid affair. Add to that a lot of swear words from the abusive-drunken husband and a GD for a little boy, not less - and this movie discouraged me as I saw him again. <br /> <br /> Punks were also portrayed here choosing the two boys, another unpleasant viewing experience. The realism of the story takes a swan dive when one of the boys flies away on a home plane! Gimme a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive and nice part of this film is to see the pleasant, loving, touching relationship between the two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter has become a familiar face in the next two years with major roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Wood, of course, did not hit big until a decade later, but he made it big in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. These two boys, and the narration of an untested Tom Hanks, are the only facets of that movie that I liked.
