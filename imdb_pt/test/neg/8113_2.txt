A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumbles in Gatlin City where children have killed the adults and are always eager to massacre more, along the way they are separated and Peter Horton, of course, must save his wife from these tiring, er in this very bad adaptation of one of King's best tales. In the original story, King managed to create tension and draw the personality of his characters, however, all this was taken from production and all that remains is a repetitive bore that is too predictable to be so full of suspense. Also the effective ending used in the story is in favor of a happy ending that causes the overall impact to be mute. There is some atmosphere and stylish direction, but no plot to support any of it. Children are also not very convincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
