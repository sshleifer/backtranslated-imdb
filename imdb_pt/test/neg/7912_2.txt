Having watched all episodes of the Star Trek TV series many times since the 1960s, the majority being very good to excellent, and only very few being mediocre, my opinion is that this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it's so badly executed that it's a constraint to the series. It is not that the story is so bad, although it is not particularly noticeable in any way, but the acting is bad on the part of the two main characters, that is, those who are not the regular ones in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her weaker performance than ever as the daughter of a mass murderer, and who is on a mission of a kind. She pretty much calls it the role of a phone and shows no real emotive ability here. Although generally she has never been used as more than a handsome face in most of her film / TV roles, usually in small parts, she has fared much better. Arnold Moss as his father gives new meaning to the term 'Ham' and is the only actor in a 1960s Star Trek episode that overcame William Shatner in that area and really makes Shatner look great in comparison . And he can interpret a Shakespearean actor no less, which gives him more impetus to exaggerate, and he does. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two clues being so weak, the story is such that anyone with any sense at all can tell who the killer is in the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole storyline that ended in the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens. Your answer was yes, you're right. <br /> <br /> Skip this one and watch the much superior episodes of Menagerie that were originally televised before.
