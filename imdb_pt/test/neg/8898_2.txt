Although I seldom agree with filmkr√∂nikan, I have to say that this movie, although not horrible, just did not make me care ... and everything seemed to be out of place ... had its moments ... three or four that made me laugh ... but most of the time I was sitting and wondering why? Why did the characters do this? even the Hot Shots characters seemed more thought-out and improved ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good norrlands movie, watch the Pistvakt. There, they were more than random ethnicities that just went around shooting each other in the Swedish tundra ... <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed ...
