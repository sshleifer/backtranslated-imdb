It's awful. <br /> <br /> I review quite succinctly I know, but it's been a long time since a movie left me in such a confused state - wondering how the hell a movie like that made. <BR> The last time it happened was last year's turkey 'Mission to Mars'. <br /> <br /> Salvatore Coco is an ex-convict - trying to perfect himself through self-help videos, endless seminars and improvement courses. . He lives by the slogans these courses expose. <br /> He comes across a nightclub singer, played by Nikki Bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career will be that of a talent agent - with the singer as his only client. <br /> <br /> Funded by his gospel song, paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler - he tries to re-launch Nikki's career with disheartening results. <br /> <br /> 'Walk the Talk' is the reason why Australians are so scornful of Australian cinema. It's poorly built, lame and too long (111 minutes for a comedy that barely should have scraped the 80-minute mark). <br /> <br /> Each scene is very long and very repetitive. The public does not receive a character with whom to sympathize; a vital ingredient in a movie like this, supposedly about an 'impaired' giving a chance. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic and downright poor ending comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most stupefying dialogue and scenes that have you are clamoring for a power outage. <br /> <br /> This movie is a failure on all levels - worse for the Queensland public for its liberal and innate use of various locations on Gold Coast / Palm Beach; and its laughable use of Brisbane suburban names like Norman Park and Caboolture.
