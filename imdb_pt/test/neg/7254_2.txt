Watching this movie made me wonder, why was Universal releasing movies like that? They had a wonderful sequence of movies with all the classic horror movies. The dawn of the atomic age provoked an onslaught of gigantic creature films. Spiders, ants, mantis'. With Deadly Mantis, we have a giant mantis flying around the Arctic, scaring the Eskimos and being chased by the military. The insect arrives in a tunnel in New York, where the soldiers end up destroying it. Of course, all this is much more watched when viewing it in the MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the movie with a giant map?
