Of course, all this nonsense raises the question: "A genre as self-referential as teen comedy really needs another parody movie?" The lamentable "Scary Movie" (I and II) took the formula as far as possible - 'Not Another Teen Movie' really does not have anything clever or shockingly excessive to add. <br /> <br /> The plot, essentially based on teenflic fairyfloss 'She's All That,' walks in a shaky line between parody and tribute ('John Hughes High School'). Everything from "American Beauty" to "Varsity Blues" is extracted for reference. The result is, ultimately, an unsatisfactory spectator experience. The downside of giving us a carbon copy plan of "She's All That" is that we all know where it's going anyway. And if we did not, the jokes would not make sense. <br /> <br /> There is very little to recommend here. The gross token scene (an erupting toilet) looks badly out of place here among all the 'feel good' references. There are moments of humor - the music is funny enough and the strange good line is sent to the public. Fede, I do not watch.
