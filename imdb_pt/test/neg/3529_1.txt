Hi you, <br /> <br /> I bought this on DVD from England. You see, I have one of those multi-region players. I thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show my friends. Well, surprise to Amy-Jo Johnson, she's barely in the movie. Although it is on the cover. It's really hard to imagine how such a bad movie was made in the first place. Maybe someone has a fiduciary fund. <br /> <br /> Oh ... It's about Vampires who live on the beach
