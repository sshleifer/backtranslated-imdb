The unexpected turn of director Todd Verow in sentimental drama produces a predictable result: nothing new to see here. Attractive but unconvincing - should these 20s be in high school? - dribbling banalities about confused and adolescent sexuality does not seem to me the best way to exploit the promise of Anonymous, who was equally self-involved, but also honest, crude, and by comparison, not so corny. I have no idea what to do with this monotonous, uninspired movie, other than waiting for Verow to find another career. Of course, it's unpretentious, but so is Mike Huckabee. <br /> <br /> No single attribute, however, is as horrible as the electronic belt of Jim Dwyer, which yields endlessly, from wall to wall, the full length. of this film. If I had seen this and heard it in a theater, I would have left. Fortunately, on my laptop, I could rub and mute.
