This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. I hope the REAL family and other characters portrayed have lawyers suing VH1 because of the portrait. The acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the portrayal of the characters is scary. It's supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. I usually like the Flex Alexanders acting, but this time he completely missed the mark. <br /> <br /> You could argue that he took that part for a few laughs because it was so horrible. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS. But if you're willing to laugh because of a bad acting and a stupid writing, do not forget. Do not waste time.
