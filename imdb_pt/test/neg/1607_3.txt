Not only did I read the book and watch the movie, but it was also on the USS John F Kennedy when they filmed it. Needless to say, film crews and actors may be trying to get people trying to do their job. Now about the movie. As a career sailor, I was very annoyed at how they showed their lives aboard an aircraft carrier. I could separate the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone who has ever lived on a carrier could), but this would take the pages. One scene that stood out in particular was when they were in CIC (Combat Information Center) and they were watching a RADAR contact crossing the screen. Each time the contact moved, it beeped. Unfortunately, this equipment does not bip as well (I was a technician on that equipment). The book was based on facts, the film was not. The sequel to the TV series was as bad as the Navy finally realized that the support for this series would only make it look bad. If you are a Navy person, watch this to see how a movie about the life of the wearers is seen by the eyes of Hollywood. If you're not a Navy person, see Midway or Top Gun, at least these movies are fun and fact-based.
