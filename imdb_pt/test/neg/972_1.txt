There comes a time in the career of every great actor when they get sloppy and accept projects they would not have touched with a 1000 foot pole in their golden days. Remember "Taxi Driver"? This was a great movie. I can hardly believe De Niro's "Showtime" is the same actor. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch Time Chasers than watch this movie again. If someone offers to take you to see "Showtime" or pass free passes, or whatever, run as fast and as far as you can.
