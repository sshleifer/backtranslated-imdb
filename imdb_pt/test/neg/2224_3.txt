Based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, AT THE EARTH'S CORE provides little more than a way to escape and give your brain a break. A Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invents a giant excavator, which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to break through the earth to explore the mysteries it may contain. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflicts with prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> Cushing appears as a distracted teacher to the point of being boring. Instead of being a daring adventurer, he comes across effeminate. On the other hand, McClure did enough to become laughable. Caroline Munro plays the beautiful Princess Day who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast are Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
