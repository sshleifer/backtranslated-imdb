This movie is horrible, I can not even be bothered to write a review on this crap! All I'm going to say is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the acting is very bad. The kid who plays the main character really pisses me off, he has the same expression on his face throughout the movie. I just want to slap him! Basically, 80% of the film is slow motion pictures of skaters, weird songs and sh * t. <br /> <br /> Apparently I have to write at least 10 lines of text to send this comment, so I'll use a few more lines, saying that the main character has one of those faces that you just want to hit! <br /> <br /> Meh I give up .. THAT MOVIE SUCKS !!!!
