In fact, parts of it I really liked. There were some interesting twists. But that just left me there, I saw that feeling after all the SAW films. Granted the end was different from a typical Saw, but let's face it ... a group of guys, unknown to each other (or so they believe) thrown together in an abandoned chemical factory .... But then you lose something. There is no intensity, there is little group dynamics, there is no sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Some twists in the end and definitely worth watching if there is nothing else on your plate, but that left me empty. ..it passed the time, but not satisfied.
