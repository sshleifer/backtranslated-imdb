Do not get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, honestly, I gave it an incredibly low standard. The only reason I even saw this was because there were a lot of girls going (different story for a different time). When I started watching, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two terrible types, there's Freddy vs. Jason Terrible, where you and your friends sit and laugh and play about how terrible it is, and then there's a movie like this. The cat in the hat could not create a momentary interest in me. As I watched the first part, I was not only bored with no sense, but I also felt violated by the horror of that film. Mike Myers is generally brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this movie did not click. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / those who changed was that they refused to use any of the original book colors (red, black, white) on any character except the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any original (and I hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. The book was like an ice cream sunday, colorful and delicious, and the film was as bland and difficult to swallow as sawdust. <br /> Avoid it like a leprous whore.
