I just saw a terrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A critic of Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) was right when he wrote: "From A to Zzzzzzzzz." The story is about an English colonial idiot who comes to Malaysia to "civilize the savages," so to speak, and ends up falling in love with his dormant dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a native Malay prostitute fluent in English who cultivates English colonialists and teaches them their native language in exchange for ... well, the film never makes that clear, but I can only assume that it gives you money or something like that . Needless to say, the film focuses much more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get tricky for our young hero when the forbidden love affair is aggravated by his culture, his domestic soap opera situation and his own unrestrained stupidity in all the important decisions he takes over the film. So, yes, the film has some important flaws, but, on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things that I have rented for: a beautifully photographed exotic location, and an even more beautifully photographed woman and exotic artist who interprets the dream dictionary, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this low-quality movie was her most beautiful and that he was right. She's not a great actress, and does not like Malay, and it's pretty obvious they use a double body for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has that rare face and figure that is more than just sexy but also beautiful the way a Vivaldi violin concert or a Rembrandt painting is. <br /> <br /> PS I apologize to all of you feminists out there who discourage objectifying women, the "male gaze", etc. etc., but I hope you can understand that I do not want to disrespect.
