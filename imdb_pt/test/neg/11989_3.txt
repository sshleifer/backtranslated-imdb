I'm deeply disturbed by some posts I'm reading in the forums of this movie, people saying that it's actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best yet, it's not a good movie at all! Far Cry is a cliché mess full of bad acting, bad direction and an uninspired story with a poor script. This is Boll's first action movie, and flash news people, action movies are not too difficult to do because for a basic action movie all you need is explosions and shootings scattered around a fragile plot, and hey, Mr. Boll can do it. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark and Bloodrayne, all the horror games adapted to the films by Boll are much worse than that (they do not have redemptive qualities). Far Cry has two things that make it even better: two good tracks and some well-made action sequences. Til Schweiger is very good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female lead. The normally great Udo Kier is acceptable, as the villainous cliché and the supporting cast are very bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence that came as a shock considering that Boll was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel with bad CGI. , cripples and lame cliches in every corner. Oh, and the worst leads to a sex scene, I think I've had a scene. Not only do the two know each other for only six hours, but all he needs to do is say that he kept warm while he was in the army, serving his fellow soldiers. He already got her to take off her clothes by saying only to her. So he took off his clothes and went to bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to sum it up, this is a bad movie. It's a stupid action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're totally bored. One can do something worse than pop it and watch it, but I would personally say watch a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from that mess. <br /> <br /> 1/5/5
