Harmonia Korrine - Do I hate or hate it? In this evidence, aversion may be a better word. Not clear, just everything he does. But it could have been so different because the first ten minutes of this movie promise a lot, including a fantastic idea of ​​a Michael Jackson impersonator falling in love with a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Fantastic. And put yourself in Paris! This can be great. But unfortunately, Korrine may awaken the strange decent idea, but since he is a horrible writer, the story fails on every level and the audience I witnessed in an hour is a positive proof that he is the most boring and pretentious film that exists out there. . Apparently, the exit rate on its debut in recent years at the Cannes Film Festival was quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he stupidly changes the story to the limits of a castle to introduce a lot of other imitators, making the whole experience tedious and narratively sterile. When will independent cinema stop funding this rookie?
