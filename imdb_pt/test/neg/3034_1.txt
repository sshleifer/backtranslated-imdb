I sat through less painful operations than the time I spent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you try, it's going to be something in the vein of a Guy Ritchie movie ..... Think again! The production, the dialogue, the acting, the script, the work in the cinema and the plot were the worst I have ever seen in a movie. My favorite part in all honesty was the final credits. In all of movie history there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and go out and do something better with your life. <br /> <br /> Do the root canal work instead of wasting your time and money on it!
