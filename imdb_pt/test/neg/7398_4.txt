This is an incredibly standard western, which features some bad acting, boring plot and silly action. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is perhaps how incredibly stereotyped this movie is. It features all the usual cliches, yes even a bar fight and the movie really has no surprise at it. This makes it a boring and weak Western, but neither is it because it is poorly done. <br /> <br /> It's obviously a small production and the film seems to have been filmed in 30 days. The direction and editing can be called bad and all the action sequences presented in the film are incredibly silly. Maybe it's kind of funny to watch, for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> His story is not interesting either. It's a very friendly Western (also bloodless), in which, for some strange reason, everyone seems to be against the Younger brothers, who in this film are portrayed as good and very friendly guys. The story gets more and more dumb as it nears the end. The younger brothers actually existed and were part of the James-Younger gang, of which the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James were also part. Of course they were not as friendly in real life as portrayed in this movie. It was customary for the early 1940s to have sympathetic male characters. It was not really until the era of the Western Spaghetti that the main characters actually became rotten criminals. Strangely, what has come close has always worked better than the early Westerners in that the main character is on the good side of the law. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie original is the fact that it was filmed in color. This was something very unique to a 40's western and still gives the film something extra. You may wonder, why did they film this western in color. The film is still done in the style of a black and white Western after all, and I truly believe that this film would have been a bit more believable if it had been made in black and white. <br /> <br /> You could easily do without this western. <br /> <br /> 4/10
