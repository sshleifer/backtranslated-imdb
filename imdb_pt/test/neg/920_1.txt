This is absolutely awful. It's everywhere and nowhere and it does not have any kind of point. I've never understood what's good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so over this nonsense she must have been a personal friend to the people involved, because no way would she have read any part of this so-called "script" and thought, "Yeah, I want to do it!" Most movies I can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. There is ZERO of it in that. He's extremely stupid. There is really no other word to describe it. This is possibly the biggest waste of money on movies I've seen in a long time. Ignore this at all costs, you will be glad you did.
