I have been a big fan of the Enterprise's original team since I was eight years old. I watched all the movies and enjoyed each one by what they retained from the old series and by further developing the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Even in "The Undiscovered Country", I thought that the aging of the characters was well treated and the story worthy of a theatrical release. However, having said that, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is easily the worst of the series with the original crew. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy is well handled, but the overall script, direction - by William Shatner - and the special effects are worth nothing more than a TV episode. This is a "friend movie" and sometimes almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. The sequences of action are not sustained and, therefore, build little or no tension. Dialogue is weak, though it does provide some laughter, both intentional and unintentional. The Klingon seems to be cast as a belated reflection. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is simply silly and Laurence Luckinbill, an excellent actor in everything I've seen, absurd boarders in this movie. The scene in which Sybok evokes images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain breaks the image of the characters as we know them. Spock would never be a part of this stupidity and McCoy, trying to save his father, is full of insipid and redundant dialogue and totally misses DeForest Kelley's acting skills. The whole scene is wasted and does not really show us anything new and nothing we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner did not have the luxury of working with ILM for the special effects and that the budget for this movie was tight, but that does not allow such a bad story. In some ways, I think this story fits into the old series, but the films, including "Star Trek: The Movie," are much better than that. It's a shame most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of that movie. The focus on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is good but very used. The real crew really seems to be out of character. I liked the old Klingon general and the sultry Romulan at the bar. I like some of the humor and the idea that Spock has a half-brother, but that's about it. If this was a TV episode, I could accept many of the flaws. As a movie, this is just a bad and uninspired movie. Too bad, because I want this movie to be good. Even if it was the level of "Star Trek III" I would be happy, but this film makes all the other films in this series look like Shakespeare works.
