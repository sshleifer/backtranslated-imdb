Ok, anyone who wants to see a great work of art should NOT watch this movie. A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be disgusted with the horrible production values ​​and the vision of seeing an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) prostitute himself. Cotten must have really needed the money or was too senile to realize that the movie sucked. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who at the end of his career appeared in the exaggerated and terrible FROZEN DEAD. I know Mr. Andrews was in the prime of alcoholism, but why did Cotten make such a mess? As for the plot, it is a reformulation of Frankenstein's plot. The first half of the movie really seemed to be making a serious but seriously flawed version of Frankenstein's original story. Then, inexplicably, they introduced a daughter. This was not a bad thing ... until then, out of nowhere, they decided to stop making a horror movie, but they made a softcore porn movie! The change was dramatic and bizarre. It was almost as if they said "okay, Mr. Cotten finished his scenes and went home, ... now ladies, ... STRIP!" <br /> <br /> The problem is that on all levels, the movie is horrible except for the makeup of the monster. Although not great, it is still very cool to see. But poor writing, acting and a budget of $ 17.46 conspired to make it a monotonous and horrible movie - one so bad that playing nudity somehow for the perverts out there should not be enough to lure anyone to see it.
