I would like to make it very clear that I am not religious at all. I am an atheist, but I could see that Richard Dorkins contradicted himself repeatedly. I would also like to make it clear that I am not the kind of person who argues against something with philosophy all the time, but I feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question belief in mainstream science. as well as questioning religious beliefs. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Richard Dorkins always spends some time philosophically thinking about belief, anyone who thinks hard about science and religion will realize that science is indeed a religion in itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference between the way scientific beliefs are held when compared to other religions, but at its roots, it is faith in a particular human instinct. Throughout this series, Richard insists that scientific methods are the only correct way of thinking and it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence is strong enough. If you dig deep enough into how science works, you will realize that it is as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end, faith in the evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our senses, but more than anything . more faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence. <br /> <br /> This is not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were decided because they were, and still are, the most common patterns of recurrence. of which we are aware. I think humans have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something stays in a certain state or place of existence, the more we just assume through blind FAITH that it is more likely that it stays that way. For example, we do not expect gravity to suddenly work the other way around tomorrow, by that I mean pushing the matter out as supposedly to lure it. But the only reason we do not expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as much as we know. However, that does not mean you could not do the exact opposite tomorrow or even now. No matter how long something may remain in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it, but we do it by instinct. I would ask you to consider what is a long and short period of time? There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it took for these supposed sages to decide that everything should be made of matter, sound, light, etc., but let's give them what they would consider to be a cutting-edge way. ! Let's say a lot more time than actually was 12 billion years! Is this a long period of time? 99999999999999999 years makes 12.00 billion years seems like an incredibly short period of time. As far as we know, there may be an extreme amount of changes in the so-called laws of science in the next trillions of years. It's all about comparison, only when we compare things can we say "that's long" or that it's short. It is the same with big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others. <br /> <br /> I doubt any scientist can tell me why they think relying on this instinct makes sense. I certainly do not see why it should, but that does not mean that we, as humanity, should necessarily stop using it. With this in mind, the most hypocritical comment Richard Dorkin made was when he said that faith is irrational, "a process of not thinking," he said. If what we have in that instinct I have described and that instinct we all possess on some level is not faith, then I do not know what the hell it is. Other times when he's being hypocritical is when he talks about religions being the age of bronze, "myths of the bronze age," he says. I would like to point out that no matter how many scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experiments, experiments and evaluations, the pure rules of science are getting older and old all the time! They could even be described as the sacred bible of science. He was talking about how he is tired of different religions being stubborn "I'm right, he's wrong" but looking back as he was rude to the various respondents, he seems to be as stubborn as himself. To be fair to him, at least he does not try to bombard religious communities. I appreciate your hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war, but I do not respect your arrogance in your own beliefs. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science if that's his way. I'm also scientifically oriented, but I do not think he has the right to go to religious leaders having hostile arguments, trying to force their opinion on them and virtually describing them as stupid. Despite all his education, experience and discoveries, he does not seem to have the wisdom to properly question his own belief system. I read what he says in defense of this argument that open atheists as I introduce myself, What he says suggests to me that he is totally missing the point. <br /> <br /> Finally the title of the documentary, Root of all evil. This states that religion is the root of all evil, not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> The documentary series was frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical, and boring.
