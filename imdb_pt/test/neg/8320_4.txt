Bravo seems to indicate that the main character, of course, is brave. I would disagree. The bravest thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her - being brutally beaten along with her fianc√©e who does not live another day - is to go after the criminals without resorting to a totally distorted view of society. The character of Jodie Foster, Erica, is a radio personality, whose niche walks the streets and records what goes on. We are not given any real depth beyond "she had someone she loved, he died, the police do not chase her, she picks up a gun, yada-yada-yada, she stays a little but she is not really involved with the main detective" for the character, and so was left with something left over from previous films: the watchful justice code, where taking power into your own hands is all there is. But we are never sure whether Erica is sane or not, if the filmmakers stand in one way or another (this is to the end, which is such a stupid message to take anyway, dog included as an arrogant metaphor) the city of New York today, which has become significantly safer than, say, twenty years ago, it looks like you will be beaten or beaten if you go down the right alley or just sit alone in a subway car. There may even be a slightly better movie in the middle of it all - maybe just the undercooked sub-plot with Terence Howard's detective who is involved in some custody battle of a child that is not his and a woman he is not connected to and a stepfather who, I do not know what besides owning parking lots and being a bad guy, but we are left for a roadmap that is both spoiled and disjointed with logic. It is laughable, for example, to see that at first the logical side - of Erica failed to film right, as seen in her first shooting at a convenience store at the convenient time of a wife's assault by her husband - and then giving way to the illogical of his attempt to shoot a pimp by driving the car at her and killing him and stooping in time not to get hit. It does not help that Jordon's style with the camera becomes a little more than unbearable: it's called stedi-cam for a * reason *, not because it can get in and out. <br /> <br /> Ironically, the script and direction become very good, or rather work the best way possible under the desired circumstances: when looking at the real scene under the bridge, caught between a recorded point of view by one of the criminals by the ordinary film camera a pace that is perfectly disorienting. And when Erica returns to the air for her radio show, she freezes trying to do her old trick, and speaks of a heart of how scared she is - this scene, from Foster's performance, clear direction and script, is the best scene of the movie. But in addition, there is just a lot of stance in a psychology that is fragile: Is it a De Niro in Taxi Driver or a Bronson in Death Wish? We have her narration about scenes, some of them have nothing to do with her radio show, noticing how upset she is at night, nothing to do but her self-imposed task of cleaning the streets. But unlike Death Wish, a film that has kept more ambiguity and never received a response in the end in a scenario of revenge, the path of endless violence only caters to a message, which will not be new to anyone who has seen a second of melodrama life of the week. <br /> <br /> Actors are content with what is given, and in the end, it becomes much more frustrating to try to stay with the expected, the banal plot, and the old plain. inexplicable (plus the unwilling hilarious, like some profanity shouted by Howard after being shot in a scene), and the temptation to leave increases more and more. It is a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of genuine interest and unobstructed conventions.
