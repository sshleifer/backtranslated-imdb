God, I've never felt so insulted in all my life than with this crap. There are so many ways to describe this crap, that I think if I said everything that came to my mind, I would be banned by this site. <br /> <br /> How do I get started? Well, on the one hand, you do not have to be aware of the original series to know that this movie is a slap in the face of the people who saw it. The biggest massacre of a theme song ever made is here, from a metal version, to a RAP version, what were they thinking? How does the Underdog and a heavy electronic musical style match? The story is so basic that I will do something I do not usually do and not even make a summary. Think about it: a dog gains superpowers and fills the rest. This is how predictable this movie is. And then comes the jokes .... please kill me now. This style of humor that may not even let the kids laugh, it's so bad, it's expected to be a punch after the sneeze. That was kind of funny. <br /> <br /> But what amazes me most is why Jason Lee (Name Ny is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (Jim) are all here. In the shows I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, do a good job and, excluding Lee, are the best actors in the film, but that says very little. The rest deserve Golden Rasberry nominations for this crap. I am very sad to see such good actors buried by this disaster. <br /> <br /> In short, this is as bad as Doogal, which I also analyzed, and again, my head would explode if I saw anything worse than that.
