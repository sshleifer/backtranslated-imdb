It's not a bad concept. I just wish they had taken it in another direction. It's a movie that tries to be interesting, shocking it with bestiality to begin with, what works for most people (Puritans with weak stomachs). But in addition, there is not much for this movie. It's not funny or romantic, so please someone change that label, and since I already knew bestiality is really cool most places and a million dollar industry, I was not really shocked. But most people do not know this and I thought that as the movie evolved after the secret came out it was disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking movies that would teach the ignorant about a fetish that is a very real reality. (yes I did my homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So if you enjoy watching bad movies you can dream about how you could make them better while watching them than sure, have fun doing it.
