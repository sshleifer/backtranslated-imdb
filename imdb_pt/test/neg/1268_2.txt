There are many so-called anti-war / anti-gov. controversial movies around now that start as a mea culpa and end with 'our poor boys are going to hell, so let the world sympathize with them, it's not their fault' - kind of thing. I was afraid that this would be otherwise in this style, even if it dealt with another subject / aspect of the same subject. I almost did not go and saw; for that matter, I almost did not write this comment. What do we get here? An Egyptian is taken to a secret torture center under US orders, but it is another Egyptian who has to do the torture, not an American: "Let's see, we Americans have clean hands," and the Egyptians are very bad anyway , then let them harm yours. Oh, and goody had to be an American with a conscience: in fact, many Americans have them, but here the concept was wrong. Yes, we all know it's called the Extraordinary Rendition and started in the Clinton era and is now used for reasons well beyond control. Otherwise, he was too banal and nervous about condemning the US for being tortured; as if the manufacturers were afraid to go all the way, afraid to be considered unpatriotic or whatever (take a look at the message board! Someone apologizing gets a heavy verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether it be a guilty or not; In the 18th century, Frederick II, King of Prussia, abolished it for convicted killers - although I must say that a life sentence for a child molester is much less than I want to see. All right, what about torture? This movie did not really bring out its horror and hopelessness. When you're under torture, (now comes the capitals for emphasis, I'm not screaming) YOU WILL SAY ANYTHING, EVEN IF IT'S NOT TRUE, EVEN IF YOU DID NOT DO THE THING THAT YOU ARE ACCUSED, IN VANETA HOPE THAT IF YOU SAY AMEN WHY THEY WILL BE PEDDLING, IT WILL STOP. NO, BUT YOU NEVER LEARN AND YOU CONTINUE TO SAY THAT YOU DID WHAT THEY WANT THAT THEY SAY, "YOU DID NOT. Another thing that the film did not bring enough was that TORTURE IS EXCESSIVE, INDEPENDENTLY HUMILIENT AND THAT THE FEELING REMAINS WITH ALL YOUR LIFE. Somehow, it changes the people inside. How do I know all this? Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Reissue: two things: the Arabic that was used in the film was not the Egyptian dialect. It's a little worse than putting together a movie in New Zealand with the locals as the characters and everyone has an American accent. Moreover, the terrible preacher who was inciting his ignorant audience to violence was saying things unfamiliar to that religion, which should have been revealed. Nor has it been explained anywhere that any nymph can become a mullah / imam; it does not need any special qualifications, and that is a gap that needs to be corrected: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and the great ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia, finances many of them. Thank you very much for this space.
