I like all the major actors involved in this rather bizarre movie. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving proved themselves to be some of the best and most capable actors, but I could not get into it. I do not know if it's because I do not understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not understand this movie. Worse than anything is that the actors have made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the point, I do not know. I realize that's probably an insult, but I do not know what else to call them. I must say that I bought the guys like the artists (the correct term?), But the story was also not very good or very interesting. I would say that I generally can not really appreciate the costume designers, although I do notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very impressed with them. Very creative to say the least, not just attractive but I do not think they should be. I do not know that I'm definitely not the target audience and would never see a performance made by such artists, but I would not see ballet, or opera too, so I do not know. If this is your type of movie, then you'll probably like it but if you do not ignore it, because it's ... well, not for most of us. I just checked that you won the Oscar for costumes and I'll say it right. I must say that Ebert also did not care much about this movie, although he liked it more than I did.
