I would say this is a background movie. Play the background as your tending to the busy work (laundry, e-mail check, etc.). I thought this was a movie that was made before Amy Adams succeeded after the Enchanted. Wrong! It was made in 2009! The script / script is pretty awful. I love musicals, but the singing is just average and does not move the storyline together. Ughh It looks almost like it's a TV movie based on cinematography. Am I watching a TV show? <br /> <br /> Even the secretary starts to sing. What the f # # $ is going on?! In fact, she seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so good at Enchanted. The main actor is medium. Disappointed for sure. This movie would have been good for a lifetime, but that's about it. :(
