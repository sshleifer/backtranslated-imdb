Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not suspense, not suspense, a horror movie. Yeah, this movie sucks. Horriblely bad. After many years lurking here on IMDb, I'm really moved to create an account just so that I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It will STEAL YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies so bad, or at least an hour and a half of your life, if you are not smart enough to push the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd love to hear the director's voice on an "enhanced" DVD (there's another horrible thought) to see what the heck they were thinking. Producers had to assume that there were enough sticks to fall into the name of Kilmer to make this film at least balance the international distribution. <br /> <br /> I really had the misfortune to choose this to watch movies on demand, which did not provide subtitles for Russian dialogue. Not that it mattered much. Striving to hear the Russian, translate it in your head (if you can) only to discover how dull it is only adds insult to injury. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie a "1" because I can not give it a lower rating and because it got something remarkable. Somehow, it made a movie almost entirely underground did not feel claustrophobic. Now this is a dubious achievement. <br /> <br /> Here's your spoiler: And the end, holy mother (no pun intended) it's like they run out of money and decide to stop filming. The movie's "climax" literally happens seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I have ever seen in the movie. Exercise your simple exhaust mechanism too if you're watching it - the power off button.
