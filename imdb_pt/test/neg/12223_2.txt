The Ten Steps basically have a reasonably good premise for a scary short, but the execution is simply scary. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind that is regularly witnessed in Irish short films. Really very embarrassingly bad. The girl has to go down the 10 steps of the basement to change the fuse burnt. She phones the father who entertains his boss for dinner. The mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, picks up the phone and, loudly, tells her not to play, since Dad is "trying to impress his boss." The actress who plays the boss's wife very successfully imitates her mother's bad acting when she tells them that their house is haunted. The rest of the film consists of the father persuading his daughter to go downstairs on the phone. The Ten Steps employ camera moving stock techniques, lighting, and music that one would expect in a below-average horror film. Poor.
