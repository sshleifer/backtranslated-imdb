From time to time, an indie comes up who has an incredible cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can not miss but the movie sucks. Some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are "Levity" and "The Safety Of Objects", and now here is "The United States of Leland". <br /> <br /> This impressive cast included Ryan Gosling, Kevin Spacey, Don Cheadle, Jena Malone, Lena Olin, Michelle Williams, Chris Klein and Kerry Washington. Gosling plays Leland P. Fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (Spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child), but he does not remember it and does not seem to have any reason at all. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle plays a teacher in the juvenile hall who is trying to understand Leland (and also explores him writing a book about him), and Jena Malone is his ex-girlfriend. We see their relationship deteriorating (due to their heroin addiction) in flashback. Sounds like an incredible little drama, huh? I thought so as well. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is poorly done, poorly written. The dialogue and the narration are painfully pretentious and full of irritating hassles about "life," the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches, and while it may make Leland understandable in some ways, it masks his crime. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, there is no problem with acting. Gosling (who was worthy of the Oscar in "The Believer") is a tremendously talented young actor, but the way they are written, none of these characters (the least of all Leland) even feels like real people, so there is not much that he can do, but murmur his ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is the most memorable. She has one of the most expressive faces I have ever seen. Even throwing a subscribed character into a bad movie like this, it can break your heart with a look. When she has good material to work on (as in "Donnie Darko" or "The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"), she's really amazing. <br /> <br /> But that's not good stuff. Maybe after a massive rewrite might have been worthwhile, but as it is, "The United States of Leland" is heavy, inert, and for a film that seems passionate about how "deep" it is, it's really superficial.
