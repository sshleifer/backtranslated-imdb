I'm going to start blasting the movie first. Remove Abbott and Costello from the cast and you have a badly colored movie, hardboard from the cast department, very dubbed sound (especially during the chant!) And annoying dialogue (eg listening to the line "Mr. Dinklepuss" ad infinitum). Obviously, some studio hack thought they could profit from Disney's CLASSIC presentation of "Mickey and the Beanstalk," but perhaps the audience was more naive then (unlikely) or stuck in a double (most likely) feature. Even children should feel insulted to have this movie shown to them. A total waste of celluloid. Now, about the performance of Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott has always played the straight man, and according to all accounts, he was the coolest person on the set. On the radio, his character used to be the fast broadcaster, and it was especially funny when his speed made him clear his lines and soften the mistakes. In the movies, he still plays the straight man, but he's more of a con man. Not that he's bad at it, but this character was played perfectly by Groucho Marx. The true transvestite of the duo in the film is Lou Costello. Again, on the radio, he was funny. He played a character who was a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He was also shallow with the lines, and made me laugh when he improvised Abbott's mistakes. In the movies, I do not know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes an imitation of Stan Laurel, who in turn was further upset by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? He was funny on the radio when he was a smarta, but here he becomes a childish character who seems to be attacking the cameras at every shot. this characterization is shown in every film they make, and it only brings a stain on the reputation they had on the radio. What remains for his film career is a poor (very, very poor) copy of Laurel and Hardy. The movies would have been a lot funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of retreading the stock release.
