I bought this movie from a market stall three years ago .. I have to hand it to you when I sat down and watched it .. I thought 'OK! This is going to be another great B action movie. "Obviously I was wrong .. While watching this movie .. I began to realize that this movie was taking me to another planet .. full of cr * p! /> I started getting really bored and fed up with this movie .. Although I wanted to see it happen at the end .. I really felt like it was really getting on my nerves .. <br /> <br /> The people behind the movie they could have brought some names known to this project.But what were they thinking? Even these actors could not save this movie .. At the end of the movie .. I felt that this was a waste of money .. just buying this little movie life for a small amount of money.A few months later, I sent the tape to a charity .. I did not want to see it again .. Sorry! if you are thinking of watching a movie and then dozing off to sleep .. I strongly recommend that you me? I'd rather go in Pro-Plus and watch something decent ..! <br /> <br /> Disappointing 1 in 10!
