This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There is a lot of nonsense over the internet (ie if you install a program on your computer, you will see dead people - very much like if you play a video tape that you will die in RINGU). Frankly, most of it seemed a little silly and lost me. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence - being totally alone for eternity. This was disappointing and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and I have seen a large number compared to most Americans. However, a genre that has become popular in recent years and that I can not relate very well are these horror movies. I know they're super popular - especially since they seem to be redone frequently in the United States. I saw both RINGU and THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and was quite ambivalent, despite their popularity. About the only recent horror movie I really enjoyed about Japan was SEANCE - a reworking of the great British film, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what, I think, made SEANCE different? Well, unlike the other films, just like KAIRO, gobs and gobs of money were not spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience - instead, the emphasis was on the story. The result is that these other films are very much like American movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday the 13th - with scary things jumping to scare the audience and the plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want history - not cheap emotions or ghosts as the main focus of the film. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know I'm in the minority, but I can not find this is a very satisfying movie. All too often, little things happen that can scare someone - but the characters start screaming and crying and acting like they say, "This is the scariest movie ever made, so you better start shaking." Well, I guess this just tries too hard and I wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the movie and the plot progression - not intimidation tactics.
