I turned it off for about 50 minutes! Who was the idiot who decided to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami's (Battle Royal) book, and turn it into a pathetic reality show scenario, deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> It made the movie industry good turn around though. Now directors like William Malone (Fear Com) can say "well, at least it's better than the 7th Series" This piece of crap and Dracula 3000 draw for the top spot in the worst 100 movies ever made! <br /> <br /> Be warned that this is not a 'Bad as Good'Flick! <br /> <br /> This is a shame for Film Makers everywhere! <br /> <br /> Never see this movie!
