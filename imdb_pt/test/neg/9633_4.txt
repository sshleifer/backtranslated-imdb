Tenseless and humorless (especially in the light of his dubious psychology), but very rhythmic and comfortably shocking, this film shows the extraordinarily hypnotic presence of Angharad Rees as a young woman periodically possessed by Jack the Ripper, thus allowing some horrific effects in between of Edwardian property. It is all very normal for Hammer, but is treated with a fair amount of visual elan, even though the central relationship between the psychoanalyst Porter and Rees leads the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.
