I'm a big fan of Eric Roberts, I collect his movies and so far I've gotten to 60. But I'm honest in saying that sometimes he actually makes horrible movies. But that's why I like him - he's fun. <br /> <br /> But this one has to get the price, I can not stop wondering why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and Corbin Bernsen to the picture. While Bernsen is simply awful (I really do not like him), Roberts manages to be the best thing in the movie (and that does not mean much). He practically does this routinely. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts as such. And Tim Abell and his team look like action man plastic dolls and acts like those to. <br /> <br /> The plot is really embarrassing. I have not seen any of the Carnossaurus movies, so I do not remember the images that were added from there, but it explains a few things. But there are still huge holes like craters in the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the nearby forest. But in the end they blow up the whole lab into pieces and just relax that it's all over but they forgot the ones that were out there. When the helicopter pilot is eaten alive, I wonder how she could not notice a T-rex coming up in the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The guys in orange overalls is my favorite - what are they doing, out for a run or what ?? /> <br /> Of course there is a standard B movie sex scene with silicone breasts wrapped as well. This time it's Lorissa McComas who greets us. I have no problem with that (she looks awful), but to look at a guy squeezing tits and being on the verge of climax for 8 !!!! minutes is just tooo long. <br /> <br /> What a shame for all of you (including Eric Roberts) - Now I look forward to watching Con Games (I wonder?)
