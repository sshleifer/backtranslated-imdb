Why is none other than Actor played hilariously bad by Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly, I had the misfortune to go through this turkey before the Mystery Science Theater 3000 destroyed it. I strongly recommend checking the MST3K version as it is hilarious and one of the best episodes ever. <br /> <br /> The film itself is basically the typical kind of B movie that Italian filmmakers were producing. in the early to mid 80's. This movie was apparently made to profit from Conan's craze, but fails miserably in every respect. Stay tuned for the scenes in which Actor fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to do a full hang glider during a faint. <br /> <br /> "Thong, fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> evaluation: the movie itself-1 The MST3K version: 10
