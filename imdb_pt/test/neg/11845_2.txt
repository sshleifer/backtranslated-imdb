The biggest and most disconcerting things of the Raptor movie were ending so the Tyransaurus is identical to the Carnosaur except that the boy in the boot was a little better acted and action than the adult. The similarities to the Carnosaur films were a rather poor choice in the plot. The only thing that approached well was the start with the children in the jeep. Then the plot went down the hill there. It would have been nice if a different plot had been planned, rather than clone the previous films. The raptor movie should have taken lessons from the Jurasic Park series in various scenarios. The only movie that came close to a good dinosaur movie is the Aztec Rex. The scenes repeated as if taken from the Carnossauro films leave a person thinking about these films.
