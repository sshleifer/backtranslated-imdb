So as far as I understand, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is just as scary as the paranormal. The "paranormal" image associated with the villain, Donnie, is purely symbolic. He is actually just a normal human being. <br /> <br /> The problem is that I just do not buy. Donnie is simply no more frightening than the paranormal. He's not even that scary. As a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has only recently become a killer, he is significantly less upsetting than most real-life serial killers (eg, he is very humiliated version of Ed Gein). That's why Scully's horror of seeing nothing but hair-and-nail-cut bodies (something not unlike a normal personal hygiene routine), even before someone is killed or injured, is completely out of character. She sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly recedes. <br /> <br /> So, as Comic Book Guy says ... "worst episode EVER!"
