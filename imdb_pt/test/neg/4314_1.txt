Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and never looked at him again in all those years. Excuse! It was bad. I've been told I have to write 10 lines, so I'm going to put in some trivia. Tom and Tuesday Weld were "featured" in this photo and Tom was told to take it to Tuesday for the premiere, but Tom said he was not going with Joan Collins, and he did and because he did only Tuesday Weld was introduced . I found this very funny then and still do. The movie while the concept was funny, and the actors in it were impressive, but somehow it did not come out funny. The continuity was abstract, at best, it was as if I were watching two different movies at the same time. time, each running to the other. Sorry, Bob Gilson
