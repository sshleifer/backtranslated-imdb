This movie would probably have been nice if they did not use CGI (computer-generated images) for the werewolf scenes. He made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked like caricaturists. The CG is great for certain effects like dinasours in Jurassic Park or Twister. But when we see a movie in which the creature should look completely real, CGI is not the way to go. Seek an American Werewolf in London. Not CGI. Just Makeup and a mechanical creature and what you invented was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel. This movie offered some jokes that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have attracted me, but it's nothing more than a movie that I thought was fine. And that's not good enough. In my opinion, An American Werewolf in Paris does not hold the original.
