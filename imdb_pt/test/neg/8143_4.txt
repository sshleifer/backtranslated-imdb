This movie is perfect for those in love with zombies. is a film that you can laugh at acting for the terrifying zombie action. Having said that, I gave it a 10 outta for effort cos horror is a difficult genre to do. Down the list, the negative points of this film were as follows. #Bad make up #terrible sound and sound effects #really bad continuity #cheesy dialogue #one song played through the whole movie #stein couldn not act and in my opinion one of the worst I've ever seen # terrible final #racist moment and steal the Simpson character named <br /> <br /> the good points #good #police costume officers seemed to have the best performance exp #o actors with fewer lines or small roles seemed to be better # good try with blood gore <br /> <br /> I do not want to talk bad about the movie, it's funny to see why these bad points and I think that's what makes this movie well. if it was better, I do not think it would make any difference, but it would not be interesting to see a remake with the same cast, as I believe they have possibly improved in the last 7 years.
