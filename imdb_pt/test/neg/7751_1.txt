This movie is a bizarre fantasy tale, which I'm sure does not appeal to anyone over 10, but it's very strange for children. The plot is stupid, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Kathy Ireland, 25, plays a teenage girl who acts like a 9-year-old girl. She seems to have heard the voice of her character listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Her shrill, raucous baby voice becomes annoying the second she starts talking. All other performances are bad, but in fact Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter saying that her father, who left her a long time ago, fell into a bottomless pit in Africa, and when she finds him, she falls into an underworld filled with strange people with an Australian accent. It's one of the most Corni movies you'll see, with terrible lines everywhere. <br /> <br /> It is annoying the effects that this film uses for character development. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who does nothing and is not going anywhere. She flies to Africa ... wow, what a development! She drops her glasses and then does not need them. Why does dropping the glasses represent them by not becoming a nerd? It should represent your descent into blindness. You're just an idiot. The only good point I can think of is that there are special effects and semi-good camera work, and the musical score looks good. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a ridiculous family fantasy that will only appeal to those who expect nothing from a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 84 min. PG for violence.
