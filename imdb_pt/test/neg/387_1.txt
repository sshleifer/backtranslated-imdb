This is possibly the worst movie of all time, which really took itself seriously. And not as a result of acting, because as an actor, I must say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, only to escape the need for electroluminescent therapy after the beginning of the wrapped photograph. Being one of the 57 people who actually watched this movie in theatrical version, I must say that I have never before or since lived a movie in which the film ended, credits rolled, house lights lit up and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the house lights went up, people started coming out of their comas to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay we understood, that was a joke, right? They will show the real movie now. Eventually, after the doormen handed out disguises, and we took an oath of secrecy to never admit that we were there, we felt it safe to leave, praying we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. I've seen some really bad movies in my day, (I have Cinemax for God's sake), but I'm still bitter that I will never, ever be able to recover the two hours of my life that I missed by watching Closet Land.
