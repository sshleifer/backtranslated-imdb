Hi, everyone, Oh, boy ... This one's a lulu. It has very bad background music whenever you can squeeze. There are three thugs who, I think, are the stars of it. They beat people and cut people and knock down trucks and tractors on people. Usual material. <br /> <br /> The woman who is sending you on your missions is unable to move your mouth when you speak. It's like watching a bad ventriloquist who is his own dummy. She walks like she's swinging an egg in the head. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has 70's leisure style for men and blah for the female protagonist who is supposed to be a good nurse. A bad novocaine mouth woman wears red. A silk dress, maybe, or maybe just a popeline jacket that's too big. <br /> <br /> I really liked the ending, although it did not make much sense. This tells us what happened at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> The cops are fine. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. The two bright ones could have worked again in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film begins in an interesting way and ends with a surprise. The middle sucks. The guy at the restaurant who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. He's like an actor from 1940. Great voice. <br /> <br /> This is a little too long. The lady with marbles in her mouth could have only a few lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. It would have been easier to understand a bird. <br /> <br /> His scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett
