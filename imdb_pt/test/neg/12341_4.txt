Director Michael Ritchie and Robert Redford's second documentary-style drama, "The Candidate," is a political satire that still seems recent and pertinent today. So it's a shame that 'Downhill Racer', made shortly before, seems so old-fashioned by contrast. The music is ugly and perhaps innovative ski sequences are now standard on the sport's television coverage. The world of skiing seems strangely amateurish (probably accurately, given the time the film was made but difficult to relate to today's professional world), and the theme of Americans in Europe also seems to sink into an era of travel every easier. Perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plan, centered on the arrogant but enigmatic hero; unfortunately, is a sad Redford performance, offering us little insight into their care or motivations. And a character-driven movie without a lot of personality is never a good bet. I expected a lot, but unfortunately this is a boring movie.
