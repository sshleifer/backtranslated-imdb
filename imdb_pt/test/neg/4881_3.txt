I saw Bogard when it was released in the 1970s. It was one of those photos that received an X rating for violence. We walked into our local grindhouse, and we saw it anyway. Very good photo. Lots of blood from the street fights, though the cheap sound effects of the punches took something from him. And a lot of sex. I remember one of the first scenes when Bogard meets this beautiful brunette in an apartment she is showing him. Without a word, he picks it up, puts it on the window sill and blinds it. As I recall, the photo went from that point on. So when I discovered that Bogart is also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard edited for television. So many of the scenes I remember were missing, I wondered if, in fact, this was the same picture.
