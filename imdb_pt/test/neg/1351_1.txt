I really wish I had read everyone's review before seeing the movie ... it was one of the most excruciating movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes in the movie; I should have followed my instinct. The film offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to find out that it was run by a woman! The characters did not represent any woman I knew, they were boring, bitter, and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, little makeup and hair style. It was recently compared to the movie Sex and in the City; it was not even half as good. My suggestion, I do not see this movie!
