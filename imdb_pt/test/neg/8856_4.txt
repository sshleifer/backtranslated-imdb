Well, this movie is really "FULL" HAHA Got it? That's like the attitude of this movie. The plot is only a copy of Pulp Fiction, okay this is acceptable, but to make this piece if "PLUMP" (haha)! is really unbelievable. The plot is so pathetic, and the whole thing just made some laughs. He tried to make some jokes from several other movies, and failed most of the time. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but that's not the right way to laugh. Most supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. The film is short and silent in about 75 minutes in total. They could have done a much funnier job, looking like they'd mocked a hit movie, they were betting, and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> Overall, PLUMP Fiction is "PLUMPABLE", but you will not gather much! <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching again and again ?: It's not enough, it's actually more than enough! <br /> <br /> So is it worth the rent? Ummm .. Like I said, it's "PLUMPABLE", but you're only going to get some "PLUMPS" out of it! <br /> <br /> Overall, in 10: to 4 out of 10!
