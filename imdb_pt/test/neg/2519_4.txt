Okay, this is a weird movie! Fans of Ed Wood Jr. will appreciate the director of "inventive" techniques, George Barry, using such film images and exaggerated voices. It can make a crack in the wall on a raster device! There's more humor than horror here, but I found it an uneven mix. You'll be laughing and crying, and probably wondering why you put your hands on it. Barry explains in the introduction that filming began in this film in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of $ 10,000. It's 59 months and $ 9,900 too much! If you like your cheese on the exaggerated side, with vintage from the 70's, you may find this an irresistible and weird snack.
