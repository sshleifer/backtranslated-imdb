This is really horrible, the weaker attempt of a comic adaptation already committed to the cinema. Every thing possible about this movie that can be bad, it is. Music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects ... on the only good points I can find is that Sue looks cute in her blue socks and that Thing makeup is almost acceptable (only on the face). That's it. Zip lock. Do not worry about tracking this illegal copy; really not worth your time. Even the aborted "Captain America" ​​movie of the early 1990s is far less painful than squirming in its place as you try to endure this mess.
