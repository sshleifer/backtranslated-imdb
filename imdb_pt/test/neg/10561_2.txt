Maybe just to laugh at the way my favorite Jane Austen works was portrayed. Maybe I'm too severe in this adaptation, but I'm afraid to be partial with the A & E version. I have a hard time imagining Mr. Darcy portrayed by someone other than Colin Firth. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed superficial and often forced to dialogue. Lizzy did not seem to have the real feeling that is so evident in the book. Her fantasy for Wickham was exaggerated, and then she suddenly as for Darcy was not believable. <br /> <br /> Darcy was portrayed in an acceptable manner, I will grant you. He managed to maintain the indifference that is needed, but felt that he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that make his character so charming, especially in the proposal scene. <br /> <br /> and Mrs. Bennet was also well interpreted, but seemed to be absent in many ways. Mrs. Bennet's bad mood was not completely captured in her performance. Mr. Collins was a good portrait. Very much in keeping with the book. <br /> <br /> I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst representation in the entire film. <br /> <br /> Other problems I've seen are the few freedoms they took with the order of events, like Darcy being present at the first meeting with Lady C., and also that Miss. Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy in their visit to Collins. <br /> <br /> The choreography was terrible during the dance scenes. The scene in which Lizzy and Darcy dance is much less intense because one can not overcome the feeling that they seem strange in the ballroom. At least this version of the BBC left out the dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when he praises the two in their dances, since they performed very poorly. <br /> <br /> There have been occasional moments that have left me interested, but overall I think this version is a disappointment. I would not advise this movie unless you are like me, and you are excessively diverted by such follies. <br /> <br />
