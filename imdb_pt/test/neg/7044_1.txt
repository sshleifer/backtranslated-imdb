Wow. As soon as I saw the cover of this movie, I immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood movies just because they are so bad they will be fun (eg Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of an atrocious movie: a "gang of local thugs" that is completely harmless, a badly made motorcycle scene, horrible dialouge ("Son of Congratulations, I'm very proud of you being a Bad Boy"), actors playing basketball as if they were good, atrocious songs ("Me bad, me bad, bad bad boy"), unexplained plots like why the Good Boy and Bad Boy are friends ??? And why is the hot girl in love with the nerd? I've never seen such a poorly constructed story with so horrible directly. Some scenes actually lasted 30 seconds like the one in which the Good and Bad Boys ran inexplicably on the "gang member" poker game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you are a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, watch the Guru, if you want to watch such a bad movie that is really fun then watch Good Boy, Boy.
