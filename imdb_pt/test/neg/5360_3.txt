Let me first say that I am a ghost believer, and I really know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know that they are there. <br /> <br /> What I hate are the people who bring the Bible and the Religion to all of this. People forget that there is more than one "Bible," thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways of interpreting what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God and not everyone believes in stereotyped religion. <br /> <br /> Religion does not make everything true, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible hitter is breaking the same rules written inside you. is supposed to never use more than one tissue at a time, slavery is OK, and you can kill your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, "Oh, that was the Old Testament and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is God's word, and can not be changed ... there must be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts and people who so blindly follow it there, "there is no other way." The excuses that these blind followers use are pathetic, or they themselves can not explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses given them by the pastor or the teacher. <br /> <br /> But anyway, for review. I'm a decent fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show was coming up, I was very excited and thought I had some potential. As much as I enjoy watching "Ghost Hunters", I do not like some of its members, and I do not like the way they can overlook a place like being haunted, but I can not explain anything that is happening. Just because your research equipment does not capture it does not mean that the camera filming did not. I'm glad they are skeptical but it's like they did not understand that just because you got nothing on your tape recorder and movie does not make the place haunted or not. If the Ghosts were so easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not as a belief. It's more of a "right place at the right time," just like if there's something there, what makes you think it's going to "show up" for you? This show is kind of silly. It's usually boring, and there's a lot of talk, a lot of psychics, but almost nothing happens. The filtered narration of the main guy is usually annoying to listen to, or basically not necessary. <br /> <br /> In addition, the dependence on paranormal is very abundant, because I believe that MANY of them are really talented. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in, but most of the time it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this show, but of the few I saw I still have to be terribly impressed.
