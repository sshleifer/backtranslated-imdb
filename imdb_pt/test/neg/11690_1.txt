Remember those terrible war movies that your grandmother made you watch 25 or more years ago on your old VHS recorder? "The Fallen" is just a poorly executed remake of those films! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the editing is terrible, the music is terrible and all together form an unbearable nightmare. <br /> <br /> It's also terribly slow! Very slowly! I tried to sleep while watching, but I could not do it because I had nightmares of it. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie! It's so bad! Ten lines are too much, so I do not know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Hit the Eject button NOW and you will not regret it!
