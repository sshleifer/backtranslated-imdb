Make sure this movie may have had its funny moments with people sitting around and I know the movie should not be totally believable. The movie made it so scandalous. For example, a girl like that would never in a million years go out with a face like that too the people in the movies had performances without shine there acting was so bad. Also the bad plot they could have don and a better job in the script at least and they focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really annoying after the first jokes, it was like 10min was laughter, then the old when it is This will end up kicking The bottom line if you want a lackluster of acting mixed with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie.
