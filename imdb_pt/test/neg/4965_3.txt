I read about this movie online and after seeing the positive reviews it received, and seeing the trailer, I decided to check it out for myself. What a disappointment! It starts well enough. the opening scene was really very tense, but from there it's all downhill. I can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but in doing so, they were happy to watch it. These choices combined with the "C.S.I" edition, use of music and montage, lack of suspense, scares or humor really drag that movie down. There's a lot of prefiguration and a lot of "subtle" clues, so when the first turnaround comes early, you already know how the movie will end. I gave the movie three stars because I think the cast did a good job, plus I can not recommend this movie.
