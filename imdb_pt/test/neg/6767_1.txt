THE RAP, the book upon which this film was based was one of the most difficult books I have ever read. However, I failed to score. Cheeky, raw, dirty, indecent ... you name it, had it. He also had some of the best characterizations of any novel I ever read. <br /> <br /> Well, about the movie ... it was deplorable. I mean, Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the worst mutha ... talking about WASCO ... Mcintire like Wasco is like climbing Tim Conway as Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the main character in the book? Small Arv. He does not even exist in the movie ... Fast Walking was not the main guy in the book. Why even name credit this thing with THE RAP? Nothing of the spirit, atmosphere, evil or drama of the book was captured in this film. <br /> <br /> For me, it was not just a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
