Okay, now I'm sure my resume caught your eye and my comment that Zazu Pitts is that Satan is not without some basis. Let me explain. The film at first seems to be a dancing film B about an evil organization called "The Crooked Circle" and its vow of revenge in the form of murder in a rival organization dedicated to resolving crimes. While this is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a private citizens' club that solves crimes) and COULD has been interesting, this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of family supporting actors. Because? Well, because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache! While the murders are being committed, people are being kidnapped or whatever, you can always count on Zazu whimpering at maximum volume - almost like a nasty 3 year old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time, she is not an integral part of the film, but received the best billing. Why she's there is beyond me - I suppose it's just to whine and scream. As a result, I found the film virtually impossible to display and was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I referred to this dubious talent actress as "Satan"! I'm sure that when the actors in this movie saw the final product, they also felt more or less the same way I did about their horrific, amateurish performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is in public. domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why.
