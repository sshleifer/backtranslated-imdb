For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster? ten minutes of charm and ninety-six of errors. <br /> <br /> Travolta and MacDowell do their best, often rising above the numbing and banal script of Nora Ephron. But the movie moves like a snail. And even within their fantasy context, the characters behave implausibly on a regular basis. (Reporters who routinely leave the story of a lifetime? An apparent angel living on Earth? Out of his sight?) Someone forgot to tell the romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt, brilliant in so many other movies, it's not Tom Hanks. The film's climax redefines the invented word. Ephron may be shooting for the sky here, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long and long walk through the movies.
