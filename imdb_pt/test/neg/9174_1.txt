"First Snow" has an intriguing beginning. A street vendor has his fortune told by an elderly man whose predictions are surprisingly correct. From this point, the film presents itself as a bloated episode of "Twilight Zone". I do not want to say anything other than car trips, phone calls, and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual usual performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a nice character, disregarding the well-being of other people because of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no return for the long-suffering public. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one. Not recommended. - MERK
