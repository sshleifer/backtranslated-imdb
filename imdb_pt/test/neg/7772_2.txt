Lazy writing, poor acting and directing wood lead us to a 2005 Canadian TV movie called HUSH, which should not be confused with eight other films that use the same name. Tori Spelling and her husband doctor move from San Francisco to their small hometown where they meet their old friend who decides they still love him. She gets pregnant with Tori's baby (do not ask) and begins to overthrow anyone who might get in her way while she plans to reunite with her old passion. The actors who play the old friend and the doctor are not worth mentioning, because they act more than plans. Tori is not much better, but at least she's something to focus on as the plot snakes here and there before coming to a very lame and very familiar conclusion. Watch instead THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE COT.
