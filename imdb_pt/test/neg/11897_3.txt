One would think that anyone who embarks on a continuation of the pioneer Naked public employee more than 30 years ago would at least try to honor the original with some kind of inspired insight but no. Here we have a kind of biographical film of one of the most elegant people of the late twentieth century, who has no style at all. It is true that the filmmakers gathered a few prominent actors - and handed them a mug of porridge to work on. Everything on the infrastructure of this movie is wrong, starting with the script, which is another of those condensations of great lives of TV movies in which all other lines are a "famous quote" by the subject and all other scenes are an in- your -face presentation to the next key character in the subject's life. We received Swoozie Kurtz as a public relations specialist who promoted Crisp as a state artist; Denis O'Hare as editor of a gay newspaper that hires Crisp as a film critic becomes somewhat alienated from him when he seems indifferent to the passions of AIDS activists of the 1980s, and then returns to the group as a compassionate friend of the octogenarian dying; Jonathan Tucker (in excellent performance) as a timid and insecure gay-themed screen painter who is friends with Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performance artist and woman-about-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by Crisp's personality, offers her a place in her traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and talented artist, but he does not have the least chance of the script to incorporate the realistic Arcade. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-bedroom apartment in an old building in Manhattan's East Village. He said he never cleaned because "after a few years the dust does not worsen," or something like that. But looking at the representation of that apartment in this movie, you would never have the taste of that dust. He frequented a local cafe on a busy avenue and would be seen practically every day of the week drinking tea and watching the world go by. In this movie, we have a diner that looks like something on 12th Avenue, next to the Hudson River. Most of the scenes of "New York streets" have a sterile and unreal appearance, with no concept of the period. <br /> <br /> The soul of this movie is the great John Hurt in the lead role. After nearly 35 years, he can still understand the essence of this peculiar post-Edwardian English and pass it on to third millennia. Every line of it, every gesture is exquisite. In later scenes, he even modulates his vocal projection to fit that of a person whose life is ending toward death. Crisp wrote shortly before leaving this realm that, when grown, the skin of the old person assumes the character of a stinking overcoat that can not be removed and one longs for death. This feeling is seen in Hurt's performance. So for him and for him, this movie deserves a look.
