this 2.5-hour diluted snore-fest seems to be one of the poorest excuses for an adaptation, ever. clearly possessing a budget that allows taking breathtaking photos in Greece, money could have been better spent working on a cohesive road map with character development and clearly delineated motivations; especially since the project has already gone through the trouble of doing so. the portraits did not have passion and direction, leaving the viewer debating whether they should bother to worry about the end of the protagonists. which brings another point - the main character of the original, thriving work is not so named in this version despite the fact that most of the other characters' names are used. Enchantment and magic are also markedly absent from this particular piece. in fact, all the aspects that made the theatrical version of the 'storm' full of admiration and intrigue were completely sucked out of this complicated version of a pompous, selfish idiot who can not figure out how to care about anything but the blur. of its wealth and power. above all, a lackluster effort at best, and a brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration.
