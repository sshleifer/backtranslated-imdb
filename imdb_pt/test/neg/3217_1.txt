It's incredible that this no-talent Chapa has managed to get all these well-known stars to appear in this sad, pathetic, extravagant and exaggerated movie about a short-stacked gangster who looks white but is half Mexican, much of the acting is bad and many of the good stars known in this useless film receive a screenplay that seems to have been made by a 16 year old, I'm sure that this movie is the low point of the career of actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey, which I'm sure are very embarrassed that they have already appeared in this turkey from a movie. I doubt that many people have already heard of Chapa and after this terrible movie I'm sure it will disappear into oblivion where it belongs.
