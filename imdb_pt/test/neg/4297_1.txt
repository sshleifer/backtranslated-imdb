As a fan of war and flight movies, this is at the top of my list. It is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts as if they had just left a high school play. The acting, script, direction, production standards and cast are all rubbish. The only saving grace is some of the flight sequences. If the people they portray were fictional, I could rate it as a 2, but if there is something that bothers me more than anything else in the movies, it's pretending that's history and that the great people they're trying to be, actually did it! It's almost as if they try to write in as many remarkable WW1 personalities as possible. There are many good WW1 flying movies and this is not one of them.
