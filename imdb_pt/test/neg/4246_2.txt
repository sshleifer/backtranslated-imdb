Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story begins okay. Her husband betrays her and she discovers on national television. So she has to rebuild her life. Here it could have gotten interesting or built into a plot, but you get so bored with it. She moves back with her parents and Harry Connick Jr., who plays Justin, starts hitting her. The two have no real chemistry, but you should get the impression that Justin is in love with her. The movie ends the way you imagine, but you wish it had not ended like all other types. They got off to a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable, but instead it's a movie you definitely want to miss.
