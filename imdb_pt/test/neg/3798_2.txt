This movie is in a dead tie with the original for the worst movie ever made. I think this might be a little worse if anything. SPOILER ALERT !!! Here are these survivors on a ship that has been capsized for a long time. Unlikely? It's not impossible. The whole premise is so laughable that it's not funny. There are some very big names in the movie, and neither have they managed to salvage this sad thing. I truly think it's a waste of good celluloid. After seeing this, I also unfortunately decided it had been a waste of my time. Do not bother with that. Or the original for that matter! I gave a 2, mainly because they throw 1 votes out.
