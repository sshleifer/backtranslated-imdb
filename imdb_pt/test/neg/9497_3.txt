I love Ustinov's distinct and literate narration. And the photograph is quiet and pleasant. We put the movie to our 3.5 year old boy who kind of went in and left the room. So for our first screening, we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were delighted. When we re-watched, sitting down for family time, we were all mortified by the violence and life-threatening situations that the poor otter got into. About halfway through the movie, there are a lot of hairy and bloody animals. Too much blood, not just a little. So in the end, there is a wild fight with a dog, so the blood darkens the water. You think, given the G-rating, that's all you'll see ... that they will IMPLY that one of the animals has died. No. They drag the carcass out of the water and show it clearly for several traumatic seconds. Personally, as an adult I love horror movies and I'm fine with violent movies, Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Heck, I love the ultra-violent Battle Royale. But these are not children's films and do not advertise themselves as such. If you are deliberately raising your kids to see the harsh realities of cute animals' lives, then this is the movie for you. If you are like me and my wife, you can spare the nightmares of your children and avoid them.
