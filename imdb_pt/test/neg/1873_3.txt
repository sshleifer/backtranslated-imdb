This is not a good movie by a standard. It's very poorly written and the performance is a little above normal (some performances are well below normal, but Swayze and Gray do a very good job with little to work with). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as stated above, Swayze and Gray were high points. <br /> <br /> What was bad: <br /> <br /> The script. The "bad guys" were simply too bad to be believable. The best villains are the ones who are not so obviously evil. These guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say NOTHING would let me believe they could be real people (maybe there are guys like them but I sure do not want to see a movie about it) Another scene, the first in which Gray and Swayze meet when resort workers are "dancing." Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to enjoy themselves.The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile to her. in the middle to make him dislike her, so when did they dance well together? <br /> <br /> And some of those lines, I mean COME ON (I cringed at the end when Swayze muttered the phrase "Nobody puts baby in the singing. "Like he never did it with a serious face.) <br /> <br /> Another wrong thing, the setting of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Everyone looked and dressed like the 80s! <br /> <br /> Who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles <br /> <br /> The music (original music for the movie) er the laughable one (with the exception of "I had the time of my life", which was good music). <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but DEFINITELY the most exaggerated
