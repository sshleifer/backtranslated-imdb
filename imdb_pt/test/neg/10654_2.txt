This movie is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a sincere teenager with the power to save the Chinese people's pity, the film did not show any convincing argument to prove it. And the rest of the plot made no effort to show us more than a cheap common sense ... The plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can draw from it is that it shows how arrogant a being is can be. Katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The acting and setting were good, but the plot ruined everything, full of cheap cliches and hypocritical scenes, I hope I do not see this movie again in my life. Skip this one!
