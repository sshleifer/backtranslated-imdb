I just watched Disappearances at AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in an almost empty auditorium of 1000 seats. The festival programmer, after seeing the lack of audience, began his opening remarks with: "Well, at least some of the festival participants have good taste in the movies." Well, Mr. Scheduler, after watching this movie, I must reply "No, we do not, and you too!" This part of the "Late Forest" period accompanies the young (not so) Wild Bill as he and his mystic family dangerously perform Canadian illegal whiskey across the border during the American ban. The old-time outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and company) do not just need the money to save their ruined farm, but want to introduce the little Wild Bill to the virtues of manhood. <br /> <br /> Although generously photographed, this adventure story lacks what makes such good films, "tension" and credibility. Kristofferson's mediocre performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream I had at a time when Al Gore played Willy Wonka. I just did not care and when the mystical grandmother of Wild Bills came out of nowhere to give her advice, it simply did not fit. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job as Cameron Frye in the character of Ferris Bueller; Big Bill's brother-in-law while teenager Chris McDermott uses those penetrating blue eyes for his acting benefit. <br /> <br /> But overall, we expect to see Jay Cravens Disappearances playing on a $ 2 Bin Block Buster near you.
