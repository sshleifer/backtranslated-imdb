First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie I felt like I had been sold a goods account. Remember that it is not the movie's fault that IMDb hears it as a first comedy and a second horror (though I do not know how it's done ... maybe some idiot from the movie crew will put it on). Being a fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked based on this and I'm so, I'm sorry that I did. Where to begin? First of all, to get back to my start, there is no comedy in this movie. He tries once or twice, but he never gets more than a laugh at best. My reaction was mostly rolling my eyes and wondering why anyone thought this stuff so tired would be funny. Besides, there is no horror here. Not a second of tension can be found. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on the screen (sorry, but in a horror movie cutting as soon as the good thing starts is a big fault). Hell ... there's even nudity. Call me purist or juvenile ... I prefer some in a horror movie if he can not create an original plot / premise. And how tired how all hell "TV reality show went the wrong thing"? It has been done before and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... ummm .... whatever this movie was called with Edward Furlong. That's how bad this movie is. I do not even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than that. I also liked the comment stating that the time for this was good because "reality TV is taking over". Has anyone from the past posted it with a time machine? Are you kidding me? This thing is crap ... and not in a fun way.
