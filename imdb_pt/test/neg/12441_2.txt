This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I can not believe that people actually a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a movie c) really expect it to be successful. Words can not describe how horrible this movie is. I like my fair share of teen movies, but that did not even come close to being funny. In fact, it was funny for the simple reason of being so horrible. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the movie where I even managed to laugh (plus the laughter about how bad it was). <br /> <br /> Renting this was one of the biggest mistakes. I already did it. It's been a day since I've seen the movie, and I'm still in shock about how horrible it was. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> 2/10
