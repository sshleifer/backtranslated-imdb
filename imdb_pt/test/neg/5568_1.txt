Here, French cinema reaches the bottom of the pit and, compared to it, the least attractive of American teen horror films such as "Friday the thirteenth", "Freddy" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art. It is even more annoying, since there were exciting original elements: the forcel of Brocéliande and its legends, the Druids and King Arthur, were all splendid possessions for a dream fantasy and a horror film. Filmed, as a skillfully pointed user in a fake forest, near Paris, the film is false horror, false Celtic history, false traces - you should see the teacher (Wilms who was a wonderful M. Le Quesnoy em "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille) scream for the "priceless scrap" - which production probably bought in a lying shop - fake characters, fake digs ... <br /> <br /> The boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts. And what can we say about the monster teachers? A ten year old would write a better script than this grotesque farce. To think people can spend money on such a thing when artists are still waiting for a producer! <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Maurice Leblanc wrote a wonderful story dealing with druids and ancient ceremonies in his saga Arsene Lupine called "l'Île aux trente cercueils" . A miniseries was made 30 years ago. Avoid this rubbish "Broceliande" and try to see it instead.
