This movie was a low point for Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. The main points of the plot are drawn directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Upon a Time in the West" (released two years earlier and also with Robards): A man finds a water fountain in the desert, being the only water for many miles in In all directions, he plans to build a 'station' around the hole and to ensure that there is a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. To do this, add an untimely preacher, bad music, quick action shots, even more timid shots - and there you go. There is little doubt why he failed at the box office. The real question is "how did you get so far?"
