(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> this movie was a big disappointment. There are so many problems that I do not know where to start. so I'll talk about what's good in the movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was great. Steve Martine offers a really funny performance from a middle-aged and tense high class. Queen Latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black girl. and eugene levy, well, he practically plays himself. add betty white and jean smart and you'll have a great cast - all played their parts well. and if you look at these guys for 1.75 hours it's worth $ 8 for you so you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But the movie makes many serious mistakes. First of all, there are racial stereotypes and racial jokes enough to offend everyone. all white people are intolerant. all black people are ebony speakers of the ghetto. blacks are cool, cool, with and poor. whites are nerds, hard and rich. (except the eugenics tax, he is clearly taken with the queen latifa and "speaks the jargon" - then latifa calls him "freak." so - if you are a white man and like black women and know street slang you must be an aberration). the film is full of racial slurs on members of the black cast, and in return, whites are portrayed as jerks and boobs. <br /> <br /> putting the race card aside, let's look at the big flaw in the movie: they destroy the character of latifa. she comes to Martin's house under false pretenses, but Martin likes her anyway. she should be unjustly charged with theft, martin takes his case. 3/4 of the film we discover that the character of latifa escaped from prison. then our sympathy for her goes out the window. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot. the movie progresses from scene to scene, with latifa appearing somewhere where it "should" not be (like a country club or martin's house) and martin trying to hide it. This is the joke. then in the last minutes of the movie, they decide they will finally deal with Latifa's claim that she was wrongly accused of bank robbery. martin is surfacing as a homeboy to extract a (say, unusable) confession from the ex-boyfriend of latifa, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Finally (but there is a lot more wrong with this movie This movie seems to be a mix of clips from other films. <br /> <br /> The premise is clearly borrowed from another Martin movie, "The Nanny of the House." hawn comes to live with martin and shakes his indigestible middle - class life martin and latifa meet online - ala "youve got mail" the "peculiar nanny fixes rich man 's life" goes as far as "the sound of music" and "mary poppins." <br /> <br /> I would not see this movie again for free.
