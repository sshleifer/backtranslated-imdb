The idea of ​​nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds great for a movie. Especially because it's supposed to be funny and I think it's heating up somehow weird. The problem is that the film was very rarely funny and often seemed useless and unnecessarily gross. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being assembled again and again, but no one bothered to finish any of them - there was no return. In addition, the film was just brainless and had the winding thugs all over Japan, although they left so many victims of living crimes that it is impossible to believe that they would not have been captured almost immediately - especially since they continued to continue using the same camper stolen for days on end. And as far as being gross, I did not need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. Also, believe it or not, there's a scene where four of the guys are raping sheep! <br /> <br /> In all, I really hated this movie. And it's a shame because I almost always love Japanese movies - not just badly made and uninteresting like this.
