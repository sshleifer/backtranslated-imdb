The story in general, though quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. However, the film was absolutely terrible. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. I was crying all the time because I knew I could never have my time wasted back. I do not see this movie. If you do, bring a pistol with a bullet and a few bullets if you go with friends. I'm sorry for everyone who had something to do with this movie. I also feel sorry for everyone who had to watch the movie. Avoid this movie at all costs, and if your mother forces you to watch, kill it. Hahahahaha! Watch! I'm a psycho now !!!! IKWTCBS turned me into a psycho !!!!
