This late Freda effort plays as a modern day (70, ie gothic thriller), but leaves with few emotions. It certainly is not a terribly bad movie, but it has that feeling that many of Freda's later films have of someone who gave up when they first saw the diary. It starts well enough, almost giallo as in tone, then takes a turn to Gothic territories with a decent (albeit terribly clich√©) configuration. Then, suddenly, Freda seems to have lost interest in the movie and all we have are extended photos of Camille Keaton and lit candles. Then, about an hour later, we come to some sort of violent climax with decent to bad special effects. This is followed by another slow paced with a very obvious twisting end (if it's even meant to be a twist?). And throw some very daunting explanatory scenes along the way and you will have the Tragic Ceremony. So in parts, it has its qualities. But all of a sudden, it stumbles and collapses in front of you. A feather. <br /> <br /> btw stay away from the SHAROMA DVD, a useless pan & scan edition that kills what could be a good visual experience.
