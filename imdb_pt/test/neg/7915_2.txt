... because this is another dead. Deadloving, second-rate animation, invented and not funny songs (though the little sung by the Devil was worthy of Tim Curry), and a weaker plot than Land Before Time 99: Fossils On Parade. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I did not see the first movie. I'm not a big fan of movies involving Heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. Still, I hope to see the first one soon, since it had to be a reason for someone to create such a horrible sequel. <br /> <br /> If I did not get this movie for free, I would not do it. I do not have nothing of that. For a movie from heaven, the only good thing about it was the devil. 2/10
