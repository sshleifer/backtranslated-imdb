We're looking for this hard-to-find VHS after seeing two great Merchant-Ivory photos. Knowing it was an instant crash at the box office, a failure as a rental, I thought it would be worth looking at anyway, based on M-I's reputation. What a pity! Nine years ago, it was a Liberal Agenda goal to spoil the Founding Fathers, and indeed, they have had some success in eradicating the Founding Fathers of many American classrooms, including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders ended quickly when the Washington Times pointed the truth to the New Jersey School Board and its subversive acts. A small part of this was spearheading the supposed connection between Sally Hemmings and Thomas Jefferson, disregarding the bewildering DNA discoveries that failed to support the left-wing agenda. Nevermind! They put James Ellis, an author of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University sealed the agreement by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> As for Jefferson in Paris, the Liberal Agenda round begins in the opening scene in which James Earl Jones is claiming to be Jefferson's son. The rotation simply continues in flashback mode to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person believes the lie to be true, Hemmings' claim would be an insignificant detail on the larger issue of Jefferson's long and vital diplomatic mission in Paris (as well as in the Netherlands, where he secured crucial financial support for America). when our infant nation was without funds). <br /> <br /> In addition to the Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing of interest in this monotonous and tortuous film. Some of the other stories are indeed accurate - adding credibility to frame the lie - but this film has one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please do not ask me why the Liberals decided to destroy the Founding Fathers, because I do not waste time explaining the acts of such people. Do not ask them too; they usually answer these questions with the same answer: "CLOSE UP!"
