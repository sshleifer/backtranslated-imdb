If there is a word I can associate with this film, it is a "constraint." It should be embarrassing for everyone associated with the film, to actually watch it in a theater. Everything - the script, script, dialogues, song lyrics, direction - poor quality, bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I was a kid. I liked it then, mainly because it was a fantasy, a movie of superheroes. It is a genre not so explored in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a great hurry to make the film. I can not understand the reason behind the choice of foreigners as Hindi-speaking characters who can not even hit the timing (nothing to say about dubbing). The script is terrible. The issue even more. If one follows the dialogs closely, one can detect grammatically wrong sentences (which completely change the intended meaning). Nothing special about the music. <br /> <br /> The biggest embarrassment should be for the Censor. There are a couple of nip-slip scenes in the film, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can not even think of a metaphor). The director missed them. The editing team missed. And the censor's advice was wrong, too. So much for the motto of non-indecent-exposure-on-screen. Authorities probably fell asleep while watching the film. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine why Amitabh was with the role. It may be because he was a good friend of the Kapoors. But the paper hardly has anything for it. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he could not have followed with a worse one. There are some heroic scenes, really valuable. But on the other hand, they are embarrassingly unbelievable (catching arrows, for example .. probably could have been better with CGI, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam do not exactly define the burning screen. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their scope is limited. Amrish Puri is your usual self in the role of a fairy-tale villain (letting the vile laugh escape from time to time). <br /> <br /> Overall, an interesting concept. It could have been so much better.
