Preposterous applause, refreshing Herman Melville (!), About the vaguely incestuous relationship of a young man with his aristocratic mother being transferred to his long-lost sister who was raised by gypsies. Or something like this ?? not that one really wants to unravel its multi-layered plot adorned with scenes of pornographic sex, pseudo-symbolic images (the brothers swimming in a river of blood) and other bizarre touches (a gypsy child repeatedly insults the passers-by in the street until it is anonymously beaten to death, the deafening music of a rock band used to demolish old buildings). Considering the material of origin and the presence of Catherine Deneuve (who at least breasts naked), I expected much more of it; apparently there is an even longer version of POLA X TV out there ??
