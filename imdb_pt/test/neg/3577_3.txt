"R Xmas" scrutinizes the life of a middle-class family of drug dealers, married and with children, during the holiday season. There is no story here - just a disjointed collection of events. Ferrara seems to emerge from the juxtaposition of holidays and domestic life with drug trafficking in NYC, going back and forth between them. The players seem to be improvising and flattering from time to time for a little convincing watch. Overall, a weak effort is not worth the time. (D)
