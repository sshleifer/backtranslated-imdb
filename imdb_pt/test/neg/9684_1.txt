How offensive! Those who liked this movie probably never opened a bible. I can imagine those on NBC saying, "Okay, let's make a movie to appease those damn Christians, but they will never know the difference if we have nothing factual or in the correct chronological order." Well, they were wrong. Anyone associated with this atrocity must find a church and repent of their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity. I only gave this movie 1 because I could not give a 0.
