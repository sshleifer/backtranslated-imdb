One of the most notorious "Video Nasties" of the '80s is also one of the most overly exaggerated. "Make Them Die Slowly" is about what you would expect from a potboiler aimed at Umberto Lenzi ?? (still poorly rendered), some ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even dumber than "Cannibal Holocaust") and a lot of courage being chewed. The exploitative violence of the film, however, is often shown only shortly close-up, and never remained for too long, which diminishes its effect (interpreter as you can). Dialogue is Lenzi's usual nonsense, as our male heroes show their affection for women calling them "tw @ t" and stuff like that. The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombardo Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) do their best in the face of growing idiocy (including a completely ridiculous "castration preservation"), but can not save this excess work effort.
