Everyonce in a while, 4kids brings new shows to the company. In recent years, they have brought pure gold like Kirby: Right Back at Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But Recenetly, 4kids was shut down. CatDog is one of the examples. <br /> <br /> It's hard to write a negative comment without attacking the program, but in fact, the Weekenders is pure junk. It revolves around a group that has an active brain. The problem is that anything he thinks comes wrong. It may look good on paper, but after watching it, you will realize just how far from good this show is. <br /> <br /> The Face of Pizza is an extremely stupid character. It is very one-dimensional, there is not much for it. He is hyperactive, end of story. Although many feel that all character is a South Park robbery, I think exactly the opposite. Mechazawa, from Cromartie High School, is an interesting character and can make me laugh. Tino can not do either. <br /> <br /> The cast for the show is no better. Like Tino's mother, they suffer from lack of character. They just stick to one feature and that's it. The only quality left is the fact that the show can make you smile. If it is that the scene can be really funny, or you can just smile because it is so stupid. <br /> <br /> Thje Weekenders is a very bad show from Disney / 4kids. Although it seems to love some fans, it should be left to the kids.
