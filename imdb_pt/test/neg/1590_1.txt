This movie was playing on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to take a look. I watched for the first 20 minutes and then turned off the sound b / c, but sorry, but the holes that are an integral part of a movie plot make the movie nothing more than junk. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bike off the road, leaves for help, returns only to find out that it is being called a hit and run and there is a hunt for the 'monster' that hurt (in the end killed) her. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about a woman in an affluent neighborhood who has two young children and is an active and sociable woman and yet for this movie to work, one has to believe that she does not have a cell phone. Sorry, but that's BS full, especially when everyone seems to have one - they used to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road - when our main woman left the crime scene to go to the 911 phone on some phone public. When the main female returns, the ambulance is already next to the girl and there is a conversation about how horrible the person is that struck and left her. <br /> <br /> Just DUMB. Sorry, but I'm not willing to buy that this woman does not own a cell phone that is needed for the movie to work. Please do not insult my intelligence film, thank you. Maybe if it happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it, but it's clearly a movie of today (1999 at the time). ..but wait, if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> The woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house, the ones where children played, so all the film had to do was make her cell phone die in the car, she did. for another way to call the police. Leaving a cell phone simply created a ridiculous plot.
