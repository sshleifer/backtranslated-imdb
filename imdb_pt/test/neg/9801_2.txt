In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to film the stardom, thanks to her sensual beauty and her highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. She starred alongside greats like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring hits in such films as "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch." She stayed with female stars as well, and she surprised even her detractors with her performance as a bitter marine nurse in "So Proudly We Hail." But the change of times and its own failures reached it and, by the end of the decade, its peak was over. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and two more in the future), Veronica headed for New York, where she made occasional appearances of television and summer programs before completely disappearing from view. It was briefly big news when she was found working as a waitress in a second-class hotel in the early sixties. But now, his long-standing alcoholism and difficult years of life had robbed him of his appearance. Without them, public interest in her soon disappeared again. She returned to the stage in several vehicles, but her success was minimal. Eventually, she moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relative obscurity. In 1966, she went to Canada to attend an obscure film called "Footsteps in the Snow", which had no US release. The following year, it was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to produce a commercial. They approached her to star in her "Time Is Terror" movie and convinced her to invest in the project. As one author put it, "If ever a movie queen suffered a terminal commissure, that was it." Surrounded by amateur artists and pathetic production values, she could not even rise to a minimum level in this quickie shot in Miami, Florida. Seeming utterly ordinary in long plans, and aged in close-ups, poor Veronica was not acting as much as she was on her side. As a troubled doctor, who has found a successful youth-restoration formula using carnivorous maggots !, she seems bored and confused, her most unintentionally hilarious moment when she is forced to improvise as she struggles to play with rubber gloves. The supporting cast does not help at all, just advancing the storyline to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently only required the actors to move while the camera was aimed at them, there is no need for anything like entertainment (there is admittedly a hilarious scene involving a private detective and a corpse in a wheelchair that precedes "The film was filmed for three years because no shot was filmed, but in 1970, the producer put it all together, changed the title to" Flesh Feast " and as the former protagonists, such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland, had unexpectedly revived their careers in horror films, this farce was promoted as the Veronica's "return film." This sounds like a strange course of action for the filmmakers, although it is unlikely that the (young) audience of such a horror film would know or care about Veronica L As expected, she did nothing for Veronica's career, and she died in poverty three years later. A previous reviewer cites a scene in which the female detective working undercover as a nurse in the doctor's lab (supervising the theft of bodies from a nearby morgue) asks for the help of a talented driver to cut off body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighs, "I hope she does not mind leaving her body to science." "Try not to think about it," advises the driver, sawing. "I think you're right, Hans." concludes the detective / nurse: "What is done is done." What a sad end to the career of a star still fondly remembered.
