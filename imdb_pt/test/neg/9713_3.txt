Pete's meteor. I saw this referred to as "authentic" and a "gem". I got this movie on a Saturday afternoon. I kind of wished he would not. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was noted to be Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately it had to be this movie. The first thing you'll notice that Pete's Meteor suffers is a complete lack of plot. Or rather, a lot of small subframes that are not really connected and are not going anywhere. The young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with his grandmother. A meteorite lands in your garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the movie's title, Mickey is the one claiming the meteor, and the "plot" actually has little to do with the meteor in any form or format. From now on, several other characters and subframes are introduced. But like I said before, they really are not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Things range from the cute family movie to the dark suspense very fast, when Pete (Mike Myers) is introduced and begins to play a role. Micky blames the death of his parents, although we are never told what happened or why. Hugh has romance issues because his girlfriend can not overcome his cosmic fascination. And Pete's drug-related past begins to catch up with him and temporarily attracts his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast to the mix when obscure characters begin to try to kill him. That seems to be the main plot until you realize that he does not even have a half-length movie, making everything else seem like a pointless filler. Hugh's girl problems, Mickey's bad behavior, the meteor ... what on Earth do they have to do with it? Not much. <br /> <br /> So the 'plot' is disjointed and half of it is useless. But a good cast of characters can save you, right? Keyword: good. Most of the characters are terribly unpleasant people, most of whom you would like to see die horribly. At least I know I do. Despite the title, Mickey seems to be the main character, which is a very bad move when you see him in action. He is one of the WORST kids I've seen in a movie, with an extremely bad attitude problem. He 'borrows' a car, harasses and talks to Hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually tries to burn the man's house when he can not get what he wants and even tries to stab Pete with a knife. You think a child like that is on his way to prison. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets what's coming to him. I'm not sure at what point you should be sympathizing with his character, because he's always an unpleasant brat. He is the leader of his brother and sister, so they predictably end up taking and sitting behind and just following what he does. Surprisingly, they are so far away that I can not even remember their names. They may not even be there. <br /> <br /> Their grandmother is practically a borderline alcoholic. She tends to be as unpleasant to Hugh as Mickey, and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil looks when she is not swallowing bottles of alcoholic beverages and feeling silly. Very ridiculous when you take into account that she should be taking care of three children. Her problems with alcohol are never really addressed, although she breaks down from time to time in the film. <br /> <br /> Hugh is one of the few friendly characters in the movie, but that's only because he's the punching bag for the movie. most of the characters and takes their mess without returning it. The children treat him with malice, but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do pleasant things with them. He has a girlfriend of a taxi driver who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, trying to leave him several times in the film when he enters his cosmic language or does something to prove that he is not exactly in the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (fortunately). <br /> <br /> Then there's Mike Myers as Pete. Pete, despite having the only solid purpose and plot in the film, is extremely underused and does not play any role until the second half. It's a shame that Myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even when Pete is getting screen time, half is just Myers running through dark alleys and hiding in small corners. And even though it was the only real point for this movie when its plot ends the film, it's a strange and unsatisfying conclusion that has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and bizarre explanation behind the movie title. The movie, making you wonder if they were just performing in the movie you were just watching. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth seeing on Pete's meteor is the role of Mike Myers as Pete, and that's if you can walk through this mess untidy long enough without attacking another human being due to the characters extremely unpleasant and the plot non-existent. No sir, I did not like it at all.
