After an astronaut dies in space, he is taken back to a military base. Inside the man are discovered alien embryos - he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "Attack of the Giant Leeches" (see separate review), but may be best known for his work on "Columbo." The executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one ... especially in the 60s. This film is tacky and poorly constructed. What seems interesting are the poor effects, not the movie itself. One scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos and is an embarrassing depiction of cartoon. Even in 1958. And when an adult alien comes along ... you wonder why he's wearing shoes. Or if you're really insightful, you'll wonder why you saw the alien suit in other movies. <br /> <br /> It's by no means the worst science fiction movie you'll ever see. And you almost have to give some credit - the alien host surpassing a military-base idea predates both "The Thing" and "Alien" for several years. I do not know if those films were inspired in any way (I doubt), but at least they were ahead of their time. In addition, however, the film fails and is only great for intercepting when to drink. I have not seen the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but this is certainly a movie worthy of its insults.
