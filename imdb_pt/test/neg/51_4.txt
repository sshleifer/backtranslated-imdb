One of the last great horror movie survivors - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with stretches broadcast on television before the death of the great Conrad greeting you while you visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad's body is "borrowed" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge mansion where they drink with him, toast with him, dance with him, laugh with him and then put he to bed in a coffin that only happens when lying in an upstairs bedroom. The news of the missing body reaches the widow of Radzoff and his friend (who is proficient in the black arts) and she performs some sort of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that he can, in his own words, "keep an eye on one eye, tooth for tooth ". Well, Frightmare is an interesting "bad" movie. Of course, it's cheap. The sets look like they were borrowed (which I'm sure they were). The special effects and blood and courage are made with liberality and little credibility. Performance is average below average with some exceptions. Re-Animator's Jeffrey Combs is in tow, but in fact he does little in this ungrateful role as a horror-obsessed teenager who needs to steal the body of a dead man for fun. None of the "kids" except the pretty girl who's playing with Meg is good. Nita Talbot plays the "friend" of Radzoffs with waning interest. Also, look for the big - I mean big guy who plays the cop. This is Porkys own Porky of fame. But fortunately for all of us, a performance increases above the material. Ferdy Mayne, a forgotten actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee as an actor and star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a more than laudable job as the icon of horror in public life and a true demon of a man in private life . . Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being, living only for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he's even dead (obviously none of the teenagers swinging at that moment). Mayne is able to look very real, speaks very elegantly and conveys the threat with ease. If for no other reason, you should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; however, I believe when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff who used images of Christopher Lee (does anyone have any thoughts?). Anyway, one can guess what happens and in fact: Radzoff goes out and goes after the children who disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is banal and excessive. The acting, for the most part, is anemic and the direction, so ridiculous. But Mayne does a good job in a sea of ​​ineptitude. Definitely worth a peek. Watching Mayne continue to appear on the screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time.
