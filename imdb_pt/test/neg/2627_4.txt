This was a really good show. I enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback, seeing the old Diggers reuniting again and reminiscing the terrors of their captivity at Changi POW Camp. The main problem with how the program was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a holiday camp than as the place should have been. I am old enough to remember the images of the liberated men of Changi and other Japanese prisoner-of-war camps. No actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance to the condition of these men. They made the Belsen Jews look like sumo wrestlers. I've met several Changi veterans over the years. Many would never ride in a Japanese car, let alone own one. The physical and mental torture these men endured was too horrible for them to speak. What percentage survived? John Doyle may be well writing comedy for "Roy and HG" (I hate that too), but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated. I am happy that the satirists write "The Life of Brian" and mock the Crucifixion because it is obviously comedy, even though some consider it in bad taste. "Changi" is written as a picture of a real event and as such can be considered by young people as a true record. Great performances from an excellent cast can not redeem this lightweight script.
