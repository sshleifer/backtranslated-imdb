Do you hear that sound? This is the sound of H. G. Wells rolling in his grave between this version and Spielberg's film abortion, it has been a difficult year for the classic novel. But at least Steven has some right things compared to this crap. Hello, the ships were not big bugs, they had names. They were tripods and the aliens worked on three. The ships and aliens were all wrong, you can not see the aliens to the end. The effects and the cast work well. But these actors are much better than this "movie" deserves. The thick, if not all the movie, is Howell's character who wonders through the devastation, meeting a person, they join him and he loses them for one reason or another. There are no more than two people on the camera at any given time, although most of the film. It's like filming three at the same time, putting the film above budget or something. So fat the only and only watchable adaptation in the history of WAR OF THE WORLDS is the GEORGE PAL version in the 1950's. THE BLACK HOLE.
