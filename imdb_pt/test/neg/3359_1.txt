Talk about rubbish! I can not think of a good thing in this movie. The script was bad, the acting was terrible and the effects, well, there were no effects. I can not believe that the screenwriter of this movie did Identity, everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish. <br /> <br /> The cover of the video shows a showman with shark teeth and scary eyes. . I look like a scary villain, but like the old saying "never judge a book by its cover", the whole villain looked like a cut cardboard. One part in the movie a girl is killed by a salad, terrible. The scenery was bad enough, as they could set the whole thing up in Lapland, but no, a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this movie as a parody, which I think they wanted it to be, but the only thing that made me laugh badly at the sticky effects. You may argue that I did not see the first, but seeing this I would be safe if I did not try. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke in this movie is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were made at home, and this carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I could guess the budget of this movie, it would probably be between 8 and 9 pounds and fifty pounds. The producer in a last minute panic must have grabbed the actors for the street that gave them the script said that they have 6 minutes to practice these lines and film on an island. <br /> <br /> Finally, the acting in the film was painful, it was as if the actors had forgotten their common speeches and had created them. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this movie: 0 stars out of 5
