The worst movie I've ever seen. The quality of the sound was poor, the cut of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logical and had no speed ... First I thought, "Oh No, I do not want the trail that proves that poor Patrick was an innocent murderer. " But it turned out to be even worse. Normally, in this American movie you get a super suggestion or no suggestion. I want very little tips that direct you to the killer. The public is not involved. And now, when I get no clue, you can expect a sweep like "he / she is the killer" at the end. And that's not all. ah ... That's impossible, let's end it ... <br /> <br /> In a word: Disgusting .. <br /> <br />
