Oh my. It started with such great potential - a bunch of cute Sorority Girls who walks around practically naked, check it out. Then off to a bar where the 80's cheese is upturned a notch, check it out. For a woody state park the next morning, double check. A group of girls and their teacher, rowdy cyclists, a guy General store, and that dood of them live acting like the drunken locals - makes for a beautiful body count, check (and speaking of body counting, note the strong similarity in the DVD cover for the foreign horror film - Body Count! Aka Camping del Terrore). A whacky Indian in the woods doing some kind of ritual, hmmm, okay I'll let it slide, check it out. And then, oh brother, all downhill from there. Terrible. The head of the monster Lochness in the pond made me break though.
