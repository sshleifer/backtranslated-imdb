Schieder offers a semi-credible part as the President of the United States with Maria Conchita Alonzo politically correct as the female vice president. The movie just stinks. with so many plot holes it is a wonder they have managed to keep the movie in which it was filmed. Relegated to HBO's evening hours, this movie is not worth seeing. 10 minutes, you're wondering why it was written. 40 minutes, you're wondering why you're watching. Save the effort and watch a replay of Hee Haw or something. Anything is better than this clunker.
