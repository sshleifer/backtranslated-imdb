There was a lot of hype in this movie and the commercials made it look like it would be great. Unfortunately, as Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 shameful glory of the original Bring It On. There are shameless stereotypes throughout the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all races involved in the film. Hayden Panattiere's performance was sub-par, both in terms of acting and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally shrank because I was embarrassed by the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc) was so stupid. My recommendation to the creators of any future Bring It On movie is that you hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the cast's "acting" was horrible and their lack of cheerleader skill made them completely useless for the movie. Just great character: Kirresha.
