Honestly, I was a big fan in the trailer for 'Stay Alive' when it was released a few months earlier. I kept telling my friend how this movie has a great story - and maybe a good story. Anyway - this movie is a little below my expectations. <br /> <br /> The plot has great potential but as the story unfolds along with acting, direction and bad CGI - this movie is a disaster. The ghost makes no sense, and includes the killings - it's all too rushed, creating a "unreal" feeling in the public's mind. <br /> <br /> This movie can be scary for some audiences - but fear in a sense of shock (due to the effect of sound, etc.) rather than endure fear due to certain valid factors in the film. <br /> <br /> You must re-consider watching this movie.
