OK, fans, it's on DVD. But the only reason to watch this is 1) say you did (due to your notoriety), or 2) if you are an unconditional fan of Bill Paxton. I'm not a hardcore fan of BP, but it was fun to watch and it was the only thing that stopped me from turning it off from pure boredom. It's a shame because this could have been a good movie with some script work done by someone with some intelligence (and a cast led by someone other than the totally untalented and untalented Judd Nelson). Of course it's disgusting, but it's bad, not in a good way. If after reading all the comments about how bizarrely revolting and dystopian this movie is, you're still interested, do yourself a favor and see some bizarre and revolting dystopic bullshit instead. Movies from John Waters, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Basket Case", etc., all come to mind. There is much better out there.
