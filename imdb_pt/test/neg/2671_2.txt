Most of this movie was good, for a sequel to a sequel to a sequel ... <br /> <br /> I was impressed by how much suspense there was; I really hoped it was thrown out the window in favor of blood, blood, blood. It was not, but there are some pretty ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> What I did not like, however, were all the complications of the plot. Those could have been fine if the writers had had time to explain them all. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution, specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage to some extent? What exactly would they do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant? Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have "discovered everything" once they saw the fetuses .. But this was never explained to the audience. <br /> <br /> If you just watch this movie to see people being killed then this will be good for you .. However, if you can not stand a plot being thrown at you, it remains unresolved in the By the time the credits roll, you should go watch something else.
