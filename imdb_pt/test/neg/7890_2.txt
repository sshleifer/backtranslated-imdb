The dog of the Emperor (Richard Haydn) is promised to the dog of Johanna (Joan Fontaine). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a live turf recorder to the Emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna's dog. After a revenge attack in which Virgil is banished from the city, a psychoanalyst insists that Johanna's dog face Virgil's dog so she can overcome her canine fears. This is organized and dogs fall in love. Then do Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes through romance and in the end, Johanna's dog gives birth. But who is the father .......? <br /> <br /> The dog's story is the very weak vehicle that is used to try to create a story among humans. It's a terrible plot. There are 3 main pieces of music, all of them are junk - bad songs and terrible choreography. It's just an extremely boring film - Bing has many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost painful and annoying way. It's not funny ............ NEVER .......... but it's meant to be. Bing and Joan did a lot better than that.
