To describe what is seriously wrong with this movie, it should contain some * spoilers *, so if you go to see it and expect to be surprised, do not read this! <br /> <br /> I liked everything about this movie, except the plot; and in a thriller like this believable plot is essential. It works well, though it's a bit slow, and the camera work and Portland scenes are great for an unassuming low-budget image. The dialog box is very good. <br /> <br /> Mason is seriously taken out of youth working in a telemarketing company that sells insurance. His friend from high school, Berkeley, is his employer and looks after him like a brother, despite the fact that Mason is obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that leave him panting and clumsy for the inhaler. His visions and nightmares suggest he has had serious problems with beautiful women in his past, and the film seems to suggest that he may be a serial killer of women. He meets a cheerful and pretty girl named Amber and he draws it in his notebook. She likes her and poses for him to paint her portrait. He sees more of her and begins to awaken from her withdrawal state, almost becoming half human. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and she begins to wonder. She gets scared and walks away. We are wondering if your sudden coolness will push you over the edge. Their behavior becomes more erratic. <br /> <br /> This is the setting for revelation. To explain how this movie goes terribly wrong I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * For this plot to work, we believe that Amber, a very outgoing young woman, is going to look for a seriously disturbed emotionally young man who, at least at the beginning of his friendship, has a vague look and can only speak in monosyllables or say nothing. He is far beyond the nerd, he seems on the verge of total catatonia. Yeah, I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdos, but usually the Charles Manson type or punk rockers, guys with some kind of manic malevolent energy. Mason is practically a zombie, he's hardly there. Any cheerful young man would cross the street to avoid him. It is not believable that this girl is attracted to him. In addition, there is no credible reason for Berkeley to satisfy the mad Mason, which is also not believable. <br /> <br /> But wait, there's a revelation. Amber does not show up at the Berkeley house for Christmas dinner, where Mason waits for her, and Berkeley, his old friend, has to tell her that Amber and all her other ex-girlfriends, the ones he drew in his many sketchbooks, they do not exist at all! She and all others are mere creations of her distorted imagination: he dreamed them. <br /> <br /> Well, that explains why a normal and beautiful Amber would go to Mason, she is just an invention of her imagination. This could have been the final revelation of the film with proper preparation and setup, but unfortunately it is not. At this point Mason runs back to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he is enraged, he kills her. But now we can understand that Amber was indeed real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. <br /> <br /> In the end, after proving that Amber really exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong, that he misjudged Mason. That would work if Mason had been in the middle of the road from the beginning, but as we, the public, always suspect that he was totally cluttered and possibly a female killer, not surprising to us. We suspected what he was all the time and we could not understand why Berkeley could not see him. But again, we wondered: if she was real, why would Amber be attracted to the catatonic Mason? <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, are we never allowed to understand whether all of Mason's other girlfriends, those in the sketchbooks, were real or whether Amber was the first real? And if the others were real, would he kill them too? What did he do with the bodies? <br /> <br /> The problem is that the filmmakers simply did not know what to do with the material. Maybe there's been a way to straighten out and tell a suspenseful suspense story, but this movie is not it.
