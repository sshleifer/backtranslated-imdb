If there was justice in the movie universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun would never be allowed to step on a film set again. It seems inconceivable that anyone who has spent two entire decades in an editing room, in which LS began his film career, may be totally devoid of any sense of rhythm or dramatic staging, but this film is overwhelming evidence. <br /> /> Worst of all, it's fascinating. From the opening scene where a nurse is dressed in a suit appropriate only to a porn movie or a skit in a Mexican variety show, the viewer is bound to see how low he can go. The answer is not far, since in the next scene we moved to a funeral home where the next stunning fashion statement comes in a black sleeveless dress worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> The aggressively inadequate costume is not the only flaw in the film. Dialogue is a delight to the connoisseurs of poor writing. "You turn my tears into wine," is a sample gem. The actor deserves an Oscar for delivering the one with a serious face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces every scene in the world with what is possibly the schmaltziest soundtrack ever recorded, which turns from shamefully sentimental in the dialogue scenes to tacky groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transitional scenes. <br /> <br /> The script features characters without rhyme or reason and the beats of the story are spread out as if they were with a broken shell. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that this is a horror movie, though. Our characters find themselves in a forest where Dr. Chopper and his two "scary" henchwomen are hiding, who are supposed to be some sort of Frankencreatures but look just like Valley Girls with fake blood wiped under their Supercut shags. I honestly saw a more frightening makeup on eight-year-olds playing candy on Halloween. <br /> <br /> And again, we get a breath of ill-crafted costume work, while Valley Ghoul One jumps up. around a pseudo-Victorian polyblend blouse, while his friend wears an elusive set that may have been almost fashionable in the less funky corners of the 1980s. Dr. Chopper makes the grand statement of fashioned, looking like a Crisco cowboy who got lost in the woods in his big black Harley, dressed head to toe in black S & M leather with a zipper. <br /> <br /> If this sounds intriguing, all means, check it out. There is a lot of divided and elaborate dialogue (such as the precious scene in the "Elephant Cemetery" or Ginsburg's "intellectual" speech). <br /> <br /> To be fair, the cinematography is good, considering what was placed. before the camera, and the actors struggle (with extremely extreme results) to do something from a lot of cliches and inanities. You have to wonder if they were really too stupid or just blindly desperate, not to get off the set after taking a look at the ridiculous villains with their 99 Cent Store weapons.
