As you'd expect, there's a good reason for this film to be so obscure and unfamiliar despite dealing with the ever-popular premise of zombies and starring the queen of the 80's movies Linda Blair, namely: sucks! "The Chilling" is trying very hard? very difficult ?? be a story with depth and factual background, considering that it should have been just a timid and bloodshot horror film about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time until something remotely interesting or meaningful happens. There is a lot of nonsense about cryogenics that I learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So, of course, in this movie, a group of people are studying the behavior of human cadavers when frozen. Needless to say, this is extremely boring, until two stupid night watchers decide during a power outage that it is a good idea to put the cold cells built in metal on the outside in the height of a storm. The coolers are hit by bleaching, obviously, and the bodies spontaneously thaw and come to live to attack a zombie killer. "The Chilling" is a boring and surprisingly scary movie (at least towards the end of the 80s) that does not even consume a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to create an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and I can think of no reason why the zombie attacks have been so cruel. Even despite the low budget available, they could have done better. Scenarios, makeup effects and costumes are regrettable. The research lab, for example, looks like a proper apartment, while zombies can not seem less menacing with their green faces and clothes wrapped in foil. As Linda Blair managed to get involved again in such an embarrassing and low-budget horror film is a complete mystery. She is attracted to bad movies as bees are to honey.
