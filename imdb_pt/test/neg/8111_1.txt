Having loved the novels and short stories of Stephen King for many years, I, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed with the adaptations to film from their printed works. Some notable exceptions are "Stand By Me" from "The Body", "Carrie" from the novel of the same name, and "The Shawshank Redemption" from "Rita Heyworth and Shawshank Redemption". This movie is by far the worst thing ever produced with the name of Stephen King attached to it in some way. Not surprisingly, Mr. King has virtually denied any connection to him. I feel that the thing that most offended me about this badly played, cheaply filmed, horribly directed piece of junk is that they had the audacity to COMPLETELY change the final Do not waste your time or money on this amazing arch-wow of a movie! !
