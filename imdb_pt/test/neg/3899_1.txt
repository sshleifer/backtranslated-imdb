I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide variety of movies, and I mostly like his horror movies, however bad they sometimes are. I think it was morbid curiosity that drew me to this, and I was not curious enough to end it. It may have improved in the end, but unless you are in lesbian sex scenes (of which there are many), then you may want to give a pass. So what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman peeing in a bowl at the kitchen counter (standing)? Only you never care what is used for after, you probably do not want to know. If this sounds intriguing to you, then that's your problem, but then again, you may like this movie. Myself, I am not a prude, I have seen many filthy movies in my day, but at least they were well made, and this is not true. Sometimes too much is too much. Bleah
