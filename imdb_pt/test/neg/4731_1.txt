If you like me like movies with plots and compelling actors, then Alien Vs Predator-Requiem is probably not the way to go. In summary, alien lands in a typical American city, Predator lands in the American city, both have a little struggle, the US government explodes the city, some people flee ... I'm sorry, I think I could have spoiled the end . It is easy to criticize someone who is being critical; people scream, I bet you could not do anything better! I bet I could! Having made this film, watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done; surely there must have been the specter of madness in the room.
