Do not get me wrong, I love the TV series of League Of Gentlemen. It was funny, twisted and completely inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the premise was interesting and I was eager to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre story would take them. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment for beginners. the three weaker characters in the series were the leads and contained small parts for the other characters (why not pick mickey & pauline, pope lazaro or bathtubs and edward for the main parts! It was embarrassing all around, half-shabby jokes and poor joking humor. <br /> <br /> The real argument was the ridiculous drama / comedy of the day (and I'm going to use the word comedy loosely). He was distracted from the main plot and felt strange, not to mention painfully bland. The direction of the film is shocking, and it often seems that the lines were delivered by the characters in a take. Very rushed. <br /> <br /> So - the three-headed monster from Plasticine-esquire. What the hell was all this? It's ridiculous, it seemed the Gentleman's League scored him at the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my entire movie experience. What once was an incredible television series was spotted by a terribly bland movie. <br /> <br /> If I could give 0 out of 10 I would. Do not waste your money watching this.
