I was expecting a lot from the role of SARKAR from Mr. Ahmitabh Bachan, but I'm disappointed. Being a direction of Ram Gopal Verma I was not ready for this kind of movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is very dependent on the power of others, not yours. There is a Tamil movie called Nayakan based on the theme of God the Father and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The film is well directed and the power to the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be very powerless in the film and he only accepts everything instead of changing things. The film does not show the strong impact of God the Father.
