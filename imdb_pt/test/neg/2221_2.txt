Slightly fun and self-consciously raunchy - but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorer roles, and he often sounds dubbed. McClure is very Cheezy to be believed, but who can blame him in the desert of this movie, whose plot on ancient dinosaurs human rulers birds reminiscent of the 19th century "charm period", but not enough and unfortunately the script carries the connotations racists of the literary genre in films. Good effort from the actors, but an ill-conceived production.
