I watched this movie as I sailed through late 80s nighttime infomercials and sitcoms on TV one night at 2 AM. I must say that I did not expect much and did not get much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast were not Oscar-worthy to say the least. This movie has its ups and downs, and has a good couple of twists in the end, but in all honesty, it was awful. Not even a typical horror movie. No blood, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad acting. I would give it a 3 out of 10.
