A bad movie about a bad movie. Is that original or what? If so, then that's the only good thing about it. The lovely Ally Sheedy could not stop this bomb from destroying cinemas and VCRs everywhere. It should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by Danny Aiello's character were advertised as themselves as well as the characters they played in their D-rated movie. Calling him movie rating B is too much praise and would lead to delusions of grandeur.
