What a horrible movie. I can not believe I really sat and watched. A very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, no redeeming features. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "race" sequences are ridiculously awful, and the plot was so bad that I forgot. Part of the film was made at the Spa-Francorchamps course in Belgium in 1988 during the Grand Prix. I was there and I'm glad I did not show up in any of the paddock scenes shown in the movie. It could have been good ... too bad.
