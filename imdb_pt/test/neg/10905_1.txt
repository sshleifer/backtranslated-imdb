I do not write reviews here often, but I can not stand and let other people suffer through this movie without even trying to warn them. This movie is horrible and it's not because "I do not know what the director was trying to convey" or "I'm too dumb to understand the plot"; this movie is horrible because of bad direction, writing and screen acting. This is the "trifecta" of the bad move and the reason the movie went straight to the video. He tries to be something like "High Tension", "Hostel" and "TCSM" by surveying some of these ideas, but it just does not work. I did not have high expectations, not even averages, going into the movie, but I was still very disappointed. It had potential to be very good with a nice scene and good idea for a movie, but it was wasted.
