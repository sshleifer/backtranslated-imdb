What should I say? I only saw this movie out of curiosity, and this is really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends, and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city in which this film is said to happen ... Shame that not one actor or a film camera arrived in Rennes. They could at least have chosen a probable town, or a probable forest, but nothing looks even like Brittany or Rennes ... And calling it a movie about Celtic legends is really making a fool out of the public. Besides these details, it could have been a good movie, but it sucks. Silly scenery, silly characters and no originality. Definitely to avoid.
