Hello - I usually love movies. I am 19 years old, I have seen many and I do not like just one or two. This, however, in the second that ended, I had to pull my sister (who wanted to see) by the arm and I started to cry laughing as I left because it was a ridiculously horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Why it was horrible: - all cows had udders, especially uncomfortable, were SOAPs with udders - none of the characters were unique or enveloping except perhaps the main Coyote Dag - the idea of ​​keeping cows watch coyotes are simply ridiculous - "funny" moments are repetitive and simply become a sequel to overcoming the latter - the themes of working together, which should have been present at the end, were non-existent. Instead, people get the impression: Well, I'm going to take it all to myself, and in that case I was lucky that my friends decided to support me without my knowledge - every moment similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) were beyond grossness, even for a child's film <br /> <br /> and ... the worst of all ... PARALLEL THE LION KING IN ALL THE WAYS Responsible father figure who is killed by the Coyotes are essentially hyenas, with Dag, the main coyote, being the equivalent of Scar) The farm falls into chaos, Odis (the cow, although basically Simba) wants to play, and is shocked that his father died, believes it was his fault even in this movie, it was his fault), confronts the coyotes and gets a screaming butt, after Dag tells him to leave, and about to leave, Odis somehow decides to go and save some chickens and their friends back to him up (by complete surprise, of course, he leaves without knowing that they will come to help him). <br /> <br /> Other things taken from the Lion King: stars moving as signs, paternal figures referring to stars / signs in a mystical loving way, the obviously circularity of how Father Ben met Odis and took care of him, and as in the end the love interest of Odis gives birth and he has a similar experience. Birth in the end? Good God, what the hell ... and even similar music, which seems completely nailed at the end, because it's completely different from all previous music. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is the first movie I've ever seen where I was really rooting for the bad guys - I never understood what other people were saying so far. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Do not waste your time to go see this. Convince the children not to see and watch the Lion King again. Either that, or take them to see the Ant Bully, which was creative and artistic.
