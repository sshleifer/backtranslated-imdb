Watching this movie, you just need to ask: what were they thinking? There are so many notably bad parts of this movie that you may find to be intentionally poor, kind of like a joke. <br /> <br /> I think the worst part of the movie is the direction. There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematographic elements in this movie that are laughably bad. The funniest example of this would be at the beginning, where party guests are getting their invitations via email - The same camera angle is used for each photo (which lasts about 2 seconds) and the same computer screen with the same area work / window / program etc appear. It even seems like the thing is filmed in the same set every time. The entire sequence was also completely silent, with no music or sound effects. Overall, it was a bad way to convey the idea that an email was being sent to the entire city. <br /> <br /> If you listen carefully, you may notice that the song sounds very similar to other movie soundtracks. This is no surprise - most of the songs, including the one that opens the movie, are actually minor changes to scores of other movies (see if you can guess which ones). Also, I noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It looks like it was written and played through a low-end midi keyboard. If you're familiar with LucasArts SCUM adventure games, the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine. <br /> <br /> Everything else about the movie is just plain stupid. The acting is terrible. The script is derived (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the movie remotely funny, unless you see the whole movie as a big joke, being played in a paying audience. Do not rent it. Not even watch when it is replayed in the central comedy. Just forget it - it's terrible.
