I can not help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. It's as if they did not even bother trying to write a good comedy, just rephrasing third-rate jokes and hoping for that to happen. The worst of it all is that it's all so uninteresting and needy anyway. To make matters worse, Kevin James has a smug, permanent smile "I'm so funny" on his face that it would be tolerable if at least once he turned it over to the comedy department, which he does not do, he he just stands there doing nothing like a big bland baby. Which brings me to the relationship between the Heffernan - easily the most insincere and poor representation of a couple on any TV show, really indulgently nasty headache. Remini spends the whole show as if it was a violent task to be around her own husband. Jerry Stiller taking a few laughs at the program is doing a 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld, only this time his tips are almost always based on water because of the inability of the central pair to recognize a joke, even if it flies for them. . The episodes just float in a stream of nothing, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a waste of talent, there is talent here, this is a creative laughing desert.
