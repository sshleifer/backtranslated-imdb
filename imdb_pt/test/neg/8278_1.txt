For me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of cinema - and horror movies in particular. The reviews I've written so far have been for movies that I love, respect, and admire, and rewarded them eagerly with brilliant praise and perfect ratings. A fan of lifelong horror movies, it's a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share my thoughts and ideas about great horror films with others, and hopefully have a hand in exposing people to movies they could not look for . I've only recently started reviewing films for IMDB, and it was my initial intention to focus only on my personal favorites, examining those I believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. However, the existence of movies like "Graduation Day" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. Completely devoid of any merit, this confusion of ideas not formed in 1981 is directed in an amateurish way, poorly represented and, in every way, an absolute embarrassment to horror movies. During the brief couple of years before and after the release of the film, we saw the appearance of domestic (and Canadian) films like "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman" and "My Bloody Valentine". "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn", "Final Exam" and "Night of Hell", among others. These films, although with varying degrees of quality, clearly strived to achieve something in terms of plot, plot, acting, direction and general tone. Not all of the films released during this season's abundant Slasher era would be of artistic merit or commercial success from the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th," but these films were all well made and clearly contributed to the continued development of films. horror movies "Graduation Day," an abysmal farce about a masked killer chasing members of a high school athletic team, was directed by Herb Freed, who can only be expected to never try to tarnish the horror genre with such farce. The task of creating value horror movies is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. This movie fails miserably on every possible level, not least of which are terribly wooden spectacles, ten-cent special effects, an annoying musical score and, most of all, a story without the slightest hint of tension or suspense. A useless exercise on how to waste film, "Graduation Day" is an absolute shame for horror movies.
