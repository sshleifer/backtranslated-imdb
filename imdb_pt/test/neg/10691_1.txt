Never before have I seen such a tale of such unsavory hangers so ungrateful that his golden goose could not settle down. these spunk monkeys are parasites and bad examples of friends. I felt sorry for Troy when he tried to hook up all his friends with Hollywood shows, but as soon as things soured, they all left Troy hanging. The overnight was an invented effort of indulgent retribution to a man who was going against Hollywood forces to maintain the integrity of the story. The simple premise of Overnight is trying to communicate the message, "look at this guy, he screwed it up," when in fact he has a strong underground base, dealt with hard blows from friends and executives, all in the name of getting a project done the way he imagined it. Honestly, the only productive pair that any of these guys played in the overall execution of the Boondock Saints shoot culminated as extra bodies in the first scene of the bar room, after that all they did was moan why they were not big business. based on the escalation of his rancid efforts over the shoulders of troys.
