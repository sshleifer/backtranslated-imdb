I saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when I could not sleep. It did not help. I found myself looking at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. I could happily never see this drawing again, simply because of that face. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong - I love fairy tales and rhymes as much as anyone. But this distorted and terrifying interpretation is simply disturbing. It is mainly the cruel laughter and the exaggerated features that terrify me, and I still have nightmares about it. Please do not let your children see this. It's far, very scary. Please, I pray you, keep this far.
