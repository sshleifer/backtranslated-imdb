Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. The nature of class war would always be a laughable subject, but this TV series explores better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy has always been thrilling and writers have written almost perfectly perfect episodes every time. In my opinion, it's the best British sitcom from the middle to the late 70's, overcoming the likes of RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, ARE YOU BEING SERVED? and so on. With the series ON THE BUSES having ended a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED became the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it is now known), enjoying a four-year run on the channel. <br /> <br /> The movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every aspect. The overall essence of the TV series has been almost entirely stripped by the writers of this abysmal film (whom anyone will notice immediately are not the same ones who worked on the series). As one commentator has pointed out, Mildred does not have the sharpness she had in the TV series and does not come across anything like arrogant. <br /> <br /> The plot, instead of focusing on class warfare with the Fourmiles. this was the basis of the TV series, in fact, writes the Fourmiles almost entirely after the first half hour. The plot, if you can call it that, consists of George and Mildred going on holiday to some hotel and mingling with gangsters. Top-notch talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here. Most of these are well past their prime and they all seem very embarrassed, as if they know full well that the only thing worth hanging is a paycheck (which probably will not be much). <br /> <br /> The jokes and jokes of the movie (if you can call them that) rely heavily on traditional British farce, including wrong identities, embarrassing situations, badly timed antics, characters losing control of what is happening and general confusion. And all this fails miserably. As another commentator pointed out, it seems that the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the TV series, and instead have created something like a CARRY ON joke. The scene in which George is stripped by the character of Sue Bond is particularly out of context. <br /> <br /> A mystery surrounding this movie is the BBFC certification provided - 15. Why is it rated 15 when all there is to see? Is it harmless, non-vulgar entertainment? <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the comedy spin-off era came to an end not long after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind that film, Hammer, known for producing first-rate horror movies in the 1950s through the mid-1970s, soon vanished into utter obscurity. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is a total failure. . My advice - skip this and stay with the TV series. You will not miss anything, I assure you.
