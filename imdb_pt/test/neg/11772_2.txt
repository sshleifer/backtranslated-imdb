It is not often that I give two stars to a horror movie, because horror is my favorite genre. A movie may be bad as it is not a masterpiece, but it can be enjoyable based on unintentional humor, bizarre characters, etc. An example is a large number of horror / science fiction films from the 1940s to the 1980s. They are pleasing to the aficionados of the genre and to the culprits of pleasure, because their "wickedness" is amusing. However, this movie has no humor or bloody scenes from the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I suppose in 1995 it was the heyday of the politically correct, so Gore on TV was at a minimum. Now, in the mid-2000s, with C.S.I. shows, TV is an absolute blood feast! (Good for us, horror fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original stars of 1978.) They are not the defects of Katt and Paul, but the writers and filmmakers who created this lukewarm. Peru. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie. I will not tell you how this is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This TV movie probably had a bigger budget than the original, but it failed as a good terror, as can be seen in the votes of the users here. Stick with the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a fish-killer movie!
