this is by far one of the most pretentious movies I have ever seen. is a slap in the face of some Indians who speak English and look at the mirror. disgusting. the cheesy version of the 1970s politics of the plains of northern India. the message - the educated English-speaking Indian tried to save the poor beggars from India with all their fervor. ignores the fact that poor beggars are also capable and are saving themselves. <br /> <br /> Like a love story, fine. The problem is that the love story and character development are based on a completely fraudulent version of politics.
