This looked very similar to the CHILD'S PLAY movies, except a lot worse. A lawyer tries to save a criminal, who has been convicted of killing his son, of execution. She fails. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the murderer buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. Then, after several people are seriously injured, they find the little girl talking secretly with the doll saying she did not hurt anyone. Throughout this movie I found myself asking myself 'why am I seeing this cheeze?' again and again. The final sucked so bad that I went and watched the cartoon version of Disney shortly after and slept with the light on.
