I got it out of usenet, so I was not prepared for the heavy (and I mean EXCEPTIONALLY heavy) religious theme. Not that I am one of Satan's disciples or something, but it was very heavy. <br /> <br /> Besides, the acting sucks. It may be because they had to have good little boys to make bad boys, but it did not work. <br /> <br /> There was some pretty cool movie involved, so any style-style fan might want to check Skirt, but be ready with the fast-forward buttons. <br /> <br /> There was some sloppiness in the issue. In particular, a black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Approaches a white 240Z. Wheels spin, the camera changes, and what you know, that white 240Z is transmogrified into a Civic white. <br /> <br /> I gave up early, so I can not guarantee the moral impact of it. But I would like to point out that this kind of movie is totally preach to the choir. If the director / writer / producer was trying to bring religion to the masses of unwashed streetracing, they went about it all wrong. I think I'd rather watch an adult diaper commercial than hear a bragging bible from the Bible about Jesus' death for us. Yawn. <br /> <br />
