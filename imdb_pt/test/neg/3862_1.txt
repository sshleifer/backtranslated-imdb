Imagine Diane de Cheers, the intellect-centered character, now imagine she was trying to make a moir√© movie. That would be it. If you just looked at some pictures with no sound, you'd think Hmmm ... this could be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now if you turn on the sound and listen at any time, you will quickly realize that the person who made the movie knows nothing about movies beyond what they read in a book. I was continually thinking that this is a foreign movie, it was so bad. <br /> <br /> If you do not remember Cheers, think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember the character DeFoe who made the horrible movie ... well imagine that horrible movie without Mr. Bean saving . That's what this movie is. I'm not saying anything about what the film is other than it's an attempt to make a dark and moody movie about a man-hit coming home ... at least that's all I could get out of it.
