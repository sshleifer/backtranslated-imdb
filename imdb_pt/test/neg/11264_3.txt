I saw this movie last week during the Berlin Film Festival and had average expectations. "The director is Bertrand Tavernier, and I knew some of his earlier work in French cinema. I really enjoyed some of his previous films. -The cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I was eager to see all this talent on the screen. -I was not familiar with the book on which it is based and I had not read anything about the film beforehand, but I was told it was a research film on Deep South (we have seen many of them in the past, maybe this is as good as the others ...) <br /> <br /> Two hours later, the final titles appear: THANK GOD, IT WAS EVEN !!!! "The plot is beyond comprehension. If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were many smaller characters and there were many useless plots. We do not understand anything! - the accents. My God! The Tommy Lee Jones accent is decent, but I still have nightmares from the cajun-French corner of Mary Steenburgen ... - Poor cast in my opinion. I can not believe that old Tommy Lee Jones can end up with a linebacker dork ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. "Who were these people?" We barely understand who these characters are and what they do. Is there a bait shop? Does Tommy Lee Jones have a girl from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - The comedy attempts were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably his "action" and "suspense" scenes. They were horrible. No emotions. Bad acting (can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there are the science fiction things. No spoilers, but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird. <br /> <br /> I do not normally write a review about IMDb, but I found the film so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But that's just me ...
