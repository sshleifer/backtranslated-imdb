This movie will probably be a real disappointment unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made. The Marx were chosen to be cast in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. They are kind of forcibly embedded in the roles. Ironically, it might have been funnier if he had used different actors who did not have such high expectations placed on them. Instead, it has forever been consecrated as part of a canon that it does not really deserve to belong to.
