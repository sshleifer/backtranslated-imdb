Horrible! There is no other way to put it. In fact, it's so bad that the only reason I'm losing words is to alert other reasonable viewers who want to be cleverly entertained. You will lose I.Q. points watching this. Come to think of it, it is not even suitable for negligent viewing because of the irritation factor. There is no guilty pleasure in watching something so incompetent. <br /> <br /> Reasons to avoid it: 1) Horrifyingly scientifically imprecise, to the point of no longer being science fiction, it is just a lazy, sloppy and lazy fantasy. <br /> <br /> 2) It sports FX which are extravagant and unbelievable. Not even tacky-kitsch is a wink and a nod, like the vintage Doctor Who, but just cheap and shoddy to the point of being insulting. FXs are so bad they are not even laughable. They spent about a dollar and a half on it, not anymore. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction is so weak and stupid that the only way the actors get to the end of the shoot without becoming terminally depressed was. to sleep in their roles, although Catherine McCormack made some effort, probably on principle and in spite of the director. Also, this is not the only bad movie of Peter Hyams: his flats are far more numerous than the bad ones, of which Timecop was the last one, and that was 15 years before that text. he has not had anything decent since (End Of Days was so careless, Arnold was the only draw, and he needed a firmer direction than Hyams). Hyams continues to make it increasingly pointless to think of giving him more work. <br /> <br /> And finally, <br /> <br /> 4) The stories of Ray Bradbury deserve much better treatment than that. Refusing to watch this movie sends this message, not that Hollywood is particularly listening. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk. If you do and end the movies, you're the one to blame (and Hyams) for being more than properly warned.
