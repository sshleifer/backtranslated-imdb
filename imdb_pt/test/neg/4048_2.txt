When I first saw it, I thought it was a joke. All I could think of was "You have the 8MM camera, I'm going to get my little brother's monster toys, we're going to make a movie!" Why would someone in a modern time like 2001 make a science fiction movie like this, it looks like it was made in the early '80s? With actors who are as wood as an Indian of cigars, a script that was written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawnshop, special effects of the poverty line, and moreover, a director who thought making that crap would make them famous. The end result was not spectacular, complete with fragmented dialogue and continuity. Venus must have been fun to do and I'm sure everyone involved had a great time with their little movie. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10 for a brave and hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
