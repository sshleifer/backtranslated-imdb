Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible fighters and horrible actors. Hogan, for some reason, was popular enough to get a movie deal. I'll never know why. If it were not for Vince Mcmahon's money, this stupid movie would never have been made. Maybe someday someone will make a good movie about professional wrestling. No Holds Barred is not this movie.
