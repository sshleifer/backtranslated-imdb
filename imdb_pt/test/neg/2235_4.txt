For one thing, he produced this movie. It has the feel of later films with international casting that are dubbed. The opening credits tell us it was filmed in Vienna. Bey was a delight in the Universal adventure films of the 1940s. He was also excellent in a film I saw ten years ago but has never heard of since: "The Amazing Mr. X . " Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as an exciting and scary movie. <br /> <br /> This one is really wooden, unfortunately. The plot is not easy to follow. When I got the hang of it, I was disappointed anyway. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer looks great as a concert pianist. He was a very handsome leader ten or fifteen years before. He never really picked up like a big star, although he should have. <br /> <br /> This is not terrible, but it's very heavy.
