There could be some AHEAD SPOILERS but I doubt it. I have no idea how the script went through the crusher. It's awful. Completely unwatchable. I stayed there for 45 minutes (about half the race time) and could not take it anymore. I was a fan of Elijah Wood in the 1990s (see "The War") and I've learned to appreciate Mandy Moore's turn of bubbly seriously this year (see "Chasing Liberty", which is surprisingly entertaining). I saw pieces of "Run Lola Run". So with three leads I liked that should have been good. It was not. No one performed well. Wood Jones was flat. For an aspiring writer, he had almost no imagination (his violent fantasies seemed to have been ripped from "A Christmas Story" and his lusty ones were - huh, a cross between annoying and annoying). Powerful is absolutely nasty since the first second and I just know she should be "The Girl" reading the box. Speaking of the synopsis - whoever employed for that work made the film look funny, quirky, romantic, and quite enjoyable. Whoever that person was, he or she should have been employed to rewrite this script. Half way through, I did not care about any of the characters any more. Moore's Lisa is an aspiring actress who is clever and conniving (for no apparent reason), but her ridiculous play (which must be funny in the presentation) is on the same level as the rest of the script. There is supposedly a happy romantic comedy ending with this turkey - given the character material with which they had to work, I just can not visualize it. Save your money. Tell your friends. Do not watch this movie.
