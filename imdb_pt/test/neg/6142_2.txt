My Rankings: Performance - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 General - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This program is a very drug officially. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I do not know, in the other CSIs you enter the episode you are watching. But in this, you just can not get into the episode, no matter how hard you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. I know people have different opinions, and I respect that, but for me, this CSI is not good enough. So if you like suspense, acting / real performance, good plot, direction, character development / addiction and a good show, I suggest you watch CSI Miami.
