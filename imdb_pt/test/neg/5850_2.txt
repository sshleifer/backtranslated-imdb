If you are a fan of a slapper who has terrible writing, acting horrible and cliche after clich√© this is for you. <br /> <br /> There is not much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks. In a brief synopsis, people with a combined iq of 100 travel to New Mexico in a 200-million-dollar race. And yes, they are seemingly superheroes, since they can do many things, such as jumping on trains that run over 80 km / h, surviving numerous car crashes and endless cases of street races and rampaging coyotes . <br /> If you are a teenager, or do not want to think about a movie, this is for you. No actor outside of Lovitz is believed in everything. Lovitz saves the film from a 1 with the Hitler bit. > <br /> 2/10 (save 2 hours of pain and $ 4)
