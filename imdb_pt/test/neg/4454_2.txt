Many Alistair MacLean books have hit the big screen. Some of them (The Arms of Navarone, The Fear is the Key, Where the Eagles Dare) have been well translated; some (Breakheart Pass, Ice Station Zebra, The Secret Ways) have been reasonable enough; some (River of Death, Bear Island, The Road to Dusty Death) were very rotten. Caravan To Vaccares is another film based on one of MacLean's perennially popular bestsellers, but unfortunately this is another one that deserves to be added to the "rotten" list. Populated by uninteresting characters who enter into uninteresting situations and adventures, Caravan To Vaccares is an absolute failure, as much as suspense as entertainment. Her only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) being filmed in very attractive venues in Provence, and b) Charlotte Rampling seems totally enthralling (with totally naked scenes) as the main female character. <br /> <br /> The disillusioned American Neil Bowman (David Birney) travels aimlessly in France when he meets British photographer Lila (Charlotte Rampling). They decide to accompany themselves and, during their wanderings, meet the mysterious noble Duc De Croyter (Michel Lonsdale). The Duke persuades the pair to help him protect and escort the Hungarian scientist Zuger (Michael Bryant), who is wanted by several obscure parties because of some information he is carrying in his head. Maintained by Bowman and Lila is the fact that Zuger discovered a secret formula for using solar energy as cheap and economical energy. Does the Hungarian desperately need his formula for New York, but have the hired guns been put in his lane to capture him? presumably so he can be taken back to some ruthless and tortured criminal lord to reveal his invaluable secret that they can sell for the highest bid. Bowman and Lila find themselves and their fugitive fleeing in the French countryside from their mortal adversaries. <br /> <br /> The movie looks terribly cheap and amateur, almost like an independent low-budget movie made by a -professional cast and crew. However, a fair amount of money was actually played on the film, and everyone involved, at various points in their careers, did a much better job. Therefore, one must assume that the film is bad simply because it was written, acted and directed with a clear lack of care and interest. The pace is very slow, and the plot points become so laborious that the viewer has to put a lot of unrewarded effort to follow the story. Is not Birney's performance complicated, and Rampling only creates a stir because of her nudity scenes? the character itself is an absolute annoyance, and the actress seems pretty bored with it. For those who can continue with the film to the end, there is an unusual scene featuring some deadly rodeo clowns and a ferocious bull (!) Which, while not particularly exciting or well executed, is at least different from the norm. Caravan To Vaccares is a very disappointing film in many ways, and once again a strong romance of the prolific author suffered during his transition to the screen.
