Wow, there's a lot of venom directed at this movie, and a lot of that is deserved, but it's not the worst movie ever. (That's probably "Zoolander.") Anyway, if you're on top of something, too drunk, or just in the mood for a "B-minus-minus" movie you can take This may be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Yes, as others have said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an update on Bram Stoker's novel. Two of the main characters are called Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is Demeter, and they are in the Carpathian galaxy. You find out later that Van Helsing is descended from the original, and he is simply on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and to add to the originality, this movie "scary ghost ship" has another character named Ash. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There are development of fine characters like paper and anachronisms such as the above-mentioned manual wheelchair, and Coolio and Tom Lister speaking in twentieth-century black slang. But what really makes the movie ridiculous is the end. If that's what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours were a waste. <br /> <br /> Like I said, you want a silly movie to play "Mystery Science Theater," and your mind is in about the same required mode to see the episode of "Great Plant Rebellion" from LOST IN SPACE, then you may find it amusing. Otherwise, put a stake in it, it's done.
