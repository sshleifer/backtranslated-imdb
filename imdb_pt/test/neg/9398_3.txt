Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is not better than mediocre and that's generous. The plot is grafted onto a travel diary and remains completely uninvolved. <br /> <br /> Installed in the (say) suburb of Newark, the plot would be considered ridiculous. All that saves the film are the Tuscan countryside and occasional scenes in Florence and Positano, and a film of the "while-the-sun-sink-slowly-in-the-west" variety would have served better to show what is certainly one of the movies. the most adorable places in the world.
