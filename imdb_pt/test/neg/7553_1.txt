No wonder so many young people have Attention Deficit Disorder. It seems that stage productions (dance) are currently about how many cameras and camera angles a director / editor can put on a 1 hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this feat? Try counting them sometimes for something different to do with it, otherwise display completely unwatchable. <br /> <br /> I tried to distinguish at least some faces from some of the other dancers in the production. That was impossible. They did not look like faces, just smudges - it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (good glow!), Michael Flatley's feet and that patented Flatley look over his shoulder squarely. Since he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job, I guess that was to be expected. No need to ask yourself too much about who your target audience is. Riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to present the show practically as you can see from the audience, not from the catwalk, from the side wings or from the perspective of the floor. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Sir Michael has retired. Thank God for the small blessings.
