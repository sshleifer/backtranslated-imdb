I think this was one of those films whose director did not read the book he was based on, were it not for the fact that they were just a bit alike. It is certainly possible that a great film is "based" very vague on a book and this was certainly the last, but not the first. <br /> <br /> There were some flaws. One was that she tried to be very similar to the Railway Children, probably because the adults would expect this, being of the same author. Another is that he also sought to be like Harry Potter, with music and emphasizing the scenery too much. I have nothing against JK Rowling or the movies, but the book is nothing like those of Harry Potter. I thought Psammead, though very well voiced by Eddie Izzard and also by the character, was almost free in a totally inadequate environment. I may have missed something here, since the comments made on one of the characters' books may have been a reference to the imprecision of the adaptation. There was also no need for extra characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they were not. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children. , one of whom knows the book and the other does not. The one who knows him thinks that everything is fine, but he is not as enthusiastic as the one who does not know. I'm not sure what that means.
