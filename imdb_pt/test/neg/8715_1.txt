It is surprising that some people saw this as art. We saw this as a poorly filmed camera (shaky hand camera and all), (usually) poorly executed, impromptu mess that looked more like a high school movie project with kids experimenting with black and white movies. Injecting heaps of poetry into the place of a story does not make an art film. When we watched this in the theater, people were starting to get angry (including us) in the face of the endless stupidity of this self-indulgent, twisting mess. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our candy and popcorn, we too would have left the theater with the other two dozen people who packed up and left looking for something more interesting to do!
