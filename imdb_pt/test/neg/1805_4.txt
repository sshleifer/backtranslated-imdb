In a way, this movie did not even compare to the novel. However, it was nice to have a look of what the Congo was like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. I would never recommend watching the movie instead of reading the book. I hardly even suggest watching this movie, let alone other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others, have not fulfilled this book. An important part that is missing in the film is the sense of how the government's lack of there in Africa was forming an early genocide. Also in the movie, Marlow and his companions did not stop and took the note and the wood. Similarly, Kurtz's African lover beats Marlow at the end of the story who has a great influence on the story, but it was not in the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on the ship, however, he died in his cabin in the film. The groom's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words also differed. This movie is only effective if you want to visualize the novel more clearly.
