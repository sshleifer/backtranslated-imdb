This is just one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. It may not be the worst movie of all time, but if you have not seen many bad, this can easily make your list of the ten worst. When you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original "King Kong," you have to wonder why anyone would sink to the point of producing this disaster. So taking a step further and realizing that the quantum leap for "Star Wars" the following year has reached a new level in science fiction entertainment, this offer will make you laugh and cry at the same time. <br /> <br /> Now, let me ask you, what would the teacher (Peter Cushing) possess to bring an umbrella as a major piece of underground research equipment for the ride to the core of the Earth? Okay, so it was helpful in averting the parrot / tyrannosaurus (parrotosaurus?) At first, but come on. Somehow, I guess that's not what Edgar Rice Burrough had in mind when he wrote his Pellucidar tales. He probably did not have Caroline Munro in mind as Princess Day, probably the only redeeming factor for the whole escapade. <br /> <br /> At least there was some pseudo-scientific explanation that I had a kick; I'm always looking for one in movies like this. This would have to be how the sky in the center of the earth was actually the underside of the Earth's crust, explaining that ethereal pink glow. But as hard as I tried, the story just could not fool me into finding something interesting about Hoojah the Fool or Jubal the Ugly, let alone those half-foolish, half-pterodactyl creatures. Paraphrasing the good teacher - "You can not hypnotize me, I'm paying attention!"
