I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why are more white women always chosen than black women? each episode is always more white than black. as if to say that white women are prettier than black women. I would like to see once again black women, then white women. and not just your show is like that in many more blank shows. but I would have thought since you as the show's boss, you would see this and have more black women on your show. but you're like the rest trying to act like you're so fair and kind. You're just a big hypocrite.
