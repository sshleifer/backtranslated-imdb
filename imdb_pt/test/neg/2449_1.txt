Before seeing this masterpiece, I would never have imagined that a devastating and horribly contagious virus could be defeated by the use of Lutheran prayers ... and "erbs." Ralf Moeller's performance is gigantic; the incandescent realism. I was so inspired that I will fly straight to Zambibwia tomorrow to pluck the pesto and join hands for the prosperity of the third world. God bless this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'll have to watch Troll 2 and Anus Magillicutty just to believe that it's possible to concoct a more clichéd dialogue. He is so tortured that giving a cheesegrater to his fingers may be preferable to sitting through him. The only subtlety he can achieve is his disguised racism, while the poor islanders turn to an ineffective collective prayer that achieves nothing until the übermenschlich, the Teutonic hero Moeller, wrapped in linen, with his direct line with Yahweh, can provide a Blood Sample that the Yankee scientists can begin to work on and save the unfortunate natives. This movie sucks.
