Independent movie viewers know that once or twice a year they will see stories about dysfunctional families and expect them to become more of a challenge to keep them updated, but here, despite the good cast, it looks more like it. Story is about the Travis family who are trying to recover from Matt's suicide (Kip Pardue), who was a promising high school swimmer. (Jeff Daniels) is the father who retires of all and never treated its other son Tim (Emile Hirsch), as well as Matt, but it communicates (of some sort) with its mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) that finds its stock of pot and starts to smoke it. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also starts flirting with much younger men like the checkout box at the grocery store but when she tries to buy more marijuana she is picked up and taken to jail. She does not tell anyone what happened, but she finds bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben took a leave of absence from work. After all this, Sandy gets sick and lands in the hospital where his life is in danger, which forces Ben to realize that he may have to accept the loss of another part of his family. <br /> <br /> This film is written and directed by Dan Harris who worked with Bryan Singer on "X2" and also on the upcoming Superman movie and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion , the story (for me) has many things. The script addresses so many different areas that you need a scorecard to track them, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimentation with homosexuality and a fatal disease. If all these scenarios were not enough for you, Harris then adds a twist at the end that should sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards Tim. As I rolled my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script continues to unfold one thing after another, I must admit that I did not hate this film and I have to give credit to the actors for it. Everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the movie, but I wish the story would focus more on Weaver and his character than Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she might have had a role that might have led to an Oscar nomination, but instead we have endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or her periphcies with the neighboring neighbor. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he just plays so many different things in the audience that the material becomes worked out and invented.
