A very terrible movie about a number of unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well, but it becomes more bizarre and harder to swallow as it moves forward. Rachel Leigh Cook is the only highlight in a sexy and sexy performance, but I recommend this movie just for the actress's fans.
