First, if you want to make a good movie, do not stack all your exposure in the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be puzzled for almost two hours, just so that Margo's father explains everything to Alex very late in the movie. To make matters worse, the writer decided that it was not enough to have the basic mystery solved, but added a completely unnecessary murder about which we knew nothing (involving Alex's father!). <br /> <br /> Motivational issues with characters as well. Margo's father's choices do not seem to make sense when the movie ends. Why did not he just kill Philippe's father and end it? Instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is invented, but one that guarantees that everyone will be at physical risk for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who is murdered by the henchmen of Philippe's father). Although Alex is a doctor (someone whom someone thinks is relatively bright), he chooses to flee from the police, during which he not only endangers his own life but those he engages in an unpleasant pile on the road. Why was Margo's friend so interested in keeping her promise to Margo, since all the crap hits Alex's fan? And should we think that Margo's father prefers to kill himself instead of going to prison? And his wife? Did he consider your wishes? These are some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> Then there are some nasty details, like: Why was her father there the night of his forged death? How did he get the addict's body in such a short time and quickly retrieved it to bury him with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems anxious to be part of the chaos in which he and his friends have to kill for Alex, despite his debt to Alex for saving his son's life. What good do Margo photos do? They do not imply Philippe at all. And why would Margo have the safe deposit box key that night for her possible hijackers to take? Did I miss some other things? Probably. Minor irritations of mine include the fact that although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a demon. What makes your marathon run away from the police, even if more impressive. Also, when he's riding in the convertible with his lawyer, none of them is wearing a seat belt. How brilliant could they be?
