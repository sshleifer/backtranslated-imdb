After having problems in Chicago, the Solomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farm to start over, but their idyllic life attempts are cut short when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben begin to see and being attacked by supernatural beings who do not allow them to live in peace. <br /> <br /> Messengers begin decently, although eventually they become a generic horror movie that is much more comical than scary. After reading the premise, I thought it might have been a decent movie, as it looked scary and had potential. Unfortunately, the film did not match its potential, although I should have expected it, since the trailer was horrible. The script was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and insipid dialogue. The characters were not developed and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots, so it was hard to feel sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The directors did a horrible job in building the suspense. They mostly counted on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. The music was really exaggerated and only made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I also did not like how they used only one location for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where most of the filming happened, so it got a bit boring after some time to see the same area. Besides, I did not like the actors' closes. During a conversation, the camera shifted continuously from character to another within five seconds and became very annoying. The directors created a decent atmosphere and got some points to make their movie stylish. However, since we've come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not so difficult to make your movie look cool, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in December, I'm sure it would have received several nominations for the Razzie. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in the Panic Room, but you would not be able to tell that she has talent when watching her performance in The Messengers. She was good at acting afraid and that's it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was awful when it came to everything. It looked like she was reading your lines and had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just too much wood and he almost showed no emotion. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had some good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and have managed to act in many of the adult actors. Overall, this lame horror movie is not worth watching because of its softness and laziness to make movies. Overall Rating 4/10
