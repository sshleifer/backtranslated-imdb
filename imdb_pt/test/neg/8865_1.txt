Now, first let me say that I love God's horrible movies. Especially horror movies mainly. I watched hundreds of movies at Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But this is the absolute worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off was so bad. It was bland and simply unacceptable. Give me 3 views of Back of Hands The Hands of Fate or Monster A-go-go on it any day. Avoid this movie as the gauge !! Now I'm sorry as I'm going to rip my eyes off to clear them of the dirt I had to watch to get a decent judgment for this movie. Just a decent joke in the part I watched was that the killers are now a pair of extermination for Hitmen Exterminators. Even that was not a big gag.
