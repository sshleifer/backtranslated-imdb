The Bone Collector is set in New York and begins as one of the most renowned criminologists in the world, and Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) crime scene experts are involved in an accident that leaves him quadriplegic bedridden. Jump four years later and Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are abducted shortly after New York police officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene and finds the body buried and mutilated by Alan. Amelia realizes some unusual evidence from the crime scene and makes a note that impresses Rhyme when he is invited to work on the case, he quickly realizes that the evidence is, in fact, cryptic clues about Lindsay's whereabouts. Having broken the clues, the cops arrive too late to save her, but that's only the beginning, as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill and leave forensic clues to Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I have to say it's one of the worst posts in the big budget The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I've seen actually does Friday 13th (1980) looks sophisticated and realistic! Jeremy Iacone's script was based on Jeffery Deaver's book and is so poor on many levels that I barely know where to start. To start with, it takes itself seriously and this makes all other faults seem so bad. The characters are really horrible and I did not believe any of them were really human. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralyzed from the neck down and there is simply not much that the script can do with him, in fact he literally can not do anything but stay in bed all through the movie. He's apparently impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train and thought that a recent footprint near a murdered person might be relevant, I'm not being funny here, but no police officer could realize that a footprint near a murder victim might have some relevance . ? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney who is not only nasty and screams at all for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short span of time in which each victim had sections of flesh and skin surgically removed from their bodies , how exactly did this guy become a police captain? So there's the killer whose motives are less plausible, are you trying to tell me that they invented an intricate plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in prison for something they actually did? If they wanted to get revenge on Rhyme, why did they kill all the other people who had no connection with anything, I could buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them out, but not to kill several other people who have no connection with them themselves. , the intended target Rhyme anything else. Also after planning an intricate plan to kill these people and run away with them, they suddenly become the most stupid person in history, because despite holding a large knife and being able to walk and use their arms they are defeated and almost dead by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below the neck! How did this happen? I should also mention Amelia, who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take pictures of the crime scene and shoots at mice for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> In addition to some of the worst characters written, the story and storyline is not much better. We never figure out why the killer is using The Bone Collector as inspiration. We never find out why the killer was pulling out strips of the flesh of its victims. It's never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia can get into crime scenes before even the appropriate forensic teams. There is no reason for the killer to choose his victims. Also the murderers' clues are a bit obscure, are not they? I mean, a bloody animal bone and scraped rat hair? Of course, how does one go from a bone hairs to the precise location of the next victim and has the entire city of New York to choose from? There are some nonsense about a bird that sits on the edge of the Rhymes window, which is totally random and in almost two hours. The bone collector is really slow. There's so much wrong with The Bone Collector and it all boils down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious at every level and it has zero credibility. Apparently, Angelina Jolie stated that she recorded nude scenes for this movie, but they were cut because they were felt to be very disturbing. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 48,000,000 The Bone Collector is well done with good production values ​​and what Hollywood talks about it. I should also add now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen, I think she's absolutely terrible at it. Denzel Washington simply stays there, Queen Latifah is horrible and even Michael Rooker can not do much, since he's stuck with a cliché and one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The bone collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen in a while, I saw it for free on television last night and I still feel cheated and stolen. Is there so many things to make holes in, is it silly, embarrassingly horrible or should it be terribly embarrassing? It works anyway to be honest ...
