'Leatherheads' strives so hard. Try to be lighthearted. Try to be a comedy. Try to be a love affair. Let's see, he tries to be a 'Friday of his girl' through 'The Sting' through 'Happened One Night' through a dozen sports films. Unfortunately, trying is not doing and the movie is as drenched as the field of the last game. A fan of movies watched the big fight scene in the speakeasy between the Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and realized that the fights John Ford staged with such style, verve and humor in such films as' The Quiet Man 'or' Donovan's Reef ', or' The Searchers' may have seemed easy to do, but obviously they are not. I bet George Clooney thought channeling John Ford would be easy, too. How difficult it could be: crazed masculinity, punches, broken bottles over heads, an undisturbed pianist ... just put it there on the screen with some music going on. Excuse. It takes a master to make the fight scenes flow. <br /> <br /> Movies are not wanted. Humor is difficult. Romance is difficult. Touch a lost art. <br /> <br /> I once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet show. Something about not wanting to sting the fantastic performance bubble by listening to the din of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the elevators. This movie is like this ... all the effort and good intentions, beautiful actors, nice games, but beats with its rhythms instead of galloping like the original Galloping Ghost, Red Grange, in which the film is loosely based.
