"Fool for Love" is one of the many forgotten films that Robert Altman directed throughout the '80s. This, an adaptation to the one-piece screen by Sam Shepard that features Shepard in the lead role, is simply not very good. Altman made many not-so-good movies throughout his fascinating career, and it was often his fault. But here I think it is Shepard's fault for writing such a fragile piece. Altman's direction is guaranteed, the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work on, but this inconsequential script does not get you anywhere, and it takes time to get there. <br /> <br /> Shepard is Eddie, a stunt double who has a love / hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over a night spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton), who may be a figurative or literal father, both Eddie and May quietly watch. Randy Quaid completes the cast of four people as a gentleman. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic hook in the whole plot is the suggestion that Eddie and May's relationship is incestuous. However, this hook looks more like a trick than anything. The script does not explore their relationship in detail, and does not use their relationship to explore more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric and educated characters who become annoying in the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do, but provide reaction shots. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie is especially bad when the stories of Eddie and May begin to unfold in flashback over dull and drowsy voice. <br /> I chalked this up to another Altman experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> Note: C-
