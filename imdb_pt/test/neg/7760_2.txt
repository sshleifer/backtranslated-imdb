Yes, I could not stop yawning, nor could my partner. Unbelievably boring - 90 minutes seemed to extend for at least 3 hours - and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but that only numbs your feet - unless you're a fan of the 70's polo sweater! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you were expecting ANYTHING to happen, do not hold your breath - that does not happen! <br /> <br /> But, seriously, it does not convince or involve the observer. It's like a long, boring, disconnected dream. Frederic floats by, able to get out of work whenever he wants and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and messages constantly. Obviously not real life! And an office with virtually no paper or files - just a giant calendar so you know the movie actually takes 6 months to be watched. <br /> <br /> Frederick never seems to be touched by any real emotion, nor does his wife and children behave like cloth dolls - in contrast to any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong opinions, never gives the impression of feeling anything real. The only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between a supervised couple in a cafe, and has nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> Ok, so maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it's entertainment, or even good cinematography that you're looking for, I think this movie is incredibly overrated by most other viewers.
