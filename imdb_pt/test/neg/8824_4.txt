It seems an exciting prospect, a modern dress "Othello" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so eerily good at "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jude", and Eamonn Walker, who brought such intensity and insight to his central role in "Oz ". One might think that both are natural Shakespeareans, but both artists fail badly: Walker's Othello is a little simpler, with a whispered delivery that does not make much of an impact; and Eccleston as haunting as Iago, blinking at the camera in almost an outrageous parody of the paper. It is likely that he was influenced by his director, whose florid approach might have worked best with Elizabethan language, but which seems a pretentious and dissonant choice for this modernized script. And is the script itself less disappointing in being modern than in being obvious? it's as if Andrew Davies designed the famous plot and then wrote any dialogue that popped into his mind. All in all, a failure. 4 out of 10.
