What exactly is the point of pretending to "trick" people of things like ski passes and pizza? I can not see a point. I was not intelligent or original and I find it extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Skyler Stone does not seem to be a very practical guy or even a nice guy. He has very little charisma and almost everyone can do what he does in this show. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this crap is the fact that many phone calls are re-hosted so they not only seemingly fool the poor people on the other side of the phone but also are also fooling the audience who does not have the time enough to read the "disclaimed" flashing on the screen for about half a second at the beginning, at the end of the show! <br /> <br /> Not only that, but He also claims that this is how he lives all his life. What a lie. No one could live their lives like this and the fact that he says this is not just another scam for his show to be watched, but it's also one of the most fabricated and blatant bits of bull I've ever heard. This guy is a @ $$! <br /> <br /> What makes them think that all the work of, for example, writing and recording a song, getting someone to take a huge picture of you and two friends, getting dance lessons and actually traveling to is a ski resort really worth just getting free ski passes and a little food for free? What is the purpose of this? It's a huge amount of trouble to just go for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. <br /> <br /> As far as "comedy" is concerned, this is the bottom of things on the keg.
