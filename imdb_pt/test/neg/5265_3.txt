"Ordinary Decent Criminal" is sad because he is obviously trying to succeed and equally has no chance of apparently doing so due to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. A lousy failure in the entertaining Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who likes to fool the cops and his competition becoming a sort of folk hero in his mind, this film manages to be lightly amused when it is trying to be funny, a little more than annoying when you are trying to be interesting and forget sentimental or poignant or captivating, although you also need to take pictures of those qualities. "Ordinary Decent Criminal" has an awkward script, na√Øve direction, execution of a traveler, weak history, poor selection, mediocre acting and eventually loses itself and sinks into a mud of hopeless mediocrity. Go through this one. (D)
