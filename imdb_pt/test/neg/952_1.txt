This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after the G4 put their hands on it, taking it from a handy source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the push of a miniature web server to the later someone. <br /> <br /> As the G4 ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic men-hormones, adding eye drops to employees and a segment of sexual counseling. Now even the players who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust. I look forward to the death of the program and the network, extremely late and well deserved.
