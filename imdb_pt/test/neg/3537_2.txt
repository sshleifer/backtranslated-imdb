I really loved the Millenium series, starring Lance Henriksen, and that's why I bought the movie. Obviously, on some level, it was a mistake. Monsters / monsters movies are usually very bad and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> The basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail (well, however, this movie would never have been a success, even with a good director and actors), but the way it happens is only a class B movie. The scenes that were supposed to be scary seem funnier to me and the animal is not credible. <br /> <br /> However, watching this movie with a group of friends in a state of restlessness makes this movie shine as it is. involuntarily hilarious.
