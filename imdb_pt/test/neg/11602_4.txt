This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood film, and it seems he was still settling into a pattern of consistency, going from the faithful adaptation of the classic novel to Rebecca to the Foreign Correspondent espionage thriller, and now this romantic comedy in the cast " images from the 1930s. " Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, had already established itself in something consistent, so much so that he was unable (or at least unwilling) to deviate from it. It was not sensible, then, that he should go out of his usual genre, and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate. In Rebecca, it was really great to see Hitchcock embarrassed by his producer and source text, forced to turn his technique into heavy Gothic drama, but for Mr. and Mrs. Smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content. In other words, Hitchcock was not Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> First, let's look at the romantic angle. The best love scenes in Hitchcock movies were crazy, passionate and a little bit dangerous? "Have you ever fallen in love with someone you should not have?" situation, and he was great at describing this. This is something that makes a much older film, Rich and Strange, one of Hitchcock's few non-thrillers that really works. Hitch is not so good, however, when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story. A light touch and suit is necessary and Hitch does not have it. <br /> <br /> Second, bring the comedy. Of course, Hitchcock movies could be funny ?? Is Lady Vanishes probably the best example? but only when the jokes were scattered throughout the story. The master of suspense simply is not enough of a comedy director to create a movie that has funny bones. Does he cut scenes like he would in a thriller? angry angles of people talking, inserted close-ups of hands and feet, point of view ?? but does not allow comic timing or focus on jokes. For example, the business with Carole Lombard's costume exploding apparently is shown to us with some closes, but these are timed more as if it were revealing some crucial point of the plot, and has no comic impact. Does Hitchcock's style almost coincide with comedy? for example, the character arrangement on the club scene where Robert Montgomery tries to make it sound like he's got the attractive, sophisticated woman at the next table? but these moments are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Even the cast of Mr and Mrs Smith is not up to standard. I'm not sure if that was the strength of Robert Montgomery, and he's boring here. Of course this was exactly the strength of "Queen of Screwball" Carole Lombard, and while clearly acting well, the scenes simply are not meant to capture comedy performances. Even Jack Carson, who could be hilarious when allowed to leave before the camera, stops cheering things on. Of course none of these excellent comedy actors are helped by the script, which is not exactly full of laughter in the first place, even if the basic story is a reasonably good premise. <br /> <br /> In the comedy that Hitchcock did after that, it was Trouble with Harry, and that sort of thing worked because he played with his family suspense. However, was it only when the story could exist regardless of humor, when the basic picture was suspense? as it is in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot ?? that Hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well.
