Why, oh why, is this garbage considered a classic? I've seen a larger body count in episodes of The Simpsons. Virtually nothing happens in this movie and much of its time of execution is filled with almost unbearable melodrama straight out of a low-rent soap opera. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family is going through difficult times and when Dad is away mom and little boy is going to fix the car. But when they arrive at the ranch, they discover that the watchdog has gone mad. The rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the St. Bernard bib circulates them over and over again. <br /> <br /> In relation to the child, I have never seen a more boring child in a movie My life. And of course he's completely Aryan since blond-haired, blue-eyed kids like the one in Chocolate Kinder packs seem to be nicer than people with brown eyes and dark hair like me. All he does is cry and moan. The same goes for Mom. She takes the car, gets in the car, gets out of the car, gets in the car. <br /> <br /> I know this was done in 1983, but I just got sick of horror movies where the characters make stupid and illogical decisions. If Mom used only some common sense, she would be able to get rid of the disgusting dog. <br /> <br /> It is very poorly written and there is no tension. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, take a look at John Lafia's Man's Best Friend. It's funny, inventive, has a better dog, a higher count and a more engaging story. Let this garbage be.
