I do not know which was first launched in 1970. Cannon to Cordoba is a "West Europen" It was made in Spain. This means that this is far inferior to Sergio Leone's #Western Spaghetti and the masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann, in my order of merit. This order should not be interpreted as all John Ford's Westerns are better than all of Sam Peckipahn's. I think the 100 IMDb cast rank them very well. <br /> <br /> The worst of this company is Casting. George Peppard is fit for the role of a sergeant, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "puttana" in "Piazza Vennezia" in the sixties in Rome.
