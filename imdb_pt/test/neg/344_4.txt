This movie is proof that you can not just go to a Redbox and read movie descriptions, pick one and try it out. <br /> <br /> Although I give a great deal of credit for producing a movie with half-decent special effects with such a low budget, and at least a decent script and storyline ... unfortunately, it was just that: middle decent. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things are not all well wrapped up and do not mind low budget effects, you may like this movie. Honestly, it was not really my cup of tea. I should have gone to bed instead of spending my time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better science fiction film produced on an even smaller budget (!) Take a look at "Primer".
