This documentary was boring and pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean ... the documentarian obviously does not even know how Darwinian evolution works? It's a theory, and the name is just stupid. Reading a college biology textbook could have told the documentary filmmaker what Darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but evil is done as politics. <br /> <br /> There was also no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people ... without testimonials from experts, and with obscure clues ... <br /> <br /> The documentary was also annoying. I mean it could have been edited for 35 minutes, and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are much better documentaries than this ... this was not worth watching ... you can get better information from Wikipedia = D DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
