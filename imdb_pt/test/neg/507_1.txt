We will see. What bothered me the most? The extra long dance scene at the beginning, watching people spin so much that I got dizzy ... Without even showing where the music was coming from ... It all starts from a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Or maybe it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than necessary. What a drag this movie is. And the most annoying aspect is that the bad guys are so bad, so obviously horrible that it looks like the director was making this movie for sophomores. "These people are bad ... These people are good." Whenever a movie has its agenda - heart up its sleeve, I'm out of it. There is a scene on a skating rink that looks totally out of place. Long scenes of love with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. The character of John Hurt, who is part of the long opening scene, drinks and disagrees with exaggerated villains. Her death scene might well be the dumbest story ever. And I hear everyone, even those who hate this movie, talk about how beautiful cinematography is. I think it looks faded. Watch "Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful backyards. This movie is even worse than the anti-hype. It's useless. The epilogue, showing the main character of a yacht, was almost as idiotic as the prologue. The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid unless you love bad movies because this is their king.
