Snakes on a Train begins when Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border into the United States, and then illegally board a seventeen-hour train to Los Angeles. However, Alma's family did not approve of her and Brujo's relationship and put an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes, is not life a b * tch? When the snakes leave Alma's mouth and slide to other parts of the train, they begin to infect other passengers with the same unusual disease ... Edited and directed by the Mallachi Brothers (though IMDb claims who's just a guy using a pseudonym, Peter Mervis) Needless to say, I thought Snakes on a Train was crap, it's as simple as that really. It looks like the whole movie was planned and made to make money from Samuel L. Jackson's cult movie, Snakes on a Plane (2006), of all horror fans except Asylum's favorite producer who specializes in stealing great movies This style of money and movie production is no more evident than here with Snakes on a Train, making a movie just because the title rhymes with a more successful movie is not a good starting point. Eric Forsberg's script is silly to begin with, Snakes on a Plane was a lot of fun, while Snakes on a Train is a lot more serious and when you really split it and look at it, it should have been a lot lighter. In fact, it probably would have worked better as a spoof of the Scary Movie type (2000). You know something, I'm struggling to find something positive to say about Snakes on a Train is so bad. To begin with, the character is trash and it is impossible to get emotional with someone, the story is absolutely horrible and does not make sense (if people vomit all those little snakes from which came the huge ones?) Why did Alma become the giant snake? the end Why Bujo killed the engineer How would he stop the train when he arrived in Los Angeles? Where did that typhoon come in the end?), it takes itself too seriously, the first seventy minutes are so boring and monotonous, I I'm surprised that I stayed up and it's just a very, very poor movie on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has only a few sets of train wagon wagons that all look very similar. the film becomes very repetitive and bland to watch. There is almost no blood or blood, there are some snakes lending under the skin of some people, someone takes a shot and that's about it. The special effects are rubbish too, the giant CGI snake in the end is really awful and the less said about it, the better. It is not scary, there is no atmosphere and it is a bit annoying from start to finish. Real snakes are also a problem, they are so docile and not threatening. If you look at any scene that has a real snake and an actor, the snakes never make any move toward them or act aggressively, and in fact always seem to want to flee in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Filmed in California Technically, the film is obviously low budget and shows basically cheap because it is. The acting is not good, not that the actors receive any kind of material to work with. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Train is rubbish, I'm sorry, but that's how I feel and I do not know. how to describe it. I really can not see what anyone would get out watching Snakes on a Train, it really is that bad.
