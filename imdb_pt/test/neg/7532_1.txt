This is really a very bad movie. This may seem an oversimplification. An infantile and inconsistent replica comparable to an insubstantial insignificant insult. The truth is that there is not enough to say about the confusing and meaningless plot, the really atrocious performance (I'm barely speaking here), or the random images of violence against women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous movies. to make mistakes that drive this affront to everything that is good and decent in the world of cinema, or rather, of human culture. Please accept my word, do not watch ... ever. I'm serious. Stop. You'll thank me for it later.
