I've heard a lot about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania and a good part of the film was filmed here in my country. And I expected a lot from this movie. In the end, I was disappointed. It's not as horrible as other reviewers have said, but it's definitely bad. It's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and what Lambert comes to kill it. Lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters is boring, and the action is not very good either. Also, perhaps the only thing that could have saved this movie, the special effects, are also very bad, the monster looks awful (not scary, but horrible). Oh and another bad thing: the music. The film tries and manages to create the atmosphere of the sixth century. But all the action sequences are presented in rock music, which is very bad. I mean action in rock works perfectly in a movie like Charlie's Angels - where is the perfect way to film your action. But here, it was a bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
