I mean spirited, and down to the right demeaning adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of his ancestor, but does not have any talent what ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance, which is a clear steal of what Jim Carrey did, but he should give up acting all together. He's so annoying that you'd want to stop him if you could jump right into the movie. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I've seen a lot of bad movies this year, but this not only takes the cake, but it's arguably one of the worst movies ever made.
