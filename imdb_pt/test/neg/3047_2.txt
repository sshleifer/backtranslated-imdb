This starts interestingly, since there is an amusement park next to someone's house with an oil rig there as well and some kind of church across the street with a neon sign "Jesus Saves", all good in a small area ... Now this is very dazzling, if unlikely ... and then we go straight to the film, which leads unlikely to new levels. Of course this is a remake of the 1979 thriller starring Carol Kane as the nanny Jill Johnson .... now Jill is a girl who has spent her cell phone minutes so loud that her evil parents punish her by making her work out probably something that the target audience of this movie can identify with. Jill is taken to this huge and fancy house on a lake in the middle of nowhere (clear) by her father to look after the Mandrakis family. The kids are already nestled in their beds when Jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, huh, she can not handle it? Of course, despite the remote location of one of Jill's friends, one with whom she apparently has problems like stealing her boyfriend or something. Anyway, it is clear that the alarm in the house shoots for no reason and then someone's calls begin to arrive, calls from someone who wants to kill her. Of course Jill calls the cops, and since there was no real threat in her life, they detonate her, but tell her to call back if there's anything else they can do for her. Check out the scene with Jill calling her friends at the high school party or whatever, it seems like some kind of "Burning Man" festival, ?? There are all kinds of scares invented in this, including the cold cat Chester who, of course, appears here and there, one of the most tired cliches of the "horror film" that exists. Am I going to admit that I dozed sometime during this, and I missed something? Hard to say, or to care, really. This is one of those movies that makes me wonder how the remakes of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been bad. Anyway, from reading online reviews, it seems that the people who got scared the most were the 12 year old girls, and I can only assume that from statements like "I peed my pants". Well, we can only hope that this will put an end to the remakes of Hollywood movies that were not exactly stellar to begin with, but do not bet on that. 2 out of 10 and am being overly generous.
