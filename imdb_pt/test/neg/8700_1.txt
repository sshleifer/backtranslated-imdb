if you're a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will make you cry inside. granted, I'm only about half an hour into it now, but it's so painful, I felt it was my duty to warn the true ten commandments before they get subjected to this curse. I did not think it was possible to actually make the special effects worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was filmed but this remake of 2006 proves me wrong. I can forgive a few lame special effects, but the catastrophic dialogue, the melodramatic style of life, and the exciting action of "we're life-form wax" makes me expect them to rewrite the plot and drown the bass. Red Sea.
