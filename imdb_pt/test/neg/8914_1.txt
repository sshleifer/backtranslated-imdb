TDY is probably the only piece of junk that has ever hit the video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and it annoys me because Van Damme is a personal favorite for movie comedy B. Segal did a good job in the past but he fell very low on my books and he probably will never pull another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brainstorming session with himself. <br /> <br /> It bothers me how he did not do many of his own action scenes, as he did in previous films. In conclusion to all of this, if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper, then rent today you die.
