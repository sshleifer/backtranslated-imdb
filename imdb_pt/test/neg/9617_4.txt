I'm not going to waste your time describing the plot for this, the other reviewer has done it very well. I will, however, give you my opinion on this movie. This movie is basically Japanese anti-propaganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly devilish who have no respect for anything as well as very poor martial arts skills (groups of Japanese men arrive there with kicks from single women on more than one occasion). fighters lose almost all (if not all) fights in the movie that take the suspense. The plot is actually very solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though. The problem lies in the fact that there is not much fighting. When there are fights, some of the fighting is very good, but other scenes are badly choreographed. A scene angela mao takes six Japanese in a church and kicks all her asses. The problem is they show it fighting one by one when everyone should be attacking at the same time. I understand that this movie was incredibly cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are. They use the same village for when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing anything. Some scenes are filmed in real locations and look good. In general, the only real problem with the film is the slow and uninteresting plot. As there are few fighting scenes, we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and, well, I did not have fun. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars out of four
