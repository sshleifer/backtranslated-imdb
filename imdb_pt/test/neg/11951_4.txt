Well, I must admit, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I was looking forward to it. I'm usually a fan of light-hearted romantic comedies and the trailer, that's the impression I got from this movie. However, I spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. Although there were some fun scenes, the overall perspective of the film was pretty depressing. <br /> <br /> I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters because they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time the director could have used exploring the characters taken by an unnecessary use of Opera, making the movie look creepy and slow. <br /> <br /> All in all, although there are some moving scenes, the trailer is quite misleading and I just suggest you go watch this if there really is nothing else that pleases you. <br /> <br /> It's not fantastic, and like I said before; Brando.
