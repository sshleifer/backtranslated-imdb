Oh my lord, what they were thinking with this. Not only is it frantically bland, but worse, a very good original was destroyed in the bargain. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, really transformed the performance of her life into that. Even better than where she plays the prostitute in another performance call of her life. Maybe she's just as good as a thug. Any other time, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal come together beautifully, so if you remotely glimpse anything funny at this baby, take the anvil you were beaten from. <br /> <br /> Because much, very little of this remains, to this horror. Nothing in this baby is remotely funny, except for maybe a couple of times when Dick and Jane are gawking like lepers and can not kiss ..... and uhh ........ oh my lord, is that it? Well, it seems so. <br /> <br /> It's really such a bad movie.
