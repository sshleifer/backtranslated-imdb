I usually LIKE Sion Sono's work, but that movie was completely retarded. But, unfortunately, not retarded enough to make you retarded entertainment. I just sat there, gaping, wondering when it would end. The plot makes only a whisper of meaning. I think it was planned to be overdone. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But humor, as it was, fell flat on its face. It's not funny. Not scary. It's not bloody. I would say maybe Sono has been hired on this project, but he seems to have written that annoying junk too. I still need to fill in a few more lines, what else is there to say? I suppose I could end by saying: Better luck next time, Sono-san.
