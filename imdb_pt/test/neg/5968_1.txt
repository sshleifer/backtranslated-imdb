If this movie was just scandalously poor it would be nice, the problem is that many take it seriously. To summarize, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There is no story, no focus, no clue and all the issues raised can not find an answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and annoying (I've been in war-ravaged African countries several times and found all the persistence in the local misery and desperation very painful to watch but still making no sense). <br /> <br /> - The issues raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are not questions but affirmations. <br /> <br /> - I am not a doc filmmaker, but what is the point of raising, for example, the issue of gun smuggling, if the only element brought to the public is the statement of a local reporter? The director does not bother showing us at least one sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to locate loaded trucks leaving the area shortly after landing a plane. <br /> <br /> - The story of the fish takes less than 5 minutes and is only supported by a sequence in which the director shoots a documentary displayed during a local conference. This guy did some work ???? <br /> <br /> Abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences, but where is the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a handheld camera and shoot the same pictures, unfortunately. Where are the great news? <br /> <br /> - Filming prostitutes watching and crying over images of their murdered friend and his fellow prostitute are worth the worst emotional manipulations you can see these days in thrash and real TV. <br /> <br /> The parallel between the hunger plaguing the country, with more than two million hungry people and the export of fish, is absolutely useless, dishonest and makes no sense, but it manipulates viewers in typically anti- -globalization and anti-Western. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting debate in France after an academic has published a very detailed commentary on the film, which has brought the number of journalists working in Africa for decades to investigate a bit more about various details. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - The waste of fish shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is by no means intended to be eaten by humans, but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money to animal feed. I do not think I'm the only one who got the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite. <br /> <br /> - Gun smuggling is a reality (but again, where are the big news?), but not the way this movie explains the issue. If the empty airplanes that land in Mwanza participate in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment at a different location in Africa, then go to Mwanza to catch fish so as not to make the trip back empty (meaning they actually land empty at People eat fish locally, contrary to what the movie suggests (about 40-60% of what is taken from the lake) and thousands of people make a living from it. These are private businesses of this kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty, not the Western lamentations and the endless foreign aid. I do not know how shocked I am at the success of the film!
