This movie is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I'm not referring to acting, but to the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. Moreover, it disturbs me when respected and revered actors such as Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play these roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intention to raise the subject of the film, a social outcast. <br /> <br /> I was in high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his appeals and death penalty books were on the news. I remember the wave of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and that Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Conquer people. Read the story. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove through the streets of Los Angeles at night with a police light stolen in his vehicle. He stopped cars with attractive women inside under the stratagem of making a traffic stop; then kidnapped and raped the women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can suffer and many victims say they prefer death to their horror and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it took only an extra decade. No sympathy for the devil here.
