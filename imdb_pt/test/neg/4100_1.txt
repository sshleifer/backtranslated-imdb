This is a pitiful movie. What makes it even more pitiful is the time, effort and money put into a super predictable script and action. <br /> <br /> It's about some kind of monsters, by the way, and some kind of insects. Do not expect an explanation of the plot. There is none. This could work, if there was something of interest, or characters we could care about. There is not. Everything that happens to anyone is as predictable as the other movies the Sci Fi channel makes. <br /> <br /> Do not try to understand what some of the characters are saying. They speak nonsense, especially the annoying chief woman whose accent is a kind of thick British that is harder to understand than any old British movie you may have seen. She is unintelligible. <br /> <br /> A lot of money is spent on amazing scenery and scenery, and that's the biggest crime of this movie, because it's not worth it.
