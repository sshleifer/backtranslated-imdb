This movie received a great article on the upcoming attraction of Blockbusters' I was looking forward to the release date, 07/08/02. The plot seems reasonable, the cast should only have secured a side-splitter, but whoa there; In addition to the 'off-wall betting events', this was very annoying. <br /> <br /> This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid that has not helped in the reputation of John Cleese's comedy. . Rowan Atkinson, now he was very funny, in a way from Rowan Atkinson!
