The executive producer of the film is none other than that messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the director's father. I wonder what David's guru, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. Hypocrisy here is as disgusting as the movie itself. It's a safe bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, serial killer and devotee of the Phoenix-based recreational violence, would have loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many people blame this film for their cinematographic art; this level is very good. But on a moral level, it's the most disheartening movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I think it's the falsity of the thing that saddens me the most. Generation of Moral Minds Xers learn a craft and a little postmodern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then engage in the arts and entertainment industry; and here is the result: a film that sinks into human suffering, injustice and carnage, much of which is witnessed by a nine-year-old child who sees his whole family being brutally murdered by a couple of murderers of recreational violence who, in the end , ride at sunset. <br /> <br /> NO MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> For whom are films produced like this? Of course, the sadists will love this - why not? But who else? As I've noted above, there are some good movies here, but good craftsmanship can be applied to any subject. Why apply it to things like that? In addition, the film is very full of suspense, but it is not because of the coarse and coarse nature of violence; is full of suspense because it is well directed and well-played. I'm sure the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock could explain this much better than I did. <br /> <br /> So, what was put before us here? And above all, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty and even evil place, but should not we disagree when an "artist" makes a point of rubbing our faces in it? Or, even worse, put it on the faces of those nine-year-olds who, one way or another, end up seeing this on their home DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people make sure this movie is not seen by their kids. Yes, I know - dream, bernon ...
