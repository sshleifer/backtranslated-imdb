I did some research on Ed Gien and found some interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien was quiet and lonely, not a bit of an asshole because of the movie. I'm going to say that I have not finished this movie, but I will. I shudder at the fact that all of us wisconsinists speak as if we belonged to Kentucy. You know the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie, is that Wisconsin is not as hot as they made it sound. <br /> <br /> This film is not just an insult to the people of Wisconsin, being a Wisconsite, but it is a complete insult to a man who has proven himself to be an insane and lonely man. He killed two people and the movie could not even get it right. Ed did not come so close and personal and scare people, he shot the two and only people, he killed. So why do these films lie and say "BASED ON A TRUE HISTORY"? This is not based on anything other than the lies that the director invented in his dirty head. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing else! <br /> <br /> OK, I'd like to add this. I finished this movie so sad, and I personally would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework while making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and oh NO THERE IS NO DESERT! Hell, there were more pines and snow in Ravenous and that was to be filmed in California. <br /> <br /> OK, for those who do not know anything about Ed Gein, I'd like to give you your history lesson. Ed Gein is believed to have killed his family, but this has never been proven. He killed a bartender, she was shot in the bar nearby when no one was around. He took the dead bartender back to his house. Ten years later he shot and killed the shop clerk, he stole the cash register and the truck from the store. He was caught because of this murder, he came the day before when his son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was there buying the antifreeze, and the receipt that only had antif ..... was the only evidence they had to start a world hunting for men. He stole graves, in fact, in 56 stolen graves. He hates the people he dug up and sneaked; lamps, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family he had dined with once and for some time and they threw all the meat he had already given them when he was caught considering that he was caught in his house. He was arrested and hid behind a police car, afraid of what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book that the judge who tried it wrote. <br /> <br /> After this movie is over, after watching the whole horrible thing, not only am I offended by the directors hourly view on what the Wisconsin women look like. I mean, it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab in half the time, you know, because Wisconsin women are all LOURAS. Please! I am very offended by the lack of homework this guy did and by the work he did in making this movie. I have no idea who this guy Kane is and I think he might be okay on something else, but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all this I'm so sad that I lost 3.99 in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film after it was finished was completely false, this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and that George Washington was not our first president. Come on folks, that's your story, and this is Wisconsin history. To end this speech, as you all would feel if I made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you may think you're fine, but that would not be true) and he lived and was not the president and either . You can not rewrite history.
