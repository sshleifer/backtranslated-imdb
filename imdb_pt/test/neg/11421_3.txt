There was not much thought put on the story line on many fronts. This is a good action movie, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> - The film claims that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. However, they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. So they can not turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can not do. How does this protect vampires during the day? Who are they protecting the vampires from? Uncontrollable lycans? Slaves in human form are only peasants. <br /> <br /> My understanding is that vampires are immortal and do not grow old. Still Sonya ages from child to adult. Do they just stop growing old at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was transformed (as explained in the second movie). But do vampire babies grow old? Weird. <br /> <br /> I did not know vampires needed torches to see at night. We still see them carrying torches throughout the film. <br /> <br /> - Silver was the only thing that supposedly was able to hurt lycan. However, the wooden steaks fired from the huge beasts kill the lycan as well. <br /> <br /> These are just some of the things that show only a lack of thought in history.
