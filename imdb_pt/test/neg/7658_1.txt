In fact, there was nothing funny about this monstrosity! This movie was a complete abomination. The absurdities of this movie almost made me want to vomit !! I think the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their audience. They took out a relatively decent series of movies (I said decent, not good !!) and totally destroyed trying to put money in their pockets. The Making of Airplane! it was a Hollywood way to make up for this shitty movie. The worst part of this is that or no one in 1979 noticed the asinine events of the movie (such as the Concorde's door appearing at some impious high altitude or the Patroni flipping through the window at Mach 2 to avoid a NUCLEAR RAIN! they were thinking ???) were totally unrealistic or just did not care! I think it's the last of the two. The writers and director of this "movie", if you want to call it that, actually tried to suck the airport dynasty with that crap!
