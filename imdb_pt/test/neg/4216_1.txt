Alexandra Ripley wrote a horrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold their rights and for a lot of money they allowed Alexandra Ripley to write a piece of trash book even worse than the novels by Barbara Cortland. I was a big fan of Margaret Mitchell's book and Alexandra Ripley's fake sequel was written just to make money. <br /> <br /> Although I've always admired the acting talent of Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton, this is a really terrible movie. The script is horrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margarets appeared as Belle Watling is so horrible that I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth it in the movie is Sean Bean, who gives a performance of masterful bravery as the sexy and fierce villain - Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance is along the lines of "The Man You Love To Hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol. <br /> <br /> But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie, so you have to be plagued with watching an unbelievably long 6 hour movie with an unbearably boring script. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie, unless you are an unconditional fan of Sean Bean and simply watch your wonderful performance.
