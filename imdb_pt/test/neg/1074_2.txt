I got 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It's a very well filmed film (although the DV format begins to show itself in external scenes), and I'm sure it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, all sides of high school. But the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or follow the promise of the premise. There are several characters, but none of them is more than what the plot requires them to be. There's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "I'm a troublesome teenager X, I have a problem in Y." The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenal and problematic. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the men. You have the gay junkie boy, the gay athlete, the kid who rapes your sister and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype demands, all gay men should be sexually dissatisfied and violent toward women and themselves. Of course (or not, as the stereotype assumes), the two male gay characters beat up the women, the Peepants, and themselves. I would be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned upside down, or if the characters somehow transcended them. However, it has not even happened, and that's all there is to the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Then the ladies. One young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapee of the brother who rapes her sister, and the girl who kills herself (I'll talk about it later). Again, I do not think there is a requirement of political correctness for the filmmakers (I would be unemployed if that were the case), but I think this is only justified if there is more to this character or story. If this archetype were being used to reveal something about another character besides "I'm a teenager and life sucks," I'd be happy as a mollusk. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted, altered or sublimated. <br /> <br /> Finally, the girl who kills herself. This is blunt and forceful. Should we sit for 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself for 30 seconds throughout the movie? We followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we are invited to torture ourselves by a character who is not part of the story? It's cheap, scary and sloppy. Despite the millions of independent films that came before that, you have to win something like that. You can not just buy it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get the characters that go similarly nowhere else, but the movie ends. What I've learned? I already knew high school was a bitch - it was there, I did it. I already knew that people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities are ridiculed. <br /> <br /> What else is there then? Smoke, mirrors and some beautiful views of the leaves. Oh, and the worst deus ex machina I've seen in a while.
