Of all the movies I could have chosen, that had to be it. When I was last in New York, I went into a Times Square store and, out of hundreds of DVDs, I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) and this in a double DVD that also included Seeds of Sin (1968). ), did I regret it? Read on to find out. The film opens on an island (near Millenig's Staten Island home), where two lovers are walking with a huge seemingly made paper umbrella, at one point he gives her the tops of an herb as a gift. Out of nowhere Colin (Hal Borske), a retarded hunchback appears and kills them both for no reason. After the opening credits, which are accompanied by some of the worst music-induced headaches I've ever heard, at least I got used to it, as it is used constantly throughout the film, we are introduced to three couples. The wives are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams), plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). Each receives a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan), who requests a meeting so he can read the testament of his late father. Dobbs informs that they must spend three days in their childhood home "Crenshaw House" and fill it with "sexual harmony and marital love" that they never knew because of the tense relationship between father and mother. It informs couples that will is highly irregular, but cool. After three days, the inheritance will be settled. Couples are also briefed on the servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the retarded Colin, who welcomes couples by killing and biting pieces of a rabbit in front of them. Later that night, what is left of the dead rabbit is found on one of the couples' beds with a note that says, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit." This starts a series of events that end in horrific murders and reveal obscure family secrets. <br /> <br /> Co-written, photographed and directed by the talented Andy Milligan. This is an absolutely horrible movie in every way possible. Let's just pass on some of your flaws. The music is horrible and causes a headache. Sound, you can barely hear what the characters are saying and certain scenes have no sound effects, but at certain points you can hear Milligan shouting orders to his actors, oh and there is a constant whistle on the soundtrack as well. The performance, probably among the worst I've seen. The not very special effects, Colin nicks someone in the opening sequence, is the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied up and their stomach open with a saw looks really horrible, as well as the various hands and legs that are cut. Photography, Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or shoot a scene, it regularly cuts the top, bottom or sides of people's heads and faces, and their camera shakes and shakes as if operated by someone who is constantly stumbling . There is also at least one scene so poorly thought out and filmed that a member of staff is seen. The movie is often so dark that you can not see what is happening as well. Editing, again one of the worst I've ever seen, he seems to cut scenes before he finishes, cutting while the characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if there was one, credited to Milligan and Hal Sherwood (it took two people to write this!?) Is everywhere and is incredibly stupid. There is an unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim to the basement, the killer walks right behind him, at one point the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to avoid being seen? They lean to his right, the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex, but he does not notice, right in front of him. You have to see this sequence to believe, I still can not believe what I saw. Bizarre sub-plots simply happen and disappear completely, check out the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and co-writer Hal Sherwood), who turns out to be a gay priest who had an incestuous relationship with his brother before to get married! A strange scene that is there for no reason at all. Martha, the reaction of housekeepers to the first murder, she is more annoyed at the fact that the dinner schedule is over! There are a lot of insane dialogues as well, Patty and Martha argue Colin, Patty says "if I did not beat you so much" Martha responds sympathetically "you have to Patty, you have to!" Deliver totally direct. And do not start with me as the wallpaper gets ugly in the whole house! The only good thing I can think of to say is that the costumes seem reasonable, for the period of time that should be set. I could probably continue all day about how amateur it is, but I think you get it. One to avoid, unless you are a serious masochist! I did not regret buying or watching for a second!
