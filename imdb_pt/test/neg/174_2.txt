I've heard people compare this movie to Sideways. As this comparison was made, I will never guess why this movie was not in any way comparable to Sideways. <br /> <br /> These two films were as different as Star Wars and the Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common was that they both had wine as their subject. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were kind of interesting, they were ruined by the worst camera job ever. I've never seen worse camera work in my life and I'm comparing with homemade videos accidentally made by 5 year olds. <br /> <br /> I give this two stars, ONLY for the interesting interviews with the French wine types. and by showing how American wine companies are aggressive and corrupt (are not all companies aggressive and corrupt?) I would give it -10 stars (Yes, this is NEGATIVE 10) to the deplorable, terrible, horrible, horrible, VERTIGO - INDUCED, 5 yr old, could make better camera mess.
