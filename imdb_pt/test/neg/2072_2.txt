Another pretentious film by Vicente Aranda. If "Juana la loca" shone of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the excellent performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and full of themes (hot brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness because of passion, gangs of Sierra Nevada, "toreros", ...) Obviously Peace Vega is a beautiful woman, but on his talent there are more doubts, and Sbaraglia The role is so stupid that results almost unbelievable. The screenplay is weak and the smug character of Aranda influences the whole film. With these ingredients, the result could not be good. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
