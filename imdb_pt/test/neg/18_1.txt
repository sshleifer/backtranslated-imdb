Bloody Birthday opens for a photo of Meadowvale General Hospital. There are three babies born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now 'Meadowvale, California, June 1, 1980'. Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope), are starting to work on an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is bewildered and has only the jump rope handle of a child Annie was holding, like a clue. Unfortunately, before Sheriff Brody could settle the case, her youngest daughter, Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends, Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman), killed him. As soon as they finish Sheriff Brody, another boy in his class named Timmy Russell (K.C. Martel) appears, the three murderers do not know how much he saw. Soon after the incident, Timmy plays Steven and Curtis on a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy in an antique closet. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she does not believe him at first. The three children continue their wave of murders. Your strict teacher, Miss. Davis (Susan Strasberg), a loving couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister, Beverly (Julie Brown), are among their victims. Joyce begins to have suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven, which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three 10-year-old innocents are really soulless killers? <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this movie. I think it's absolutely horrible and does not have a single nice look in its 83 minutes in duration. The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the motives of child killers other than the solar eclipse that blocks Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason, these three children are not aware, so these are the only children born during a total eclipse? If this is true, why do they wait until just before the tenth anniversary before the killing begins? I think it suddenly comes into action, right? For the credit is fairly well paced, but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit. The film as a whole is very uninteresting and predictable, the children are revealed as the killers in the first 10 minutes and, as I mentioned below, no reason is given. It's very silly sometimes, too. Check out the scene in that Debbie to Steven, throwing a bowl of water on it! The death of the sheriff is attributed to him falling a few steps, sure, the injuries suffered with this type of accident will not be the same as if you were beaten to death with a baseball bat as if he were in fact any competent doctor or pathologist would have seen it within 5 seconds. There is not a single drop of blood spilled throughout the film and all the murders are boring and unimaginative. There's some out-of-place-looking nudity while Debbie charges 25c to let the boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly undresses. There's an early scene right after the 5-minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom microphone is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit of it all. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. All production is bland and instantly forgettable. The acting is bad everywhere, these three boys are very annoying and irritated me from the beginning and made the film even more complicated, especially Curtis in his oversized glasses. I just hate this movie, simple as that. I can not think of anything good to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.
