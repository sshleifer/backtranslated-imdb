I went to see this with the strength of Albert Finney alone. He is one of my favorite actors and he rarely fails to deliver. I'm not sure if the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a boy who is about to be born, but as his mother goes into labor, he refuses to leave! This puts God and the whole factory of human beings in crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try to persuade the boy to change his mind and decide to want to be born. So Finney takes the fetus to an adventure in the Big Apple, hoping to show him all the reasons why he should want to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the ridicule of the plot, I could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn it into his typical Hollywood sentimental moralistic message film. In terms of direction, the film was unbearable with a horrible soundtrack of sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem unable to resist. <br /> <br /> He even massacred the somewhat unconventional story by giving his hand every moment. Any twists and turns that were in the store were completely donated by the way the story unfolded. It was as if the director thought the audience was just a bunch of idiots who could not see the obvious tips from a mile away. <br /> <br /> Even Finney in his performance, though satisfying, looked a bit clumsy and out of place; and the little boy with curly hair, in spite of being cute, was actually kind of dull. Bridget Fonda seemed intent on trying to duplicate Demi Moore's performance in 'Ghost', shedding tears at any moment. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film has so far failed to obtain distribution in the US, which is surprising. me as I think it has the potential of box office to be a modest success, appealing to children and sentimental adults. As for quality, it is not a horrible movie, not very good. (4 out of 10)
