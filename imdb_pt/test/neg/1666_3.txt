This is probably my least favorite episode. I lived in Cape Girardeau for some time. I can say that there are no boats out to sea or shrimp, fresh crab or scallops anywhere near the Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland cable, it is on the Mississippi River. It looked like the plates were from Mississippi, which may explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in and out of town, and none of them is Route 6 or Route 666. This whole imprecision was very disturbing. Besides, Cassie did not look like someone who would want to be around Dean if she was well educated. I did not buy them as a couple and I did not enjoy the long love scene. Jo was more Dean's style.
