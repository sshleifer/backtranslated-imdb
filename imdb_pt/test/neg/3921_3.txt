Obviously influenced by the success of Pal's "Destination Moon" and Lippert's "Rocketship X-M", this is not the only one. Limited special effects, a fine line of story results in a production that even the half decent cast can not save. Just no credibility here. No one seems surprised to find Martians as well as Terrans, etc. etc. Go over it!
