To this day, I have never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Misunderstood, poorly planned and racially neanderthal, happened in Chicago, where all blacks apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER IN FRONT. . . . . SPOILER: His blues solo was even more painful to watch than his clueless acting and the introduction - "No one leaves without singing the blues" - was as dumb as a post. The kids that her character was babysitting were unbearable and well before the end of the movie I was hoping something horrible would happen to them all. <br /> <br /> I have to say though, there is something special about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me, but that gleaming piece of gut did what Chopper, the Phantom Menace, and the Catwoman did not do - it made my stomach hurt.
