This is an illusion of Cellular. <br /> <br /> Bad casting ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list continues ... <br /> <br /> well, there was no direction since the story, scenes and scenarios were taken directly from another film. <br /> <br /> Even the fight sequence is copied. One with the mace was Kill Bill and the other with fire hose was from a movie by Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can not remember the name of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing ... <br /> <br /> Can not expect something original from any of the more Bhatts !!!
