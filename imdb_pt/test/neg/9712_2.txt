As mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this movie besides seeing former "Wayne's World" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The plot is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. If there were good Irish scenes, that would give him another reason to see him. But instead, it focuses on a small, ordinary village that is obviously surrounded by Emerald-Isle's "green pastures," which are often shown in Irish films. If there were any cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality", it would be worth seeing, however, this could almost have been filmed in England. Too bad for Myers but this fails to please or satisfy the heart of anyone who has ever wanted to visit the land of Guiness.
