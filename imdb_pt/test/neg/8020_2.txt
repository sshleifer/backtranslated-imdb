This is a weak launch of almost everything: refugees, Croatia-Slovenia relations, globalization, sexual orientation. A very big and clumsy metaphor about Slovenia being at the crossroads between her past, which is symbolized by everything that becomes "virgin." queen of the house, and her future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having children. <br /> <br /> He plays in a fairly recent Slovenian legend involving a virgin and a "forest". king "in the form of a goat (the image of Zlatorog Beer is also based on this legend), but unfortunately the treatment is very incoherent.Weiss seems to think that the end justifies the means: it can use all kinds of" similar "sequences to dreams, "and then choose which ones are true and which ones are imaginary.How can the ride in the jeep with the" king of the forest "be real for the three girls, but the scene outside the tent is only real in Simona's imagination ? The ending just continues (I can not believe that the running time of the movie is only 98 minutes, I've been watching a director unknowingly?), With the three girls having to look at the camera for about 10 seconds with fear and happy at the same time (so obvious). <br /> <br /> I never thought I could spot the bad acting in a movie whose language I do not understand, but it did not take long to see this "Simona" is exaggerating most of the time, as if you were playing in a film and dumb. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad as I kept thinking the director was starting and wanted to capture what she thought his generation was involved in making a half-experimental movie, until I realized that the director was actually 37 years old when making the film and that her work is probably "serious."
