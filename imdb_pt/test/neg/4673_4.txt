Half of the film is blinking lights and unstable camera. The rest is made up of predictable characters (think science versus government, know-how versus authority, etc.). <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? Are the cars being played in the first 5 minutes, is the horrible Russian cosmonaut accent, are the uninspired characters, the fruity Top 40, or the US vitriol going to save the world? No. It's the fact that regardless of the "sad" ending - there is very little suspense in this movie - we basically know what will happen. <br /> <br /> The good part of this movie: "American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!"
