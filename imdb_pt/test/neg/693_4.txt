Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | thanks god | to be held at three different locations, and although it was an interesting idea, it did not really work. There are only two games that have actually been eliminated, the rest being decent, or most of them, quite awful. There are some fun celebrities on hand such as Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time most of the time. The British championship Bulldos Vs The Dream Team is worth the price of the entry itself but you can honestly see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> Games. <br /> <br /> Colosseum of Nassau. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. By the time it had passed, and despite the poor finish, this was something surprisingly bearable, with the audience really interested. Crowd sings "Bullsh * t" at the end. Having said that, it did nothing for either of the two's careers. The match ends in a double count with them fighting off the ring <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The Animal" Steele. Not so good wrestling wise, but a lot of fun due to the wiles involved, and a great Steele comedy, as well as wild can fight with a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes to leverage. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Serpent" Roberts vs. George Wells. For a disposable match, that was better than it should, but it's too short to make any impact. Roberts wins with DDT, removing the snakes later, which upset Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing Match. Mr.T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva and Bob Orton. A huge failure in my opinion. I was bored senseless in all of this, and although it may have been a marketing success, it certainly did not succeed in entertaining me. Many of Rowdy's songs are also noted. T wins by DQ, when Piper beats T. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Correspondence of the female title. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. It ends very fast, even before you get a chance to start, setting a fast pin drop record for Woman's games. Moolah wins when he takes advantage of Velvet's lost fall from the top rope. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff / Classy W Freddie Blassie. Great pop for the cable. Stupid game, with annoying offense from both involved, although it is too short to import. The corporal wins when he knocks Volkoff with Blassie's cane. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Real Battle. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. That's a lot of fun, despite all the NFL talent involved. It is also noteworthy by Bret Hart's first appearance of Wrestlemania. Andre wins when he expels The Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Time of Dreams / W Johnny Valiant | C |. Combat absolutely tremendous, this is one of the best wrestlemania games of all time. You will not have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers at hand and the excellent psychology of the ring. This is pure wrestling at its best, you can not call yourself a fan of wrestling if you do not like this game. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collides with Valentine * Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules Hernandez. Very decent game here, with the two men doing solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute with above-average skills, and contrasts well with Steamboat's high-flying style. Steamboat wins with a cross body flying high from the top rope. <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible correspondence, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I do not. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana & JYD. A pretty solid game here, with many memorable shots taken from Terry Funk | that across the table was something else for that time. I would have to rate this as my second favorite. The funks win with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the hottest games in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can not fight to be worth it, and Bundy is not that good. The violence was brutal at the time, but Hogan's superhero act is kind of boring, and there are many boring times. Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a flaw in most respects. Wrestling fans should see this once, but you do not either. There is not enough here to satisfy a true fan of wrestling. Vince ruined it all. Do not be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. Not recommended, and rated as one of the worst Wrestlemania, out of the brilliant fighting game. <br /> <br /> 4/10
