Ok people, I have to agree with almost every other review here. The characters. It is. Stupid. They are ALL stereotyped, and still have beautiful clothes and are always skinny. <br /> <br /> Do not tell me about the role of Jamie Lynn as ZOEY. Zoey is a beautiful, popular and tanned blonde teenager that everyone loves! She has a "rebel" personality, great, with which everyone agrees, no matter how stupid or extreme. Most annoying of all: his voice is so bubbling and unpleasant. "OMG!" <br /> <br /> Let's take the first episode, for example. By the time she steps on the huge PCA campus, everyone seems to love her. The boys want to invite her out, the girls want to be her friends, etc. Thinking she's all this, the episode ends with Zoey always being the center of attention; she is the best player on the unofficial, confident female basketball team, and feels sorry for everyone when she is weakly hit in the face. Oh boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> My favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl who appears much later in the show, Lauren or something, who is the ONLY person ever presented at the show to hate Zoey <br /> < And Zoey does not even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. In one of the episodes she even calls the friend of freak without ever apologizing and shows no regret in doing so. <br /> <br /> Zoey is ALWAYS the best: <br /> <br /> -Design T-shirts and professional backpacks (which become a big hit) <br /> <br /> - with very schematic elaborated BY HIMSELF to teach a single person to a lesson. <br /> <br /> - Thanks without law <br /> - Taking the blame for things that did not even relate to it so that everyone could be happy. <br /> <br /> - Coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on TV. The list goes on and on ... Ugh. She has no acting talent. She is always the perfect person. She acts moody and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! I can not stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone on the show always has good clothes. EVEN NERD! Your wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> No one cares if everyone in the PCA loves you, Zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving up right arm. <br /> <br /> BUT, regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. The humor is usually humorous and fun, but the characters are so simple that it's hard to like. <br /> <br /> This show would be great if Dan Schnieder thought a little more about the type. of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that they are stupid and stupid. <br /> <br /> There is no one overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, Zoey is the definition of Mary-sue, the story lines are well thought out and the humor is laughable. But again, I want to emphasize that the characters contaminate the show. Watch the program if you need to, but do not say that I did not warn you if your eyes started to bleed.
