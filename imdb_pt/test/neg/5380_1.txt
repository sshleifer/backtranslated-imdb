Because???? What a disgusting joke of an alleged movie ... the poster looked like a cute movie ... what a disappointment ... who the hell is the protagonist? He looks like an old retired retired cop ... I'm a cop and I can tell .. the man can not act ... back to being a cop ... without a presence on the screen ... why did they show it? ass like that, like he was Mel Gibson, hell no ... put the filmmaker out of business .. this guy has no business making a movie ... I seriously doubt that women or gays find him attractive ... who wants to be the cast, the movie is a talentless hack that does not launch talent hacks in the lead .. it's great that we whites always have Asian women but why a white and ugly guy, why not Dean Cain or Brad Pitt? Asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what I see ??? I do not understand .. it must be low self-esteem .. <br /> <br /> The only hot girl who can act in the movie was Kate Holliday..why was there a hot white girl among all the others? Ugly Asian girls who think they are hot and who can act ??? <br /> <br /> Just two actors in this movie, the poetry presenter at the end of the movie and the sexy white girl in the massage home .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the protagonists in the movie .. < > <br /> The Asia Character was ridiculous it seemed like she was trying very hard to be a kind of ghetto / sexy black girl ... the key word here is "try" .. <br /> <br /> Gina .. you do not can act and you're not hot enough physically for that kind of role .. you need to play roles of characters and be more humble in your self presentation .. <br /> <br /> I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi. .. I looked for her on IMDb and she is a great Asian actress ???? if that's the case, I do not want to see the Asian American actresses. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood does not have Asian American actors! if this is the best they got !!! they were supposed to be getting some kind of Asian movie award? give me some time ... it seems they just made a movie with the goal of putting a lot of Asian girls in them ... they are not even hot ... Ginny ... you're not hot ... stop to try to ... play character roles and improve your acting ... you're not a feminine type of leadership ... <br /> <br /> If this movie makes money, pigs can fly ... sorry for being so but I feel like these actors need to get better or work on their craft: for the exception of the two actors that I mentioned they should have played the protagonists .. I say this in love for all the Asian girls in the movie, for Please, do what your parents say and go and be a doctor / lawyer / and engineers ... and act sideways for fun..expectly that's what you're doing now .. I'm not trying to be mean but hoping this be read and push people to either get better or go make another deal .. there was not even a message ethically in this film .. <br /> <br /> I would not be surprised if "Soap Girls" was secretly funded by members of the Ku Klux Kl a special department of Klan Asian-American hate propaganda <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Asians should hate each other..because this movie makes me as grateful spectator that I am not Asian..you people are pathetic. Have a little respect for you Asians.
