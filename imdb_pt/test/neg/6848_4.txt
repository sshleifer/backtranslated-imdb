Three young film officials have the task of reopening a long, closed theater of the old days, in which many years before a shocking series of terrible murders took place. It seems that many more murders have occurred since then, but all this remains unknown to these three young beginners who hope to finally become great alone. As they approach the great night of reopening, things get increasingly strange and disturbing, with items suddenly starting to move on by themselves, with no apparent help and a terrifying old man apparently haunting the premises. <br /> <br /> This is really awful. In fact, if it were not for the character of Mary Woronov's secretary a young and aggressively independent and powerful woman who steals virtually every scene in which she appears and the incredibly sexy Selina, unbelievably contemptuous but totally sexy, that would be total loss . The only other good thing I have to say about this movie is that some of the murders in the movies are made in a truly inventive, though not overly bloody, way (a preference for me but not necessarily for others), fashion. The rest just wallows in constant misalignment (so extreme, the rare few can actually find humor) and walks the predictable destroyer kills annoying characters in one after another routine.
