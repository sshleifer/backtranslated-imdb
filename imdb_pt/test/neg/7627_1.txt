Forgive me, but this work by director Peter Hall is horrendous. If you can not get to us with the plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog? This certainly reaches the audience. This spectator is tired of seeing animals sacrificed by the plot of a movie. And believe me, I saw it happen before she opened the package. How predictable you can get. Take a cute animal and kill it in a horrible way. I've never been a fan of De Mornay and this performance tells me why. Exaggerated and a bit stagnant in the interpretation, I find it a little silly and definitely boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad for having to play against De Mornay. He did much better in other films, namely "Philadelphia" where he had some honesty in his dialogue. In this chestnut tree he did his best to keep his real character. But the writers, Green & Rush, have done a good job avoiding this with their trivial plot and insipid dialogue. Please, let us not be subjected to this type of entertainment. Some of us are not fooled by cheesy parcels, by injured animals and by generally long dialogues. Seeing her get away, made me furious.
