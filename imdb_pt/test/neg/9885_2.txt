The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me -melt-. Rafe and all its beauty made the movie worth it, even though I feel like getting up and screaming. I've never seen a better man. <br /> <br /> -ahem- But that's not the point. <br /> <br /> The title? That's really what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it away. I will, in all my anal retentive glory, point out what was missing, what has changed, and all the more wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> Seems firm and here goes: Apparently, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and apparently ULF is no longer son of ASTRID, as in the book. And, as I remember the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is apparently BLOND, unlike the notably RED HAIR described in the book. I think the book said it looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the movie also shows that ASTRID is VIVIANA's aunt. <br /> <br /> -WHERE DID AXEL GO? <br /> <br /> VIVIAN is 19 years old. In the book, she was 16 years old. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet at HIGH SCHOOL, where they both take part in the book. VIVIAN will see AIDEN because of his poem 'Wolf Change'. But according to the film, AIDEN beat up his father, escaped and now lives in Romania, and draws Graphic Novels. That made me go 'What the F ** K'. <br /> <br /> "There's no Kelly in the movie. WHERE WAS KELLY IN THE MOVIE. KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And she also dated Aiden after they finished. Vivian still gets drunk in the book and destroys her room. <br /> <br /> GABRIEL has a striking resemblance to the Lord of Columbian Drugs in the film. And he kinda looks like one too. His performance was very good, but his appearance threw me out. <br /> <br /> VIVIAN had no parents in the movie. His father and mother and two other brothers died in the film. Still in the book, when she arrives home one night, her mother, ESME is sitting on the couch, after struggling with ASTRID on GABRIEL. And VIVIAN has no brothers. Only his father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what it is. That really got me. He kills RAFE in the scary church, confronts VIVIAN, and she saves him from the other wolves except that AIDEN shoots her, so they go out to find medicine, and then they try to leave town together. WTF?! In the book, Aiden goes mad when she turns into a wolf, and cries like a girl, throws things at her, and then she panics, and jumps out the window. Then he invents a story that he tried to break with her, and she threw a chair out the window. That does not seem to fit for me. <br /> <br /> -Aiden wants her to run away with him. In the book, he does not want anything with VIVAN after she turns to him. Neither does he lovingly hold her face and says she can control him. He cries like a woman because he is afraid of her. <br /> <br /> And the final indignation ... that almost gave me my three best friends and I ATTACK THE BODIES IN OUR SEATS: -In the film, AIDEN and VIVIAN FLEE together, and VIVAN killed GABRIEL. How she shoots him. GABRIEL dies. In the * BOOK * not only VIVIAN does not kill GABRIEL, I believe they HAPPEN TOGETHER. As she does not end with Aiden, she ends up with GABRIEL. WHAT IS HELL? Little things have also been noticed: Ulf's red hair that he takes from Astrid has been changed to brown in the film, and Vivian works in a chocolate shop. <br /> <br /> A horrible shock; I'm ashamed. The book really was not difficult to follow. If Disney can use a random school, why could not the principal find a random school? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I was really looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that it has not followed at all. I give 2, just because (as the top of this review says), Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was extremely sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a wonderful job. And they kept the poem of Steppenwolf <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
