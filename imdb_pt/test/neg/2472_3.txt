Well, it's standard Hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile away. It's nice in parts, but just as predictable. I must confess that I did not like it very much, but I am very difficult to please and many of my friends loved it. <br /> <br /> It's very cute, and the actors make good presentations. It's a cool background and the eye drop is really good. But the story is annoyingly predictable, not original and really boring retains the film. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The girls' film genre gets some bad reviews, but there are some genuinely good girl movies out there; this is not one of them.
