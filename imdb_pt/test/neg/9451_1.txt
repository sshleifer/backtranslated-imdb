This is seriously the worst movie I've ever seen, from the beginning, the film goes straight down, with its tacky soundtrack, little acting and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B movie, this is awful. After reading some of the good reviews I thought I would keep an open mind and watch it. But all the bad reviews went so well. I can not understand how anyone could have liked it. I'm a big fan of science fiction and that was a lot more than I could swallow. Definitely do a different movie favor. They are many other best movies that deal with this subject. YOU WERE NOTICED.
