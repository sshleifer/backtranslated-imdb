A teenage couple had sex on the beach in the 1960s. That's all. They are said to be fifteen, while one of the actors is actually twenty-five. Perhaps this film was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of playing on "taboo" topics, but I can not imagine that at that time anything shown in Esmiko Limon would be considered a taboo. <br /> <br /> Shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even shallower. The selection of songs involves nothing more than the well-known "classics" that are still heard on every radio station today. The plot of American Pie is not much different, but it's at least a little funny. Eskimo Limon is monotonous, flat and not aesthetic. Almost unbelievable it had six sequences!
