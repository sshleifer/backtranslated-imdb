I do not understand why people are praising this movie. I did not like it at all. I watch with several people. None of them cared about that either. First of all. Clearly another low-budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. The actual footage looks like a live TV interview. The makeup is bad. When you watch the movie along with the extras on the DVD. You will find that there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it. I read several books and watched several shows in this story. What I always got from all the material about it is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could really make a good movie about this. It has always fascinated me. The bad acting really ruined the story. The situation of the little boys really increased even more. When you watch this movie The boy and his problem is the thing that you and your friends will remember and laugh at. It made no sense because his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch was so threatening, but it was okay to throw her little brother to her. It's a huge story with him and his little problem. I still can not get over the little girl by saying "Mom said that tobacco will rot your teeth". Frank Fox's statement and facial expression are so bad. The scene in the yard with him getting food is very stupid. The sound of parts of it seems to be from the psychopathic movie. In addition, the girl who hovers over the bed and her little "bladder control problem" are from the Exorcist. This movie does not have the talent for creativity. We put the film on for a few minutes and knew it was a bummer. I also noticed that they were defects in the quality of the film. Parts of it looked like what a person can shoot on a home video camera. I noticed that many people on the credits had many multiple jobs. That's probably how this movie was put together. Someone said I like this story. I'm going to get all my friends and make a movie with a video camera and a computer. It does not matter if we do not know how to act. As long as we shoot and say it's good. We got our family together and we prepared food. Then he sat down and watched this unsuccessful attempt to make a movie.
