Admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous movie legend, my expectations were very low. They were not low enough. Scholckmaster Roger Corman somehow took over the rights to produce the Marvel comic characters in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and handed it over to Oley Sassone, whose directing work has been on TV series such as 'Hercules' and 'Viper'. With a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, filmed and briefly released on video and then sent to the desert of forgotten films. There he should have stayed. However, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this "Fantastic Four" sits in the ether hoping to cause a fall for those rare, unhappy and foolish people enough to step on it. <br /> <br /> If you've heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. The people who did this were very loyal to the original material, and that's the only thing they deserve credit for in this fiasco. This presents the origins of the heroic group that develops superhuman powers when the armor in their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. Reed Richards (Alex Hyde-White) develops the ability to stretch the body and becomes' Mr. Fantastic'. His girlfriend, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab) may become invisible, and his brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood) may spontaneously make the fire erupt from his body. Finally, Ben Grimm (credited to Michael Bailey-Smith and Carl Ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin turns into a hyde rock and is then referred to as The Thing. There is a prologue that establishes a former classmate of Reed's Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) to become his nemesis, Dr. Doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of the Spaceflight of the Fantastic Four as an act of revenge for injuries he fault in Reed. . There is the configuration, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and, finally, a climactic struggle. There are more details for poorly written writing, but they are insignificant. <br /> <br /> This is a film that was made simply because the creators (I use it in the technical sense of the word. There is not a lot of creative imagination working here.) I had the legal rights to do so. The plot will undoubtedly be mirrored in the launch of the large budget planned to be directed by Tim Story in 2005, but addressing a massive project of special effects like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of insanity cinematographic. What special effects there are most of the time are handmade or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'The Great Robbery Train'. When half of the climax fight reverses the full animation, you're almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were doomed to be on this project. There is very little consistency of style in this mess too. Most scenes are taken in light or primary colors, and the only clad sets are the obvious science fiction pieces. There is camera work, but it's basically just keeping the characters centered on the screen and the minimum of information flowing to the audience. The issue includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). Editing rounds are even used to supplement the poor special effects when The Thing transforms. The only scene in which metamorphosis technology was put to use was shocking just because it was such a positive leap in quality. <br /> <br /> Limited camera work is not unforgivable. In 'Clerks', only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. It worked for the movie because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. Kevin Smith never let his reach exceed his reach. 'The Blair Witch Project' has caused some audiences to suffer from seasickness caused by things that contained this pseudo-documentary. When all was said and done, it was an effective job on the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. There is no sense of history or theme here on a spoken or visual level. With this Fantastic Four, you never get more than an accidental chuckle from the fact that filmmakers and artists seem to be really trying to rival other comic books with that badly-budgeted entry. <br /> <br /> Any movie involves a lot of time and work. It is so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. If you are one of the people involved with this, this was probably done as a stepping stone in the path of a film career (hopefully improved). Everyone knows how to get jobs to make the most of what looks like an opportunity. For those of you who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is to just do it with a group of friends (so everyone can point and say "you watched too") who were warned about the experience hurt), and maybe you can create a drink game to ease the pain between the accidental chuckles. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
