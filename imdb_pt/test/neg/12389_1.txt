I find it disconcerting that at a time when fulfillment and fulfillment of spirituality are unknown and we are all scattered throughout the spectrum of possible beliefs, a charlatan and a fraud of the caliber of Gurdjieff (as a charlatan, he is exceptional; there is no denying It is a pity that he has abused him, however, by the aggrandizement of his wounded ego, feeding himself on the adulation of unsuspecting sheep that were at his disposal, and fear of him) may inspire such extreme adherence and credulity. This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's fictional and fantastic account of his training and "awakening" (which I prefer to describe as his discovery of how much he can influence the minds and desires of certain sorts of sadly disoriented people). You see, if you dare to have an unpleasant enlightenment about how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful to have your blood pressure medicine handy if you are one of those who still expect a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography in all the service of the premises and pretensions of a dysfunctional cult.
