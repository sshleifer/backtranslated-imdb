Altman's Quintet has to be considered more than just imperfect: as so many other reviewers pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices in representing those ideas, should work - and yet very little in this difficult film. The partially blurry camera lens - I remarked to my wife that this must be the most disturbing conception of direction I have ever seen - has never allowed me to "enter the world of the movie." <br /> <br /> In general, there are serious problems with the mise-en-scene employed here. Of course, one did not think much about factors such as costumes and production design, but none of them is very effective in evoking a credible world. Maybe it's a matter of scale; the film is so bound that I laughed out loud when it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the budget constraints of the film. Matte paintings here and there may have helped.) In the most disappointing Altman movie I have ever seen. Great ideas and great metaphors do not always appear in art - they are just part of the game.
