From the brilliant mind that brought us "The Exorcist" ... and "Cruise". "Rampage" is more like the latter. It's a confusing general movie that has a great vibe made for TV. The whole movie pretends to depend on the question: "What if the 'Boy Next Door' was a serial killer?" but instead turns out to be a drama of uninspired tribute and meditation on the insanity claim and the death penalty that makes little sense. The film is very loosely based on the Richard Trenton Chase case, selecting a few facts here and there to create a fake character and a different outcome. One of the main points of the film seems to be that ending the life of a terminally minded child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow analogous. "Sometimes you just have to choose," says the main character. Yes, sometimes you have to choose to pull the plug ... on your TV!
