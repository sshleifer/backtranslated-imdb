Tediously long and somber cinematographic waffle. I could not believe how bad this movie was. I watched it just because of the countless people who gushed about this on this site. I was watching the same movie? The entire episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps's past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no one was affected by his past. I think it was Socrates who said about the pieces that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect then it should not be there. Obviously, the director did not know this rule and thus filled his 'work' with one terrible scene after another. Even the plane that collided with the house was unexpected, it was not a surprise, but it was unexpected! <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that as I write this (December 1, 2002), People say it is one of their favorite movies, no one bothered to add a memorable quote. The reason is that there simply is not any. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this, watch a warped board.
