There is only one word to define the entire movie, that is: horrible. How "mostly Martha" has been redone is horrible. The title of the movie is horrible. The actors are terrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cooking and USA is horrible. If you have seen "Bella Martha", well, this is the original title and means "Beautiful Martha", this is a punch in the stomach. Ms. Jones' performance is so poor and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better. Not to mention the cook, it would be better to play a different role. And the girl ... is not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a really cool, authentic movie ... why was it redone? There was a story ... here they took it. There is no story ... What does it represent? In a way this movie was perfect, too. Do you know when all the ingredients fit? Well, this is the case here. Such crap perfect ....
