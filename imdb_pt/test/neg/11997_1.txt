This movie got really tense when a poor boy is attacked by a bunch of wild dogs. After a tense chase, he is saved by Grandpa with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We are then introduced to a series of annoying colleagues, including a pie that is always half dressed. During this stage, the film increases tension with strange "plinky plinky" background noises that left me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while, but when I looked back at the screen, there kind of strange creature, things out there grunting and killing. One word of advice, if you're already stuck in your house by some nutter - get some cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Although we skip half the film because it was totally uninteresting or memorable, we are now in the dizzying conclusion, the last surviving creature fighting a "Whip Duel" with Grandpa and his magic whip. I'm not going to tell you what happens here, but I can tell you that the battle of the whip is full of tension, with air strikes, two-level fights and all sorts of drama. <br /> <br /> I'm now going to push this movie through the door of a neighbor that I do not like.
