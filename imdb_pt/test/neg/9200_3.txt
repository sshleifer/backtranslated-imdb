I really liked the movie. It was really extravagant at times. (They destroy the villain with hair dryers - but where are they connected?) It's a unique movie, and I enjoyed the acting of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also liked Phanuel (however you write ...) liking Megan's charter because she called him a fool. In addition to acting, the "rewind" and show what happened in Ariel's and then Megan's viewpoint was quite interesting. I saw it twice and I would see it again
