I saw this videotape movie with my younger brother a long time ago, even though I was a boy who has a hearing impairment. I did not have the closed captioning decoder at the time (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I was able to follow the plot and understand what's going on. It was not my fault I saw the animated film aimed at girls. My father rented the video to show for my other younger sister. <br /> <br /> A decade later, I rented the video (for 50 cents) to watch again with closed captions on. My memories of this movie were totally destroyed by none other than a SCRIPT WRETCHED. I've seen a lot of badly written movies (such as COOL AS ICE and JASON GOES TO HELL: FINAL FRIDAY), but I've never seen (or heard) such bad dialogues, just flooding with enough inanity to make your head spin so much laughing at hysteria and screaming from the pain of enduring the torture of sitting through this movie. Despite the good story and intriguing storyline storyline, the screenplay has to be one of the worst I've ever written for SCREEN, BAR NONE! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never be working as a screenwriter, professional or not. I can not believe they even allowed the terrible script to produce such a movie in the first place. Did the Japanese producers read the script, in English broken or translated before they knew what they were doing? Same crap as G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The movie has redeeming values ​​in comparison to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of the 80's animation, or just a nostalgic trip, BEWARE OF RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR THIEF! It does not matter if you've been exalted or traumatized by the badly made animation movie with an atrocious script written, or you have not seen the movie, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. The film should be viewed with the caution of learning how NOT to write a bad script!
