why, oh, why did I waste my time watching this movie? was given to me on video by a friend and I thought to watch it, it can not be that bad. In the first place the acting is simply shocking and we must believe that this is real? Secondly, this movie is blatantly trying to copy Blair's witch project (yawn) and does very badly. So, if you want the scare of your life, I would suggest that a Simpson Halloween special would be much more scary. but if you just wanted to laugh, then maybe the general shit out of that movie would be enough. but overall I would avoid this movie at all costs or drink a lot of alcohol before seeing it. The best part? It's only an hour and a half, thank God.
