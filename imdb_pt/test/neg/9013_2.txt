For those viewers who thought the 1979 film "Alien," the first to portray an earthly male being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, "Night of the Blood Beast," made 21 years earlier, may come as a surprise. In this film, America's first man on space lands on Earth and, after being examined, is believed to be dead.

The alien mother also appears to terrorize the small band of scientists who are watching our gravid hero, and she (?) Seems to have the body of a bear and the head of Yarnek, the rocky creature of a 1969 star. Trek "episode. Anyway, with its short time of 62 minutes, a small group of scientists and a cheap-looking monster, this movie suggests no less than a Grade Z warming to "The Outer Limits" (which would debut four years later) but despite the good writing that this show used to boast.

Why do aliens traveling through space can not land on our planet, instead of having to hitchhike on our ships? How was our hero impregnated to begin with? These are all subjects that this small inexpensive can not be bothered with. It's really only for the science fiction finalists of the 50's.
