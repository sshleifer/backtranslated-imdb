PLEASE?! If this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, I think I've lost all its point. Because I left feeling that Reggio was based on space exploration images of the Cold War era, and had NOTHING to add to the dialogue about the fear of technology. Tracks of 1 and 0, denoting technology and math and science - DONE that. Does anyone out there see the Matrix? And studies of people moving in motion? Ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses exact excerpts from Muybridge's photographs of human movement studies. <br /> <br /> This film has been derived, and the result is enough for Philip Glass to sound like EVERYTHING he's done in the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie at all costs !!
