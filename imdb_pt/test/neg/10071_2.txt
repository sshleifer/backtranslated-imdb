Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? Not a moment of it is worth it. Many elements can easily scare people from the movies ... and it's not the dinosaurs! Tea Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she's come to the end result. I wonder if she went on stretching a vocal chord while filming the movie .... Laura Dern ... she's fine, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe switch smart dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard of something called facial expression? Fellings, emotions ..." .. he has to work on it! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack ... you have to change that record, or you get tired of it. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor I've never seen playing a bad role ... unfortunately he can not save the movie, nor the well-crafted computer dinosaurs.
