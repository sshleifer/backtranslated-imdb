It's a shame that a film with such good cinematography as this has no plot to be backed by the work of Sarah Cawley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (Film Editing) and, above all, no sense of what is happening in Mexico . City. The film tries to be a very realistic representation of city life, but is unable to do so. It's a shame, a lot of wasted movie. An American woman tries to find her brother who has been kidnapped. The first story in the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to present a better narrative of the ordeal, especially when it comes to the attitude of the staff of the US embassy in Mexico City. , when dealing with a problem like this. Compare, for example, with Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar problem. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, with Todo Poder (1999). The film is worth watching if you want to have a sense of the city's appearance, paying little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists and turns that require a fairly extensive suspension of disbelief. Who's going to believe that a Mexican patrol from Mexico City will go all the way to capture the main characters from the US-Mexico border? And that this policeman will be able to use his border radio to Mexico City! Only the producers of this film. It is noteworthy that, unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, at least in these Mexicans, Spanish is spoken.
