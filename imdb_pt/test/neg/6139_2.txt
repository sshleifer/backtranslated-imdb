************* SPOILERS BELOW ************* "'Night, Mother' is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to his impetuous mother (Anne Bancroft) that she will commit suicide. This is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. The bright hook turns out to be a scam, the following story is devoid of substance, gravity, and revealing value. Where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last talk of their lives? Where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? They're here, but they've all been painted with the same opaque color that keeps the emotion in the background and celebrates the "genius" of playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything else. The result is not a film, but an exhaustive test of resistance. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I think Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses in movie history, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom . She brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and I've seen her rescue more than one movie from the bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I watched this movie in the first place, and for one of his films to be terrible, he has to fail in a significant way. This movie fails in two. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is so faithfully adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The entire movie is a dialogue between two women between Jesse and his mother. What worked on stage - a middle-aged mother and daughter discuss for two hours in small homes in movies. A game, no matter how big, needs to be * tailored * to the screen? it is self-indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not a single word of it can be altered. The screenplay for this movie could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages, and an experienced screenwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and the competent Bancroft a few physical sequences, some facial reactions, something to do away with the yak fest from wall to wall. and a single set of prison. No wonder the script has been adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who may know the theater, but reveals himself here to have no notion of the film. <br /> <br /> I can not overemphasize the effect of the theatrical play script. have in the movie. Watching Jesse and his mother discussing Jesse's impending suicide is redundant and annoying. The women walk from the living room to the kitchen, enter the living room, and return to the living room, where they start all over again. A tiny Midwestern house is not the ideal place for a single studio movie, and the director never tries anything clever or original, never tries to break the monotony with an outside shot or fray, or a flashback or * anything *. There is no music, no other character, no other story ... just two women covering the couch cushions and discussing their opinions. Is the reverence given to the play unhealthy? even Shakespeare's most solemn classics shake with the screen. Does the commitment to the original game seem almost spiteful? it is as if the film were made just to document the dramatic treasure that was the play, with the audience thinking a little. <br /> <br /> The other reason the film fails is Anne Bancroft. She may be a good theater actress, but in the movies - where the presence is 80% of performance - she rarely seems to fit. She certainly does not fit here, playing a midwestern grandmother, but more like Mrs. Robinson before her breakfast. She chases Jesse around the house, looking more aggravated than surprised, and seems extraordinarily unfriendly even when her lines convey a loving-but imperfect-woman. Sissy Spacek is great as she always is, honest and honest. open and so good that you really understand and agree to the choice of your character. Sissy lets us see that Jesse is a bored, once wrong tire of a woman who has had all the breaks and made many wrong choices. She never had control of her life, and her suicide will be her way of finally saying "No more - this is where I come out." Is that how she puts it anyway, and when does Spacek talk? you listen. She proves in all her films that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, it does not have to be a bluff, a bravado and a borrowed testosterone. In this and in films like "Coal Miner's Daughter", she quietly demonstrates a gentle force and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic ?? You can not fail to fall in love. <br /> <br /> That's why it was so hard for me to watch. '' Night, Mother. ' Spacek is wasted in a blistering maneuver of a movie that never serves to engage or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except stubborn Sissy fans like me and even then you will be disappointed. I give the film an entire bonus for the lyrics to the end, which is brave enough to let the main character do what is right for * her * and not give in to a banal happy ending. DEGREE: C
