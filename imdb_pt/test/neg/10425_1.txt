"Wired" would have to be considered one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. The writing and directing show an impressive lack of imagination and I'm sure most of the actors still shrink whenever someone mentions this movie. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent, or as an accurate account of his short life. <br /> <br /> A meaningless mess, with no redeeming features.
