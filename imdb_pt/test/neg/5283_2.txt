Ugh, bad, bad, bad, but I've seen worse, and that's why I gave 2 instead of 1. I just watched this movie and found it was almost as rotten as the flesh on Dr. Chopper's face. The worst line of the film had to be "I like to introduce you to somebody ... know my inner b * tch" which consisted of the only survivor of the fantastic group 5 throwing a garbage can at Dr. Chopper and then dropping the stage. Second worst line, "I'm the park ranger who's going to drive you crazy" What, this freak is not even a cop ????? Someone else noticed how everyone instantly dies from the magic stab (no one dies so fast because of an intestinal stab, I know that, because I often see them in the operating room) except the super ranger. Cara had like a pail of poor blood out of this wound, writhing on the ground some, and then comes to the end to give a farewell to Dr. Chopper while b * tch inside is curled up on the floor. And if it does not hit everything, he does not even have the decency to die, like everyone else. B * tch inside helps him to limp out and continues to tell him not to die while she runs to help because he is like his only friend left alive now. Since when did these two become friends? I do not think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to go to the city qualifies as knowing his time, but whatever. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie if there is nothing else of your own and you have nothing more to do with your time.
