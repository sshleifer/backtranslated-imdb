this is only the second time I've been moved enough to write a review. unfortunately, both times have been for films that can be described with several 4 letter words that can be defined as feces or excrement. the other film of such caliber was masked and anonymous. <br /> <br /> anywa, for review .. there are several main things wrong with this movie that I will describe below. <br /> <br /> 1) Steven lost the plot (ie, in all his other films, the family / friend is killed. <br /> <br /> 2) Steven ran out of money (there was a good car chase scene in the beginning, but I think he screwed up his budget with that and could not afford a decent screenwriter or editor). <br /> <br /> 3) Steven does not seem to do his own thing anymore. instead, (from memory) 2 fight scenes were tossed around the neck down and down the back so you could not really see his face. most likely a stuntman. I'm guessing chuck norris. <br /> <br /> In summary .. Seagal worst movie ever. second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen many bad movies.
