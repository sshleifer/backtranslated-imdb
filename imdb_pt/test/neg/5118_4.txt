Bare Wench is another parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen of those things out there). There are 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain), and an idiotic guy whose sole purpose is to provide comic relief. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I'm thinking "Great Great-looking women having lesbian sex softcore each other for 10 minutes or so." That should be pretty good. "Unfortunately, the producers spoiled everything. There is nothing in this video that truly qualifies as a sex scene. There are a couple of false starts, but most of the action is just the women posing for the camera. I think that once the producers spent their money on the women, and they spent more on having them remove their clothes, they had no more money to make them actually do anything. And I think they also used up all their nudity time allotted too soon, because at the end of the video, there's a huge amount of nonsense dialogues that are obviously just being used to fill the runtime. "You're a liar!" "No, you are!" "You go into the cave, do not go, I think we should go home!" This continues indefinitely. <br /> <br /> There are much better things than that.
