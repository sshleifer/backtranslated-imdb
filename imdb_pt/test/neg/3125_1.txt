This movie is so unreal. French films like these are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? Even, I did not know ... why. What? The well-known half-brother sex scene? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit, the story on which it is based is so unreal. What's the use of that, then? Can you easily find in life, half brother doing these things? <br /> <br /> Did I learn anything from this movie? Yes: some people are so fond of wasting time making movies, such stories, such nonsense. But for those who like nihilism, nothing in life, or simply a life without hope, then you're there ... you have to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Only one is worth worshiping: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is an incredibly beautiful woman.
