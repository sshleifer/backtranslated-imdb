I finally rented this video after looking for it for many months. Initially, I just wanted to see it because I'm a fan of Neil Pearson (Patrick, Isobel's boyfriend, the leader). However, the film stands out very well without Neil (although he takes good care of himself in this film, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). It's a sinister and intense movie, the kind the English do so well - definitely a "girl movie" in the house and its isolated setting giving the movie an aura almost "Wuthering Heights." The film is full of tension and the ending, shocking, but somehow inevitable. I'm glad that I watched, it was worth the wait.
