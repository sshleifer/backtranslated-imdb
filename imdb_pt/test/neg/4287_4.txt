In this film, Gary Oldman plays a defense lawyer, who was previously a prosecutor. He is a bit tormented, but he is more or less a common face than a figurative or literal monster. The funny thing is he can not. I guess you can not get to normal from there. Kevin Bacon was creepy enough. The scene in the park was very long with many fake scares. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to have come from a different movie, although the rest of the time that Ms. Young did well. This film suffers from strangeness trying to cover up predictability. And failing. Do not bother yourself.
