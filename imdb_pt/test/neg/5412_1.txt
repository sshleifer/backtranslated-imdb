Thank God for the DVR and the fast forward speed. Even with that, I could not bear that farce any longer. When they came across the old Indian asking for beans, I gave up and extinguished. Is this the best the SciFi Channel can suggest on Saturday nights? How about some old classics? The idea of ​​a coed special forces unit was bad enough. It seems they wanted to save money by having everything filmed in the woods. What else can I say? It was so horrible that I do not think I can create enough lines to qualify me for the space to analyze it. But it looks like another line will do that. Save your time, let alone your money with this dog from a movie.
