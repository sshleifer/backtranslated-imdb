Such a BS film. It's just stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a completely unfounded plot, not in any way related to the book. <br /> <br /> It seems that the production team has received more money from the people who commissioned the film than they can ever sell the film. The film's plot includes references to some of the recent real events in Russian and other parts of Eastern Europe, but puts them in such a way that it has nothing to do with reality. It seems that the film is a brainwashing tool, which helps portray Russia as a place populated by bad people who always dream of killing someone. Of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes, like using the map of the USSR instead of Russia, when posting news, showing a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting that they are Russian elections, etc. <br /> <br /> There are also many bizarre episodes (for example, a character runs through the Red Square in Moscow and in a second he is in the center of Sophia, Bulgaria).
