(Dir-Henri Verneuil): sober drama about a wealthy doctor who gets in trouble to maintain a relationship with a younger woman, with whom his family takes to live them, in addition to be married to another in the same house. Their quest for happiness is not clear, but they explain very well the reason for their unhappiness in displaying the authoritarian trait of women in their wife's lineage. Well played, but predictable drama.
