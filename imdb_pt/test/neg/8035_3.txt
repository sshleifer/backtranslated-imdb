On the way home after a day at the beach, four young men seek shelter in torrential rain at Lord and Lady Alexander's house after their car runs out of gas. They do not know that, but the house they're staying in is supposed to be the site of a satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only woman in the group, must be sacrificed. While his companions rush to help her, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things really get out of control and everyone else in the black mass is also dead. The four try to escape, but soon discover that there is no escape from what they have witnessed. One by one, they find their destinies. Gong at the Tragic Ceremony, I was sure I would enjoy it. The gothic horror of slow burning is right in my alley. I also really like some of Riccardo Freda's other films, like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost and I Vampire. Tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. Unfortunately, things do not always work out the way they should. The biggest tragedy about the Tragic Ceremony is the time I spent watching this movie mess. With a few minor exceptions, nothing about the movie appealed to me or it worked for me. The characters are unpleasant, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the rhythm is terrible. There is a subplot about some cursed pearls that do not give at all and only serves to confuse things even more. Also, nothing interesting happens in most of the movie. By the time the four leaders realize that they are in danger, I have come a long way from caring. And I do not understand the comments I read that praise Camille Keaton's performance. I suppose it's a great performance if you consider that a non-thrill stunning is acting. The three male leaders are the very definition of indescribable. They do not do anything to stand out. The supporting cast includes some favorites of the genre, such as Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but none are given to make. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film, which tries to explain what happened in the last 80 minutes. It's a weak attempt to provide an end to a very weak movie.
