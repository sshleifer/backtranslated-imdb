That's what I felt like screaming, as well as leaving the theater, but I held back. Yes, the acting was great, no, it was not the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue just would not end (or be interesting)! And despite all the gossip, you never know or care about any of the characters. Definitely the most annoying movie I've seen since Sphere, but I expected this movie to be boring. I had to go through this, but please spare yourself
