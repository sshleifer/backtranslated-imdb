Yes, Pigeon and Coburn are great, and it's interesting to watch them, though Coburn seems pretty restrained and boring here. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City from the 1970s, and the vintage cars and clothes. This is all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, as is most of the acting. Ray and Sandy's motivations seem forced and unlikely. I've seen this routine "train to be a pickpocket" several times before. There is a long buildup, leading to nothing. Better watch an episode of "Streets of San Francisco", or one of the many great crime / capo movies. To quote a few, there is Bedtime Story, remade as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Mob Lavender, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting, and best of all, House of Games.
