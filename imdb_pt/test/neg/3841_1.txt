I'd like to start by saying that I would not see this movie again if they were distributing popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can not give it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars. The acting is absolutely terrible. This film is a farce, based on the classic "The Most Dangerous Game". If you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least J-Lo offers a better scenario, Ben should pacify the girls who watch him. I'm not bothered by the $ 7 I paid to see the change, I only wish the 90 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> "Can you give me my time back!?!" Samuel L. Jackson, changing clues
