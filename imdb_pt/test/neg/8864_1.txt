This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for some decent laughs. Well, it turns out that this movie really was terrible. The whole plot does not follow in the plot of Pulp Fiction. It happens to another movie like Forrest Gump and more. A few laughs came out of this movie, but it all took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are planning on renting this movie, please do not miss 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting it out and find a movie that really makes sense. Please, if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I definitely will not rent the sequel. Just giving a head to those out there.
