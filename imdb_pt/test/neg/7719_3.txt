I can not understand how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creating scenes creatively, he relies on old, boring zombie cliches. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed leaders have to get down the college steps into the van, he fights them with zombies, but none of the leaders is bitten. He can not be bothered to run a decent fight scene, so we watch the cables go down the steps. <br /> <br /> Sometimes zombies stink and in others they run like the wind. This is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without worrying about the continuity of zombie behavior. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and much more inspiration, this film could have been much better. .
