Leon Shamroy's CinemaScope color cinematography is quite remarkable here, including the use of colored filters for various scenes. The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive result Hollywood has ever produced. Too bad it is no longer available on CD. The actors, however, never get to the occasion. The accents are so varied, from the British subjugated Ustinov and Purdom to Hollywood to Baxter and Mature, which looks like a real mishmash with no central vision. Tommy Rettig is shockingly American. The acting styles range from the zombie style to the blistering. Only Ustinov as a servant of a conniving eye steals the show - what there is to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the one God, Ra - pursued by the authorities, has its interesting points. But when the plot of the film fades, it is the amazing music and visual elements that remain.
