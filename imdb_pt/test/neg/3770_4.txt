The director does not know what to do with a camera ... many options and she always always chooses the wrong one ... she lets the travolta take over ... and he controls the movie from beginning to end. The characters are not developed ... maybe because we need to see them singing ... no rhythm, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... wrong: travolta OK ... johansson, she's too grown up to be an 18 ... even if she really is 20 ... <br /> <br /> the happy ending? Well, it looks like there must be one, so the story is sad, but not so sad ... The travolta does not know how to play guitar, but the director does not seem to care much that he is totally out of sync .. . <br /> <br /> The idea is the only good thing ... but how did she develop it? well, it's simply full of stereotypes and lines heard so many times ... <br /> <br /> Too bad, another missed chance ...
