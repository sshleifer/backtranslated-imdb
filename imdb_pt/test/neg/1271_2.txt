Opulent settings and sumptuous costumes well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl, and a good (not great) performance of Jannings as Henry can not beat the poor writing and static camera. Henny Porten chews the scene like Anne. <br /> <br /> It's all very beautiful; but it is all superficial and without depth. The melodramatic tale of an unjust woman has made it a hit in America, where the expressionist "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" failed the same year (1920), proving that what is popular is not what endures. Lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies, not sterile spectacles like this.
