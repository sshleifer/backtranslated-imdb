Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of the film simply does not work. It's like a hamburger-jelly salad - an interesting idea, but who ever thought it would work in the movies? I like director LaBute's previous two films - they were ruthlessly honest and fun. This movie can only be ruthless and creepy - with large amounts of cutes. (As a high concept, think: Doris Day-Rock Hudson's movie that Sam Peckinpah could have done - now lower your expectations to match the current mass-produced Hollywood state.) What actors as talented as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince and Janney almost make their scenes come true is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that is simply not coherent. I would find Freeman's humorous speech about the end of the film (in a Lynchean way) funny if it were not for the uncomfortable suspicion that such unconvincing morals should be seriously accepted. .
