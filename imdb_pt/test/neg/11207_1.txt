What crack are you smoking? This movie, while gloriously entertaining, is horrible! <br /> <br /> The action scenes are so obviously fake that it's kind of sad. The Colonel's daughter is painfully annoying. The ninja training camp is so hilarious that it's hardly worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beat up the other guy in the army, I almost peed. I could continue ... <br /> <br /> Fun, no doubt. Good not. Well done, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a commentary on America as an empire, it is actually quite good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not so surprising, especially in the context of American cinema of the mid-1980s.
