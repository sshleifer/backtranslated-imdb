I wish I could use the travel machine back in time to go back to the time when I considered seeing this movie and making other plans. I saw a free display of A Thunder Sound, so I can not complain about the price, but I wish I could get my 103 minutes refunded. The acting was mediocre and the special effects were deplorable. People should not make dinosaur movies if they can not make prehistoric creatures look as good or better than Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only salvation of the film. I noticed that women under the age of 18 rated the film as the highest, and the only explanation was that they looked at Burns all the time. All the time 103 minutes. This movie should have finished in about 80 minutes. He just crawled and continued. Do not waste your time or your money on this unlikely movie.
