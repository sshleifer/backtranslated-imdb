Who gave those people money to make a movie? There was nothing funny about it. The fact that the dog that used to be the funniest thing about this type of disease says it all. First of all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, just took the name and relied on all those people who liked the original Chevy Chase. They took Randy 'I have no talent, I'm just a fat, sweaty pig' Quaid (the only thing wrong about part 1) and I did a 'movie' about him ... There are only idiots in his family but not the 'They're not cute' kind of idiot, but the 'do not touch me' kind of idiot. Watching this pile of dirt helps you expect everyone who participates in it to DIE! They did not even bother to get the effects right ... when they're on the boat, the only thing that moves is the false bottom ... when the pigface Quaid is in the water, you can tell by the lighting that is in the water. A studio. This movie was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and should never have been done ... never ... throwing money at a volcano would have much more use. <br /> <br /> Well, I hope I got to some of you ... Nobody warned me and now I'm scarred for life Merry Christmas F * cking
