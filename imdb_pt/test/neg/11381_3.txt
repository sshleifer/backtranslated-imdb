"Ghost Son" is the best film by Lamberto Bava and, at the same time, also the worst. I suppose this statement requires some slight enlightenment. It is his best because it is well directed, ambitious, approachable and very stylish, but the worst because it is a bland and unoriginal film and undeniably a big disappointment for all true fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, myself included, would not be interested in this movie judging by the plot, the famous names attached to it and even the boring sound title. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who brought us large quantities of complicated Gialli and fun splatter movies in the past. "Ghost Son" is a bit of his return movie, alongside "The Torturer," and although the latter is definitely not a good movie, it at least lives up to the expectations of its fans, with excessive amounts of blood, blood and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and intolerably soft horror film, even speaking in terms of ghost stories. The emphasis is very much on sentimentality, and this badly affects the already limited number of creepy and chilling moments. The basic premise may present one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is generally boring and clich√©. John Hannah and Laura Harring star as a happy couple living on a remote ranch in South Africa and raising horses for a living. Joy and happiness could not improve, so naturally something tragic is about to happen, and it happens. Mark dies in a car accident, but the inconsolable Stacey stays at the ranch where she is in constant contact with Mark's spirit. She even gets pregnant from her son, but soon after the birth of baby Martin, mysterious events begin to occur. It seems Mark's restless selfish ghost "owned" the baby and uses it to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and subplots are underdeveloped and / or remain unexplained, like the whole background of the young maid Thandi. There is little action and the only really scary moments are obviously borrowed from classic films like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (green vomit, moving furniture?). Speaking purely in terms of horrible entertainment "Ghost Son" is a painful glitch, but it has to be said, it's a beautiful and charming flaw. Cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive. Malicious punctuation sometimes even creates a threatening atmosphere, although there is nothing significant happening on the screen. There are several beautiful pictures of South Africa's wildlife to admire, but if that interests you, I suppose you're better off watching National Geographic. Not much to recommend here. Fans of atmospheric ghost stories have much better options to choose from and fanatical fanatics for Bava are advised to (re) watch "Demons", "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
