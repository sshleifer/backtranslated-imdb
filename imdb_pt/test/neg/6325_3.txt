If you read the plot summary for "Mad Max," you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You also discovered that "Mad Max" happens in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be useful because otherwise you will have no idea what is happening. The film, made in 1979, goes to great lengths to be "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) by Stanley Kubrick, only this film, in all its strangeness, makes sense and leaves an impact. This movie does nothing and ends up being a prank full of cars and bikes that hangs like any movie vehicle. <br /> <br /> The first thing wrong with "Mad Max" is that he tries to sell himself. like a tale of revenge when no watchman seems to take revenge until the final 20 minutes. If the first hour was condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 added and then another hour after that, "Mad Max would be a legal action movie with a great vigilante protagonist. Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait and act like a pussy for 2/3 of the movie and then have a sudden epiphany to take revenge on me I still have to watch the sequel "Road Warrior" and I have to admit that I'm excited about it just because I wonder what it does then. This first movie was mostly a waste of time. George Miller does some great action stuff here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable reaction sequences of whole cheese instead a character discovers something horrifying like a burned hand or what you have ruined completely these moments.It is a terribly clich√©d technique of B movie. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no subtle thematic or subtle value of society in this movie. At matter what you may think. A science-fiction action film at least makes a point, but the gratuitous violence done by random and weird bikers does not say anything of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels himself modeled by Alex of "Clockwork" just more ugly and utterly imposing. PG violence simply does not allow the violence of this gang to settle down and get a reaction from the viewer, just complain about it. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit for the amount of things the film crew exploded and collided with things and Miller does a great job of making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers "Road Warrior" will meet the expectations of where this movie ends, otherwise it is more time wasted. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
