This movie has some of the worst performances I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was high school caliber. While it is difficult to portray a character outside the wall as Jerry Lee Lewis, this can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (though Ray Charles had more depth in his personality and musicality than Lewis ever dreamed of owning). The portrait of the Phillips brothers belonged to The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin playing Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck playing Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a preacher in the country, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe in a single word. Wynona Ryder's part was the best, and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 when Lewis met her and still 13 years later?) Some internet tests reveal that the essential facts presented by the film were true, at least no dirtier than most Hollywood movies . bio photos. This movie did bad at the box office, and should have happened.
