As a fan of almost all period dramas, and with a big fan of Jane Austen, I was horrified by this adaptation. As a fan of the 1999 version of Mansfield Park, I was constantly comparing the two and this was very short. It seemed very rushed and very one-dimensional, so it became boring very quickly. There seemed to be no subtle relations, particularly Fanny and Edmund's, and little atmosphere, despite being in a beautiful location. Although anxiously waiting for Jane Austen's season since Christmas, I turned it off after an hour and went to bed. I'll be interested in watching the adaptations of Persuasion and Northanger Abbey, of which I do not have a much-loved version, to see if they can still bore me that way.
