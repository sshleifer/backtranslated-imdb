The above quote says all about "Slipstream". I should have gotten rid of this movie after the first half hour, but I decided it should be fair and give it a chance. I will not watch again, so if someone with the temerity to do so can come back to me with the number of clich√© lines in the film, I'm sure it will set a record. <br /> <br /> Some good and talented actors mingled with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his prey. The character of Paxton kidnapped the prisoner of Hamill, an android taking its name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his team-mate Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep an eye on the pair. The real question, however, is why he simply did not fire the device at Byron, thereby cutting off the middleman. <br /> <br /> If you like a scene after a disjointed scene with a tedious characterization and artistic pretense, then I suppose you will find something of interest here. But you can not convince me that the film makes sense on any level. Scenes from a futuristic Stone Age open the way for high-society snobbery, but the height of bad taste is reached when Paxton's character is displayed after a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks there is any hidden meaning here, you are really stretching. <br /> <br /> Patiently waiting for the picture proclaiming that "The End" appeared, unfortunately even this was denied. If beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had none. However, there was a unique redeeming feature when the final credits began their race - an impressive sight of half a dozen hot air balloons. Apparently, the film was keeping them afloat.
