While the design and location and photography are strong assets in this film; is a turgid, melodramatic subject that demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey the truth. <br /> <br /> The case is the use of music from the soundtrack: a mixture of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber who plays constantly and loudly. and would make Max Steiner make a face when using too much, since it instructs the public on how difficult it is; as ecstatic; how tortured to be an artist. And then, really tells the story elides the details in the end. <br /> <br /> This intensified and kitschy exploration of emotions was once well ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd about a book by Yukio Mishima: This is not written, it is Barbara Cartland. Precisely the same criticism can be made from this film: a project of deceptive, dull vanity.
