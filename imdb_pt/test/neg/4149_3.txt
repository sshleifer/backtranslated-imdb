As a child of the 80's like many of the other critics here I hated the original V and V: the Final Battle. I own both on VHS and never turn on the VCR to watch them. I remember not liking this series very much for a short time, but I could not remember why, so I rented the first record. In the third episode, I had my memory updated. It's terrible. The writing is beyond horrible. It's not even FUN. They had a lot of material to work on here, but it looked like they just did not know what to do to make it 'Days of our Lives with Lizard Aliens'. How cool and potent is the concept of Elizabeth the Starchild? All they could think of to do is turn her into a boring, boring teenager to compete with her mother romantically? Marc Singer seemed less embarrassed to be in Beastmaster II than when he was stuck in that silliness ... the point is, if you are one of the youngest who has just discovered V or one of us older science fiction fans looking to rediscover some Old fun, save yourself and skip this one!
