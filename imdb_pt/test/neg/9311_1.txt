I feel dumber after watching the first 20 mins, fortunately I went out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better movies and take notes on why they are highly rated, not because of film budget or effects special, just plain good acting and hitting things simple, and more importantly - do not be LAME-- but I think this was produced for those tasteless Sheeple and not a clue to what is "A good movie" would not be scared to rate movies low, save the highest scores you've disparaged in "single life movies." Keep in mind that many use IMDb for reliable reviews and opinions, do not spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds Peace & love
