Although I'm a Heather Thomas fan and I have some of your old bikini posters here, I can honestly say that if the only movie I ever saw was Cyclone, I would never have been able to guess why it had come to the point in show business. Directed by Fred Olen Ray (an omen as good as seeing the vultures flying overhead in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle of unscrupulous types is so "B" as possible (or in the case of Fred Olen, "B minus"). <br /> <br /> The cast itself should tell you something. It's not every movie that combines Thomas with actors of the caliber of Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, few movies do that. And even if they seem to be having fun, should not they pass some of the fun to the public? I vote yes, it looks like they voted no. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you ever wanted to see Heather deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the word "F" and connect to the battery cables, you've probably been looking for this. I myself will be content with old reruns of "Fall Guy". <br /> <br /> A star, given in the hope that when another "Cyclone" arrives in town, Heather will run to take shelter. I know I will.
