Am I the only one to think that this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror movies often lack things like a great story or good acting or even good special effects. But the way these shortcomings come together in this movie is surprisingly unfortunate. Miserable story: The idea of ​​a raped vagina turning revenge into a men's eater seems rather funny, but what the writer wrote, "This is stupid." <br /> <br /> Bad acting: The actors move like puppets. They play and look like people, who really strive but can not take action. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: Especially the Van explosion seems indescribably cheap. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that a director who made some cool films during his career changes to such messy things.
