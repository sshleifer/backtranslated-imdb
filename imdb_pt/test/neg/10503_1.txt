OK, I'm usually fascinated by Z movies. Some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. these films have a bit of talent. They want to take away that talent, so unfortunately for them, they have to associate with bad people to make their movies. But some Z movies have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... 'Wow, a Blade knock-off. Believe me, if this movie could have lived up to the label that would make it a better movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, I was subjected to some of the most horrible performances I have ever seen in my entire life. Master Kao was bad, so bad that I believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to understand their acting. I'm still trying to understand his enunciation and why he would raise his voice by saying certain words ... to add a dramatic effect, I'm sure ... but it was not for any apparent reason. Simply incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's the black guy in the purple cover by the end of the movie. The guy in the purple cape fights the hero for about 30 seconds but he is so bad it looked like he was scared to fight. <br /> <br /> The main hero and main villain did decent work. The main hero (Derek Washington) looked like he really knew the martial arts.
