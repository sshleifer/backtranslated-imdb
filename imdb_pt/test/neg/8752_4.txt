I love this movie. Even though I rated it a "4", it's because the acting, the plot, and the budget were all programmed into the "B" universe before even this movie was released. But it's alright! It's a fun movie that has a lot to offer! <br /> <br /> I remember what Leonard Maltin said about "Plan 9 From Outer Space": a movie so bad it's great! Without the UFO alien plot, The Thing That Could Not Die is based on the supernatural (divination, a buried head searching for its body, hypnosis, etc.) to tell its story. The acting is flamboyant, the second-class camera work and the settings are limited, but boy! what movie! This movie is available in the bootleg market. If you find a copy, buy it!
