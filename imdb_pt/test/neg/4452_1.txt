This should rank as one of the biggest disasters of Cinema. I was wandering around Europe at the time and had the misfortune to find the crew making this movie in what was, nonetheless, one of the idyllic and untouched settings of the world. I enlisted as an extra, and what followed was an exposition of modern debauchery. Forget all the accusations you have ever heard about Peter Mayall's intrusions into this rare piece of French life - Geoff Reeve and his companions embarked on a level of revelry in the restaurant in Les Beaux that left the Maitre with his jaw dropped in disbelief. They were simply horrible, uneducated and unworthy of French hospitality.
