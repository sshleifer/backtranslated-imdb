Randy Bowers (John Wayne) arrives at Half Way House on time to take a break on the trail and discovers a huge body of corpses inside them, including a man to whom he must deliver a message - Ed Rogers, head of the facility. He is observed by the niece of the dead, Sally (Alberta Vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where he remained unobserved during the carnage. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a filming technique here as in other films, where he quickly advances the action from one location to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. It is very well made and looks quite innovative in the Lone Star Western era of the 1930s. Pre-shopkeeper George Hayes is at hand, without mustaches, and this is the first time I see him as a villain. . In fact, it took some scenes to realize that he was in a double role, first as the hunchback businessman "Matt the Mute," communicating via pencil and paper, only to become Marvin Black, leader of a gang of law. Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House in an attempt to force Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Another basic player is here too, Yakima Canutt as a black henchman named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima portrayed a villain named Sam Black on another Fraser / Wayne boat, "Neath the Arizona Skies." <br /> <br /> There is a fair amount of time killing on horseback between Black's Gang and Sheriff's. possession, as the character of John Wayne maneuvers to expose the bad guys. In the end, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars at the cost of the destruction of Half Way House, where he exchanges some dynamite bananas for looting in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six shots, and the explosion is an appropriate end for the villain. In his best attitude "Aw shucks", John Wayne falls under the spell of the beautiful Sally Rogers, and unfortunately, Randy does not walk anymore!
