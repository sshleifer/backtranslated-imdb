This movie is money inside. A money depends on an exciting theme song created for an earlier classic. Yul Brynner has long since abandoned the ship and therefore has most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes on the lead role of Chris. I can think of no actor who looks less like Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have at least shaved his hair and lost his mustache, just for the sake of continuity. Some correctional centers show this film to punish offenders. One step out of line and The Magnificent Seven Ride! is brought up and wielded. They did not even bother trying to make this movie look like a TV movie! Abysmal
