Woody Allen (which I have to confess at first I've never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930s jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while, then quickly faded. Penn does a trustworthy job on paper, portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike Allen, who might explain why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can not maintain relationships and whose twin passions) were shooting at rats in the dump and watching trains. <br /> <br /> There is not much consistency in the story. It is narrated, in a sense, by a number of modern jazz "experts" (one of whom is Allen himself), who report their various theories and interpretations of different events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent description of the life of a fictitious man who seems to have received a rather interesting life story for his creators, who probably should have done a better job with it. <br /> <br /> Jazz fans and Woody Allen fans will probably like this. About me? The best I can give is a 3/10.
