I bought this here for a few bucks at the local video store while they released their tapes in favor of the DVDs. I doubt they'll be replacing this in any way. <br /> <br /> I could not say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's really annoying. There are no real cannibal scenes. Me Me Lai does not get naked enough (only 4 or 5 times). And she is not the Thai goddess I expected too. So two of my reasons for watching this movie were eliminated. <br /> <br /> There is a serious animal violence here for those who like this kind of thing. A great fight between a mongoose and a great snake is very bloody. Animal torture, too, some of which are real and others false. Fortunately, the fake is a bit funny, but the real one is just a little sick. Generally speaking, it's a 1970s film - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would have liked to have been. . But it's something different, right? ONE AND ONE HALF STARS!
