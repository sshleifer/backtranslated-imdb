"Graduation Day" is the result of the success of "Friday the 13th". Both films are about creative and bloody murders, rather than suspense. If you like this kind of movie, I recommend "Graduation Day". If not, I would not. There is nothing new here, just the same murders as ever. <br /> <br /> Although I have given the film a 4 out of 10, I will say it is not a repulsive film. It's watchable if you're curious about it, just not creative.
