Seriously, I thought it was a parody when I saw it at the rental store, but I realized it was just crap, I can not even believe I did not hang up, as we all know that these snakes were not rattlesnakes that were pythons and Gardner , the acting was limp and oms I still can not believe the final loll if you will watch it just watch it for the end was seriously invaluable better than the sixth sense, I do not even know if the creators of the film really thought this title would fly, the only time really will fly is when I throw it in the trash ...... just see it for a laugh, was hilarious in the most stupid way, do not buy just rent.
