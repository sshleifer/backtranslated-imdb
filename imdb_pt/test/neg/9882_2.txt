The only reason I did not delete this movie after 20 minutes is because we already wasted 20 minutes with it ... <br /> <br /> the only one and I repeat the only effect they used is a strange kapoera ( of India?) Jump on a wall of half a meter / garbage cans, I mean, effects do not make a movie, but ... sheesh .... me and my friend were expecting the whole movie for some real effect (a huge wolf ?!?!?!?!) but noooooooooooooooo ... all we have is a leap! on a wall of 0.5 meter + they used pharmacy ..... and they found guns?! in the pharmacy ?! I mean what the hell? Oh, I forgot, there was another effect - contact the spears like green eyes! every 10 min we scream "the only thing that can save the movie from disgrace is a giant wolf that kills them all!" In addition, the script was so horrible that you do not know who you'd like to die first. I mean PRAY!) that the "good guy"! will die, hopefully in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and send letters to delete the movie from all the archives in the world.
