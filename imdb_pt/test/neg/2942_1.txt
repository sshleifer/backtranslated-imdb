"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've ever seen! Not only the support is weak, but the characters as well. I'm sorry to tell you Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest Vampire I've ever seen in my life. Sorry Edison; his role in this film was disappointing. Edison does not fight at all in this movie and I'm sure if they did not have Kazaf in the movie, the plot would not be much different. The main plot of the film is not explained enough and the whole film focused heavily on Helen and Kazaf's growing relationship. I mean, who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yeah, he's the right prince? So what! <br /> <br /> Certain scenes in this movie were simply stupid. Yes, the action was great, but the whole scheme was stupid. In a scene at the end, Duke Dekotes says that Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... yes, it seems that now he is grown. Why would you wait until he grew to attack? Another scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my personal favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helen who were the creatures that persistently followed them. How can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires? People are dying around them with bite marks on their necks; Certainly the NEWS would be faster than you can say "Vampire". <br /> <br /> The characters were one more mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's girlfriend. What kind of girl would not be afraid of Vampires, especially if their brother's job is to kill them? I can bet you would not find a girl as brave as Helen if you searched all your life. Helen is annoying, moody and is a drama queen in the movie. She tries too hard to be different and ultimately fails miserably. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've ever seen in any movie. Why would you bite someone's neck, especially if you're not a vampire? It is very strange that her reaction to Kazaf's confession does not discourage him. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupid character in the story. How degrading for a young actor like himself to play in a movie with such a badly built role. He does not stand out over the film and does not fight. Although I'm a fan of Edison, I do not want a man to stay on the floor all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Your love is pure and sweet. Gypsy is beautiful and does not try much like Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the movie. One flaw in the plot was Reeve's death. The film had absolutely no substance, but was doomed by removing one of the only sympathetic characters. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story does not focus much on him and therefore made his desire to get Kazaf's "rock" sounded irrelevant. <br /> <br /> It's very sad because, at the end of the movie, I was forcing myself to watch because I desperately wanted to see Kazaf's fight. The end was so abrupt, because the whole time I expected was great. Kazaf, who is the supposed Vampire Prince, does not do anything for the movie and I'm sure if he was withdrawn, the movie would not be much different. I recommend that you do not waste your time on this movie as I have. I was very disappointed. If you are in search of a great movie, why not watch "The Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean?" Friendly characters with a well-written storyline.
