Very disturbing but skillfully crafted and scripted and cleverly directed with a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are extraordinarily good. The story revolves around a boy (Bryan Madorsky) asking where all the leftovers that eat every night come from. His parents (Hurt, Quaid) strange behavior causes the school psychiatrist (Dennis) to get involved. It's a horrible cannibal movie. But not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll love it. If you do not like parents, stay away from the movie. Just giving advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> Rated R for Strong Adult Themes and Graphic Violence.
