I'm a movie collector starring Mrs. Weaver, so I bought it just because she was in it. I find it very strange that his early career was filled with so many horrible movies. It began with an incredible promise in Alien but then had a huge amount of bombs. These bombs include this movie, Deal of the Century, One Woman or Two and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year Of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than remarkable. In the time between Alien and the 1986 sequel, Aliens, the only movie she made that was worth it was Ghostbusters. Before the release of Aliens, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was leaving. Luckily she was not. <br /> <br /> Back to the eyewitness, the movie is annoying. It creates no suspense. William Hurt looks like a carton and the atmosphere is just to dry. Sigourney is decent, but nothing worth remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you must, but do not go with any expectation of a decent movie. Watch better movies with these two stars, such as Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
