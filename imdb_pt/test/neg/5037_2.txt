From the epicenter of the cultural globe, four working-class teenagers have tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the final attempt to do so in the last century and they failed. Before the dust subsided, band manager and owner of the SEXAL store, Malcolm McLaren, spent the money The Sex Pistols had earned to make a "mockumentary" about their own role in their success. The movie was called The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle (take the hint) and consists of very little footage of The Sex Pistols playing music, and a lot of McLaren footage effectively calling the idiots out of the audience. <br /> <br /> Surreal nonsense in which guitarist Steve Jones is a detective in McLaren's tail, soon dissolves so that he and drummer Paul Cook can fly to Rio and spend time with the "big train thief" Ronnie Biggs. Get ready for the spectacle of three very nasty men dancing naked to a horribly ironic version of "Belsen was a Gas" (a song about killing Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp) and other sung music in Ronnie's tone deaf lament that includes the lyrics "God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady" (lyrics that Johnny Rotten would have considered unpleasant). The scenes of Sid Vicious are few and idiots. Jumping out of bed in a thong with a swastika on his testicles to sing a song of bad boy biker of the 50s. Playing for the song "Punk is a joke" of the film in an attempt to turn Sid into James Dean. I'm surprised McLaren does not believe in Siddy's death either. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous performance of My Way. The zeitgeist punk rock right there. Mocking an adoring audience before shooting them all. No need for a full movie, just watch this clip on YouTube. <br /> <br /> From the Julien Temple (and nicer) documentary of 2001, The Filth and the Fury, we received a more balanced and honest presentation. but there were also a number of scenes that I would have liked to have seen in Swindle (as Fury was basically a reissue of the same material). One was a lively Sid, complete with Sid dubbing; "You f * cken betta wat'ch out, alright, or I'll slice you open" - one of which still appeared on the cover of something over 7 inches - a snippet was shown in Fury but I do not know which context originally appeared . It was in original engravings but removed after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the movie Who Killed Bambi, which would have been the mock movie Hard Day's Night that McLaren originally intended to do. He starred in Sting (!) As a member of a gay New Romantics group, and it looked like a damn sight more fun than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, it's a scam. If you need it, rent The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the failure of music as a polemic that changes the world.
