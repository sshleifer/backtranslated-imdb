If I heard the male leader say "This is crazy!" again I would have vomited. The film is a great clich√©, with false attitudes of "grinding it under his heel". No man in this movie has a redeeming quality; reminds me of the Soviet-era films with messages strongly oriented to politics. I could not even understand why there was attraction between the leads, nor could I wait for the end.
