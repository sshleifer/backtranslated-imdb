When you read the commentary on this movie, which is a clever and funny political comedy based on actual events - the only real word here is that it's a comedy. If you say it's a film about Russian politics - it's not. There is probably only 2% in the film than actually happened in Russia during that election campaign. In fact, in 1996, it was a thousand times more interesting to keep up with the situation and this was a really funky election campaign. Well, there were US PR advisors working on Yeltsin's team, but their role was minimal. The whole campaign was totally different from what is shown in the film, it would be a lot more fun showing all the president's people across the country with paper boxes full of money, and celebrities giving the shows to support Yeltsin all over the place - in least this would be true. I only give three because of the respect to Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about the machine guns on the streets of Moscow. I was living in the place that had the most hard crimes in Russia in the mid-1990s and I've never seen a man with the gun on the street.
