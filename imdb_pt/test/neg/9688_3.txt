I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after seeing this movie! I was expecting a biblical story viewed with great special fx, etc, but during the movie I discovered that this was an absolute disaster ... it was not biblical at all ... just the boat and the animals were similar to the story ... if you want a visual "translation" of the biblical version of Noah, then DO NOT go watch this movie!
