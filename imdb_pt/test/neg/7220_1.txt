This television show is a dull waste of time if you want to learn about the animals watching the discovery channel. If you want to watch nincompoops on television, watch MTV. MTV is not for music television, for preformed dodgers of latecomers or for spoiled kids who mourn their hearts for not getting a BMW for their 16th birthday. I bet if you like this show I bet you love viva la Bam, and idiot, huh? I think my IQ dropped ten points by watching this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two jackass shows and the animal planet <br /> <br /> Some people think this is a good combination. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, think it's retarding. <br /> <br /> And if you notice that it's a lot like jackass <br /> <br /> and viva la Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is horrible
