This is easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on the TV. I'd love to ignore him completely, but Fox put him on Sunday's schedule, forcing me to find something else to watch between American Dad and Family Guy. The male star's face is almost the least evolved and pathetic excuse for a human I've ever seen on TV. Nothing in the program is remotely funny and practically everything has already been done and much better by other shows. <br /> <br /> It's obvious their strategy is to dive deep into the Sunday show and wait. Someone starts to like it ... but I have to break it for you, Fox, this is the wrong hole. The blow did not work on me - I just go somewhere else - but come on, you fucking dickheaders, this show freaks out, and that's even worse when compared to the rest of Fox Sunday's programming. <br /> <br /> DEVELOPMENT CANCELED FOR THIS STEAM PILE?
