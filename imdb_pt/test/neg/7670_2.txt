I gave "Airport '79" only two stars because it is a really bad movie. No one who has anything to do with it deserves praise (except Charo's Chihuahua, who does a great job in his role). This is not to say that the film is not worth seeing. This helps if you have a buzz, but this is not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really looks like an early version of "Airplane!" Each scene has a set-up and a payout, and the scenes run down as if they were totally disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, the crew and the airplane can continue, no matter what. Are you a news reporter and a strange guy murdered in your house in your presence? The killer then chases you on your greenhouse roof? No problems. You can still catch that early morning flight to Paris ... no need to involve the cops. Does your plane dodge an unmanned drone missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom hunt, making barrel pulleys, a dive without a motor, and a landing without reversers in the process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics to check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. It's really funny. <br /> <br /> And I admit that there is a bit of anarchism in me that leaves when passengers do not pay attention to cabin attendants. The highlight is when the attendant tells Jimmie Walker that he will have to save his saxophone (God spare me a flight sitting in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) Before takeoff. Jimmie basically says, "No." Later in flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and Jimmie actually appears on the next leg of the flight with another sax he will not pack. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (A passenger actually obeys the clerk.) When Charo is informed that she can not take the dog on the plane, she leaves the plane. Naturally, this happens because you can not get a good view of her butt and breasts while sitting. ) In summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a little fun. Unfortunately, the filmmakers and the cast deserve no credit for this, as it was probably totally unintentional.
