ARMED AND DANGEROUS is not one of John Candy's big names. This movie about a fired police officer who ends up working for a small peat-driven security system is very weak and not much of a comedy. There are some moments that I liked, like looking at Candy in a pilot suit, but it does not seem to matter much. ARMED AND HAZARDOUS is still a dangerously disappointing failure brought to us by the director of the equally dumb COMMANDO action. What a sad excuse for a comedy! <br /> <br /> 1 of 5
