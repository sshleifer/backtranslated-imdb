The first Robocop had a cynical sense of humor and a sense of unhealthy violence. It was a fine line to walk, but Paul Verhoeven did and the movie did very well, they did a sequel. How awful. (Possible spoilers ahead - although anything that might ruin this is beyond me). <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner is not the director of this type of film. He clearly did not understand the original's wit, and as a result, huge mindless violence seems very bad - and worse is very unpleasant. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic and light music does not match the images on the screen! What was he ticking ?! The Great American Hero?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated the Robocop theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without the fanfare of John Williams, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that do not gel. At first we see Robo "stalking" his old wife. Well, good idea. But they give up completely after that. So there's a stupid idea of ​​the company reprogramming Robo to be cool. This is played for 10 minutes and then is immediately discarded. Or, the silly idea that the repulsive lord of the 10-year-old drug reminds Robo of his son - Again, a weak motive that is briefly shown twice and dropped. This may work in a comic but not in movies, and Frank Miller was unfortunately very inexperienced at the time and threw all the ideas along with the kitchen sink. It does not work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people here seem to be praising the corporate bruising in this film and the privatization of the police. This is the best part of the movie that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a tough businessman to make a profit, but in the end it was fair. In this film, he is just a pure evil in his desire for money and power. You can not just change characters like that for no reason. And the character of Nancy Allen is useless in this film, while in the first she was essential to the search for Robo by itself. It's as gratuitous as the violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And violence, yes violence. I like many violent and bloody movies when they serve purpose and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to hang out on humans being blown to bits, thrown to shreds, children looking for death and torture and people's craving for drugs. He does not know when to stop. Do we really need to see all innocent bystanders (even people trying to help others) get hit? Infease yourself when we see the bad Robocop firing repeatedly! Instead, Mr. Kershner proves that he has very little taste for this kind of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and, worse, a disgusting message of violence to any young person watching this movie. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not meant to be a message and I certainly do not watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do should be put into question. And as for this movie, in the words of the last words of the battered kid drug dealer while he dies, "it's still shit."
