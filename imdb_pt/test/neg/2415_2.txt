The sister of a fraternity boy is brutally murdered by a street gang, causing the young man to suffer a sudden psychotic upheaval. He and his friends massacre half of the city to bring their sister back to life. <br /> <br /> SAVAGE STREETS was released a year after this movie, and it was more fun. Linnea Quigley, who has a supporting role in this film as the sexy (and briefly naked) girlfriend of one of the guys, also starred in SAVAGE STREETS. <br /> <br /> This movie is low, despite providing enough escapism. entertainment and free nudity to please your target audience (myself). <br /> <br /> MPAA: Score: R for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
