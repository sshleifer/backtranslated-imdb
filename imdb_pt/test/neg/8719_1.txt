If you've never read the classic science fiction novel in which this mini-series is based, it can be really good. Unfortunately, if you're a fan of the book, you probably will not be able to watch more than the first or second hour. All the political intrigue was taken from the film, the most important scenes of the book were removed, the characters' motives were completely changed, and the words from the mouths of the characters were wrong. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with incredible political ability and a great understanding of the workings of the world, in this film he is heated and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
