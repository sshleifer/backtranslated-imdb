In Bollywood, it's not uncommon for useless films to become hits, good movies being played and good actors are not great. <br /> <br /> AKS is such a movie <br /> <br /> Himesh after a musical director and singer tried to act Hell Man, just because his songs have become a hit that means he becomes a actor <br /> <br /> The producers were sure that the film would work, maybe the songs were also a hit and of course Himesh made his advertising cheap as usual <br /> <br /> The film tells a bad story, such bad direction, so bad it makes you shudder <br /> <br /> Indian Rickshaws in Germany, Stones of Himesh and a lot of stupidity Himesh's cap is intact, even when he's in the car, <br /> <br /> The direction is bad Music is a saving grace, although most songs are the same <br /> <br /> Himesh tries hard, but unfortunately his emotive scenes are a joke, lacks of expressions, he is the most suitable for his musical director and some singers He cuts a sad image Hansika is horrible Malika is well Sachin Khedekar is well, Dars han Jhariwala hams
