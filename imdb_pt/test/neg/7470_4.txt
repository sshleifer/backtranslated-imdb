This movie was nothing more than a gay explorer cheesecake. It was not an "art" movie; just an excuse to show off several free, exploitative and exaggerated scenes with extensive male genital nudity. There was a locker room scene involving more than a dozen naked men. The camera zooms into men's butts and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their full-screen sticks. There are several scenes in this movie showing the penis after the penis. It makes REAL quick redundant and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. If these same scenes were filmed using women (ex: totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly), it would quickly be dismissed as just softcore pornography and an excuse to show a lot of eye drops ... which is all that this movie is. Any artistic merit was eroded by the ghetto's ghetto mentality drain. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing-desire, etc. they were simple and superficial; no more developed than one would expect from a sophomore philosophy student. Just go straight to the point and rent a gay porn instead.
