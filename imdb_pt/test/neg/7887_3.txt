SAIMIN <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Stereo SR </ p> <p> After a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated "suicides", an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) asks the help of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes that the victims were acting under a post-hypnotic suggestion. But her subsequent investigations reveal an even more somber force at work, linked to a young girl (Miho Kanno), whose life was hampered by sadistic abuse ... Based on a novel by Keisuke Matsuoka, this (Japanese gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some of the images in the climax confrontation reveal a more immediate influence: the recent commercial success of RING by Hideo Nakata (1998). Despite all its ambition, SAIMIN is a routine potboiler who stumbles poorly after a powerful opening ('suicides' are particularly impressive despite some weak CGI effects), although director Masayuki Ochiai - who co-wrote the screenplay with Yasushi Fukuda - promotes a process for an extended end in which the surprising secrets of the narrative are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for his cinematic adaptation of the video game PARASITE EVE (1997) - which also starred Inagaki (a member of the Japanese pop group SMAP) - and while SAIMIN echoes the film's strong visual sense, it falls short as drama, and most characters are mere figures, undermining the emotional reward of the plot. Which is a shame, because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic scenarios - most notably a sequel to a concert hall in which Dvorak's 'New World' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder! - and Ochiai is well served by a great production team. However, those attracted by the promise of bloody carnage may be disappointed - the film is long in atmospheres and short in splatter. <br /> <br /> Presentations are varied, due to the limitations of the script, but Kanno (TOMIE) is excellent. as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - which, according to the captions in the print under analysis, is not recognized as a viable medical condition in Japan! - who is the victim of a TV hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), one of the prime suspects in the killings. Inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role, and he is constantly overshadowed by Utsui, a veteran whose career dates back to the "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> (dialogue in Japanese)
