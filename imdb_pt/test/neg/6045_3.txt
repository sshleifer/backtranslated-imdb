I had seen this movie just a few days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it at lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu box so I decided to watch it. Seriously, only one movie is only suitable for late night TV ... you know, after Conan, but before the sorcerer infomercials deal. <br /> <br /> Although this movie has very little to do with webs, it has a lot to do with spiders, refer to my title if you need a refreshment. <br /> <br /> I found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating. A hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... It would have been a good start to a cool fantasy, but then down the hill after 15-20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast is poor without memorable performances, poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplified ... considering spiders do not carry breasts. As well as bad sound effects. An obvious low-budget film, although the cast has tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians stumble into a hidden nuclear generator while on a job. They move the buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall on the portal and it closes ... struggling to find out what is happening, the party still in our world seeks help while the other party watches their surroundings. <br /> <br /> The help does not arrive so they open the portal and accompany the meeting in a parallel dimension. They find a race of human spiders nicknamed soldiers. After a death and persecution, they are saved by the survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it gets boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal and then attack the hive. After losing two more electricians, they open the portal and escape back to our world ... some 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> It looks interesting right?
