Although predictable and artificial, it's not a bad movie. It's fun, which is all Van Damme hopes to do. The omnipresent "twin" device is again used (as in a large number of Van Damme movies), but it is not uncomfortable except for longtime fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth seeing. The action is decent, nothing spectacular for Van Damme, but exciting. I can recommend it to Van Damme fans and even to those who are not, but do not mind an action movie with a good pair of lead. Russian peat is a good concept and current for the day. Clearly, it's not your best movie, but it's not the worst.
