I had the misfortune to pick this up on a flight recently. I had the greatest misfortune of having it played on my RETURN flight as well. Obviously Demi's attempt to get some artistic credit, the film is a disaster because of her poor acting ability. A better actress could have done that job, but a simple look at Moore's face shows the emptiness inside. At least she's not ruining American literature this time around.
