No blood, no blood, no gratifying death scenes ... dumb ass dumb ass. Dear God sitting in this movie made me sick. Ill sick sick. Very annoying ... extremely annoying ... <br /> <br /> There's not even a funny look in this movie! I can not find a good thing to say about it, besides the lead guy had a good body ... I guess. It's definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
