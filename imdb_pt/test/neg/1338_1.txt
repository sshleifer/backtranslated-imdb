Not! no no no My whole being is revolting against this terrible remake of a classic movie. I knew we were worrying from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes - literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging. Meg Ryan playing Meg Ryan - how tiring is that?! And it got worse ... much worse. The horribly clich√©d lines, the action characters, the growing sense that I was attending a spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the last trivial trick in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it seems a dozen times - nothing new or original. For shame!
