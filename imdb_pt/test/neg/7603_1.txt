Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies that at least make you laugh at your unbelievable stupidity. It has no entertainment value. It's just shit. I do not know where to begin to explain how this movie bothered me. I think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. It's as if someone took a simple beat and then, for the rest, let a five-year-old go crazy with a synthesizer and record it. It's really awful and as if that was not enough, there is not a scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). At the end of the movie, you are deaf or have already cut off your ears earlier. Which would at least prevent you from falling asleep, since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad acting, some cheap and unconvincing deaths, no story (just jumps from one scene to another and you, as a viewer, can try to make any sense) and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst " special effects "of all time. It's extremely annoying. Do not watch this movie! You could do something a lot more fun, like looking at a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack was sucked in?
