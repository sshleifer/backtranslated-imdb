Since Disney often ignores the quality of the animation and the need for a good plot in its sequences, that was a pleasant surprise. I do not know why Disney does not pay more attention to its sequences. Graphic quality is always lower; no wallpaper worthy of the Disney name, empty frames and dialogue worse, with little or no attention given to real history, and cartoon drawings are almost always worse than the Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is still poor compared to the original Disney, and the dialogue is rather banal, the plot and the overall execution were really very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Although not so captivating, it does not fail to completely capture the charm and / or mystery of the first. There is some suggestion of this, hidden here and there. <br /> <br /> Children will like it, anyway. <br /> <br /> The rate is 4.5 / 10 of ... the devil.
