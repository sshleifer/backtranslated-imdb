Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Get ready for the spoiler - the prime suspect, the teacher, did not do it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he could not have been the killer from the start; he and a student witnessed the first murder. So there is absolutely no suspense about whether the teacher is the killer or not. There is a long and tedious construction for the ultimate explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short film) is not exciting enough to keep your interest. Even in the tradition of the accused "wrong man", he fails, because the police never seriously accuse the teacher, and the murderer is never behind him. No shine, no grace, no grace.
