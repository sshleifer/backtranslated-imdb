Is this supposed to be serious? Hope not. This is one of the most pathetically hilarious movies I've ever seen. Given that I got a buck on the shelf "Bad movies", it sure lives up to its place in the store. What can I say, the bloody effects are scattered all over the place, some looking quite real, some looking like a teddy bear who had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. Music is one of the most horrible I've ever heard, acting is one of the funniest elements ... should I continue? Do not bother unless you've seen all the other pathetic horror movies in store and that's all there is left.
