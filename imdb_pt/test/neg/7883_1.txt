This movie is about two killer women going on a tour to kill random men they encounter. <br /> <br /> Wow, "Baise-moi" turned out to be the worst movie ever on my list. The plot is crazy, meaningless and unnecessary. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no sensible parent would want to show this movie to their children. I do not understand what people do when making this movie or watching that movie. Maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled. There simply are no excuses or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved work. <br /> <br /> The only consolation I offer myself is that I watched it in rapid advance, so I did not waste so much time.
