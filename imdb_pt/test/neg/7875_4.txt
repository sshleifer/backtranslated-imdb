I saw this in my local supermarket and I knew that Debra was there, so I decided to buy it (out of support for this sexy woman!) The plot and acting in this movie was terrible (with the exception of Debra Wilson; saying this because I love her, she was seriously the only actress or actress who had any emotion in her acting and voice!) What I did not get at the beginning is because the wife did not turn her car over instead of randomly running like that. It was so stupid. And it's LA (NOBODY saw her kidnapped on a public residential street - NOBODY ... yes, that's realistic!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason) they were determined to find him (and at one point) when they had him at gunpoint - on a cell phone! In fact, I doubt the LA cops would go out of their way like that for a stupid cell phone! The lady could have walked to one of the many cell phone booths and have it replaced! The kids acting skills also sucked (I think they were reading from a suggestion card or someone off the camera whispering their lines) because they would be asked questions and would look around and then respond in a questionable voice (ie- "yes I miss Daddy?") Also how could there be all these snipers in the trees and roofing in LA WITHOUT being seen?! I see this being played at 3 AM in the USA. <br /> <br /> Debra Wilson fans will like their parts. She's the only actress with real acting skills (Debra, honey - stop doing those cheap things, drive video movies ... maybe that'll change with the next Whitepaddy movie.) She puts a few jokes (like when a of her superiors appear and asks her who she's talking to, she shouts at her computer and says "Shit, Charlie!") I gave 4/10 ... a 4 just because of Debra's good acting skills.
