I know this movie is a low budget horror film intended for those who are in favor of "cheap" shocks and gore, but even considering that this movie is very annoying, full of an incoherent plot along with horrible music and obvious signs <br /> <br /> Without spoilers, I'll just say that at the end of the movie, things are wrapped up without explanation, whether by film or narration. The girl Anitra is really attractive, but still not a good enough reason to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of those bloody movies of the 60s and 70s, then you should watch it, but be warned that you do not even get to the usual level of these types of movies.
