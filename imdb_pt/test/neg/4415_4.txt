There are a lot of movies that my college friends and I used to play. They are mostly the exaggerated works of the 1950s that appeared on television at the last show. This was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native being brought to life on a tree stump with a scowl on his face. Now my friends said that if you looked carefully, you could see that the thing had shoes on. I've never seen that. What strikes me most is that the natives seemed to be white men with black ink on their faces; some looked kind of Italian. They also spoke with the strangest timbre that did not seem to fit their situation. Like the movies of the mummies, the mobility of the thing did not seem to pose much threat. In a confrontation, one should just walk fast; I think it's the old element of surprise. If you see this, do not take it too seriously. Be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us great joy.
