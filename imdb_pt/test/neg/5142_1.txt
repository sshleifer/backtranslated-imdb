OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual easy delivery of lines in his movies. Age helped him with his low power style and smooth voice and steals an effortless scene. But Disappearance is your misstep. Holy Moly, this was a bad movie! <br /> <br /> I must give praise to cinematography and actors, including Kris, for trying to do their best with this silly and confusing story! None of this made sense and Kris probably did not understand either, and he was just going through the motions waiting for someone to come to him and tell him what that was all about! <br /> <br /> I do not care that everyone in this movie was doing it out of love for the project, or something ... I saw low budget movies that had a plot for the love of God! This had nothing, zilcho, nothing, zippo, empty of reason ... a complete waste of good talents, scenery and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I rented this piece of junk for a buck and I want my money back! I want my 2 hours back, I invested in this year F waste of my time! Do not watch this movie or waste 1 minute of your valuable time while passing through a room where it is playing or even open the box that is holding the DVD! Believe me, you'll thank me for the advice!
