This begins in Pennsylvania in 1913. A bunch of children are killed in a mine explosion purposefully fired by the mine owner. Cut to 2006. Recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and the little girl Emma (Chloe Moretz) move to a remote home located near the mine. What they do not know is that the ghosts of little children haunt the woods and kill anyone around after dark. <br /> <br /> Slow and boring horror film. The premise is obvious and has even been made to death. There are also huge gaps in the logic of history. It is never clear why these children simply kill someone or because they EAT bodies later (yes - it is shown). They're already dead - why do they need food? And why did not they get the main villain in the story long before? He was around the area. Why choose this time to attack him? Also, the characters are not at all pleasant. Sarah is faced with the worst. It has some saving graces. The location is beautiful and strange at the same time, some of the murders were VERY bloody and brutal and the children themselves seemed scary silently walking through the forest at night. But, in spite of everything, I was bored and struggling to stay awake. You can skip this one.
