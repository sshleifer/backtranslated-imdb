I could not help but laugh when I saw that the public might have thought it was email in 1996. Apparently email is an interactive (chat-like) discussion with a weak voice synthesis reading each comment out loud . And some of the other "tech" aspects are also funny. I swear the "high tech" communications center she has some Commodore 64 monitors. Almost like watching the movie Hackers nowadays, I think. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that for most of the film the main actress bears the illusion of being deficient, the final part of the film has an inexplicable use of His legs that somehow I can not ignore. I mean, why include something so stupid? <br /> <br /> Anyway, to summarize: the plot is quite predictable, the acting is bad, the killer is quite guessed. But it can be fun in a kind of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I think.
