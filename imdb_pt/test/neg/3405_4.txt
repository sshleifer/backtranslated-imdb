I am very into Waverly Hills and first watched Death Tunnel The Movie. It could not have been much worse. Then I heard that the documentary was coming out and I was excited thinking that it was a documentary, it would be more serious and it would not have the horrible special effects. Wrong, the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw. way a documentary should be. Waverly Hills does not need help with pathetic effects, that's fine just the way it is. The excursions are $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for 8 hours of overnight research per person group minimum of 10 for overnight research. Courses must be set up ahead of time. Incredible place for the ghost hunter!
