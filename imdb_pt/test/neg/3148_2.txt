Being a child of the 1980s, I grew up with countless educational programs as well as diversionaries (or both), and I continue to learn a lot from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. After learning that Sesame Street, to cite the best example, was not solely responsible for the fact that I could read on an adult level before walking, it increased the level of disgust I feel not only by the Lyons corporation and its product but those who defend them as well. As if I had faith in those we attribute to protect ourselves or our children, the fact that Barney & Friends still pollutes our waves after more than a decade is a discredit not only for the FCC, US trade and its manufacturers. , is a discredit for all mankind. In a world where I can be harassed without the use of the police, welfare services and child protection agencies simply because I was born different from those in power, even though the broadcasters can pump this garbage to my home without challenge, you have who ask what is wrong with people. See, in a world where we ought to behave as adults and explain for ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is important, because it will often have consequences long after we have gone. It is not just our attempts to make our children more normal, more similar, more thinking, potentially devastating, what we end up teaching them to be normal also has a big role to play. So the question becomes one of what Barney is teaching our kids to be normal. In addition to the lessons that we are not good at if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when they are missing, other shocking things that are shown on Barney's show include Barney bothering children. The issue of kidnapping and child sexual abuse is a major problem in our society, and it has been since we started trying to pretend it was not, but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways to present the topic. <br /> <br /> So far I've just mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons that Barney himself presents. Adding to the problem are the children shown in the program. I use the word children loosely here, since the range of ages shown goes from only three years and reaches fourteen. However, no difference in emotional response is shown at any extreme. Fourteen-year-olds react to Barney and his proposed situations in the same manner as five-year-olds. Specialists in autism in childhood and adolescence especially consider this an incredibly bad thing to expose children. The autistic spectrum adults who faced growing problems as their needs not only were not met, but also ignored tend to watch it and feel the desire to do the kind of things with Barney that would make teens of fourteen cry. As irreverent and unhappy as the shows aimed at the older kids' market, such as You Can not Do That On Television, they show Barney by showing that different ages respond not just to the same thing in different ways, but they do. So in response to mdmireles1295, I must say that I hope they do not have children. For every time I see a father or a mother showing this son this bullshit, I feel a huge desire to report it to the police for child abuse. And I speak as a man whose entire education was dominated by abuse. They may sing about ways to love, care for or share, but the examples they show are not just so unbalanced that they are the opposite of education, they are so devoid of realism that they become dangerous, as The Light Triton has already pointed out. . The kind of lessons children learn from Barney is that people do not vary, feelings must be suppressed at all costs, and the rules are entirely arbitrary. When compared to the lessons that the variation is what makes the world go round and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy, it still confuses the mind that the authorities still have to step in and get that garbage out of the air. If a father did to his son what Barney does around the world, they would face criminal charges. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I gave Barney my two favorites of ten points that I give to all trash with absolutely no ransom. value. In a world of adults who know how to respond appropriately to their children, this has no place.
