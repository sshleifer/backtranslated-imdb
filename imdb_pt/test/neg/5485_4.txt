This is my first Almodavar movie. I confess that we chose this primarily because we knew it had the seductive prospect of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is about everything this movie has to recommend it. I consider myself a very sophisticated spectator, I like European films, "art" films and I am usually able to recognize a quality film even if it is not my personal taste. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a complete blank space for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called "hilarious comedy," but I did not laugh once. Built awkwardly and awkwardly, with many meaningless dialogues. I do not understand this - it seems like an amateurish endeavor. Can someone clarify me?
