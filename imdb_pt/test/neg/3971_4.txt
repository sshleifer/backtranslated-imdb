The only reason I'm giving this movie is because it was made in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters' complete inability to act. Lead is an actor that I have never seen in anything else and it shows. No chemistry with love interest and so dull that you almost do not care what happens to it. Dick Sargent was not convincing as a villain, much less this guy should be super villain ... he was more annoying than anything. Peter Graves was the only person the movie was not horrible, his part was small and even he could not make up for his lack of talent. In 2004, someone tried to make this mess again, it was called The Island ... I personally have not seen this movie, but from what I understand, it's the same movie. If you want to laugh at this movie, the episode of MST3k is really funny ... full of bewitched references and biographies, this movie is finally watched
