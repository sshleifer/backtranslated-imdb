Possibly one of the best, most horrible b movies of all time, as in is so bad and random, it's kind of hilarious and I do not know how I feel about it. Reminds me of Cabin Fever. There's just something about that kid jumping. off the porch doing karate and shouting 'pancakes' which is intriguing. Since a lot of people have already outlined the plot and all I'm going to do is summarize the quality of the movie with a quote: "I'm the park ranger who's going to drive you crazy." Yes, I said enough. If you're looking for quality or a really scary movie, I would not recommend it. but if you like these types of movies, then I think you would like ... I do not know how, but I think some people would like it.
