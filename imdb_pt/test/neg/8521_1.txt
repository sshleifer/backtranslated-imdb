You're dead is an unspeakably terrible attempt at a British gangster movie. It does not have a unique original idea, being an atrocious copy of several elements of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. The acting and the dialogue are absolutely unbearable, the plot is ridiculous and totally predictable, despite the constant attempts of plot twists, and contains only characters and clich√©s of actions of one-dimensional dimensions. He has some good actors, but they are out of shape and unable to do much with the terrible stuff they are working with. It is an absolute torture to sit through this drivel.
