Why would anyone make a movie like that? Why would anyone invest in such a movie? Why would anyone in the world of movies work in such a movie? Why would any theater show such a movie? Why would any TV show have such a movie? Why would any critic bother reviewing a movie like that? Why did anyone watch a movie like that? Why would not mental exams be made to the writers / producers / directors of such a movie? Sometimes there are movies that are so bad they are good. This is such a horrible movie that it sucks. The IMDb really should institute a "0" or even a minuscule scale to encompass works of this horrifying pretentious horror.
