Seriously, this movie is not. Steve Guttenburg is constantly forcing his dialogue with the tough guys and giving everyone the evil eye all the time. He simply was not believable, it looks like he's trying to be a tough guy and sucks at it. I only remember him as the millionaire father with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two ... so that's a big change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean and he died (as usual). Only this time he was not impaled on a boat anchor (Patriot Games), crushed by a gigantic satellite dish (Goldeneye), or run over by cows (The Field). He just got shot, very fast and civilized, and that's all I got from this movie that they did not kill him in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. That sad? I was just watching for the 3 seconds that Sean was in it, and then the rest was crap. I actually tried to watch and understand the plot, but there really was not one. It seemed a little Mission Impossible with the hole, "Oooooo! There's a mole! It's the leader of the group, and NOBODY I expected! Let's lock it! Let's frame the weaker guy so we can get away!" Clich√© and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
