In this pretended satire, Chaplin turned his eyes to the evils of German fascism, playing the two roles of the Tomanian dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an inadvertent world war. hero and Jewish barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbor Osterlich, while finding time for countless weird scenarios. The dancer's waltz with an inflatable balloon is actually quite heavy, uninteresting and bland. Chaplin certainly ought to be commended for appearing to satirize Hitler and for speaking heavily about celluloid - its so much talked about ending. speech is actually the bold and memorable highlight of the play - but the film simply is not sharp or funny enough to deserve the praise that is often received, nor for repeated demands. The best gags are far from Hynkel's tiring stance and involve The Barber trying to avoid a large rotary pump (a sequence that steals from the weaponry in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on the head, accidentally pushing the board aside roof of your store. Compared to the director's silent classics, The Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent, and utterly unsatisfactory, while the barren periods between laughter are often long and difficult to bear. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and The Great Dictator certainly qualifies as such.
