I grew up watching the "Bowery Boys" on weekends and even in youngsters of an age I could say that this was low rent, as the name implies. Still it was fun to see Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs defeated him. The East Side Kids things were never shown, although it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just down a standard for kids to tune in even if they only had like 5 channels to watch. Enter the year 2005 and I'm reliving my childhood. I do not find any Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found The East Side Kids on disk and also on a public domain site. Luckily I saved my dough and saw Bowery Blitz on the web for free, and it really really blows. Now I can see that there are some Bowery Boys and maybe the lovers of bad Monogram movies who gave this 7-in-10 melodrama but come on guys, that's not even trying to be funny. It's a East Side Kids drama, not a comedy, so it's no good. The best part was seeing Muggs fight in the end, he reminded me of my elementary school days squandering like a girl when I would get into a fight, it was kind of abusive. Leonard Maltin said in his mini bio that this movie is one of the best, so you can imagine the rest. If you want to see some decent action on the East Side, check out Ghosts on The Loose, but the result is that a comedy team starts strong in their careers and slowly steps away until Hall's antics dominate what they were at best. Still 2nd layer well below the 3 stooges, which they imitate but amuse to those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring back pleasant memories of "Bowery Boys" and it is best left to Monogram fans.
