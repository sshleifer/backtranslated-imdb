"Flashdance" meets "Meatballs III" or maybe it should be called "Meatballs IV". This is the all time favorite movie of my friend Wesley, largely because he still has one thing about the cheerleaders J.V. As someone once said, "This is good - more than good - but as you get older, you need to branch out. Whether you want it or not, society demands it." "Give Me an F" has the greatest cheerleader JV from the movie, Mary Ann (played by Beth Miller), who looks like a caring Alicia Silverstone from before her "no-no" days " . Wesley hates Miller's other movie, the horrible "Teen Wolf Too" three years later, where she plays a fickle southern personality very much like Martha Smith's character in Animal House. Personally I admire Miller's career since the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mary Ann is a na√Øve Molly rookie cheerleader (member of the "The Lucky Ducks" squad). ) who comes to Camp Beaverview for cheerleading instructions. She is friends with Jenna (Karen Lee Kelly), the leader of the tough-girl squad - aptly named "The Demons." Jenna becomes protective of Mary Ann after her main rival does not like Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Later, Mary Ann falls in love with Tommy Hamilton, the chief instructor. Tommy is spending the summer struggling with the dilemma of having to grow and move on, which is a problem as his only skills are to teach cheerleaders and perform elaborate dance routines in the shower for the pleasure of the viewers thing. Phoebe (Daphne Ashbrook) is Tommy's suffering girlfriend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced prospect. She even tolerates Tommy's flirtation with Mary Ann - trusting that Tommy will not really take advantage of young Mary Ann. <br /> <br /> Although these four characters are solid and their relationships have a cool charm, the support cast is almost as weak as the stuff they have to work on. Which is a shame, because if they brought some comic relief to the production, it would be a decent movie. Jennifer Cooke plays Pam, an instructor of social ancestry and vitality, who is continuing with the owner of Bucky Camp. And there's another couple with something for the "Mad Max" characters. As nothing is too funny, you get just a fluffy semi-romance and some great dance routines. <br /> <br /> An attempt is made to create some suspense, slowly leading to a final contest, unless it is the first. film experience the result is never in doubt. And there is a story behind some Japanese entrepreneurs that Bucky wants to receive money, but it's nothing dramatic or comical. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
