Well, the name in the summary should say it all. FRED OLEN RAY - The modern king of low-budget movies, whether for TV or direct to video (I doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of the double-B movie drive-in and all). <BR> <BR> <BR> Creator of cult classics (?), Like Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island ... Well, I kind of like that. It's more fun (in an extravagant way, exaggerated and especially cheap) and if it's one thing, he's a pro - something you can not tell all the movie guys. <br /> <br /> But this movie here is among the weakest in its oevre. Insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain numb in a matter of minutes. If you are out of true F.O.R. kindness (or rather, meanness), look at the above mentioned, and generally your stuff from the 70s and 80s (I think he has lost some of his edge lately).
