Although supposedly autobiographical, this film shows very little insight into both the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat and fragmented characterization) and large-scale historical processes, and my hope of learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran remained unfulfilled. Instead, I found my sensibilities a bit dull as a succession of bearded Islamic villains replaced one another by insulting, torturing, or killing the irresponsibly victimized middle-class Iranian whose Western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the film clearly seeks). The understanding that the film seems to demonstrate is that of the mass media market, as it serves to nourish prevailing Western folkloric ideologies (ie, a "pleasure for all"). What redeemed the film from being simply annoying was its creative animation - genuinely minimalist images which, however, have always kept the screen rich, expressive and unequivocal - no small party for which I would give some stars.
