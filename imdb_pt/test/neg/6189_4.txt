The fun atmosphere and dialogue does not rescue this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Casbah of Algiers, while police try to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls in love with Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The movie is slow to start and never goes anywhere. Remembering Casablanca in some ways, he is completely devoid of any greater subject than the man sought by seducing a good woman. It's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of Boyer arrogant among his idiot cohorts and Boyer courting Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I did not care about Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was totally non-existent. <br /> <br /> Stock 1930's actors come across the warm plot as Boyer's henchmen - guys who clearly do not belong to Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is Boyer's envious and uncontrolled girlfriend. His shameless womanizer in front of her does not bode well for any future he may have with Lamarr. <br /> <br /> Especially bad is a long sequence in which a subordinate comes to tell Boyer how another henchman was captured. It sounds exciting ... pity we did not see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticclimatic and seems to be remarkable just because it's not a happy Hollywood ending; That does not stop him from being a fool.
