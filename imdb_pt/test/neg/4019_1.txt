ROAD HOUSE from 20th Century Fox in 1948) is not just a silly noir, but it is an absolute implausible bore of a movie. Filled with unconvincing cardboard characters, it was written in a gentle way by Edward Chodorov, who also produced and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco, from whom much more could be expected. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the lead role! Lupine, a woman who was capable of exhaling both sexual appeal and blood orange, is here under the illusion that it is Rita Hayworth playing a sexy torch singer. Bonito Cornel Wilde as his lover is as wood as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm, that role is little more than a little piece. So we have Richard Widmark, who has the most ridiculously written part of the picture! When we see him for the first time he is a good O.K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. So suddenly - and for reasons that are not clear enough - he becomes incredibly jealous of his manager (Wilde) when he tells him that he is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her, but - 1) He never proposed to her - 2) They never had a relationship (they have nothing that resembles a love scene together) and - 3) without telling anyone (including Lupino)) obtained a marriage license. Wow!! So how Widmark went to achieve something like marital bliss with Lupino after such "dating" is the quess of anyone. There is? Well, when Widmark undoes anyway, the movie is too sorry to say. From here, the Widmark character becomes unintentionally comical! His loss of marbles so early in the process is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally crosses the threshold, gets completely unbalanced and with a few shots from Tommy Udo, he ridiculously shoots poor Cornel Wilde before biting off the dust. <br /> <br /> And if that is not enough, from a movie for you - the image is also spoiled with a constant use of studio sets and interior exteriors. There is not a single outdoor shot throughout the movie! Added to that - 95% of the movie happens at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press book and a photo gallery, the extras also include a "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox" featurette. Whatever motivated this documentary is beyond me! As far as I know, they've never been together before in a movie on Fox or anywhere! However, this featurette is hosted by such heavy know-allers as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who surprisingly praise this exhausting and indecisive affair. All I can say then must be me, I guess. But "Road House" until now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I'm concerned it should have stayed that way. Fox would do better if they emitted DVDs from above and so far, Widse's elusive films like "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
