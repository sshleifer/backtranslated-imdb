In the first forty minutes, Luna is a real pleasure to watch. The characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and the places are beautiful to see. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers that her son Matthew Barry is using heroin and the movie begins to unravel and then becomes completely laughable in his illness. <br /> <br /> Clayburgh asks him why and when he started using the drug and she or the public. ever get a direct response, which would be a little helpful. He mentions not caring about anything, but that's not right, because we see clearly in the startling startling scenes that he has a keen interest in his mother's singing, baseball, sex and apparently cared enough to refuse marijuana. This movie is for people who think that the junior gets into heavy drugs because the mother and father were workaholics who missed their piano recital. I think a drug as dangerous and emotionally volatile as heroin was chosen as a sort of intellectual catalyst for the later scenes of incest. There is a lot of discussion about the mother's love for her son, but it's really about Bernardo Bertolucci being pretentious. Luna would have been great as a little family drama. How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more worried about the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this movie than anything his character was going through. ** outside of ****
