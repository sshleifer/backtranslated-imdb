When I was young, I would wake up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons, but to connect the local channel to what was called "Kung Fu Theater." It was not as if these films were works of art. It was not as if all these films were from China, Japan, Korea, or any country in particular; if the story had anything to do with the fight? be fencing or fisticuffs ?? and if the fight did not resemble much in any American gym class, then that was good enough. It was not like they were really good. They were great action movies with incredibly super-dramatic songs, where the hero reaped his revenge against a number of bad guys, and then the credits would roll. <br /> <br /> "Sword in the Moon" is very much like these films of my youth, no doubt a little themed backlash, given a welcome touch to muddy the characters enough to become ever harder to distinguish the bad from the good. <br /> <br /> Yun (Cho Jae Hyun)) is known throughout the kingdom as "the human butcher". He kills swiftly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun dynasty, the chief bodyguard of an emperor who spared his life and the lives of his men in return for his service. However, an equally merciless rebel and his amiable helper appear in the field and begin to kill imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes a personal discovery when he discovers that the two rebels are Choi (a friend of his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Sword" does not have much to distinguish itself from other action films. Some stunning cinematographies are almost totally wasted on poor quality editions, with parts of the film being so vaguely difficult to believe that what inevitably made the film was what one intended. As the atmosphere and history tend to gravitate toward a gloomy mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the endless parade of flashbacks, as each of the main characters receives a healthy story arc. What should have been a fast and easy action movie is overwhelmed by too much personal baggage, and the movie suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie marks Korea's first foray into the world of art action pieces over the likes of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Next time, I strongly suggest that producers continue with a bit more 'martial' and a little less 'art'.
