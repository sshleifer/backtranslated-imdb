"No one really knows how the Power came to be." Not even the Book of Darnation recorded its beginning, but those who dominated it were always hunted. "The families of Ipswich formed a Pact of Silence? suddenly we see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, maybe? Well, I do not know which of these they belong to, but one thing is certain: the descendants of Salem are a boyband. Can you differentiate them? I could not. If you can tell me which is which, I would appreciate it very much. These boy band boys look so damn alike ?! Serious now. Is it a horror movie or a teen movie? It is sad that the horror genre (finally, weak) has been kidnapped by teenagers. And this is one of the youngest I've seen so far. The film is visually solid, but the cast is so bland, the acting is so horrible, it was an essay ending the film. As bad as the cast was (after all, boy bands and fashion models are rarely good actors) the absolute "highlight" in this respect was the guy who plays the villain, Sebastian Stan. This guy is exaggerating well with the worst in movie history. I've rarely seen anyone make such annoying and silly grimaces in a short time. What's worse, he has the most childish face of all the boys' faces in the cast of the entire cast. I mean, it's a joke.
