As in the previous two Mad Max films, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is no exception to the violence and the strange plot. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he must destroy the master blaster and take the children to "tomorrow to earth tomorrow". This is usually a distorted film with references Peter Pan and Tina Turner, methane pigs and strange characters. I was very bored watching all this, and it did not offer me anything. I did not feel inspired after watching this movie; The only decent thing about this movie were the extremely strange characters who were chosen in various ways throughout the film. It's very strange for me and it was very annoying.
