I liked most of this movie. As other reviews have mentioned that has a good cast, the plot is quite interesting. All in all it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> But the end, I feel, is completely unsuccessful, left me perplexed. Yes, you expect people to cross and intersect in this kind of movie, but crossing it by four? Well, if it's justified by the plot, why not? <br /> <br /> But that's the bad part, there's no need for it. After a certain point everything is planning with no meaning. (here comes the SPOILER). After the airport scene Enrico and his accomplices already have the money. I could not understand the need for the rest of the coup. Is it all necessary to just rub Federico's nose in the fact that he has been deceived? I do not buy. <br /> <br /> So 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the movie and 2 of 10 for the finale.
