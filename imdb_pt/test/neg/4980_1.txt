I was browsing through the movies on demand and I saw Underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes, so I decided to watch it. I was not expecting much, but it exceeded my expectations of being horrible. Everything about the movie was worthy of pity. The dialogue was atrocious, including many terrible puns. The jokes were terrible too. I saw myself screaming and taking off the screen from my television while I was suffering from this crap. It hit its target audience very well, but I do not see how anyone else would like this movie. This made me very angry and I almost cried because of everything that this movie had of bad for him. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this movie was to give it a 1/10 after watching it. I beg you to avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for kids, but there is nothing nice about it at all.
