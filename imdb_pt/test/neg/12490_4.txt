Dear Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know in what capacity I am writing this letter to you. I am a fan of Amitabh Bachchan who never said how much he finished, having sat in his act of chasing the stick in Jaadugar. I also demand an important designation in The Godfather fan club, having watched the Coppola classic more often than you delivered flops from your Factory. And, of course, I have been a great admirer of you from the moment you had Nagarjuna wrapping the current cycle around your fingers in Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced Sarkar and called your opinion about Godfather, all you wanted to know was the date the first look would be released, the Sunday when the promos would air on Friday the film would be released. It was pure satisfaction at work to know that you, not someone hovering between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam, took on the task of re-creating the pages of Puzo on the big screen of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> / Your cast could not have been you anymore? working for the first time with the legend, climbing Abhishek as his screen child, giving Kay Kay a role he deserved for years, bringing back forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar, and choosing complete non-actors such as Katrina and Tanishaa for join the list ?? Before July 1, you made Sarkar the most anticipated movie of all the monsters that worshiped Bachchan. <br /> <br /> Initial credits fueled the hope that his impressive sepia promises on television would have been lit. But now, you label Sarkar your tribute to the godfather instead of the word "inspired" you've been wearing all the time. You probably do not want the two creations to be compared, but when the medium is the same, then a Kaante would be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a City On Fire. <br /> <br /> In addition, when your first and last sequence? the heart of any script treatment? are all about establishing and transferring power, you can not keep the Nagares and Corleones apart, even if you replace the American mafia movements by the Maharashtrian political power. <br /> <br /> But did you misunderstand Varma? You wanted to show Amitabh on your avatar from the 70's, as if it were crumpled by Salim-Javed pens. You wanted him to look out for more than life. You wanted it to be your own brand. So how could you steal your voice in the name of silence? How could you keep it rooted in your chair in search of interesting camera angles? How could you leave him without his voice and stature, the two things that made his B so great? Coppola's Godfather cameraman, Gordon Willis, masked Brando's eyes throughout the film because he did not have the power to match that hoarse, crawly voice or that sudden snapping of his fingers. But you tried to repeat the Malik act of your own company. But is not Bachchan Ajay Devgan? its strength is not in the stagnant gaze and in the stifling silence. You made the man look like a comatose patient, who every once in a while is reminded to look at the tip cards and talk to the predictable one-liners. For this, Agneepath is there, on a certain Saturday. <br /> <br /> What Bachchan fan would watch Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder from under his nose in the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? What amitabh aficionado would see him focus on gliding and carambola, in a movie that talks about power with a capital P in the promos? We can not deal so much with the name of restraint and euphemism! You do not even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he finds out that his son wanted to kill him. Give me the old-school camera-only-on-Bachchan style on any Saturday. Congratulations to you, of course, for making an actor from Abhishek, first in Naach and now in Sarkar. You also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run as well as his father. Even in the short prison sequence, you really get the Bachchans out of the text, an opportunity that Shaad lost in Bunty Aur Babli. We hope the film may have been more of a father-son story than a chaotic conflict between character-driven caricatures that pop up like advertising windows on the internet. <br /> <br /> You also leave the women more in the script that Puzo and Coppola did, and again, you deserve all Brownie points by squeezing them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle, kind Tanishaa as the girl lovelorn, Katrina a revelation as confused lover of Abhishek and the silence of Rukhsar speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> But sub-plots not a classic remake. When your free-flowing camera tries to make each frame look annoying and its high background score irks incessantly, we keep being reminded that we're in a Factory. Well, it may not be a score of Nino Rota, but Sarkar certainly deserved better than the chants of Govinda, Govinda, and unnecessary flute interludes. Mr. Varma, some of your factory directors tell me that you are involved in every project, from overseeing the shooting schedules to supervising editing sessions. Perhaps, in the midst of all the various storyboards, the cry of Bhiku Matre is being silenced by the silence of Subhash Nagare. You may need to put the blinds in the factory and work on a single home product. Otherwise, your products would remain products, to use and play, not treasure. And fans of movies like me, for which there are no hits and failures, just a good movie, prefer to choose a movie without factory finishing on any given Saturday.
