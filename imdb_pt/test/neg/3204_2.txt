(SMALL SPOILERS) I just bought the DVD of that movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I could not believe what had happened. In the first 3 movies, the creatures at least had a sense of humor (especially the third movie), but not only did the creatures almost never make an appearance, they were not funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit the story started well. After an hour, I remembered that the Critters movies were always too short. So I thought to myself, "Where the $ ^% # $ are the bugs?!?!" They were evil in this movie! If that did not make me crazy enough, the boy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie "killed the ship" and he knew the bugs were still on board! In the first film the Brown family was scared of their minds. But here, Ethan did not care! It was as if the creatures were not even a threat! <br /> <br /> Now what I'm about to say next can ruin the ending, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film, in the end, they had to face the giant bug for a final battle. In the second, there was the big bug ball. In the third movie, the creature with its fave burned made a spindash (of Sonic the Hedgehog) and was going to attack the little boy. But at the end of the room (which is what made me angrier), the bald animal approaches Ethan, and Ethan kills him as if it were nothing. <br /> <br /> Now, something I really do not know. Understand was what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. So, after 50 years, he's evil. That was very disappointing. Not only that, but was not he a faceless bounty hunter? Why was he still "Johnny Steele?" Besides, he seemed to have a different personality. He looked much smarter and not as monotonous as the first two. Being someone who really liked the first two pet movies, and loved the third one, I gave Critters 4 to 2/10
