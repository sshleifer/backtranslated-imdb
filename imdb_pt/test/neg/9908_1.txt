What I hate most about this crap is the arrogant attitude of filmmakers and network executives who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so unworthy, so tasteless that it deserves such a cons. There is inherent entertainment that is watching disaster movies and, with the magic of CGI's current effects, artists are given powerful tools to exploit what was previously denied them. With this fascination we sit down to watch some chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos we saw was in the announcements released in next Wednesday's episode. What a disappointment! But wait, there was even a bigger one. The script itself was the biggest mess! And then there was the direction and sagging acting for all involved in this turkey. But we knew that before, right? We knew that the effects alone did not make an entertainment, but even so the network bozos that made this TV movie did not care about it because in their mantra the eternal line "never underestimates how stupid the audience is." These guys really should live by that motto, and I'm so sick of it. No wonder the public has abandoned the US drama en masse and set up their camp on reality shows. at least in these programs, no one is trying to make it look different than it is: intellectual pornography. Well, category 6 is worse than that, because it assumes being different and "original." Yes, this was a disaster movie alright, but the disasters are not what they announced!
