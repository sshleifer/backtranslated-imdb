True, no one really expects anything from sequels. But even with this low standard, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially an anthology film, this fourth installment of the Hellraiser saga attempts to be a story of origins and a conclusion to the whole series at the same time. Time. An ambitious idea. But none of the actors gets enough time to do anything with their characters and the rookie director Yagher has abandoned the film, instead of yielding to studio interference. The result is a pile of mediocrity that even the fanboys have trouble defending. Unless you're a fan of "Alan Smithee", avoid that one.
