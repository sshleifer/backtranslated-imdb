I hate being too critical, but this really was bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just wish there was more talent scattered among them. I liked the overall storyline, but there was a lot of 'trying' and not enough 'doing' with regard to quality acting. <br /> <br /> My favorite character out of the whole thing was a bald cop. It reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (Jeremy Roberts, I believe) of Start Trek 6: Undiscovered Country. Simply, without the hair. <br /> <br /> If you have the Hollywood Video MVP program and are really trying to get the value of your money, then do it with one of the three MVP movies you choose. It's worth a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The only most impressive special effect in the whole show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's rifle shot. I suppose this leaves you a bit on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
