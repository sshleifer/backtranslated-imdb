This sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among Harold Lloyd's best films. Gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. The saccharine melodrama is abundant. The installation takes forever, as Lloyd, the unconventional but impossibly gentle country doctor, makes his rounds, bringing some sunlight into the lives of children, the elderly, and puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh 4/10
