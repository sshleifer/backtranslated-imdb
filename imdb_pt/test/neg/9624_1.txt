This movie is really really bad, it's not very well done and it's an attempt to lack luster at something, but I'm not sure what. I watched and was very disappointed. He promised a lot, but did not deliver anything. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the song, if you can call it that, is terrible. There are, of course, all creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly made that they do not appear to be anything but a third-rate movie. It's a shame that more attention could not have been dedicated to special effects, not at all and end up a whole movie that I agree, but in a film that is based around them, is a very important factor. For me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.
