This movie was extremely annoying. I just laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about that child who is chosen all the time by his classmates. When he wanders the streets looking for old ladies to help, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the business of pimps, Lil 'Pimp must throw it into his hands. <br /> <br /> The animation is not very good at this. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I'm sure it was. It's not a drug, it's just the kind of intermittent animation that people have gotten used to in recent years. The humor in it is not very good, I do not find it funny.
