I only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings. It totally sucks! I can not imagine how anyone would think this is a good movie - even an OK movie. None of the characters had ANY redeeming QUALITY of any kind. To varying degrees, each was selfish and malicious - or abused and damaged people who had no idea of ​​the Christmas spirit (when that happens!) I know the Canadians and I like them - but I can not think I think this is a good movie. I prefer a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. A colossal waste of time and money. Do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that "worth watching". This person would probably like to have a dentist puncturing their teeth without anesthesia as well. I do not want to be impolite, but for my life I can not imagine what this person was thinking. Unless they had ulterior motives. Maybe he / she was the director or the producer. If so, I would ask them to give me back my money. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece of drek - or rent something (anything!) Plus. I'm running out of good reasons NOT to rent this movie. If I were Canadian, I would have ASHAMED which should be a favorite Canadian movie. If so, I would say that those who think so are definitely in need of large amounts of powerful drugs. YECK!
