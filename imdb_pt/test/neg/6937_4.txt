In a sense, I kind of liked this movie because of a positive, irrational atmosphere it kind of conveys. I had a problem with one aspect of the plot, but more on that later. First, the characters were a bit silly and one-dimensional. The 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. The basic plot was OK (fairly simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or objectionable. The main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs - a beautiful element of fantasy to have. However, they had a minimal presence in the film. <br /> <br /> Other than that, the film kept pace and did not get bogged down anywhere. I liked that about the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot had to do with the idea of ​​"stealing." I think this movie may not have been thought enough - something is wrong, especially if this is a children's movie. I'll keep the next abstract sentence to not be a spoiler (skip if you're worried). The 'good guys' do some theft and they do not have the same information the public has - so it's just stealing and that's a bad thing for a kid's movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you have children, because of a questionable plot aspect I would consider going through. However, this whole movie is pretty low anyway, so it may not matter. Pass this if you have other interesting options.
