Early 1950s Sci-Fi directed by Lesley Selander. Special effects, of course, are very primitive, but very good compared to what else was there. Dual drive-in movie feature rate; still interesting enough to watch. Two prominent men, Arthur Franz, brilliant young scientist Dr. Jim Barker and ground reporter Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell) join a manned flight to Mars by Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston), another scientist and two other space specialists ( Richard Gaines and John Litel). As they land on the Red Planet, space travelers find inhabitants who look friendly and mentally advanced. In fact, the Martians are led by Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the idea of ​​conquering Earth to vitalize their civilization. There is a handsome Martian (Maruerite Chapman) that Dr. Barker intends to resume on his return trip. She is the redeemable element of the film.
