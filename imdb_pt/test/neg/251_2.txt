This movie should have been announced as three movie summaries linked together to form a full feature film (including many shots of people walking slowly down dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this film is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec movies told by the main character. The current movie does not start until the thing is almost over. I must say that the interpretation of the part of the staff is rather hilarious. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. The "robot" of the bat consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse wrapped in a lead robot body. As Tom Servo said: "He's not that impressive, he does not even have knees!" That, and takes the robot about an hour just to cross the room. But once he catches you, look out! It will disintegrate it with a touch (powered by radio? Plah-ease!). <br /> <br /> This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Otherwise, you're just a glutton for abuse.
