During filming, Vanessa Redgrave was taking mogadon? It was as if she were reading of self-care. I saw more life in a wooden spoon. Or maybe all this was part of the character? whatever it was, it was very very annoying, I kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry it. I read the book a long time ago and did not like it much except that Septimus's downfall into madness was very well done - but I do not think Rupert Graves showed it so well, his acting was all on the surface. The connection between her life and that of Clarissa is not very well done either, but I suspect the attempt is to show the sacrifice the soldiers made to allow people like Clarissa to continue their insipid lives. The movie is very bitty and has no real drive for it. I hated that.
