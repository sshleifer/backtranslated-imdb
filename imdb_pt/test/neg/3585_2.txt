Egads. <br /> <br /> I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I'm not so sure anymore, Willy gives Keannu a strong competition with his performance "I'm made of plaster" in this film. <br /> <br /> Combine this with the fact that there is almost no plot, and not a single friendly character, and it is very difficult to recommend this turkey. <br /> <br /> Natasha tries her best, but even Julia Roberts could not save this movie from obscurity. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless it's too late and there's nothing left. -Oh heck, in that case, just read a book.
