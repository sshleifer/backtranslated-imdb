I love old "monster movies" for the sheer value of the camp. This does not disappoint if you find this kind of fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is shitty 1950. You get used to it when you've seen enough of it ... the dialogue is very silly and, finally, forgettable. You're there just for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> The "science" in this movie is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly bird that can handle antimatter ... with intent to wreak havoc and eat people ... an alien who came to Earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the movie (which do not have the bird in them) include "scientists" who explain what is happening. Much has been said about the ridiculous marionette of birds. It looks like a new little bird ... balding and ugly with bristly feathers. He even looks hungry and angry. However, the bird scared the crap of my three-year-old who had great nightmares of scary birds for the night. It's a little scary. <br /> <br /> I was very sad at the scene in which they throw the egg. (Somehow, the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
