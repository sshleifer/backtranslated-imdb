This is just the fourth effort I've seen from this director (whom I met and found quite brilliant in the Italian retrospective of the 2004 Venice Film Festival) and also possibly the worst. As was the case with the BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is an excellent example of the end of the Euro-Worship era - primordial because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen by then! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we have a plot spinning around - I'm not kidding, folks - a killer phone! Beautiful but bland Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - is a model who has apparently just finished a case; she's still waiting for her architect lover to call her back, but every time the phone rings, all she gets is static, accompanied by voices from the beyond (or some crap). She befriends a new tenant in her building who conveniently knows an authority in paranormal activity (William Berger) - who amusedly explains that the negative energy that is triggered, say, during family arguments can manifest itself through appliances in a deadly force (I swear I'm not making this up!)! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... er ... the highlights of the film are: the grumpy barman whose dark place heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain of events can only be broken by having Lewis again in his rhythms, EXTERMINATING THE ANGEL (1962) - style !, the wide variety of absurd-looking phones on display, the apparatus of the heroine's photographer photographer sneaking into her before death, the sarcastic cop who greets Lewis ("And what's the toaster, I wonder?"), the possible rapist killed by a flurry of coins firing out of a telephone booth, and Berger's own bloody death (with the phone affecting the pacemaker with which it is docked and causing the doctor's heart to explode!) The movie's climax is quite confusing and apparently it finally sees all the "lost souls" dwelling in a pack of pigeons and flying through the window of the office " gone "(a bachelor party service!). For what it's worth, the score - no less than the former Goblin Claudio Simonetti - is quite effective, despite the inclusion of heavy metal numbers dated in the soundtrack.
