The main word that comes to mind when considering this movie is "dishonest." This is a low quality cinematographic biography of one of the most iconic artists of all time. The Plasterman deserved better. <br /> <br /> Before getting into the flesh of my thoughts about this biopic, I must say that there are two things that I found effective. The first was the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in scenes describing the first set of allegations of child sexual abuse. I feel that this contributed with a certain authenticity that was * severely absent in the rest of the film. Second, the sequel describing the dating of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I believe the marriage was a farce but, according to many reports, it was a relationship where there was care and affection between the two parties involved. This really happened in this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had chemistry decent enough to do that. These success points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror away from 1-star status. <br /> <br /> That said ... there was very little else here that worked. Very few actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, most notably those who played Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. In addition, the absence of Jackson's music was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they were not able to guarantee the rights to it, as this is an unauthorized production of low budget; it seems, however, that if you can not have the man's music in a movie about it, you can pack and go home because you are missing out on an extremely important part of your life story. /> <br /> The characterization of this Jackson movie bothered me a bit too. I will not argue that he was in trouble and may have been some potato chips short of a value meal, but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally handicapped. I do not believe that Jackson, known to have been a cunning businessman, would have been so naive about how the adult world works like it was meant to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the way this movie was written was nothing less than shameful. Many lines or dialogue exchanges were extremely cheesy, like Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" exchange, or nonsense, like Michael's "Blanket of Love" comments. Moreover, the writers do not exactly have the gift of subtlety. There was a lot of telegram of the upcoming events ("What could go wrong ??" types of lines) and extremely open pounding of themes and motifs in the film (if I had heard the word "believe" one more time ... ended up hurting the film as something that could be considered incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe when we get to a few years, or even a decade or three, taken from Jackson's death, someone can bring his story to life in a more deserving movie.At that time, we could have a better perspective on his life, and someone would be able to present a really thoughtful examination of who Michael Jackson really was and what he meant to the entertainment world.This very dubious kinematics was not this movie.
