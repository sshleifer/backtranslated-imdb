One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing popular culture of the 1970s, is that mass media - especially television - is generally about four years old from the underground media, especially music. Many people think that the "Woodstock Generation" remained important throughout the 1970s. Actually, it was all in Altamont in 1970. By 1972, "underground" rock or "counterculture" had moved to England and Led Zepplin, Black Sabbath and David Bowie, the first metal heads and so-called "glam-rockers", who were all "peace and love" - ​​no. Not even in a different dark vein was Charles Manson's "family." <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot for a television show (which, fortunately, has never been chosen by the networks) is trying to come to terms with a culture that was already as defunct as the flowers of yesterday. After a few years - when it was produced, the writer Carlino had already won recognition for the Mafia's tales of revenge. And the cultural references are all for "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). The song mentioned on the soundtrack is actually earlier, 1966/67 - in Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat, and Sly and the Family Stone blew that kind of folk-pop into oblivion. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a middle-class family that goes On the road in order to find hippies Wow, dude, madness, outasight, it's an amazing happening of a sack But politics is not worth anything - Vietnam - Somewhere in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This average (ie obsolete and empty) TV movie is only redeemed by the surprisingly mature performance of Jeff Bridges as the young student who convinces his parents and grandmother to "discover" (hippie) America. All the rest of the performances are standard TV by standard weather TV actors. The director uses a cinematography of good location, but, on the other hand, the film is a terrible way to spend 90 minutes. I knew everything was over when Sal Mineo comments on a young fugitive (who tells the other characters they are not really there): "She is a latent existentialist." Wow, far, groovy. <br /> <br /> A couple of extra points for being 'so bad is funny', but if you do not mind the 70's TV version of the '60s, stay away.
