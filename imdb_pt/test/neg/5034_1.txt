Well, its ten years have passed since this movie was released and the sands of time have not improved at all, again as the other comments have made Australian filmmakers have a bit more drama than middle class aussies walking by beautiful places with not much in the era of dialogue. The middle class is neither funny nor rich. There is also a mish mash cast. Because a young woman is going to marry a man old enough to be her father, that escapes me. It's a shame about this movie, it seems like a wonderful place to spend the holidays. Anyway it's an hour and thirty minutes of my life I will never be able to return. short lives to watch this movie.
