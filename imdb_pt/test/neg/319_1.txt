If you are in search of a masochistic emotion, rent this movie and show it to a group of sober friends. This film is only plain lame, but not completely worthless. Breasts are cool, and there's a victim's death that's so damn funny. Other than that, this is direct junk. But it's still better than "Grim" or "Spookies"
