I find it terribly ironic that Hollywood's "left wing" continues to protect itself by making those lukewarm movies that do not condemn or embrace the war on terror. <br /> <br /> If you are a 60's survivor and a committed pacifist, and you're waiting for a total condemnation of the war, such as BORN IN THE ROOM OF JULY, or ALL QUIET IN THE WEST FRONT, this movie will really look like a rip off. None of these soldiers really question this war, or any war or idea of ​​war. They only complain about having to do another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're an American patriot who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really look like a rip off. . None of these soldiers love America or even love the service. The way they sulk and sulk makes them get closer to suburban teens than hard-faced, blue-collar guys. IT'S NOT WE WERE SOLDIERS, AND NOT IWO JIMA SANDRA. It's not even a stupid action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe can not take this kind of film so completely. Although he is devastatingly sexy, in a difficult trade, in the somewhat bisexual male toilet, it is hard to imagine him as a slow-talking Texan boy who wants to stand up and be counted. This is not a sergeant. Croft in Mailer THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. He is more like Joel in OTHER VOICES than Truman Capote, OTHER ROOMS. He can not sell you the idea that he was in combat and did his part, OR that he wants his wife and wants her now. He fails on the battlefield and in the scenes of the room, seeming to prefer to bow and attack from behind.
