The title of this review summarizes how I feel about this movie. I can not imagine what audience there would be for this thing, were it not for the 1980s horror fanatic who simply has to see - all - of that era. Otherwise, do not waste time on it. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to most such films: something terrible happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, who inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go in a murderous fury. I was there, I did it. Truth be told, none of these 80's slashers were known for their originality, so I can not see the point in playing the movie simply because of that. <br /> <br /> But where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. I saw some very scary horror movies from the 1980s that had much smaller budgets than that. This just can not create any real suspense. The director throws some beautiful camera angles and some semiprofessional directional touches here and there, but they do not mean a thing if you're not scared. The blood is also very tame, so anyone who watches these things with intent to see some cool makeup effects from the '80s will be sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film succeeds in shocking things over time. Honestly, the key ingredient to any slasher is the rhythm - you have to keep things moving fast and keep the murder pieces at regular intervals because, let's face it, we do not watch these things for great characterization and stellar plots. But the pace, whether because of the script or the editor, is totally wrong. The murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long scenes (no doubt intended to build "character") that serve only to annoy him and leave him praying for the next death (which, as I said, usually does not is so well executed anyway. <br /> <br /> As for the killer, do not expect anything original or even remotely frightening. <br /> <br /> Does he (or she?) wear a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his primary weapon I bet the writer just got wet thinking that he invented an original "cool" weapon, but the idea is impractical and silly.There is also not much emphasis on the "whodunnit" nature of the movie, as if they had forgotten or did not mind putting anything into the mix to throw us out. <br /> <br /> I got the sense that the people behind it were trying to do something decent and respectable, and sometimes it shows that his intentions were probably a bit m genuine with regard to making a quality movie as opposed to countless other imitators slutshers of the time. the attempt fails most of the time. There is, however, a very good acting (at least for this type of film) There is attempted characterization, but none of this ends up meaning anything in the end, so ... It's a waste. <br /> <br /> Here, all you can do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences seem not to come soon enough. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you're really into those old 80's slashers, by all means, check it out, just to say you've seen it. There is a complete in all of us. But do not expect to be surprised or anything. What we have here is a very light horror film that leaves no real impression.
