My girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case too) ... so I rented it. So I saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 Oscars. GREAT! this should be a good drama. This movie had a lot of potential ... the direction and pace of it all went very well. But as soon as the film ended, I could not help but wonder if this story really would be worth making a movie. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was EXTREMELY annoying, I just could not tolerate her character. Warren Beatty was excellent in the film in terms of acting but again I found it difficult to have sympathy for his character ... he ended up coming essentially like an idiot, evil loser of a gangster ... who had no place in 'life' in Firstly, how did he come in with the likes of Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano anyway? This movie just left me with a tasteless but uncomfortable feeling ... what was the big problem with this movie? I just did not feel one I'm guessing that's how Siegel really was ... but it was a bit of it.It does not seem like a lot of real story here.My basic assessment <br /> <br /> "A hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of ​​'Las Vegas' .... but his failed attempt at the casino he builds together with having no regard for the money of their mafia bosses causes him to be killed. "<br /> <br /> What else is there besides? <br /> <br /> I just did not see the big problem with that, and it was a big disappointment.There must not have been too many movies to come out in 1991, as this was nominated for 10 Oscars is beyond me (although the two won is justifiable) 1.5 / 4 stars.
