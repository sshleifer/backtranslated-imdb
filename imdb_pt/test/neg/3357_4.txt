Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram stating that her father may be in trouble. Sheba, a private investigator and former police officer, is going to help her father. But someone will stop at nothing to get the father out of business. An attempt to show off his muscle goes awry and Sheba's father is shot dead in cold blood. These guys have been messing with the wrong woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best I can do is Pam Grier Lite with a very bad acting. For a Pam Grier movie, Sheba Baby is incredibly tame. It's not nearly as violent as some of his previous films. Gone are the exaggerated images of Pam putting a small revolver or razor blades in her afro. The pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his team can not handle the villains Pam has faced in his previous films. It is strictly by-the-numbers and almost has a feeling of made for the TV. As for the poor performance, the thugs with which Pam comes across are sounds as unnatural in their delivery as I have seen. As a result, characters like Pilot are not as menacing as they should or need for the movie to work. <br /> <br /> That's not to say that there are no moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I did not like (Pam in a neoprene outfit and Pam brandishing a firearm), is that when compared to other movies Pam, like Coffy, Foxy Brown and even Foster, the movie fails. <br /> <br /> Final remark - Maybe I'm just more sensitive to these things after 9/11, but I do not remember a time, even back in the '70s, when you could carry a suitcase full of guns in one airplane. When Sheba flies to help her father, she has an arsenal packed into her luggage!
