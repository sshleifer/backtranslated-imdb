RAT RACE commercials made it seem like a lot of youth for me to enjoy, but as my boyfriend loves this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally gave in and watched it tonight. I make him watch David Lynch movies and all sorts of obscure indie things (I recently forced URBANIA on him), so I felt I owed him an innocuous Hollywood product. <br /> <br /> I did not want to hurt your feelings, so I saved my bitch for you. Yes, RACE RACE has its moments, but a lot of it irritated me. Let's start at the beginning. RAT RACE was marketed as a "family movie," so I was a little surprised to discover that the first scene revolved around a porn movie. (I can hear it now: "Mama, what does AFRO WHORES mean?") This scene has no purpose in this film other than shoving some shit into a PG-13 movie. <br /> <br /> And while we're still in the casino segments, it's very convenient that all the characters have played in the same period the slot machines that contained the gold coins. What would have happened if they had not? Would those millionaire players just sit and wait? And how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place? <br /> <br /> But I'm working out a plot that is necessary for the movie to exist, so I'll continue. About Whoopi and his long-lost daughter: they are meeting for the first time, but throughout their ordeal they do not argue with each other about themselves. Why make their relationship so presumably complicated? Could they not have been, say, mother and daughter on vacation together? Why the business about an adoption for a long time? And why portray her daughter as a difficult career woman driving chained to her cell phone who never needs to contact her business again? Did the script eventually forget about this subplot and character trait? <br /> <br /> This illustrates the main weakness of this film - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; It is exhausting when everyone is equally cranky and without traces of identification. And another thing - the events are not plausible. Oh, of course, the characters can do some quirky things, but the characters have to be believable. Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example. Frank Drebin has some very exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, theoretically, possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of funny, which makes all the difference.) A RAT RACE character defying natural laws by jumping on a high-speed train destroys whatever plausibility the film may have; clearly they are not real people, so why should I care about them? <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with RAT RACE is moral. The characters get their modes of transportation almost entirely for stealing. I know, I know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions did not bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there are many law breaks in RAT RACE, and that bothers me now. And I will not delve into the entire sabotage sequence at the airport, except to wonder if the writers did not consider the real implications of such an action; Was this scene funny before September 11? <br /> <br /> I'm going to skip the nasty things about the heart, the drugging of the family and the Nazis (whose accumulation and reward worked best in an episode of "Seinfeld"). "), and moving on to complain about the acting, Rowan Atkinson started annoying and ended up unbearable, I do not know when I liked less of a comic character and the three Oscar winners need new agents.Whoopi did better, but she I did not have much to work with (I loved the copper perm and the purple lipstick) Kathy Bates's part was raucous but mercifully brief, Cuba was ... oh, man, Cuba, baby, please shoot your agent! INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is his third strike (be happy I did not see PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to return his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor to 97 (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR). stature has nothing to do by running naked through the desert and being examined by a Lucille Ball transvestite imitator.You still read the scripts of your movies, or are you picking up a bag and pulling your next project randomly? > There are other small points that bothers me am (how does Grisham and the prostitute get to the serve so fast?), but basically RACE RACE equals little more than their basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a somewhat lower end of the expected and inexplicable. Do they give money to charity? What kind of ending is this?!? Yes, it is the "noble" thing to do. No matter the likelihood of Smash Mouth cross-promotion / licensing prostitutes (they never say no to sell?) Doing a charity show in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing? Yes, they say that it is the journey, not the destination, that makes a trip worthwhile, but there is no journey without destination. If ever there was an example of a "happy ending wrong," that would be it. What a final bummer for a movie that despite my nitpicking here, I liked parts of it (I confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the Lucy stuff along with the character with the piercing on the tongue - at first I thought your the discourse maddened me, but he grew to be my favorite). <br /> <br /> But as far as my boyfriend knows, I found RAT RACE quite funny and charming. <br /> <br />
