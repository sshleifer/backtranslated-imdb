"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid movie by the popular comic Carrot Top (also seen in 1-800-COLLECT commercials). He plays a surfing inventor who comes across a man who has a flat tire. Top helps him and a few days later discovers that the guy died and gave his company to the comedian. Even if someone else was in the role of Carrot Top, it still would have been bad. The jokes (which are constantly manipulated) are terrible and the idea of ​​a "romantic twist" should have been discarded. DO NOT WATCH !!!
