La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! as it was called in the version I saw, begins when several passengers board a long-distance train. Three aggressive idiots, Dave, Phil and Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) and it is clear that they are there to cause problems, as they verbally intimidate and abuse other passengers and staff. While the swift train becomes unpleasant when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his companions decide to keep the whole hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette and not really much else . happens to be part of some hero cop and his prisoner who plan to save the day. It really is this ... This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi and is a complete and complete crap from beginning to end. George Eastman's script as Luigi Montefiori could easily be described as a very annoying film as much as a horror / suspense. It's tediously slow, it's 35 minutes before anything, even remotely sleazy happens and as a whole, the movie lacks the kind of exploration elements that Italian sleaze and horror was delivering at the time. The film can be compared to another Italian production, infinitely better The House at the Edge of the Park (1980) made the same year, is a very broad comparison, although like everything that made the House at the Edge of the Park, the notorious film that is absent from La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no bleeding, almost no violence, there are only a few rape, the story has no twists and it's incredibly boring to watch. The Italian sleaze and horror of the late 70's and early 80's are not known for their strong story lines or great scripts, but this film really shaves the underside of the barrel in every respect. The character is horrible, the movie spends the first 30 minutes building them and giving some insight into why they are on the train, but this is all quickly forgotten and comes to absolutely nothing. I hated the lame ending too and I do not know if I missed anything, but was there some kind of reasonable explanation given that these three Lamebrains hijacked a train? I do not think there was, was there? I'm sorry, but because your rage of a prostitute is not enough reason, certainly the filmmakers could have invented something a little more substantial and interesting, if not more plausible. In my opinion, this movie stinks, it's as simple and straightforward as I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Director Baldi does a good job, to be fair he only has one aisle and some train compartments to work with so I'm going to cut a slack, having said that the film becomes very repetitive. There is no style and he films the sex scenes as a lousy pornographic movie with a romantic piano music. THERE IS NO ONE DROPPING BLOOD DROP IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, this is not a single drop. Forget anything or violence, because you will be very disappointed if you do, as I did. There are some rapes, but they are staged amateurishly and have zero impact, the unpleasant exploitation of saying I spit in your grave (1978) or The Last House on the Left (1972) is not here. <br /> Technically La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is OK and is very well done on what must have been a low budget, but the setup obviously helped keep the cost to a minimum. The acting is bad as usual, although since it was dubbed that the original performances were lost. Fans of Italian horror will recognize many of the voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a terrible movie, it's just my opinion, but I was bored to tears hoping that something would happen and when eventually I never felt cheated, I want those 80 minutes of my life return. This piece of crap is not even apt to grace the bargain of 99p VHS in their local Blockbuster, one to avoid.
