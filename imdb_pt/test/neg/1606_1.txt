The horror of this made for the TV movie was that it did not end with this one. This generated a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot / movie. Most of the films on various professions have some kind of realism to them and of course are lively to make it exciting. There was none of that. If the intention was to do in "Camp", then he succeeded. He resurfaced in the Cape a few years ago and failed again. The performance of Richard Jaeckels as the Master Chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film. Campier than the 1960s Batman series.
