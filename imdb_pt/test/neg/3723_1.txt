NOTICE! SPOILER! This movie sucks. It's not entertainment. I have no words to describe the disgust I felt in the end. <br /> <br /> This is a badly made movie about the scum of society. Throughout the movie I've been hoping it would get better. This did not happened. Instead, things get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie as bad as that, I always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. In this case, it was impossible. I have nothing good to say about it. How bad did this happen? Well, here's an example: In the end Dan Akroyd suffocates and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! This is not entertainment!
