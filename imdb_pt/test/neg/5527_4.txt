The problem with making such a film, however, is that the final, crème-de-la-crème of the film, the battle between the two poisoned ships, must be well done. Regrettably, this scene at Ironclads is obviously made completely with small model ships in a huge tub. There is no tension, little explanation of what exactly is going on, and what the deadlock schedule is. <br /> <br /> The film takes some liberties with the story around, as all true stories do when converted. for a movie, as the Union traitor and most notably that of Betty Stuart (Madsen), a beauty from Virginia. <br /> <br /> Turns out to make a possibly decent movie involving an interesting story about iron men to preach. on the evils of slavery. It was out of place in this historical drama and was a cheap maneuver to attract viewers. It only managed to diminish the positive aspects about the film.
