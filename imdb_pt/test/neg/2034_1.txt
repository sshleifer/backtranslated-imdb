It's the early morning of our discontent, and some of my friends and I just watched "The Wind". Truly a disaster movie. Not in the sense of forces of nature wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting population, but a horrible movie wreaking havoc on an unsuspecting audience. To give you an indication of how frustrating it was to watch this particular bomb, I'll give you an example quoted during my first painful consultation. If given the option to watch this movie for the second time and, let's say, boil, I'm afraid to say that the choice would not be immediate. But instead of simply complaining about "ad film" with bad wording, I'll be specific about why exactly my friends and I criticize that particular movie. To start with, I like low budget horror movies. I even like artistic and low budget horror movies. I liked "Cold Hearts", "Midnight Mass", "Jugular Wine", etc. Films that were ambitious and daring, even lacking production value, execution and even acting. Generally, an interesting premise, unusual camera technique or just one or two well done scenes will save a movie that is running a bit rough around the edges. With these caveats in mind, I would like to say conclusively that I hated "The Wind". <br /> <br /> The film was probably the most disappointing in the sense that it was incredibly frustrating to watch. From the actions of the main characters, to the flow (?) Of the plot, to the great omens suggested by the opening that finally aspired to dust (and did not even logically link to what happened in the rest of the film, and left the viewer, expecting something more, with a feeling of a lot of noise for nothing). The dialogue was weak, at best, with timber delivery and totally unrealistic. By that I mean that no one in any of the situations where the characters were reacted the way the characters did, or said the things they said the way they said it. There was an obvious lack of vision and direction that would have corrected this problem. <br /> <br /> Interaction and character development was lousy. Claire, the "sex goddess," just like the aggravating, passive-aggressive licks in the movie thought, was so evident in her manipulations that she might well have aimed a weapon against the characters. However, she was the highlight of the film. The other main characters (with the exception of Mick's Milfy Mom, who was not terrifying) are so indistinct that they may have been portrayed by the same actor. Let's see if I missed anything: bordering personality, co-submissive henchmen with deep feelings of confusion and sexual inadequacy, stimulated by puerile rage through artistic orchestrations of a bimbette of loose lips - suddenly and inhumanly - transformed into Caligari . No, I think that covers that. <br /> <br /> Lack of scope was also problematic. As those involved with the making of this film expect the casual viewer to discover that this was the beginning of the end of the world from this pentagon of amateur lust, unbelievable, poorly portrayed (well, what would you call it?) Which occurred largely in the forest in the middle of nowhere? There were no witnesses to the "atrocities" presented. There were no witnesses anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The credibility problems stemming from this lack of attention to detail were plentiful, even from the point where the plot begins to fall ill. Case-in-point: If that guy Bob took that route through the woods to get home from the gym, and here's the key, **** every day ****, there's a good chance that another person would have been around to see something at some point later, while the authors argued vehemently about the crime scene. One would think that with the murder of a young man in the forest, he said that the city would have been a bustle, the characters would have been questioned, etc. But instead, there was a witness in sight (with the exception of Earl the psychopathic wardrobe without internal monologue). We suggest that there be no witnesses to this movie. <br /> <br /> As for the almost homosexual intricacies present, I also have no problems with these. It's not as if they'd been a surprise considering we were screaming about the closet with most of the male characters since the second scene. Again, it is not problematic in itself, but for the wrong reasons. It was absolutely unnecessary, transformed into the pure value of "shock" and / or "dangerous art," and neither shocking nor dangerously artistic from any perspective. What we had was an awkward attempt to rescue a boring and awkward movie with a boring and awkward plot. The ill-suggested sexual tension, which was hinted at only in anticipation of this flaccid scene of kissing, only took that film before the totem of "mediocrity justifying criticism" to "filming suck so badly that it does not have the inherent." grace to suck enough to play and fight. "<br /> <br /> So it is with most of the movie, a lot of artistic clutter, very little meat and much aggravation. <br /> <br /> It's not that we do not understand it. <br /> <br /> Oh, we got it, okay. the very fact that we are applauding the beating in the final scene as the only frame that made sense on his face is an indication that something was terribly wrong with this film.Instead of moving quickly as its name implies , this film was languishing forward as if the trail of sweat was running down the nose while his hands were occupied.Agh This sum sums up well the frustrating frustration that was made while watching this wreck train.There is no breath of fresh air on what it says respect to this film, only the obsolete miasma of bad ideas realized, putrefatas before they materialized.
