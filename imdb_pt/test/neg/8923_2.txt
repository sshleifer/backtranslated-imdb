I usually spend as much time writing my reviews as watching the movie, but with Today You Die, I feel that doing this would be a criminal waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So here's a five. Rant minute about how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There was a time in the mid 80's when a single look from Steven Seagal was enough to break his ribs; a complete frown could knock him over. If he really took you, he would tear you like a branch. <br /> <br /> These days, although it is still able to cause considerable damage, it does not look like the paper anymore. He went to the seed and simply does not know when to give up. He walks as if he's lying in his pants, but somehow he still seems constipated, and he's got fat. Her long, striking ponytail has gone, but her hair still looks stupid. How this man keeps working in the film industry is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Today you Die is the usual Seagal mix of bone crush fights, car crashes, shootings and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles his way through the dull writing, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or credibility. In this third-rate action movie, he plays Harlan Banks, a thief trying to go straight, who is fooled into participating in a $ 20,000,000 robbery. He gets caught, goes to jail, escapes, and seeks revenge. Yawn <br /> <br /> There are some very good car chases and armed struggles that intersperse the boring things (of which there is a lot), but reading other reviews on IMDb revealed that they were actually borrowed from other movies. Seagal is also very doubly doubled in this movie. Seagal turns into one of the most terrible performances of his career, and that's saying something, considering the lousy 'acting' in some of his characters. recent efforts. Most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at Ebonics (African-American slang). 'I do not really, really, Steven, you look like an idiot! With ridiculous script and plot lines going nowhere, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. And the final moment where Harlan Banks saves a child's lock house is enough to blow you up pieces. <br /> <br /> Damn, I just looked at the clock. I was really enjoying destroying so much of this steaming pile of dreck that I went through my five minutes. It's time to post this review and watch something decent.
