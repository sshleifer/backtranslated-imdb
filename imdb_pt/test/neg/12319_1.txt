The cat in the hat is just a slap in the face movie. Mike Myers as the cat in the hat is absolutely not funny and Mike Myers could not have been worse. This is your worst movie ever. The acting and the story were terrible. I mean, how could they make the stories most loved by Dr. Seuss be turned into film and be one of the worst movies of all time and a big disappointment. I could not have seen a movie worse than that, maybe, Baby Geniuses. But this movie is so bad that I can not even describe how much they made this movie. Bo Welch should be fired or the writer should. <br /> <br /> Hedeen's perspective: 0/10 No Stars F
