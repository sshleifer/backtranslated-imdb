The characterization of this film is among the worst I have ever encountered. The dialogue is banal and cliche to the point of extreme distraction. None of the problems faced by the characters are developed - they are mere surface details that claim to show a point without actually having to come up with a convincing dialogue to support that point. In addition, the Chinese characters' representation leaves a bit to be desired - I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father learns English flawlessly from a book (or is implied in a scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. . Etc. Smile Train is a great organization and it's a good idea to make a movie about the impact such a show might have on children's lives, but overall I found this movie to be more frustrating than anything.
