"Soul Plane" is a horrible comedy attempt that should only attract people with thick skulls, red eyes and hairy pawns. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only incoherent but also non-existent, the acting is mostly sub-par with a gang of highly stupid and terrible characters played to bad extent, jokes are often seen ahead and It's almost never a little fun. This movie has no structure and is full of racial stereotypes that must have looked old until the fifties, the only thing they really have for it are some pretty ladies, but in fact if you want you can rent something from the "Adult" section. OK? <br /> <br /> I can hardly see anything here to recommend, since you'll probably have a better, productive time chasing mice with a sledgehammer or making up waterproof sachets or whatever. <br /> <br /> 2/10
