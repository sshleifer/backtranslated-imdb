I'm a German student, I'm sorry for eventually mistakes (I'm working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The very interesting stylist converted and with effective sound effects accented platitudinous action of the drama did not divert at all from the horrible actors evil (insincere and unnatural movements and expressions of feelings) and makes the story relatively weird and meaningless less better. Just the typical slasher genre, in this case, a very strange action. Many side plays partially destroy the main story and let the viewers go all the way into the darkness, create strangeness, and let them assume the senses of actions and the merely nebulous point. It sure is a hit for fans of slasher, but not for me. But although the interesting style of cinematography and adept use of light has ended well. <br /> <br /> So, not the best ...
