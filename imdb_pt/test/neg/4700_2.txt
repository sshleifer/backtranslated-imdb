It seems incredible that the same decade that brought Star Wars to the silver screen undid an indescribable troupe like this and many other 'adventure' movies. I remember the similarly lavish but equally miserable 'Ashanti' outlined elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Whatever motivated the list A actors to sign this celluloid waste is frankly beyond this writer. They must have been very, very desperate. To be perfectly honest, Roger Moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death. Although extremely handsome in his youth, his entire acting career was based on the ability to raise an eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is conveyed by this simple stratagem. Its been the dog days of James Bond. Lee Marvin, on the other hand, took part in some very dignified walks, perhaps the most memorable "Paint Your Wagon" and "The Dirty Dozen". He has a comic book, but he is much better when he plays well. <br /> <br /> The excellent Ian Holm is a disposable, hardly recognizable as an African dumb. Everyone else just showed up for your paychecks. <br /> <br /> The only plausible and supportable element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very big model. But it's incredibly massive and looks authentic - just like its crew. The rest is not even hokum. The children's comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that snakes awkwardly about, as if the script itself had had many Lee Marvin gin blows. Here's a director who just does not know where he's going. There are hints of "The African Queen," a snippet of "Pride and Passion," "Gold," and one or two other movie thefts whose titles do not come to mind. <br /> Strangely, I've seen this three times, each time it was shown on television when I got depressed with a cold or the flu. Maybe that is influencing my judgment - but not much. Compare that to any Indiana Jones movie and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> I gave him two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end, although heaven knows it takes time to do it. <br /> <br /> Time for another Lemsip, I guess.
