A very disappointing Oliver Stone movie that, unlike its recent epic "J.F.K.", does not stimulate any kind of real emotion. "Talk Radio" is about talk-back host Barry Champlain, a very loud and opinionated man who can annoy a lot of people and still attract an audience, most of whom think he just wants to touch and abuse him. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying that he is just a shoe salesman with a big mouth. And as Barry (Eric Bogosian) is threatened with death threats, the end result is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. However, "Talk Radio" does not make a serious comment and remains a frustrating and meaningless film. <br /> <br /> Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
