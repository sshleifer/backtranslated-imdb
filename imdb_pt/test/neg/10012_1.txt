This movie is absolutely terrible and horrible. It's not a low budget, it's a budget-less film that makes Ed Wood movies look like an art. The acting is awful, but sets and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. A common subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of mutant murderers, Woddy Strode has a bullet and the fighting scenes are fired in a disused gravel pit. There is sadism as you would expect from an unpleasant 80's Italian video. No talent was used to make this movie. And the love interest of the female has a huge butt-Italian flavor perhaps. Even by the Italian standards of the 80s, this movie is very horrible but I think it came out at a time when there were not so many movies available on video or the viewers were not really discerning. This piece of crap has no entertainment value and neither is it funny, just annoying and extremely cheap. It really is and insults the most stupid audience. I just wonder how on earth an actor like Woody Strode ended up in a turkey like this?
