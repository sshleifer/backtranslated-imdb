Like kid's movie is great. For the family, it sucks. I was really hoping for something like the Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This movie was just too geared up for the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like ass breath. ??? Alan Cummings was nevertheless a delight. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... just because there's a theme song similar to Willy Wonka's song, does not make that movie something like Willy Wonka.
