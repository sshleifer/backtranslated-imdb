How about Scream Baby Scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it? I bought because, God help me, I'm a sucker for the old B-cinema, even as useless as that. However, Something about this movie annoys me, it's probably Janet, Janet comes out cold and snobby, apparently with the intention of leaving so deep and noble, with a look on her face that screams constipation, she can not agree to anything that the Tense boyfriend wants to. I'm glad this is your only role. What really pisses me off is that this is a gore movie from the 60s that went wrong, and as we all know, "Florido" is "zero gore". It's as if the director had started with the Herschell Lewis style but gave up the bloody scenes when his wife discovered it, so instead we ended up with one monotonous talk after another, and basically a lot of nothing irritating. In other words, we ended up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Boyfriend Janets, Jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, come to think of it, he's probably the least pleasant guy in the horror story. The only thing this movie really has to do is that it carries that 60s / early 70s B-gore vibe you can find in things like Undertaker and his friends, Blood Freak, or anything from Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of the Gruesome Twosome is in that, I thought his caveman comedy routine was annoying, almost everything from reel to reel is stupid, even the travel scene was stupid. The only positive thing in everything is the small amount of beach scenery, but that mainly includes Janet wailing about life not being perfect. In the only real and ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream gets even less interesting when the story finally begins, around 45 minutes. If you happen to be indifferent whether your entertainment is watchable or not, but is offended by the color red, you may not hate it. Why does Troma distribute this? Would not that be the Something Weird Video area? Scream Baby Scream may very well be the worst horror story of his time in Florida, but, I suppose, beneath the unlikely characters, and the incoherent plot, lies the potential. Scream, Baby, Scream really looks like it should follow the Blood Feast pattern, so steal a Janet quote, "If it does not fit, I'll throw it away." 2/10
