Words can not describe how horrible this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'll stab it: 1 - Unfortunate. Hollywood makes more talking animals in graphics. Apparently script and plot are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Film for children, but one of the characters is cruelly attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - Impressively stupid. The film is actually depicting farm animals as having human abilities. At Nemo, fish could talk, but most are still fish. We only hear English as a translation. In Barnyard, the animals are actually speaking English that other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unintelligent - No smart story or even any smart mood. (Ok, the 13-year-old dog on crutches was funny). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally insensitive - The "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow was playing a stereotypical black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorant - It's not a male cow I know. I believe we call them bulls? If we are going to expose our children to talking, it is better that the simpler facts are correct. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and boring. My 4 year old let us off after 45 minutes. He practically fell asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is a shame, because it only proves to Hollywood producers that the American public at large is full of shit waiting to pay $ 8. just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Why should producers spend real money when returns are the same?
