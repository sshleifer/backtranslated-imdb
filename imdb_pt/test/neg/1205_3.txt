I liked this movement as a child, but now that I'm older, I can see how absurd the plot really is. If you have not read the previous reviews, it's about a teenager and an Air Force Colonel who steal two fully loaded F-16s to rescue the teen's father. <br /> <br /> He has some aerial acrobatics, even if the accompanying dialogue, then, is basically beck teckno. <br /> <br /> Some unintentional humor in the edited for the TV version. When the hero's father is being held by Iran, I mean a country with no name, and his captors ask for a confession (why he's stuck, do not worry exactly about why, or what they want him to confuse.) he says "Tell him he can take my confession and stick it in the throat". However, his lips and, most important, his gesture make it clear what movement, and part of the anatomy, he was really thinking.
