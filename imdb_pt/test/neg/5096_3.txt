With an interesting premise (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples, sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), this should have been a good movie. But the story is sabotaged by the director's primary passion with his own intelligence, coupled with a very poor script. <br /> <br /> Yes, the natural setting is beautiful, and yes, the film is authentic in its historical setting of the nineteenth century. . But the filmmaker continues to gild the lily repeatedly, adding layer upon layer of exaggerated musical accompaniment, not to mention a completely unnecessary narration, to the soundtrack, which ultimately overloads the viewer and, drawing attention to Me, it became clear that the director, with his microscopic close-ups and the endless repetition of the musical motif of "Danny Boy" (of all things!) was trying to make a New Zealand version of an epic film of Sergio Leone, something of the order of Once Upon Time in the West. But given the seriousness of the story (most of Leone's westerns were ironic), not to mention that it's not 1968 anymore, he manages to make a parody of one. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
