Aksar is a horrible movie. The script, the story, the acting are simply laughable. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly the bad acting. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. She's pretty, but she has zero acting talent. The film has a song called "Jhalak Diklaja", composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I've never been able to understand the hype surrounding this song, since I've never found it particularly good, despite being captivating. The film is supposed to be a thriller, but instead, it looks like a comic book, thanks to dire direction and writing. Avoid this cheapo at any cost.
