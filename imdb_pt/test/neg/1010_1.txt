This is a little less disgusting than the first two films, but on the other hand, business is common: a slice of sick, sloppy, sloppy and unbalanced cinema. Charles Bronson is back, taking action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorizing the neighborhood. Crime, you see, it's 11% in the South Belmont area ... so what to do? A stronger police presence? Harder chains? Stricter phrases? No, the only solution is to send a loose cannon like Bronson to do a bloody revenge ?? or, as the writers would have it, justice: this time he's the personal killing machine of Chief Constable Ed Lauter. <br /> <br /> The writers lean back to make Kersey the hero, sending the useless cops to the area. only to confiscate a weapon from an elderly resident who holds it for protection, and provide a scene where Kersey has his stolen camera and shoot the thief just behind, to the applause of the crowd watching. Death penalty for robbery? It's all right. Everyone's attitude in the film is that this is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of characters into ciphers that exist just to applaud Kersey or support him is terrifying. <br /> <br /> Of course, these villains are scum, but should not the movie let the audience decide, instead of tilting the whole thing to Kersey and his irrational response? Strangely enough, besieged villagers do not fear gang reprisals or blame Kersey for any violence, which is strange, since a character is killed precisely because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, everyone takes weapons from their drawers and happily joins the massacre, never stopping to think about things or struggling with the thought of having to kill another human being. <br /> <br /> Atrociously shallow performances do not help? Bronson literally has a facial expression and can not even inflate the right words. New heights of stupidity are attained here? a machine gun? A rocket launcher?! ??? and new minimums of misogyny: the film tries to desecrate all the female characters in sight, either by rape, explosion or by slit throat; and puts them in an extremely stupid way, like a victim who ventures into the neighborhood controlled by gangs and controlled by gangs to ask a stranger, or another who goes shopping alone at night. This is pure, pure and simple, garbage without meaning, without style or meaning.
