Dreamland started moderately interesting, but has never been anywhere except the town of Tedium. A low-income case, with no known actors and laughable effects, is not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is that they actually filmed locations in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can not think of a good thing besides that stinker. The ending is supposed to be some kind of revelation, but it falls like the rest. Oh, I thought of another positive point about this cheese, which is just over an hour, although it is still used long before that. When the girl starts walking in the desert at night, it seems to last forever and continues to get worse from there. Attempts of horror are not effective in the least. The story is an attempt to feel the twilight zone style, but it fails a lot. Check out "Retroactive" for a good science fiction B movie.
