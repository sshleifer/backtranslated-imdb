The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who got involved with the divers from Estonia, put together this "silly thriller" to save their investment. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, of course, is always watchable - but he is in only three scenes. It delivers your material perfectly - as you might ask a professional. In addition, the main protagonist, JÃ¼rgen Prochnov, is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, however, is bad. The actress who plays the Swedish secretary secretary (or whatever it was - she does not seem listed in the cast) is EXTREMELY bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some good ideas, and the story is really interesting. The final script should have been rewritten a few more times. Some scenes are just ridiculous - especially the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes longer. Presented as a 60-minute TV movie, this could have been really interesting. Like a two-hour long, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe may be a good journalist (her ideas about the governments that use Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden were concluded as it was true recently when the Swedish military officially said they actually used the ship Estonia for that), but as a film producer she sucks. <br /> <br /> The director, the writer and the actors suck more. <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given a 1 if it were not for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times, Donald Sutherland is in it and has real pictures. <br /> <br /> But we do not even see the boat sink! What kind of movie about a sinking ship is that? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves ...
