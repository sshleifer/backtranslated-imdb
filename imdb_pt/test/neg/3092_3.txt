This movie should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but even he could not rescue the story of a young woman who sought the truth about her sister's death. Spoiler warning: Actually, the truth is that the older sister (played by Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish, shallow girl who took too many drugs. Not much of a twist and not so interesting either. The film is also overwhelmed with many flashbacks and voice overs and a lack of dramatic rhythm. All in all this is definitely worth missing - not to be recommended.
