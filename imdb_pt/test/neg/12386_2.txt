Okay, this horror movie was meant to be a joke, right? Please tell me it should be a joke, so I'll understand. <br /> <br /> A large bird with giant claws - or a claw, anyway - descends upon innocent people on the ground and devours them. above. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow sufficiently exaggerated in order to keep things interesting, but at least you'll enjoy a healthy snicker when you see the 'monster'. It looks like a cross between a demented chicken and Mortimer Snerd. <br /> <br /> Either director Fred Sears just made that photo in a hurry and knew the bird looked absolutely ridiculous, or he really thought his movie and his creature were genuinely scary. I'd rather think-and hope-that it was the first. <br /> <br /> Q. The bird needs a haircut.
