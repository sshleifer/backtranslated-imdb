Chris Ricci dreams of all this, but soon assumes an air of boredom and disdain - as much as I do when I watch. Without it, this would be no more than a cheap children's movie, but at least it adds a quality air. There are few young actresses, if there are any more visually stunning and charismatic in the business. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with that, as long as you accept what it is - a cheap version of Disney aimed at very demanding children. I've been able to watch Ricci all day, so I'm probably oblivious to many of the shortcomings of the movie, but unless you're a fan of Ricci, a cat lover or a very small child, I doubt you'd find it too fun.
