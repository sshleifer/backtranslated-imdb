Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing teamed up in a horror film; This always sounds like a great plan. Two of the most versatile cult cults of his generation, who have previously performed together in such fantastic productions as "The Flesh and the Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave", paired up in a mid-70s Satanic-themed exploration film How can this go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it can. To my deepest regret, "Land of the Minotaur" can hardly be called mediocre, and that despite the cast, the exotic setting, the attractive title and the potential sounding premise. In a small remote area in Greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, several tourists disappear because the Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers continue feeding them to a statue of Minotauro that spits fire. Cushing, who never seemed more bored and disinterested in any role he played before, has a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek, this means that you also have the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caves. This is of course quite useful if your hobby is the hijacking of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also disappear mysteriously in the same area, Father Roch - the priest of some cities before) - decides to investigate. "Land of the Minotaur" is a tedious and extremely slow horror effort that never undertakes great attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and does not bother to elaborate all potentially fascinating elements and treacherous pagan details. The titular minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and a person's body, but for some unexplainable reason the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and inappropriate high music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to consider giving the film a big disappointment is because of Donald Pleasance. His portrait of a rude, bossy, old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as ever.
