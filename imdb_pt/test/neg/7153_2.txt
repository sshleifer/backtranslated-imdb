This is a road movie. At least the movie is in yellow and I think it suggests a road movie (?). I can not say too positive about delivery. It's bad acting, certainly their English. The camera looks like it is made by a kid, there is a counter pump and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky. Since it was so cliché we really had fun all the time - and that was the most fun of the movie. This movie should be released in the United States, but I'm not sure if you should go because that may suggest it's the quality we produce. The explosions seem boring. Basically everything is over. Everything is too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the baby, etc. Find all the cliché in other movies, join them and you'll get The Delivery.
