The basic plot of 'Marigold' prides itself on a romantic comedy in which the film industry is kept in the background. An American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter is imprisoned in India. Worse than that, she's out of money. She then decides to play a small role in a Bollywood musical, so she can earn enough money to go back to her nation. Here she meets the Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. Basically, the movie fails at the script level. Just by calling a movie a Hollywood venture does not guarantee quality cinema. Marigold stands out as the best example. The art direction is weak and outdated. Musically, Marigold ends up being a failure. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is far from being recognized as a good listener. Then Salman offers his most amateur performances to date. Ali Larter is good and has a huge presence on screen. Performance too, she is good. <br /> <br /> You can also find good reviews about this movie at http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=36310
