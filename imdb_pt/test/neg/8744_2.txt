This unites the endless line of sci-fi films from the 1950s, predictable and fussy out there. As usual, it's too bad. There is not much plot I can detect and the exaggerated exaggeration of leads only increases unintentional laughter. The title is also misleading. Catching this on MST3K is probably the only way to be seen, and it's best to leave that way.
