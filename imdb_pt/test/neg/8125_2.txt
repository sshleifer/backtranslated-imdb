I tried. I really, really tried to think of something that deserved ranking higher than a two. It's not that I do not "understand" - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is childish in construction, wordy and painfully disconnected. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are from Alfred Hitchcock's school of thought, "do not tell them, show them." then you could try to enjoy this movie but you would still be hard pressed. <br /> <br /> First of all, The Terrorizers tries a flow of consciousness in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and fails in that. Edward Yang seems to understand the fundamentals of the technique, but he is very unqualified for this. (Maybe he'll get better with age, I do not know how I have not tried other Yang films yet.) The point is he uses a "show, do not tell" grace that really only serves to interrupt the procession. of history. Of course, it gets some visually interesting images, but they do not draw the story together, and they do not help make it better. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main concept behind the flow consciousness and "show, not tell" is that with the right images, right drama, repetition and close correlation, the viewer will be able to make your own inferences; This is not to say that these will be the correct inferences, but they can be altered as the story progresses, and every director must strive for some of this kind of interaction with the audience. In this, Edward Yang disappoints a lot. The spectator is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be drawn, no reason to consider the characters or their motives, no reason to get emotionally involved, and really, no reason to stay alert. <br /> <br /> Finally, Yang gets lost in the story he wants to tell, not the story the movie itself is telling. His art moves in one direction, but as a big dog he can not control, he is constantly pulling the lead, trying to get her back on the course he wants, not the one that is naturally following. The most notorious example of this is the ending. The ending really should have occurred at the time of the husband's revelation. The end of the book that the film is focusing on, (and by extension, a possible ending to the film) we have been told. If Yang had chosen to finish at that point, he would have a much more powerful piece, leaving the observer in suspense - does the story unfold as the book says, or is Yang's "real world" different? Asking the viewer to think about it is the kind of spectator interaction that Yang needs painfully. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to tell, forcing the natural conclusion for the sake of what? For the simple pleasure of persisting in a main character - we did not need to know more about her superficially, and Yang would not feel the need to tell us if he had not made her a veneer instead of worrying about making her a more engaging and deep character to begin. <br /> <br /> Why does Yang prolong and torture your movie? To get into some more of these "visually interesting pictures". The film really suffers from this. He wants to finish, has a conclusion that seems natural and leaves the viewer restless, but instead, Yang continues. Instead, Yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer, causing him or her to constantly ask "so what?" The first ending, which Yang ignored, was good. The second ending, well, my thinking was "so who cares?", Because it's not like you're introducing something that has not been presented in the story already ... but the last ending? This really was a waste of time. Not only did the "real" ending leave me uninvolved, but I also felt it was an affront to what the story might have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for the gum-melancholy-noir-dyed conclusion he insisted on all the time. <br /> <br /> My last problem with the film has nothing to do with the film itself, but post-production. The subbing (if you see it subbed) is awful. Long phrases stand for a second or two, while the short ones stay awake for a long time. In addition, as Yang quickly changes the images, the captions are removed from the screen. This is one of those rare cases where subtitles should remain on the screen even when the image was changed, because there is not much dialogue going on anyway.
