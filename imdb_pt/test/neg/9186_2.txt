"Wagons East" was a big disappointment to me. But the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be the last role of John Candy (he died shortly before filming was completed). There are just a few laughs along this western parody, and for a comedy that does not cut it. If you want to see a great parody of Western movies, the answer is obvious. See the Mel Brooks classic "Blazing Saddles". Or if you want to see Candy in much better material, see "Summer Rental", "Spaceballs", or "Uncle Buck" (just to name a few). These three films (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, "Wagons East" does not. What a shame! <br /> <br /> * (of four)
