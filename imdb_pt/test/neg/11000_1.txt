This is one of the most idiotic and worthless movies of all time. It does not really qualify for movie status. It's very cheap (apparently filmed on video), terribly acted and simply rotten. I could not believe how cheap and inept that piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I mean, I believe a guy I know in some homes must have dug his video camera and done that crap in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. Did I notice the name of where it came from? Asylum? And I'll NEVER rent anything with that name on it again !!! When you rent a movie, make sure it's from that "company". One thing is true - if you like amateur movies then you might like this loser. It is absolutely annoying and terrible !!! You were warned !!!
