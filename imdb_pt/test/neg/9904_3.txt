What is it!! it is so bad. The animation looks so terrible, it looks like a ps1 type game. The actors are terrible, they just can not act to save their lives. I sat through this whole movie and in the end I was annoyed when I realized I had wasted 3 hours of my life. I did not hear about this movie, did it really go out in the movies or went straight to the DVD? A girl was shot ?! What's up with that, it was just a stupid movie. They totally copied 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend to people who do not waste their time on this. You could spend your time watching 'The Day After Tomorrow', it's so much better. Well, that's what I think of the movie. In fact, why did I waste my time writing about it? It's really bothering me, its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now.
