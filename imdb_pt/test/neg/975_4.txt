Two popular actors are paired on the showtime as De Niro and Murphy playing a policeman and an actor. Although they share the longest screen time together, they do not achieve their expected performances, like movies like Analyze It, Meet Parents, Dr. Doolittle and Walnut Professor. The film starts off interestingly, but it becomes a common comedy that is rather disappointing. It seems that, especially, De Niro does not like being on Showtime. This is a shame because it really shows your feelings is what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used intelligently, it could have been a more interesting work and could be followed by a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I do not think there would be a sequel to it, at least, releasing De Niro and Murpy again. ** outside of *****
