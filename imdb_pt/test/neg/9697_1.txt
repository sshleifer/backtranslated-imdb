This movie could have been an impressive epic, but the creators seem to have done their best to look foolish. Even God Himself is not spared in this film, in which His words are drenched in children's jokes. The result is blasphemous and irritating. Only people who do not mind seeing a cheap parody on the biblical story may be able to watch this movie without embarrassment. The producers of this tasteless production should see "Il Vangelo secondo Matteo," a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini, which shows that it is unnecessary to pervert the words of the Bible to make a good story; the most impressive result is obtained by a sincere translation of the simple text itself.
