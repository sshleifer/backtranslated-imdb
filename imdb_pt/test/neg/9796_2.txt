... and I bought The vampire motorcycle staggers all over the line like a drunk with shoelaces tied together. Some "bad" movies are quite nice (like Norman J. Warren's Inseminoid), some "bad" movies are bad (like Kent Bateman's Headless Eyes), but "bad" movies that try and do the thing after -modernist to be consciously. bad should always be approached with extreme caution. Many people think Troma's Terror Firmer is a tasteless masterpiece, for example, but I believe anyone over the age of nineteen does not care. Then there is John Carpenter's Dark Star. Yes, it is curious, and certainly a product of its time, but as a film is only two points above the value. This out-of-budget British black comedy horror film attempts to reach a satirical tone, with its endless references to its punches (among them Psychomania, Horror Hospital and almost everything by Pete Walker), but due to discouraging performances per second . TV actors (the protagonist looks like Amy Winehouse), a screenplay that seems to have been written on the back of a beermat peeled by two "boys" without understanding how movie comedy works, (intentionally?) Dean Friedman soundtrack lift-rock and production values ​​are never above the mediocre, the net result is a film that can only be ridiculed instead of WITH. If your idea of ​​whoopee is anthropomorphic dung, Chinese takeaways called Fu King and references to long-forgotten TV ads, you'll enjoy this, but do not expect too much.
