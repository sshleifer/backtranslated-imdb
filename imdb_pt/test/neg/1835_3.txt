This movie had such a good premise to begin with. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really could not figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many stupid cliches from the worst of the old days. American slasher / horror movies. Now, I love horror / horror movies, but there are all the old cliches that have long since disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old "I hear noises in the basement and I'm alone at home and the basement light does not work, so I'll investigate" cliché. <br /> <br /> Three examples of these clichés only bothered me endlessly: 1) When Potente discovers that there may be a secret society in action at medical school dividing living bodies, it does questions and tells EVERYONE - very publicly. In essence, she's saying, "I've found you. Come and kill me because I'm telling everyone your secret." And then she wonders why she finds blood scattered all over the bed and brings her roommate's cut finger into a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after a guy she met two weeks ago ends up at the dissecting table and she discovers that this secret society is destroying living people, she goes to the laboratory where all the corpses are stored 2- 3 times more BY THE SAME EVENING to investigate. <br /> <br /> 3) Your roommate is dead. She is pursued by the killer, whom she knows, does not report it to the university or the police, and then leaves school to go home to visit her parents. Then she goes back to school, apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will forget the past and not try to kill her, even though she knows his secret. She was, of course, wrong. <br /> <br /> For someone who should be so smart (she was studying to be a doctor at the best school in Germany), she acted like a bimbo movie horror cliche. <br /> <br /> These things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating, and made me wish the ending would come even earlier. Halfway through the movie, I stopped trafficking her and wished she'd end up at the dissecting table as well.
