It's 2005, my friends ... a time of incredible special effects and an era of technology. So why can not we see a movie that's a bit more thought-out than this low-budget movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget films that annoy me, but this ... it's almost like you're trying to be awful. Just ... do not ... notice that. I can look beyond the lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good. I feel like a little kid produced that whole movie. There is not even an original plot. Vampire Assassins itself is a great hole in attempting to mock itself. Can anyone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and I just did not know it? It makes me wonder, what has the sequel been keeping for us who love the first part?
