I only bought this DVD because it was very cheap and looked interesting in its own special way ("special" meaning "retarded"). The film turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really directing the story and of course the acting is horrible. It was not even "bad" in an exaggerated way - it was just plain bad. In fact, there are a handful of great lines of dialogue, but most of the time it's weird and weak. All I could think of while watching this was that this could be a good movie if the script got a major review (if it was written by someone who really understood the drug culture) and if some decent actors were chosen. I would not recommend "Weekend With the Babysitter" unless you plan a movie career and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
