If you see this movie in the TV listings, ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'd better watch the reruns of the X-Files. Previous reviews referencing the incredibly poor performance of female leadership are inoperative. It is almost inaccessible. The sum total of his reach includes "tearful and scared" and "tearful and not scared." <br /> <br /> I'm the type of moviegoer who likes a good 'bad' movie. But this is ridiculous. There is no direction. The plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and very much like this set of numbers, it ends up having no meaning at the end. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent if you turn off the TV and bathe your dog.
