I saw that "The Foreigner" was rated on the "Bottom 100" movie list here on IMDb, so I was not expecting much when I tuned in to the US channel a week ago, but I had hopes. "Belly Of The Beast" (aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had great scenes and photos and some cool moments spread all over the place, so I thought this movie might have some of the same. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film fails in almost all standards of basic observational ability. The screenplay appears as the bastard son of a John LeCarre novel and a Richard Ludlum movie, but made by people who have no knack for plotting and characterizing. Instead, what we have is a gloomy, nefarious, nihilistic, and enigmatic nest of confused motives, entangled alliances and setbacks. And shootings in the chest. And bombing. And eviscerations. This shifts to the steering style, which is based on 'grainy shot / slow motion' images every 10 seconds along with wire work and hyperactive jumping cuts. Those film devices that were obsolete 10 years ago, when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director works them like a punk, hoping to inject some strangeness from the art techno thriller into the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Segal himself is just awful at it. He spends the whole movie talking in a half-hoarse, guttural whisper and alternating between two expressions: it looks like he's sucking on a lemon while someone waves a little poop under his nose, or appears to be constipated. And he's so sturdy (and vain about it) that he never takes his mop on the camera. I understand it's hard to keep the perimeter under control when a male actor ages (though Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seem to have this problem). But you deal with it being honest and growing like an actor, not hiding it with carefully chosen camera angles and mantles to the ground. <br /> <br /> So I can not really tell what's going on, and the movie does not give me a reason to worry about what's going on, and the protagonist is completely one-dimensional and visually unpleasant. Not a recipe for a good movie experience. <br /> <br /> Strangely, most scenarios and scenery are atmospheric and striking; in fact, if you were to freeze the film in almost any scene other than a close-up of Seagal, you would be impressed by the care and professionalism of lighting, color and composition, and the beauty of Eastern Europe's look. settings are. But wearing a rotten egg like an egg Faberg√© can not make it edible. And the procedures are rotten in the heart. There are "cool" movies (such as "Versus"), and there are visually stunning but emotionally cold films (such as "Underworld") and there is a paranoid conspiracy thriller (such as "The Bourne Identity" and remake with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing, that can not decide what it wants to be, pretends to be all these things and fails because it has neither courage nor soul. <br /> <br /> This is a professional-made movie with a real budget, so you can not put it in the same class as "Hands", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I'd rather watch all three consecutive movies several times than watch "The Foreigner" once again.
