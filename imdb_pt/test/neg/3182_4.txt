I rented this movie because I like to see things with Lauren Graham in them. Well, she was the highlight. All others seemed completely separated from the image. You stare around at those who watch the movie with you, what? However, she gave some clarity, since she was the only normal character in the photo, which does not really say much about the movie. Personally, it was very unlikely for me. However, I'm glad I rented it despite the fact that I would never want to own it. I still feel that Lauren Graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character, she seemed to steal the movie. My husband and I were happier and cared more about her character, ending with the character of Josh, than with the two main characters.
