Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was shocked. <br /> <br /> DO NOT bring kids to see this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children - and they will be bored and disappointed. Certainly * we * all read Theo's wonderful children's book and we certainly have expectations ... but that's just crap. Dr. Seuss would be embarrassed and would certainly never have given his "positive" in such a vile attempt to capitalize on a classic. <br /> <br /> What a shame. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you have a copy, buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program. This movie is not worth a free viewing of tickets. <br /> <br /> Keep the book. The TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrait - save your money ... seriously. SAVE your money - it will be on Cape Day by saint patty. <br /> <br /> Shame shame shame on what they do !!
