Most likely "Cleopatra 2525" will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it was broadcast; and I do not think many people have. But if you're still a bit puzzled is a premise "Buck Rogers in the 25th century" without spacecraft and no budget for wardrobe or production design. <br /> <br /> In this case, the part of Buck Rogers (Cleopatra) is played by Jennifer Sky. Which one could be a good thing, since Jennifer is very handsome and talented; and has a nice comic touch. But a quick look at the promotional material will show that she's a little worse for having a bad haircut and a wardrobe from the Thrift Store of the Salvation Army. If you remember how Jennifer was picking up during her time on "Xena", her sloppy Cleopatra look will be a big disappointment. With a target audience of "teenage boys looking to burn their eyes looking at" girls dressed in hot fetish, "it's not a good idea to save on the value of exploiting your heroine or costume. attract much of an audience, love or hate, "Buck Rogers" had warmer suits and much better looking stars. basically playing her character "Firefly" and Sarge (Victoria Pratt - another connection "Xena" - an extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge) Torres does a good job of playing the character Cleopatra, providing most of the comic relief of the program. Torres sings the theme song, a parody by Rick Evans, "In the Year 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" (1969). Do you remember the one that begins with the words "In the year 2525, if oh omem is still alive, If the woman can survive, They may find ... "I suspect they gave him creates his title so they could cut this little song, although who knows, maybe the title is a tribute to" Buck Rogers "and they thought about using the song later. <br /> <br /> So the premise of the show is that the surface of the Earth was dominated by aliens called Bailies (not WKRP) and humans were expelled underground. Our three heroines fight against the Bailies under the direction of a female (presumably) disembodied voice (aptly called the "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a sort of goofy, still stunned and confused by her cryogenic or perhaps disoriented slumber of the creepy haircut. There are many good close-ups of Sky with wide-eyed and bewildered eyes. Like "Buck Rogers," the joke is Cleopatra, who uses a common expression of the 21st century, and everyone considers it utterly profound or utterly disconcerting. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Firefly", the action is more than the "overrated Xena" trash that is neither realistic nor particularly fun. A good trick is that girls travel around the "Spider-Man" fashion, a kind of web casting tunnels and arrows into the maze of their underworld. <br /> <br /> Strangely (or perhaps not considering the budget), it's only half-hour episodes and, with the exception of a two-part show, there's not enough time for any subtlety or nuance. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
