I just have to say that this was the third worst movie I have ever seen right after the killer 3 tomato attack and 2 stellar troops. It was not just dialogues or the paper walls or even the gun shots that disappeared automagically with no holes in the walls. It was horrible acting. No wonder I've never seen these actors before they've all probably slept with the director (s). I think I'm cool with this movie right now, but that's only because I'm tired of screaming at the movie (I just saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs as possible from this movie and burn it so no one else ever sees that horrible waste of time, money, and film.
