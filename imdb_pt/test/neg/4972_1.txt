I love Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my all time favorite movies. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game, if there was a game I would never want to have, Super Nintendo was that. How can a game based on a classic movie be too awful? And to make matters worse, I was scared of this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How stupid was that, but again, I was a kid when this game was first released. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just weird. One minute is an action game and then it is a shooting game. What in the world is wrong in making a decision when making a video game? <br /> <br /> The sound in the game is simply terrible to listen to. <br /> <br /> The music is too sick to hear. <br /> <br /> Controllers in the game do not work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park, gambling is just a waste of time and money and not a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
