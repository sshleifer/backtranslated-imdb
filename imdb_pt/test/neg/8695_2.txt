From English accents to unnecessary violence after violence. Showing Moses as a killer. People who truly believe in the Old Testament just sit there and shake their heads. I'm not a religious person. But even I felt as if the writers of this movie were trying to turn us against God and the Jews. When Moses took the stone and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. I wanted to stone the writers. I can not believe this day and age that Hallmark and ABC (Disney) would try to show such garbage like this. Do not we have enough problems in this world already?
