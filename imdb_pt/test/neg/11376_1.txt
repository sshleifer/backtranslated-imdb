Comparing this movie with anything from Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I can say about this is that it tries desperately to be like an Almodovar movie and fail miserably. The script is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional and the performances are the quality of the school drama (except for Marcia Gay Harden, who is very good given the material she has to work with). In addition, cinematography does absolutely nothing to convey the extravagant beauty of Gaudi's architecture or the contagious charm of Barcelona. If you like the grace and humor and the dark and weird comedy of Almod√≥var's films, you will not find any of them here. Spend your money on something other than this waste of celluloid.
