I just gave a 10 to Thieves Highway, I mentioned this for two reasons, one to prove that I'm not an idiot who only gives bad reviews, but 2 because the theme of the movie has the same thread, ie falling in love with a woman of the night. <br /> <br /> We all know that woman is a girls movie, but you can not avoid them all, they will eventually catch you. Pretty Woman to me does two things, two terrible horrible hideous things, first portrays prostitution as a career more like that of a dancer, you know with great friends, leggings giggling, borrowing from each other. You see in reality Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street prostitute Prostitute we are talking here, have a great life, she is healthy happy with only an occasional groan to explain her situation. My feeling is that this "happy Hooker" type protagonist is much more palatable than a quasi-realistic character, which to me raises the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too scared to adorn that player with characteristics familiar to this role, then why do it? If I make a movie about a chef but do not want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why do a movie about a chef in the first place? Rescuing and turning the prostitute into a respectable type of dancer, history completely misses the point and consequently never surrenders to any of the moral or social issues it might have, which is really silly. <br /> <br /> Second, 'Pretty Woman' insults the novel itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no idea how to seduce or romance this 'lady' who is without his plastic friend, yes no Leave home without it, especially if you are an idiot in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of your romantic moments involve making money in one form or another, even when he first meets you is the turbo Lotus Esprit that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos, money money, where is the charm? where is the charisma, do not mention that attempt to the piano, please. <br /> <br /> The girls who like this movie will also be girls who like to shop more than most. The guys who like this movie have not even realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably do not, so he will not register. Most importantly, anyone who enjoys this movie will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject. <br /> <br /> I will finish a song: <br /> <br /> A beautiful woman prowling the street Beautiful woman, the kind that I like to treat Beautiful woman, I do not believe in you You are not the truth Nobody could spend as much as you Mercy Beautiful woman, Do not you forgive me? Beautiful woman, I could not stop seeing Beautiful woman, and you look beautiful how can it be you have no imagination like me <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, buy some time Pretty woman, talk a little Pretty woman, sell your smile for me Beautiful woman, yes, yes, yes Beautiful woman, look at me Beautiful woman, say that you will be with me ... and I will pay you ... I will treat you well
