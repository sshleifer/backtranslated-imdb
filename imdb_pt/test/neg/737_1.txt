We really do not know where to start when we talk about this movie. But let's start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that who wrote / produced / directed this movie has never read the book. Because they lost the whole point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Just a suggestion. Second, the bath scene. Enough said. Third, the characters added. The outlined gothic French lady and her black page enjoying holding hands and cartwheeling. We do not understand where this came from. And then there was the cast. They were all really nasty. We were very upset because Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together because they were so unpleasant that no one would ever want to see them happy. And the music. We think the BBC producers ran out of money, so they invaded their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, female voices and an occasional electric guitar. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * If anyone has any explanation, we'd like to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> We're still wondering what the hell all those involved were thinking when they ruthlessly launched this pathetic excuse of a movie for the public. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is by far the worst we've seen until today. And I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this movie to anyone you hate. They will watch and want to kill themselves. And we agreed with an earlier post, we would give this 0 stars if possible. DO NOT WATCH !! And we strongly suspect that all those who have commented so far in favor of this film were involved in its production. Or they were mentally insane. These are the only reasons why we have been able to suggest that this would instigate a favorable review.
