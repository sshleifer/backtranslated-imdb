It's kind of hard to believe that this came from the same director who gave us HELLRAISER. Where is the style, the foreboding and the charm? I mean, HELLRAISER is not a great horror movie, but at least it had something. NIGHTBREED is like a big ball of bad ideas badly executed. From the opening there is a problem with subtlety: the monsters are shown on the first shot! The opening dream sequence shows very long. Our hero does not exhibit professional acting skills (but no one expected this from this bastard genre). There are killings that someone wants to be more interesting. So we have David Cronenberg. Man was never really meant to be an actor. He fills the scary psychiatrist's role properly, but what he should have done was step behind the camera and save this disaster. Then we came to Midian, a scary fake graveyard with a very scary fake gate. This thing is not a big improvement over the graveyard of PLAN 9 OF THE OUTER SPACE. It gets worse when we meet the creatures in it. There's nothing really wrong with character design and makeup effects here (well ... except for the scalpless guy, the guy with a pointed chin and forehead, and the fat guy with dark circles around his eyes), O problem is the way they act and the terrible dialogue they are given. Barker's photograph of the underground city is tired and this part of the story could have been much better. Some may call the following SPOILERS. After our hero dies and becomes "nightbreed" we wait to see what he will become (there are talks about flying things and werewolves), but when it comes time for him to change, they apparently thought his hero was too cute to give a decent creature design. With Cronenberg's "character" turn, the story gets less interesting until the battle of the freaks against the rules (which is bad). Barker's mythology failed him here. There is genius and little originality behind any of the NIGHTBREED. The image could have used a bigger budget, a serious script and a character design that would not let you say "oh ... oh, how lame". What a waste. It's not scary, it's not cool, not even very dark, just weak.
