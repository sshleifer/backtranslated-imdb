... when this movie was going on. How boring. An attempt at humor, but in fact was not very good. Some good ideas were thrown out, and the actors' make-up and wardrobe were fine. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot more, unfortunately I could not take it anymore, I turned off half of the video and eject the tape, went to the store to get my money back ...
