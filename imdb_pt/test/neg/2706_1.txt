The first time I watched this movie I was ten years old. I thought it was bad back then, and at that age I did not have any cinematic taste. I watched this movie at Cinemax about 3 days ago and I remembered why I hated the movie in the first place. The character of Madonna, Nikki, is boring and unpleasant. There is no way for the main character to fall in love with her. The jokes were cheesy and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. novel !! I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater or rented. I feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.
