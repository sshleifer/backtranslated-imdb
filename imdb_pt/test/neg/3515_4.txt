Recently I watched this movie on The Sundance Channel and it kept me interested from the beginning. However, it seems to take forever where you want to go and in the end I felt a little cheated. In a nutshell, Noble Willingham (of Walker, Texas Ranger) plays a boat salesman who begins to be harassed by phone from a man claiming to be his son. According to the mysterious interlocutor, Willingham has a little obscure secret that affects the son and he (the son) is pleased to remind him of that. I'm not going to ruin anything for anyone, but for me three things prevented me from really enjoying this movie. One of them, the movie has more foul language than Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino and Glengarry Glen Ross together. 99% of it is vomited from Willingham himself. It did not take me long to wear myself out with four-letter words. Two, I just could not believe that someone would answer the phone many times, especially when it is known that a caller is on the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, whether at work, at home, at a coffee shop, etc., the phone rings and he always responds by vomiting poison on the "son", and then turning off ONLY TO ANSWER AGAIN WHEN THE CALLER CALLS BACK IN NEAR TEN SECONDS! How many of us would do that? Now I realize that we probably do not have a movie if he does not respond, but I just could not suspend disbelief on that particular subject. Three, and this is the least of the criticisms, why does the director object to showing us the "Corndog Man" (also known as the interlocutor / son)? Most of the time it's just a voice on the other end of the phone. I could have lived with that if other things had gotten together, but since they were not, it's just another one to be followed. I credit the film for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning, but that's about it. See, if only once. However, if you are like me, you will be saying "Triple K Marine!" in your sleep for a night or two after you've finished watching.
