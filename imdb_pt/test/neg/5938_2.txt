Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way to make a living, but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one can come out believing every government bureaucrat is a lazy, swollen, and vain paper pusher who lives exclusively to attend his next lunch break. It's not exactly a beautiful image, but this is the image the audience has to endure by watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, and exaggerated action movie. Just what the doctor asked for ... right? How many more of these Hollywood movies did? Thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making such films is so beaten into the dust that it must now be completely unrecognizable. Locations change, but the portions remain the same, and with the same development of superficial character and equally superficial acting, trained artists are invited to become pseudo-characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to run endlessly. "When will this movie end?" I have repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA agent, but what has to be one of the great mongrel gafts, an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the operative on the site is "skinny and mean" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called a stereotype. What was the casting director thinking? Why is Jack Nicholson not an overweight office clerk? Or does Nicole Kidman play a sloppy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could give it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to go through Arabic ... speaking Arabic fluently ... inventing all kinds of brain hair schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to think and get away Arabs who are completely disobeyed by their ridiculous Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the midst of carrying out a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try to put a real Arabic on paper. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all this. There must be a balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that leaves the story in tatters. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And one more thing. Do not let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The payout may not be great, but the additional benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this film conveniently omits.
