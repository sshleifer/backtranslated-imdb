In an attempt to keep up with the modernity of young audiences as the 1970s approached, OCDC, YCSF was the product of a stranger and stranger material chosen for music. Here is the past-life regression, ESP and hypno-therapy ... very crazy! The real problem with the concept (music or not) are the dramatically low challenges; where a movie can go, and what can happen, when a man falls in love with an earlier incarnation of a girl he does not support? It can not go anywhere new, but strangely, it can not even go anywhere old! In fact, if it could, the public still had no interest in the union of Yves Montand (playing a much more arrogant and arrogant French donkey) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never become invested in them, their situations or results. Montand is miscast and his strong accent makes many of his letters unintelligible. <br /> <br /> It's all given a superficial veneer of the 60's that makes it eminently disposable; despite Minelli's efforts here and there that are respectable. It is not even adapted from a non-musical story that has had some previous success ... this is very out of fashion! Streisand occasionally has some funny deals to offer, such as when she is trying not to fall asleep on the roof and improvises a brisk dance. But she relies too much on her insinuating, kooky, Jewish girl shtick. It can, however, sing very well, both at the "soft" ends and at the "power" of the range. Amidst a shortage of musical scum, she gets 3 or 4 amazing songs * of much greater caliber than anything Fanny or Dolly had to offer. "It's not you" is a trifle as sublime as Lorenz Hart's "My Funny Valentine," but the film can not perceive any impact; because the lyrics do not seem to be referring to anything in the movie, and nothing suggests remotely that a great love is blooming between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only cut we can see is a poor ax job. a much bigger movie. A strong search shows a longer, better explained and more decorative film, but not necessarily better, at: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there will be more Babs in this version, but more importantly, there would be more careful work by Minelli. <br /> <br /> In the end, Montand orders Babs to sing the title song after she discovers him a total idiot who feeds her with a self-esteem homily to get carried away. And she bites the bait. So, uh ... hooray for this. <br /> <br /> (* Hurry is beautiful up here, Love with all the trimmings, It's not you, and the title song)
