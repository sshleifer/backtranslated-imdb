Jaws rip off is the trashiest of all Italian "genres", and director Joe D'Amato loses only to the great Jess Franco on the junk production charts. Put the two together and what do you get? A gigantic piece of trash, of course. Unfortunately, it's not rubbish in the good sense of the word, as Deep Blood offers more in boredom than in hilarity. For the credit of the movie, it actually tries something bordering on a plot; but get that credit from the movie - the plot is crap. It has something to do with a group of friends taking an oath (of friendship) and then an Indian curse that manifests itself in a shark. Or at least I think that's what was happening. Anyway, most of the film is filled with tedious dialogue and 'drama', and the shark himself - who does not forget, is the only thing we really want to see - is only in a special participation. Or even that, since most sharks are really filming! Despite being a garbage genre, there are actually lots of fun Jaws rip-offs; but with this, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he could not bother trying, and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark film of all time. Avoid that scum.
