Many questions arise about the making of this film. The first one is: why make a movie that is just a strange female fantasy? It's one thing to leave a troubled audience to discuss the intent of a movie, it's something completely different to get into the process of writing a script that can not adequately handle real human problems before they're displayed on screen. <br /> <Why the scandalously melodramatic and often comical soundtrack? Why is dialogue excessive and often clumsy? Why is the main character's girlfriend one of the hooded hijackers? What is the purpose of transforming the freedom of the main character of the abduction into a joke by making him complete his "mission"? (This is a classic moment of the Little Aussie Film. Turn to the quirky comedy at the most inappropriate time.) Why so many scenes where absolutely nothing happens? (That's responsible for about 15 minutes of the movie, which is at least 30 minutes too long.) Why, if a man is arrested for so many days, does he struggle to make a serious attempt to escape? The director, who co-wrote the screenplay, failed in many ways to deliver a satisfying story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
