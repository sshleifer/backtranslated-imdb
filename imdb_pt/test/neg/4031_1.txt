This was so bad I had to turn it off in the end. I've never watched such a pathetic movie. I love B movies and was looking forward to more of the same, but was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> This has the worst acting / plot / direction / writing, etc ...... of anything I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who thinks or sees / buys / rents, does not go there!
