Hulk Hogan stars as a champion wrestler (a real real actor ...) named Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation who wanted him to sign on their network (Because wrestling sells! ) however, when Rip declines, the network gets a circuit fight championship called (and I'm totally serious) "Battle of the tough guys" who is champion Zeus (Tiny Lister Jr) perhaps the most deadly man alive. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and placed in a hospital. No Holds Barred is basically what I expected from Vince McMahon's production, starring the less versatile actor in the action genre (Hogan). It's basically a lot of unintentional humor, tons of awkward sequences, some action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it is no different from the struggle itself, so I give a fair note, mainly because someone renting it knows what they are getting. The movie is cheap but well done enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy it. I myself found this ultimately hilarious. They are moments of such absurdity that you only laugh at yourself. (Like the way Hogan jumps 20 feet into the air after getting stuck in a limo, as he forces a guy to cheat and of course, the way Hogan recites from his cuecard. "when this check is released!") At Holds Barred it's a lot of fun, it's true, although it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. Camp fans should really like this smart clinker. 4- (fair)
