Or that's what moviemakers would like you to believe, anyway. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to be so hard to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everything from the look of the film, cinematography, editing, dialogue and acting, is all about super cool mode. Just to make sure no one misses how cool this movie is, there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll songs and a violent Mexican surf-tex guitar playing constantly throughout the movie. As a final reminder of how cool this movie is, all the actors were told to speak hoarsely, because, as we all know, this is fucking. <br /> <br /> The plot (if indeed there is one) seems quite simple. But as someone else has pointed out, the director and star of the film, seems ferociously determined not to tell this story, instead focusing on a plethora of nude girls and dialogues who are supposed to be tough, but tire surprisingly fast (they have a contest for see how many times they could cram the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and their derivatives into an 80-minute movie?). <br /> <br /> This movie was absolutely horrible.
