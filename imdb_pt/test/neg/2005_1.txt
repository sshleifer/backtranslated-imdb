This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen! My husband and I have over 600 DVDs, most of which are science fiction and horror films that are not top-notch, but still fun. Dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming quality! The writing was horrible, and the acting was even worse. It took us 3 attempts to pass the entire movie because we could only tolerate it in 30-minute intervals. We thought it must certainly improve ... we were wrong. I would rather see a corpse being embalmed than having to go through it again !!! When that was over, my husband and I just stared at each other like "Uh ... is that it?" The end looked like there should be more, but they ran over their apparent $ 500 budget and they were like, "Oh shit ... we're broke ... finish now ... fast ... make credits!"
