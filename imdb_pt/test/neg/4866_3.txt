This movie begins with a pedestrian mount before trampling the standard type of suspense action, where an office worker continues to beat up trained secret service men, etc. <br /> <br /> I could not say that the acting was bad - there were some good faces "surprised" by Hamilton and Sheen - but I really would not need it. <br /> <br /> The laughable ending at least gave me a good laugh at my pains. Still, if my life was blinking before my eyes, I think it would go fast for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two more lines of text just to publish this thing. Yes, very tough suit that the gloss uses. I made a special promise to myself to never watch such a bad movie again.
