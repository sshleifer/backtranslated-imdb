This film is a window into the world of Britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, cigarettes and birds. I was actually in Pontins Prestatyn while this was being filmed, so it's fascinating to see where I was on vacation as a child, and what a world we left behind. The plot, as it is, concerns Stan and Jack's attempts to turn a job into a holiday camp (Â£ 25 a week!) On an opportunity to chase down young women and end up with Blakey. They join the rest of Stan's family and some laughs are Arthur (Michael Robbins) and Olive (Anna Karen) persistent chuntering, as well as Blakey's oddity, but the idea that young women would see anything desirable in brilliant Stan (Reg Varney) or Lewd Jack (Bob Grant) is just laughable. Harmless enough in his time, now it's just a curiosity from a bygone era.
