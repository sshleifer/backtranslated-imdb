totally useless ... having been there, done that with the subject I have to say it captures the atmosphere of clubbing in absolutely no respect. This could have happened if the characters had not just been mouthpieces of incredibly terrible and unreal conversations. So many embarrassing scenes that shamed The Office (not a compliment to this movie). It may also have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a comment, anything. Seriously, Kevin & Perry Go Large had more to say about the subject than this movie (term used very loosely in this case). There should be fewer numbers reserved for movies like this. -10 (extra shit)
