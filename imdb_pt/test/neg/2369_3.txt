The film version of 'Rising Damp' came out two years after the end of the television series. Like many fans, I went to the movies when it opened. I left bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell could not have spent much time writing the script; most are rehashed ideas from old episodes. At the time of the release of the film, the series 'Rising Damp' was still being repeated regularly in I.T.V. so the audience was being asked to pay to see something they had already seen. At least the films 'On The Buses' had original scripts. <br /> <br /> Second, Richard Beckinsale had died the previous year, so they eliminated the character of 'Alan' as a mark of respect by replacing the art student. John ', played by Christopher Strauli of the fame of' Only When I Laugh '. It just was not the same. <br /> <br /> As another poster pointed out, Rigsby's pension was nothing like the one used in the series, being bigger and totally cleaner. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'Cassino Royale', a film steeped in surreal humor. 'Rising Damp' also has its quota of fantasy sequences 'Walter Mitty' style, like the parody 'Saturday Night Fever'. Personally, I found them terribly out of place. A case of 'over-egging the pudding'. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Leonard Rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the decadent 'Rigsby', as are Frances De La Tour as 'Ruth' and Don Warrington as Philip. It's just a shame the film is not worthy of its talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by I.T.V. as a tribute, with his final scene - showing Rigsby lying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interest of good taste.
