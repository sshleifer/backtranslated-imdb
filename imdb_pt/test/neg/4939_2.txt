Hi, today I looked at this movie because of the medium (5.6) IMDb rating. I thought it would be worth seeing. Also the reviews here were pretty laid back but after getting to see this movie I quickly realize that this movie is not in any way close to a 5.6! It's just annoying. You can describe the movie with a few words is also just the story of the standard horror movie with all the scenes of standard horror movies. I do not know why people still like these movies or because they vote better in these movies than a 1-3 in IMDb. Just a few examples <br /> <br /> A bunch of people coming from somewhere or going / driving anywhere. They find themselves somehow stranded on their journey, but hey, maybe they're just nice to hang out with. Then a very important scene for every horror movie "Oh my cell phone is not working oh oh my too .. it's weird, but we do not need them, so enjoy our ride ..." uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange strange psycho we all sit down and shout a little until he starts cutting parts of us or killing some of us. After a while the bunch of victims get a gun or chance to escape the crime they never think of running away or even killing the psycho if they have a chance to talk about what to do until the psychopath has his gun back with anyone of the handfuls of standard tricks that they took in these movies and all running back as usual ... screaming ... a little more to kill ... ah and in the end gets really going out sometimes the bad guy sometimes wins some of the victims can escape great movies. ... OK, if I've never seen a movie of this type, I'd say it's a movie that can be watched, but if someone has seen a movie of its kind, it should be a waste of time because almost everything in the movie you know before even watching it, because it always functions as the standard shematic horror movie. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there? Horrormoviemaker 2.0? You can simply pull out some adjustment knobs and pick up the new type of Shuttle movie, Saw45674, Jeepers Creepers.
