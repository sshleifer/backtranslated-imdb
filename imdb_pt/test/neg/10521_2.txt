This stinker is in a mystifying spin on a channel here, and I found myself watching horrified again and again. The script is like something someone would invent with lots of drinks, and the production values ​​combine wonderfully. <br /> <br /> It's a kid's movie, but it features a grotesque (and poorly accounted) kidnapping. scene; the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by other actors; and in general it has the appearance of being filmed in someone's yard (the climax football game presents no more than three dozen extras sadly clapping in the background). <br /> <br /> Even everything closes with reduced budgets. - Following the narration, when the story, to the relief of someone, simply stops. Top appraisers here should be the producers - or most of the extras in the football game!
