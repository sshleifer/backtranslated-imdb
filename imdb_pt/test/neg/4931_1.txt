This movie is stupid, made by stupid people. I think the plot works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions these characters do are insanely stupid! How, incredibly non-sensational stupid to grade Nth! Basically, the entire movie consists of 4 idiots being repeatedly captured, despite having many, many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. It does not make sense lick and is not entertaining either. Stabbing yourself in the eye is more rational and probably more fun than watching it. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS **** The ending is hilarious !! The only good part of the movie! I almost burst out laughing in the end! All this stupid movie, and ends with the dumb girl being dispatched in a crate for white slavery in Asia !! Hilarious! I thought it was a totally awesome ending to a really fun movie.
