From director Barbet Schroder, I think I saw a bit of that in my Media Studies class, and I recognized the lead actress, so I tried, despite critical review. Basically, cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away without the police finding them . Investigating the murder is Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) homicide detective with his new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are very confused by the evidence found on the scene, for example. unrelated hair. The plan does not seem to be going well because Cassie and Sam quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a question of whether they can influence them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, RD Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can now see Sir Alfred Hitchcock's concept of Rope with murder for a challenge, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being monotonous and predictable. Suitable!
