Wow. I felt like I needed to bathe after watching this one, but maybe there were other reasons I will leave to your imagination. I felt accustomed and abused after spanking, I mean watching that movie. Hairy hair, thick mustaches, and well, hairy everything describes this movie of pornography / terror, but hey, it was 1981, you can not call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without the hair. <br /> <br /> Like a horror movie, it bites. But as a piece of exploration / pornography of Italy's rich film history, it definitely has a place in my library. The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles. I wish I had the English very poorly christened, I think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. The only white guy who fucks in the movie is "Mark Shannon" - he's the macho macho, a hairy machismo who really tries and does a performance every time he "goes up and down." This was at the end of an era where porn producers were really trying to do something artistic. Nothing like moving the camera from a tropical setting to a furry man with "puppy" sex with a woman. I can not help laughing. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that I pray that my future wife and children will never find.
