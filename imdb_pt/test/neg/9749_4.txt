This is probably the only movie I've seen where IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is an atrocious and stupid movie, absolutely without any artistic merit, and is a slander for a director like John Landis. And that's what makes it great. To appreciate "The Stupid," you should keep in mind a small, little-known maxim spoken by director Abo Kyrou: "I recommend you learn to look at bad movies, they are so often sublime." For any movie to work, the film must establish and follow its own logic, and if you do it convincingly and honestly, it is possible that the movie works. For example, when you watch "Freddy Got Fingered" as a traditional comedy, it's complete and absolute rubbish; when you watch with the understanding that it's really a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If Jaws had not accepted the reality it created, the end of the air tank explosion would not have worked. But, many people think "Shark" is overrated for this kind of reason, and they are not wrong. But you have your strength, do not you? The point is that such a movie makes sense if you look at it with the right perspective. Some people, like me, understand this immediately, while others never go, no matter how many times this is explained. Jim Jarmusch made a convincing defense of "Showgirls" once, and even after that I still can not see it in his P.O.V. It does not mean he's wrong. If you have the right mindset when you watch this movie (and I DO NOT HAVE MEEN SECOND, I'll put you in bed now), you can really enjoy the movie for the stupid, cheap, nonsense antics. 80's style farce / early 90's that is. <br /> <br /> The film's defenders and enemies are right: it's STUPID, and that's the point. The film accepts the stupidity of the characters in the same way that "The Jerk" accepted the idiocy of Navin Johnson. And because it takes this and runs with it, the film focuses exclusively on using that to route the plot and set the characters. A "bad" movie would actually do that and stop using that logic correctly; bad movies are bad because they make the movie, while movies like "The Stupid" know where they are going, what they are doing and why from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can not defend the movie. from the artistic point of view, and that's why I give such a low grade. The acting is largely bad, the jokes are too shallow and the quality of live action is likely to ruin what would have worked as a cartoon. But I can not deny that it's fun in your own way, and that's why I stand for it. I understood immediately, and I feel sorry for those who do not. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was attracted to this movie because of Christopher Lee's delightful appearance (I heard him say "Let the bee down!" would have been worth the rent, even if I hated this movie), but I was impressed to discover that in addition to the Studio Applause Sign segment with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored and never disappointed. In fact, many of the jokes, because of their cartoon context, were hilarious (in particular but they were funny, and the movie is not meant to be anything else: a stupid comedy about stupid characters, and instead of apologizing for it, it takes advantage of it. <br /> < and that's exactly why it works.
