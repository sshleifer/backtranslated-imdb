The first two hours of the televised version are full of characters and plot exposure - after a brief string of Las Vegas being hit by tornadoes, the action does not really begin until the last two hours. Still, some character relationships do not become clear until the second part. The actors perform in competent performances, but nothing special (however, better than those in "Aftershock: Earthquake in New York"). One exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. The plot is a fairly standard mix of parts of "Independence Day," "Speed," "The Day After Tomorrow," "Earthquake," "High Inferno," and several other films. You can predict what will happen next and come close to predicting the dialogue, word for word. The special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the "Twister" effects, the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than "The Wizard of Oz" and other effects were obviously made for less money than shows like "CSI" and "Cold Case" spend on the film. totality of a single episode. If you have to watch a disaster movie made for TV, watch "The Day After", "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin" - you will have more plots, performances and effects.
