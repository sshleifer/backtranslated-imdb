It seems that all companies that are taken with the taxes taken by Romania by image, grant the image that disappears since 1994. They hardly try to obtain the oldest car that they founded, but never they take photos of the Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin and all the new Mercedes that are more what you can find in some important countries. A second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in Bucharest, where they had the possibility to clear the streets and put garbage in dressing people with I do not know maybe '90 clothes' making them look so stupid that you will realize that the script was maybe a second hand bought from ebay or worth it. <br /> <br /> I hope for the future to continue making films in the US and to make good money there than to give us a little and embarrass our country. I have no reason to believe that anyone will understand the message ( besides my English ---: sorry)
