I'm a big fan of demonic puppets. Looking at the surface of this, looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, the puppets and a new villain in TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk who is doing this project to animate inanimate objects, can not act. He stinks! Your girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. The TOTEM I'd watch for two hours. But instead, the role of the puppets is played down, and the whole movie suffered because of it. The mystical face of the Skull that created the totem is at best, and the appearance of Decapitrons has been long awaited, short and indeed very disappointing. You'd better watch the first one again.
