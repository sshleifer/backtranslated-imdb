Maybe I've seen a clean version, but beyond a few breasts flashes, I'm not sure what about the superior nudity that these other commentators are referring to. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as I was hoping for the previous reviews, although the end leaves you wondering ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you could not see the scenes, and I think that only added to the shiver and terror of the situation. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent. <br /> <br /> All in a decently scary movie (and yes, brutal) with a disappointing ending.
