I do not usually write reviews, in fact, I never write reviews. This movie was so atrocious that really inspired me to start. Virtual sexuality tries to be a lightweight and daring adolescent comedy about the usual traps; virginity, boys etc., except the main character, apparently turns into her perfect boy she created using the help of a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Does it look interesting? Well, it's not. The acting is the most disheartening and shocking I have ever seen. Most pitiful is that they seem to genuinely support the script and the film, which probably explains why I've never seen them in any memorable production since. I did not bother to learn the names of the actors, nor their characters. The lady of burden does not enchant or enchant you, and so you do not care about her. The male friend of the protagonist does not show sympathy, even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. The only increase he will get from you is extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half-decent actor was the blond leader, who, despite his miserably weak role, really gave everything he could, which was not much in the face of such horrible work. I will not even talk about the abomination of acting that are the "bandits" of the plot. But then again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I watched this film unfold in disbelief, as I had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script, never produce, act and direct it. I can only imagine. The only reason why me and my companion continued to watch such an embarrassing movie example was the incredulous laughter that he managed to emerge from us as cohesion, logic, class and even a helpless story were discarded in half an hour after the movie. I have no idea why anyone wanted to rape the film industry by releasing it to the public. This is a joke from a movie and it is best to leave the dust in the warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 of 10. If that.
