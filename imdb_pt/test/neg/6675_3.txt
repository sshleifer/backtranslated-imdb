Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a cop with a history of rogue criminals, is recruited into a clandestine elite division of the LAPD. That does not match Jeff's girlfriend, reporter Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a story in the cast. Soon Jeff's conscience gets the better of him, which puts him at odds with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, "Hunt for the Red October" and "Backdraft"), the leader of the unit. <br /> <br /> A routine, I dare say mundane, police / drama that brings no surprises thanks to a cookie cutter plot that is content to go strictly from point A to point B. The acting is good for what the actors received to work however, this is no real reason to watch the film. It's sad to see how the six films directed earlier by Mark L. Lester just before him (from the 1984 Class to the Showdown in Little Tokyo) were all highly entertaining vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Chelsea Field briefly topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
