I got this movie for fifty cents on a business exit. I want my fifty cents back. Bad acting, poor script, bad direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the movie is horrible. It is not the subject that offends. I'm one of the many who find thriller movies and real crime films to be very interesting. The subject could have been treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect shown by the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to confuse anyone. In addition, there is little or no attention to what might have led someone to begin the bizarre behavior that Ed Gein was exhibiting while doing these horrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save your time and sanity. Do not watch this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. Not a total waste ... you can throw away the disc and use the plastic case!
