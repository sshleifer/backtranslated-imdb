"Yesterday" as a movie is difficult to assess. Cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. The story is hard and real and does not compromise. But the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the work of the camera. As a person who was born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's visual and honesty. representation of everyday life in Zulu. But this and the camera work are not enough to recommend that the average viewer see this movie. It takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of Yesterday. Unlike the 1980 film "The Gods Must Be Crazy," which was a comical look at an African culture that comes across modern technology, "Yesterday" is not meant to appeal to any audience -target. The film simply does not suit the common Western mind - and I doubt it was intended for the Western mind. The scenes are long and slow, the edition is not marked by a world of 60 mph instant gratification. The dialogue is not clever or witty, it's real. Films about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment, it's education. <br /> <br /> This film is best viewed by those who know, appreciate and love the way of life and culture in sub-Sarah Africa. If you do not have a world view wide enough to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, you should skip this movie. Do not waste time on this. Go see "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy," instead, for his cross-cultural view. <br /> <br /> I give 4 to most of those who want to see the film, but do not have a precise understanding of African cultures. . For viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world, I would give a 7.
