Often the description "full of sound and fury meaning nothing" is used and is on target. Unfortunately, Code 46 has no sound or fury. A little fury would have been much appreciated. The character of Tim Robbins (William) is so lacking in passion that the idea of ​​him falling instantly in love with Mary (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so impatient they begin to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with the torazina. There is a kind of "Brave New World" atmosphere in the movie that is aided by every scene being filmed at about 2 to 3 overexposed spots. Unfortunately this technique is tedious and quite difficult for the eyes. The fluffy mixture of tongues also becomes boring when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence. Many futuristic science fiction films are criticized for being all flash and without substance. This movie has no flash or substance. It's a 6 code all the way.
