Maybe this movie was intended to be a satire like 'Airplane', but failed as miserably as it failed to be a 'thriller'. I do not understand why they could not have paid a real pilot a few hundred dollars for a little technical advice. Hell, I would have done it for free! This magic aircraft managed to turn from 757 to 767 to 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backwards. And the dialog box sounds like it's the end of the 'phone' children's game, where everyone speaks different languages. I actually rewound the TIVO and watched a little of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as I thought at first. That was it.
