Obviously, someone was looking to catch the "Blair Witch" wave. <br /> <br /> This movie was created like all the haunted "reality" shows that have been appearing on TV lately (and I must admit, I have fun with it), but this movie is MUCH more cheesy! Probably the first three quarters of the movie are filled with the "participants" passing by the house, WHINING. Give me some time! Spending 10 whining minutes about climbing into the attic is not my idea of ​​a good time. Any paranormal events are blatant configurations. No strings, but very perfectly captured on camera to be real. The "participants" were not very friendly either. Two silly faces that do not take seriously, a girl who scares the fall of a hat, and the quintessence of the "paranormal" person. Is this becoming the "formula" cliché for a ghost movie? <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension. They took every ounce of tension in the film and put it in those 15 minutes. I admit, I spent this time walking in the kitchen. I really would not recommend this movie to younger viewers, even if it's the PG13. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some entertainment, if you do not take it seriously, you will enjoy this movie. There are tons of situations to make cracks! If you are looking for a great story ... look elsewhere;)
