Wow !! I did not even know about this movie until I was looking for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are best left unknown. Mark Hamill's role is quite ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this film with all those appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in those horror and horror films of the 60s and 70s. In these films they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Memorable acting for Mark with lines as big as "Do not try to run. You're stuck." I mentioned that he says that thing EXACT more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a Uzumaki type spiral of drugs and drinks after Aliens because he ended up in this movie after waking up on set after a binge session. THE HAIR .. THE HAIR !!! .. Priceless Bill. It really should have been "GAME OVER" for Bill .. but somehow .. he has treatment .. and has gone the best ??? movies. This movie blows. It's more annoying and annoying than The Crazies. At least this movie was crazy ... this is just annoying. DO NOT WATCH THIS SOUND MOVIE.
