Once upon a time, in the 1940s, there was an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful and talented young woman who has been in high demand for many big-budget Hollywood photos. Fast Forward to the late 1960s, age, alcoholism and overall bad luck have tarnished everyone's favorite actress. Now, once, Miss. Lake decides that the time has come to follow in the footsteps of her colleagues (?), Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and resort to good and reliable Horror. But meat feast? Same? It could not have been washed. To put it mildly, Flesh Feast is lifeless garbage, possibly one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. Lake plays a scientist, who is plotting, with the Nazis, to bring Hitler back to life, with experiments of restoring young people involving worms, that is, worms. Unless you're a big fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! <br /> <br /> I know very little about this person from Veronica Lake, as well as about the 1940's films, but to think that such a successful career has really become so sad, it's really very sad. Meat banquet is almost impossible to pass, and almost, I mean absolutely. Directed by Brad Grinter, director of photos at Nudist Camp, and the man who, coincidentally, brought us the biggest B movie ever made, Blood Freak, only a few years later. One has to wonder, is this what Blood Freak would have been if Grinter had not co-directed with Steve Hawkes? If so, then God bless Steve Hawkes. You would not think that a religious, bloody, monstrous desire for Turkey could be so much better than experiments involving Maggots and Hitler, but it really is. So forget you've heard of this and go find Blood Freak, you're just waiting to entertain you. Fast Forward a few years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititas, broke and forgotten. The end. I hate you, Feasth Feast. 1/10
