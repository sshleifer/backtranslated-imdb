I saw this on French TV today and was very disappointed! The film starts off reasonably well, but nothing is elucidated and in the end we are no more advanced than at the beginning. As for seeing the husband for the murder of his wife, this is not plausible. You need tangible evidence to condemn someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case, there is none, so it simply is not plausible. Remember the old saying "innocent until proven guilty." The fact that a woman disappears without a trace is not proof that her husband killed her. So I really do not know what kind of point this movie was trying to make. The result is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the viewer. So frankly, seeing this is a complete waste of time. After all, a movie should be fun ... this is completely false in the case of this movie and I suggest that it be irrevocably consigned to the bin where it belongs!
