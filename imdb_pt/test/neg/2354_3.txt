As I post this comment, IMDb currently rates Saboteur below 7.3 / 10 by Alfred Hitchcock. Personally, I rated less than half that. Honestly, I can not say how such a bad movie could have come from what is probably the most consistently good director I know of. I've seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30s and 60s. Vertigo is by far my favorite, while Saboteur is easily the worst. It's hard to believe that, seven years earlier, Hitch used the same formula in the 39 Steps with far more competence. My recommendation would be to see this instead and avoid it like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie I hung up before the end and I do not feel like coming back and seeing the rest. If you need to watch, rent or borrow. Do not make the mistake I made and buy the bona fide DVD purchased through Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc. Even a master spoils a few times, I think. EDIT: Maybe I was a little more difficult in this movie than I should have been. Surely it's nothing close to Ed Wood or Manos or something, but there are three reasons why I feel I should rate it so low: 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings with it certain expectations of quality. This movie delivers on some of them, but they are greatly overshadowed by the almost non-sensational conspiracy. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to compensate a little for all the 8+ ratings that this movie is receiving. . Hitchcock is like John Coltrane's directors. True fans will find reason to consider anything for him a work of art, but the high rating in IMDb gives movie enthusiasts more casual like me the impression that this movie is much better than it really is. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 on this. Maybe if this cost me $ 5 or even $ 10 I would probably be a little less bitter. ;)
