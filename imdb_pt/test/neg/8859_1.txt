This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It's been a few years since I've seen it and nothing has come close since then and I doubt there will ever be a produced movie that is as bad as that. He tries to make fun of a variety of different films, for example 'Nell' (!) And instead of funny it's just pathetic. Whatever you do, do not rent or for this garbage and if someone throws at you ... turn around and run to the other side !!
