That's pretty much all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of Carol Kane's 1979 vehicle. Camilla Belle is not much of an actress, and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the nanny besieged by a anonymous caller. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering around the home of the rich doctor and wife to whom she is providing her seat services, looking for the origins of strange sounds and things that continue to "crash" at night. As it lurks around the corners and through corridors, we can see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like Roman tubs, a huge kitchen with incredible lighted glass shelves and the resistance piece, an independent aviary. and a timid lake that has a self-irrigation system. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is not attractive enough to lure us into Jill's fear, we are distracted by the grandeur of the house, which is not something you should be doing when watching a thriller. Even when Jill is chased by the faceless maniac, we are distressed because she is breaking valuables and messing up the timid lake, not because she is about to be murdered. <br /> <br /> The film trails as predictably as most teen horror movies and the ending is anything but original. When it was all over, I just wanted to find out where that house was and if it was real. It does not matter that Jill and the children were babysitters. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
