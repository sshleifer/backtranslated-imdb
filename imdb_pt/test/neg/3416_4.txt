Sublime love says the title. Another synopsis during the movie promotions talked about inner versus outer beauty. Well, in this case, beauty - you decide inside or outside - is provided by sparsely veneered (or that is sparsely dressed / naked) Zeenat Aman that director Raj Kapoor called "a volcano of talent" while the film was being made . You can not accuse him of sarcasm, of course - after all he was promoting his own film. The fine plot of paper is about a woman with a disfigured face that has a well proportioned body, a great voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with whom the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. He does not want her face just her voice. The acting is desperate and even the 4 are because of the music with Lata Mangeshkar giving good numbers. The rest is clear, bunkum. Avoid - save your money. Inner beauty vs outer beauty. !!! You do not have to be an Einstein to find out which one the director was focusing on
