It's hard to make a bad movie with the sport theme "underdog finally succeeds," but this movie succeeds. My mind puzzles at how meaningless and annoying this movie is. <br /> <br /> I think the director could not decide whether it was about the hall or the coach. That ends up being about neither. Ultimately, who cares? No character has a nice personality. There's nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone. Even the "bad guy" is not too bad. (I think he's in two scenes, and apparently he's in some kind of beard). I think he asks her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him. Then later he kind of sorta asks her to live with him. that's it. Conflict! Tension! What she will do? !! <br /> <br /> -And with the depiction of running? Has the director ever seen a real marathon? Christine's form is so flawed that it's absurd, as is the form of the so-called "champion" with whom she competes. (A character without lines-Maybe they could have hired, you know, a real RUNNER?) <br /> <br/> -E speed in the race is beyond comprehension. Were they running or walking fast? It's actually laughable. I can literally walk back faster than they were running in the big race. Perhaps it was very difficult to move the cameras at real speed? <br /> <br /> Another nonsense: (spoiler, I think) At one point in the big race, the two women in the lead inexplicably fall at the same time. What they've fallen into is a mystery. Perhaps both were exhausted and fallen? "And then they get up, but do not run for maybe 30 seconds." Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not add any tension, since the other runners are not close, and in addition, you have been anesthetized in a state of catatonia. <br /> <br /> I especially liked how all four of his teammates, highly trained athletes, quit the race because of charlie horses, or pull tendons, or something as unlikely as. <br /> <br /> But who cares? This movie has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. A woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old boring coach with some past failure that is barely suggested. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train a little more. She wins the big race. Woopie <br /> <br /> My description is really more interesting than the actual movie. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this like the plague.
