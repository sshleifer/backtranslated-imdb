I really wanted to see this movie - I found the plot really unique and intriguing. A police officer (Andy Garcia) has a child who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement to live. The only match is a convicted serial killer, who escapes from prison. To save his son, he has to track down the killer. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton plays the convicted in one of the many disappointing aspects of the film. Keaton is a great actor at times, but here he is very annoying. It's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring. <br /> <br /> Garcia is better, but tries too hard for a movie that is not up to par. Barbet Schroeder (once a promising director with films like "Barfly", which practically does not come to anything in the American market) directs quite well - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here ... it's a big mess. The film finally wastes a lot of good stuff, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. What should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just a Hollywood failure of action.
