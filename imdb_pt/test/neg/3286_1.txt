The actors and actresses of this series are well, but the scripts were absolutely horrible. This family is so dysfunctional that it's not even funny. In fact, scripts very often illustrate how not being a parent. The scripts are so bad that they make Homer Simpson look like a better father than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is becoming a parent, if you want to see what not to do with your children, this program is the perfect guide. I think the garbage that this show feeds us is beyond words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport saw much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need strong leadership in better and better scripts than what I have seen up to that point. <br /> <br /> If you think this is generational, my teenager even hung up on a show because they thought it was horrible.
