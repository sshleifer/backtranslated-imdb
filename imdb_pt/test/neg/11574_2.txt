"Scientists in a remote laboratory experiment (create a scaly creature here) and create out-of-control monsters. Meanwhile, a military crack team / daughter of the scientist / bank robbers finds their way to the remote place and is threatened by creatures giants One by one they are eaten, all during an "exciting" run so as not to be blown up by the forces that initially created the monsters ... "The sad thing is that this sounds like a dozen movies that appeared on the Hi-Fi Sci Channel . Do I have to wonder what's going on? Of course ... I like bimbos and Hollywood-Hunk aspirants to be eaten by CGI creatures as much as the next person ... but where is the plot or the originality? Granted, there are times when Sci-Fi Channel shines. Battlestar Galactica, if a little dark, can be very good. Writers have continued to pump their lives for the various Stargate offerings, and the latest BBC import of Doctor Who is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Even in the various "giant animal" movies on Sci-Fi, the animation seems to be getting better all the time. Compare kommodo in this movie with the somewhat awkward version in the first giant science fiction film. <br /> <br /> But, my God ... how about a different storyline? Maybe some different, giant bug? On a whim, I started searching the internet. Among the litter, I have found some interesting stories that can appeal to FC fans and Russian CGI animators at once. I offer http://www.macrophile.com/~arilin/archive/metamorphosis-day to the network with a suggestion that they contact the author for the rights of the story. (The story contains violent images in general comparable to the various offers of science fiction channels.) <br /> <br /> The story has a sub-labeled, ethical and moral commentary on the nature of mankind and does not end in one of those horrible "do they really kill all the monsters ???" moments, but leaves you guessing completely and with a completely different mindset. <br /> <br /> Which is usually what science fiction should do, right?
