Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s, NEW YOUTH VITORIANS, where he looked at the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He selected these writers as the popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian period, and explained his strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are very relevant to this day, but like all criticism, gives an idea of ​​the spirit of the critical life times as well. <br /> <br /> Cecil thought hard about George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross). ), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). But for most modern readers, they are generally familiar with their shorter book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in some high school curriculum. The other books, FELIX HOLT THE RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENES OF LIFE CLERIC, are still in print (penguin, for example, have most of them printed), but are in the most unread. Of most interest today is her latest novel, DERONDA, where she discusses the Jews in English society and an incipient type of pre-Hertzl Zionism. ROMOLA is his only attempt at historical romance (on the Savanarola experience of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). His most fleshy novel is MIDDLEMARCH, which is concerned about English society in the provinces in 1832, the year of the great Bill of Lord Gray Reformation. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH in college for a literature course. It is certainly a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most mature book in the English language). But she suffers (like all Eliot's novels) from a defect - she can not write exciting and exciting prose. While Dickens is overly exuberant at times, and Thackeray can become pompous and wordy, and Trollope may become (as Lord Cecil says) very common in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte may fail to explain certain relationships well, and Ms. Gaskell it seems best to deal with female characters, all of them (and Emily Bronte in her unique novel) retain the reader's interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to decipher phrases from marble blocks with a toothpick! <br /> <br /> To this day, I read about fifty pages of MILL OF THE FLOSS. I realize one of the other reviewers never finished the novel either. But I read a synopsis of what it is. The Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central figures - they own the mill in the title. Despite being close at the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with the son of a neighbor whose father is involved in legal difficulties with Mr. Tulliver. Mr. Tom has an obscure view of this relationship, and the tragedy of the story is about the split between the brothers, culminating in his death at the end (Maggie rushes back to the mill to rescue Tom during a heavy flood, and they die together). It must have been a success with Victorian readers, but it is very bleak and depressing for the modern public. Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies at the end with her lover and Tom (James Mason) records her deaths at the end of her book of records. The story is fully rewritten, except for a double death in the flood at the conclusion. This really does not help at all. Although Fitzgerald and Mason do very well with their parts, they can not really pull the film by their work alone. The end result is a relatively small film, which fortunately did not detract from the leader's careers. The only other thing to note is that the boyfriend was played by Frank Lawton, who two years earlier played David Copperfield as an adult, starring opposite W.C. Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But in fact, Lawton never had a great career in filmmaking - he was simply always around for photos, some good, some mediocre.
