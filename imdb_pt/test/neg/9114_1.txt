I had a ten-second bad feeling in the movie as a couple of overworked weeds (probably left over from a bad western) exploded throughout the scene. The bad presentiment grew ten seconds later, when the obligatory embrace of sacrifice that turned into human, for no apparent reason, lowered the rearview mirror to see a shadow in the backseat. For the next five minutes over the opening credits, we are presented with a photo of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic music made for the TV informs us that a death is happening, not a catch-up session. For the next 27 hours, we are treated with two psychotic idiots who, for some reason, seem forced to travel together through the southwest desert, going after each other like an insane abbot and Costello. Even with the "shocking" twists in the end, we are just left to shake our heads and ask ourselves if the producers and the director / writer are as embarrassed and embarrassed as they should be by creating such inconsistent and incoherent nonsense.
