To judge a film only by the landscapes, decoration, costumes ... is not right, you are missing the core: THE HISTORY A movie has to narrate something, tell a story, something that impresses you . Yes, I was happy with the sea, cliffs, clear waters and everything, but ... Is there a plot? <br /> <br /> They are more interesting films with crazy people, like: FLIGHT OVER THE CUCKOO "S NEST ... etc ... etc. This is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than her children or her husband Just a clear case of psychiatry Nothing extraordinary Unfortunate waste of time Is there all that anger coming Fish smell Sea?
