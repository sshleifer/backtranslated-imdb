I can not understand why anyone would allow an under-par director to put these things on the celluloid. This movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than that ("Here Comes Mr. Jordan" - 1941, and "Heaven Can Wait" - 1978). The only saving factor for skating fans may have been a nice ice skating made by a professional squad of skaters, but that just does not happen. The closest thing the public sees to good skating is when Tara Lipinski's character takes a glimpse of the ice for a moment. Others like Nancy Kerrigan and Elvis Stojko are hidden in the background and do not do any figure skating. There's not a lot of real emotion being shown, and there's really no reason to tune in to this obviously made-for-TV movie. My advice: rent the original.
