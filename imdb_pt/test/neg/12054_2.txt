Well, what can I say. WHAT F ** K? There really is not much to say about it. The only way you'd like this is if you, like me, like bad horror to laugh at. <br /> <br /> ACT-VERY INCONVENIENT! Just watch the last scene with the top actresses running! Texas Tear CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just horrible! <br /> <br /> Gore - It really is not believable. In one scene they use one of those knives that have a cut piece of them that fit into a part of the body, etc. Using that, with the addition of red ketchup, his supposed two seem real, though they do not really look like one. "Plot" children's movie "gets lost in woods at camp weekend" stolen from Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Assassin Quality - scary mask if you're afraid of clowns, kind of unbelievable that someone would choose this as his fantasy however. The director obviously realized that all good clothes had been used in all the other horror movie films out there. <br /> <br /> TOTAL - 3/10 * / ***** ps - stay away from CAMP BLOOD II that made it look like the LORD OF RINGS.
