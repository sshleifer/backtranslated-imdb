Little did I know that when I signed up for the all pay channel package with Direct TV, I was facing a movie like that. It happened right after another movie we were watching ... and I was a teenager in 1981 so I'm not sure where I was at the time ... but I missed that movie. <br /> <br /> I also can not believe we left her. It's funny, because it takes you back to the time machine for the early '80s ... but I think even so, this would be a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "very cute"! ET was "cute" in a way ... but not obnoxiously cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this ... I go into IMDb to see what others are saying. I am impressed that this thing was named! Wow ... the film industry has come a long way since the 80's! Oh well ... he showed some old actors ... by the way, it's the other thing that surprised me ... the lineup ... not a bunch of non-names ... but some real actors. It must have been on your drug days! Anyway ... weird, interesting, bizarre and makes a happy they grew up!
