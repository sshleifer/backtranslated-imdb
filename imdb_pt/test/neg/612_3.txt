I've been a Carpenters fan for a long time, read the bio, watched the specials and saw Karen Carpenter Story. This movie did not really show the real Karen Carpenter. In the film, she seems to be shy and practically lonely (with the exception of a girlfriend). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. She was outgoing and nice. She had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts at a solo album and her meeting with Phil Ramone and his wife, Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she consulted a psychologist, but she was a volunteer, and once a day, she went out to the hotel room. In addition, Karen was taking pills to boost her thyroid so that she could lose weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist did not recommend either. In addition, Karen's husband in the film is called Bob Knight, but in real life was called Tom Burris. In addition, Karen did not divorce Tom, but only broke up. Karen would sign the divorce papers the day she died. In addition, Agnes found Karen naked in the closet, unlike the movie in which she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend seeing.
