Oh God! It can be a very interesting film and it actually is. I would like to give 5, but I give 2 for my vote. Because? I saw it in a theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really very poor !!!!! It keeps shaking all the time, in a completely tasteless frame! <br /> <br /> It's really painful to see this very interesting movie in a movie theater. You were quickly nauseous and you have to make a great effort not to vomit on your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's really a shame because the story is edited in a non-linear way, which is pretty rare (and a good idea!) for a documentary. <br /> <br /> See this at home!
