I've seen the movie many times, and every time I'm more and more disappointed, which is a shame, because EX YU movies are usually very good. The shame here is that Holiwood tried to make movies about the place and people who have no idea. Myself coming from the Balkans (Macedonia) found the film disappointing. It is clear that the Bosnian characters are not really understood and are not really portrayed. To understand an EX YU person's mentality, you need to know your past, your way of life, what makes you cry and laugh. And the director of the film did not take that as a guide. When we (EX YU) make films, many symbolisms are built into it, which makes the characters recognizable and pleasing, and mostly portray the truth (if it is based on true story). The films like "Pritty village, pretty flame", "Tito and Me", "Underground", "No mans land", "Before the rain", "Black cat, white cat", "Otac na sluzbenom putu" the father was off to work), "Ko to tamo peva" (Who sings there?) Rare for the masterpiece of Balkan cinematography, and nothing can compare to it. Not the story of half of Holiwood's studio. As someone from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other. Excuse me, but when the film is made it is not just for the variety of spectators of American armchairs, but for the rest of the world as well, and some of them live in the Balkans and in Sarajevo as well. for the injury, half of things are filmed in Bitola, Macedonia, where I come from Imagen my shock when I saw the Broad Street of Bitola in the river ng movie scene, when the bride is to shoot from sniper.And what was that a insertion of actual images of the news coverage in the film? Anyway very disappointing, as the truth is far from the movie. Shame no one consulted real people like living in Sarajevo under fire, before filming the movie. book is one thing and real life is another, and this film leaves both.
