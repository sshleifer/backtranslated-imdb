I rented this movie because I'm a big fan of Dudikoff. I realized that it could not be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15-minute mark, I was begging the others to let me rip the DVD and throw it back to the store, but they refused. They swore they had to get better. <br /> They were wrong! This movie was missing everything. The actors delivered their speeches with as much emotion as a rock in a coma! The plot was ridiculous and I was offended by Hollywood having assumed that people were idiots enough to have fun. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T gives one of his worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After watching the filming of the wrong airplane, thugs getting up to take a shot, and clips being emptied and losing everything, I wanted to scream and hit head on the concrete. The film hit its plateau of ignorance when people at the space station used an elevator to travel. Space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space, no matter what real astronauts might say. <br /> <br /> I did not finish this movie and I hated it. I do not want to end this movie. This is a slow suicide. I could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture I passed.
