I did not like this movie. I rented it hoping it was something like the 10th Kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered that it was not. I also thought it was just a nervousness. The acting was bad, the characters were unbelievable and the jumps in time were crazy. I only recommend this movie if you're in the mood to see a crazy guy running around, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can not believe I wasted my time on this.
