This film worked together with some of the most predictable stories and superficial characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the book "How to Write a Space Disaster Film" and followed the game. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - exhibiting courageously in the face of disaster - has been made several times. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that producers would throw $ 50 million into the project. But judging by the second half of the film, which contained countless useless attempts at special effects, producers only managed to raise $ 50,000. To know that the film was nominated for a "Special Visual Effects," the Emmy made me absolutely shocked. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of high school students with a Media Studies pass could have created more believable effects. And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Now, I'm not a NASA specialist, but it's certainly highly implausible that a worker attached to the bus simulator suddenly has a position of power in the control room when things start to get in pear shape with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced in Mission Control that the Program Director would call instead of a twenty-nine-year-old who has not been in the control room before. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace for this movie is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt to save something from the train wreck that is this script. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10, with Bill Campbell's above-average work in the leading role saving him from an inferior brand.
