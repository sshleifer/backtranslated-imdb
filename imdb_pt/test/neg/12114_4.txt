Of course, this movie was delayed. But you expected it the moment you looked at the cover box. It's a B movie and on the T & A factor this movie was delivered. In fact, it was funnier than expected. Although it has not been a comic genius work, like "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo", with regard to B movies, it was worth watching if you like that sort of thing anyway. <br /> <br /> Christians and morally oriented parenting groups, this is mild adult fun. If you do not want your kids to watch sexual content and nudity, you should keep your kids away from that movie.
