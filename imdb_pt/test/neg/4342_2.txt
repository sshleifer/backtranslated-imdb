A "B" thriller "B" from the early 1950's, the story is fun, the wooden characters, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sexpots that catch your eye, but a short shot with only a few pictures shows a "el" train crossing the river on State Street Bridge, from the Pullman 6000 Series cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme, as they were delivered when new in 1950. For drift fans like me, that draw makes the photo count the penalty. I think movies like this, DETOUR from Ulmer, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, The Fugitive with Harrison Ford, and others of the genre film crime, make it interesting, if only for the fact that I know Chicago and San Francisco intimately and I recognize the most of the street Locations. Another sage is a really fun boring movie!
