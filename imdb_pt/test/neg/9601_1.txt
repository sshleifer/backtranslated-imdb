Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman make up a list of good actors should be smoking something I'd love to try someday. Where to start: awful soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" in some places. This is the typical woody food written up and for which the love of never-been to star. I really felt embarrassed by the "stars" in this "movie". The only dictator left to get over this bullshit was Gary Coleman, who, if he had been in the movie, would have done at least somewhat frighteningly bad, rather than simply bad. <br /> There was a part. in the movie where Carol Alt yelled, "You think I'm an idiot ?!" Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does, and PLEASE, for the love of all that is decent and sacred ... STOP And stop degrading yourself like that! This movie is something that Anna Nicole Smith would attend. <br /> <br /> I would tell you what the plot was, but that would be another sentence fragment for this article, plus my mind drift many times during the movie. anyway, so I barely paid attention.
