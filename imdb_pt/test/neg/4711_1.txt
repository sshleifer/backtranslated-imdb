Terrible acting, terrible script, totally unrealistic. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway exemplifies the clich√©s and sentimentality that movie studios love to shake the throats of viewers. Elijah Wood is unimaginably bad in the lead role, and the plot points are artificial and sentimental. Cook and Wood's relationship is laughable at best. But the worst element of Bumblebee is the script. This is one of the most incredibly bad dialogues I've ever had the misery of listening to. Bumblebees, actually crawling inside my ears and pricking my eardrums, would be preferable to hear Elijah Wood robotically spit their pseudo-deep lines. I wish a "Bumblebee Project" would run on me, so I could happily not have memories of that stink.
