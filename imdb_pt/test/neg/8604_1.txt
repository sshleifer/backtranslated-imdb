I found myself watching the Sex Lives Of The Potato men with a frown, puzzled that so many talented and witty comedians decided to get involved in a movie so utterly devoid of humor. <br /> <br /> Poo and masturbation jokes are funny. when you are eleven years old Eighteen more and you start losing friends around the water cooler. <br /> <br /> Maybe have a little fun with this movie if you're the kind of person who often makes jokes involving dog mess, brown bags and games, or maybe attend 'man' competitions on nights out by soak up vomiting / urine fellow comrades etc when you're not back in the basement of your parents punching your teenage wife. <br /> <br /> Even so "Sex Lives ..." is difficult to recommend. Maybe, if you're really strangely at masochistic cranial surgery and spend your happy nights hitting the elderly or seeing toilets, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of a movie distribution. <br /> <br /> I discussed characterization, narrative or performances if I had not completely zoned after the long comparison between tuna paste and vagina.
