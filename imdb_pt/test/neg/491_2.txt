The sleazy (glam) rock of the 80's is like house music from the 90's or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that a long time ago, so we can laugh at its foolishness. It's a shame that 'Rock Star' does not have any laughs, as it must have been one of the most boring movies of the last few years. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he gets kicked out of the band at the same time that the real Steel Dragon singer is also kicked, he becomes the next vocalist. You already know how this will end up at the time, with Chris losing with sex, drugs and r & r and forgetting his longtime girlfriend / manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There's way too much music (boring) in this standard excuse full of formulas for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. Watch Almost Famous (Over-rated, but still more fun) instead, or better still, a movie about real people playing real music with real emotions, That Thing You Do. What the fuck! 2/10
