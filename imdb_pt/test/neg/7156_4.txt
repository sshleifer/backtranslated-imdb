I really expected the best with this, but it just did not happen. Funded in a very Dutch way and still great, with a style and rhythm that is very much like Hollywood. What I do not understand is how - with all these great benefits - the director, writer, producer still managed to make this film a completely awful sight to watch. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who simply can not really speak [act] in the English language. Kudo is to get him out, but what this guy was thinking!
