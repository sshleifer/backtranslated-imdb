for me, this is not a good TV show, excited or not. However, it is annoying to the nth degree. There are some reasons for this, in no particular order. First, the introduction of one of the most useless, and annoying characters of all time, the character Batmite.this is not for the show, whatever. maybe it's a comic relief, but it does not work like that. Up, the Joker. I thought it was really ridiculous to have your character loosen up with this ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence. Maybe it's repetitive. It ages really fast. I also do not think the actor was entitled to the character's voice. It just does not sound like the joker should Ultimately make Robin look like a complete idiot. other than these problems, the show is not so bad. But these are big enough problems to drastically reduce the sympathy factor. For me, "The new adventures Batman "is a 3/10 at best.
