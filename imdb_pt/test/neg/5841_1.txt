Obviously, several agents did not see beyond the dollar signs when they hired their clients for this 117-minute minute of the courtesan complex. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie could have been good, the $ 1 million were left out. Seriously. The amount of the check does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage promised to imply "for richer for poorer, for prostitution as for faithfulness." Imagine the story in another way: 2 children, homeless, boundless, "desperate" and completely stupid. They collide with the rich businessman. The marriage of children is hampered by imperfect moments and by the fact that the husband is a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, exuding charm and stability - a virtual magnet for the biological clock - and with it the temptation of the wife, tensions, suspense. Who will she choose? Maybe, under these conditions, I could really care. As it is, frankly, Redford's selfish, manipulative playboy puts an end to the sympathetic character. A woman who sells herself is just about what a guy deserves who will ruin his wife. The indecent proposition makes the husband a TOTAL loser, deficient in all positive masculine characteristics, and makes the wife a cheap prostitute seduced by money, rather than confused by another potential love, a woman devoid of moral center and self-respect. <br /> <br /> All the impressive talent (acting, direction, film direction) wasted on this film - and that was a staggering amount - could not save him from his $ 1 million pitch. If I see this turkey in another bridal shower, I'll bake it! (Or maybe cross with Titanic and throw the ribbon in the ocean!)
