Elderbush Gilch was a big disappointment to me. I had heard how good it was, how important it was. It just did not hit me. It had a stupid plot, plus some idiot and sadistic Native American characters that are offensive by today's standards. While most D.W. Griffith films have depth and insight, this one looks more like a program image crafted by a formula. I loved to see Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh in a nation's pre-birth roles, plus a little bit of the staging of films. the battle scenes were very good. According to Griffith's future cameraman, Karl Brown, the audience was standing in their seats and applauding when the cavalry arrived at the end. I did not feel anything. And, after leaving me, I watched Griffith's early work on the Biograph. This movie is not what it used to be. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that, despite all its flaws, it has many of Griffith's touches. He deals with his main actors very well, plus the scene where the Indians are surrounding the booth reminiscent of the climax of Birth of a Nation, a much superior film that would send shock waves across America a little over a year later .
