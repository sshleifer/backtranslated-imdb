Have to really have such a horrible movie! Actually, I'm more ashamed to have gone through all this. It looks like an old 80s science fiction movie, complete with super fake "special effects", strange images and very extravagant dialogues. Maybe that's what they want it to look like, maybe they think it's cool to make movies in the '80s, as if it came back in style. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think the promised eye drops will save the movie, you are disappointed - the so-called "babies" are sly and frankly ugly. They can not act at all, I do not understand why they could not at least get good-looking chicks if they want untalented babies! But I think when you're making such a stupid movie, you do not have very good choices, hot girls are not just lining up to do that kind of crap!
