It was not until I looked at the trivia section that I discovered that the original producer / star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its creation. This no doubt explains why everyone on the screen seems to have their minds on other things, a symptom that appears in a very old scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know when you're painting a wall until you're completely bored? Well, that's the kind of expression that fighters have on their face when they are swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing way. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Soloman the King of Israel having a case with Queen of Sheeba and her people are not happy about it. You can not really blame them, since there are few more beautiful things in the world than those of the Israelis, although the Israeli women here seem to look like Cherie Blair! Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with most Israelis born out of the country, but this would have been true a few thousand years ago, where everyone speaks in European and American accents. After much talk and a (and no, this is not praise) we have a climax where the Israelis in large numbers have to defend themselves against an Egyptian army that does not know how to read a map, otherwise they would know that there was a canyon in front of them. That's what I do not understand - even though they are blinded by the sun, the Egyptians spend ten minutes toward the Israelis, never realizing they are heading for an open ravine! Is not that a bit illogical? It is also a revealing mistake, since the horses, carriages and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you have a foolish foe who can not see a ravine in front of you or shake a sword as if he painted a wall?
