Why is Guy working for Buddy? Probably because Ari was not around in 1995. Why does Dawn want to stay with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are several things about this movie that I'm not sure. But is Kevin Spacey an excellent verbal tsunami like Buddy Ackerman? and totally believable because he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> Frank Whaley's face is certainly out of his element working for Buddy ?? he wants to write and make meaningful films, not be an employee who is verbally abused by having equal instead of sweet and low. <br /> <br /> The dawn of Michelle Forbes, who also wants to make meaningful films, seems to be out of Guy's league. <br /> <br /> The ending leaves much to be desired.
