I bought this DVD of Chuck Norris knowing it was one of his first movies, and it shows. We all know he's never going to win an Oscar for his acting, but that's not what we've seen. Although there have been some earthquakes in California since this movie was made, there was never any desert or hills between Hwy.99 and I 5. Billy was supposedly cruising from 99 to 5 over 120, a distance of less than 15 miles. I would like the writers, producers, and directors of these films to at least look at a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I was able to realize from the beginning that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. So grab your Doritos and an adult drink and enjoy a trip back in time.
