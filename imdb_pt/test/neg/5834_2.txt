It's a space movie, or at least I think it is. you have semi-naked prisoners in a space prison and a monster in a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sensual encounters. Your Friggin Hilarious. The acting is so bad that the space nuts look like an Emmy-winning movie. The story is simple. The prisoner of space has a chance to reduce the sentence by investigating a space station that has lost contact with humanity. She finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and with rage of aliens. She fights them, and so on. It's a movie worth seeing just to wet your laughing pants. If you like real sci-fi flicks it's a no-no, but it's a great mood setter for the amateur filmmaker because I can guarantee your movie is better than that.
