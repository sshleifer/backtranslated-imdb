"I have not laughed that much since Grandma got caught in the juicer," says one of the stoners in this quasi-farce hilarity of all those films of Val Lewton and George A. Romero that we come to love (or reluctant). depending on your personal taste) over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young actor plays a macabre joke on the rest of his troupe after a scary night they visit an island in the graveyard. His artistic director, Alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by performing a highly stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> Too much screen time is poorly spent; the amateur dialogue includes lame jokes, melodrama and other kinds of unnecessary comments (and Alan can not stop that annoying laugh ... too much!). Once the action begins (which comes close to the end of the movie), it's worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I saw this on a local station television program that worked very well like this ... only this one scared me at 13 years old ... but then again you can laugh your way through it, to the bitter end ... ... which is probably the reason, nowadays, why very few people still wear striped hips.
