"Get out while you're ahead" is a phrase they never learn. Typical Hollywood sequel scenario: if the first film was just shocking, the second was not, expect the third film to be the worst to be released this year. Even worse are the prequels, whose events have already been explained in detail. If you have not seen the first two movies, you will not like this one. It's like starting to watch the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars with the last movie in the trilogy. So, "stand alone" this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Remember in the first movie about Lucian's revenge? Remember the second about the long-lost wild brother? Well if you saw these two 5 min moments and stick them together would you have? a 5 min prequel. But the creators of ether thought that these 5 mins were vital historical events or just wanted to give some actors, cast and crew some work and maybe make some money in the process. "I have a lot of money, I make movies to live and I'm bored. What am I going to do? I know! I'm going to make a movie." So, anyway, you get this prequel for 5 min and you stretch it for 90 min ?? this is the movie And you know what will happen to the main characters "immortal", so there is little suspense. By the way, the whole drama of the movie is in those 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrow rise was the killing mother at the beginning of the movie. Sick. The rest was Braveheart remix. If you want a comedy, see Braveheart first then this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to vent a little? the film put me in a good mood. Who invented the concept of "vampire vs. werewolf" in the first place? He's older than me and he's aged so fast. And why do vampires look like gothic girls in heat, while werewolves look like psychopathic bears? Hiding bad movies behind cleavage fails. Is not it time we had some more lucid werewolves with an upright posture? How can their immutable werewolves even reproduce if they tear them all to pieces? And why with all their powers did the vampires rule the world? Blaa, blaa, blaa ?? What a waste.
