Paul Mazursky fails in the film. Writing, directing, casting and acting (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are all off target. I remember that the comments of more than 20 years ago were mediocre, but I thought it would still be worth seeing. With notables like Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who acts in most of her scenes) and John Cassavetes, I understandably expected much more. The music chosen for the film is shocking, the cuts between New York and Greece confusing and the overall pace leaves much to be desired. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to update this story, or add his touch to it is intriguing - this retelling of Prospero and his daughter takes very little importance of the game, and adds not much more. The play is not one of Shakespeare's best, and gutting it further seems not to be a good decision. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this movie.
