This movie reminds me of Harry Potter - not the style but the marketing strategy. There may be part 2, part three ... until one day the product life cycle ends, of course, on condition that part one has commercial success. many things seem to be hidden, and so the story seems incomplete. the design of action is annoying. Scenography is ok but not ok. maybe Edison Chen would be a big star someday. It really looks charming, even on the big screen. The most impressive still is Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
