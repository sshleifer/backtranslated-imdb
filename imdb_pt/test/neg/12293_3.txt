This was the first feature film for almost everyone involved, including director Teck Tan, so they deserve the credit for taking it out. But this film was strange in its direction, preaching in its style, exaggerated in its action and excessively politically correct. The plot was all over the place, preventing any aspect of developing well. Gangsters get involved in the story, though I'm not sure what their presence has added to the film besides making the film even more unreal. They could have been completely left out and the movie would have been better as a result. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young Malays from the Chinese ethnic group who returns to his native country after studying in the West. His studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of the Malaysian charts (a rather youthful premise). The beginning of the film suggests a conflict with his traditional father, but once the gangsters get involved, that part of the story is abandoned without the least ceremony. <br /> <br /> The film tries to take advantage of Malaysia's ethnic mix, but unfortunately the way those aspects were filmed or it sounded terribly planned or frankly preached. There is a beautiful scene of Malaysian women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the view is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The acting was a bit amateurish, and the male lead was particularly unconvincing. The Malaysian women's leadership was a notable exception, leaving the mark more positive. The film also has an openly gay character, and despite being a little caricatured, it offers some of the funniest moments in the film. But the film was only slightly above a typical local television soap opera drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is not at all offensive, was banned in Malaysia. 3/10
