So you have the spoiler warning --- but I'd say you can not ruin what's already rotten. I suppose they changed the name to "The Cavern" just in case the reputation of "WIthIN" had preceded. <br /> <br /> After paying the cable rent for this movie, I considered saving my household trash for a month and sending it to the writer / director. He had his trash delivered to my house, so I thought it was fair that I should return the favor. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a suggestion that the scene is in the Kazakh desert. I do not know why they chose Kazakhstan; perhaps the writer is a fan of the Ali G Show. But they should have just started inside the cave, because the outside was obviously not Kazakhstan. It was the first clue that I would hate the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has no redemptive qualities except one: it's consistent. Everything is terrible. The writing, the direction, the acting, the cinematography - all aspects of this film are bad. And I like bad movies, funny movies, horror movies. . . but that was simply bad. And idiot. And banal. And predictable. It's boring. <br /> <br /> To get an idea of ​​the movie, go into the laundry with five friends and turn off the lights. Put a flashlight (on) in your dryer and turn it on. Now, you all start screaming and screaming at the top of your lungs. It is. <br /> <br /> For a complete re-enactment, have 5 out of 6 people in the laundry lying dead on the floor. Mix the Karo syrup in them. Turn the lights on again (stop the dryer). Now there's a guy in a gorilla costume come in the room and rape the last person standing. <br /> <br /> FIN <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: Reading the other comments, many find it remarkable that this film was made on a low budget. This is not remarkable. Making a trash film on a huge budget is remarkable (Waterworld). Making a good movie on a low budget is remarkable (like Blair Witch, which I really liked). Making a bad movie with a low budget is not a bit surprising, and you can expect more of the same if these people are still making movies because I can not imagine anyone would hand them a heap of money after watching it. Is low budget an excuse for a terrible movie? No, and certainly no reason to watch it. Would you eat a dog manure sandwich just because it was cheap to make? <br /> <br /> The IMDb rating for this movie over time will be interesting to watch. The trend should be more downward, but only if the number of innocent and innocent bystanders exceeds the filmmakers' ability to beg their personal friends to give them 10 stars.
