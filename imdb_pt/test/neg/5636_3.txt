I did not know anything about this DVD when I hired it. He took a quick look at the comments, but decided to keep an open mind. Obviously an independent film and low budget, but this did not bother me. I will watch anything with Derick Jacobi and as always he did his role well. Too bad no one else did. I had watched 'Atonement' a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. At that, she seemed to turn to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake was to launch Vinnie Jones. To be honest, I saw his picture on the cover of the DVD, but I did not realize he had the best billing. A sticker was strategically placed on his name! It was watchable and I thoroughly enjoyed the Dickens story next to the present day. Perhaps with a more capable actor taking the lead, this could have worked better. He was still weak.
