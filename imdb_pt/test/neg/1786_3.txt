This movie starts off the way every movie should begin, with a lot of hotties in a bedroom walking in panties and / or topless. Some of them take a shower. I'm liking this by now! Unfortunately, we met or main characters. They simply are not particularly nice. Normally, in these films, the actresses are not really acting, they give very "natural" performances, and they are quite nice, funny and nice. Not here. They do not have much personality and I do not care much about them. <br /> <br /> Some of the girls go on a camp to school. On the way they stop at a gas station and meet a gang of motorcyclists. The biker gang should have been left out of the movie - it was tacky before, but now it's just plain stupid. The head biker looks like a middle-aged guy dressed as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go out into the woods and then the biker gang follows them. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what happens after that. There are a lot of things about the end of the world because it's the end of the millennium, so some of the bikers are killed by a mysterious Indian guy who keeps disappearing. Someone is eaten by a boring Lock Ness Monster thing while he is swimming in a lake. A guy with silly makeup is apparently a druid, and he needs to sacrifice some of the girls to avoid the end of the world. Or maybe it's the end of the world, I'm afraid you're not paying attention. First he dresses the girls in animal fur lingerie. <br /> <br /> It could have been a really fun movie, but the motorcycle gang sort of ruined the atmosphere and the plot was so blatant that it did not even live up to my expectations. They really should have eliminated half the elements of the plot and just focused on one or two things. Instead, it's all over the place. Overall, if you are looking for a delay of 80 years, I imagine you could do something worse. If you tried hard. There is an abundance of nudity in the beginning, but the characters are kinda bad and the plot is too absurd to be even a bit satisfying.
