This is a disaster film, in both the meanings of the word. Every character, every role, every conversation, every turn, everything in this movie smells a lot. It's a shame to see the talent of Dennis Hopper wasted in this horrible movie. I can give you hundreds of examples, but see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Or rather: no.
