If this is the author's and the director's idea of ​​a slice of life, they are clinically depressed maniacs. A sad and melancholic film, at best, with ubiquitous and unhappy characters who interact negatively with disastrous results. This movie is billed as a comedy. What was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated premeditated arson or drug-induced rape from one of the main characters. Is this art imitating life? Jack Black was slightly amused as the man of the mountain, a weed farmer. However, even this segment of the movie was full of pathos. What was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage. If Black's character was so paranoid, why was he making acid with a group of people straight from Woodstock? There is no end to disconnected relationships, a plot less plot and scene transitions without any cohesion or logical chronology.
