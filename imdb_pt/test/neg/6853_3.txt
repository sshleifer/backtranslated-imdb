I've never been disappointed with a Kurosawa movie, but this is probably the first. "Doppelganger" is the worst I've ever seen from this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films is announcing this as "Kiyoshi Kurosawa's most scary movie ever." What? Kurosawa's most scary movie is definitely "Kairo". And if you think this is horror, you have a surprise. This can not be classified as horror or suspense. This is a drama, and a very bad one at that. Many scenes that were supposed to be shocking ended up being funny, and much of the plot is really confusing. And since it is Kurosawa, the pace is slow. But it is so slow that you will lose interest for forty minutes and feel like doing something else. What bothered me most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if executed with little care ... It can be a disaster. I think it describes a scene here that has minimal CGI usage. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can give "Dopppelganger" is that she has a really good acting. Koji Yakusho gives a great performance along with the rest of the cast. But this is very beautiful ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor, and go watch "Kairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be afraid. This is a bad and bad attempt at a clever drama. Which is clever, but ... Well, a lot is missing. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for good acting.
