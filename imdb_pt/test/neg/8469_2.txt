I found this movie immensely interesting and a bit tired, it speaks of violence and what it is doing, I still do not see the point in becoming terrorists to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and in other countries who justify the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. Think of the Puritans and the Christian crusades against the Islamic people during medieval times. Much blood and death far exceeding today's violence, the Western world had a negative impact on religion. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. But I still remember that most of the Islamic peoples are PEACEFUL! The people of any nation feel some kind of patriotism, but to start a war in the fact that I am right and their mistake needs to be rethought. Again I repeat that you can not stop the terrorists becoming like them.
