Nightkill star Robert Mitchum as a private investigator tired of the world, investigating the case of a missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. What Jaclyn does not tell Mitchum is that she knows very well the whereabouts of her husband. After all, it was she who helped her lover, James Franciscus, get rid of her wealthy husband. <br /> <br /> What else would you expect from a spoiled movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and Smith is constantly overshadowed by Sybil Danning until a giallo style ends the whole mess with a bitter end. This is BAD cinema. And this movie is soooo bad. It makes it look like Halloween has mixed with Trick Or Treats. Avoid this. <br /> <br /> Classified as R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situations.
