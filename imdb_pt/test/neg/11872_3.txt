The detonator is in Bucharest, where a kind of former CIA government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) tracked down a gun dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), things go wrong and Dimitru discovers that Sonni is working for the government from the USA . After a major firefight, most of Dimitru's men were killed by Sonni, which is why local Romanian police are unhappy. Flint (Michael Brandon) decides to send Sonni back to the US and at the same time protect a woman named Nadia. Cominski (Silvia Colloca), who is also being sent back to the US. However, Nadia is wanted by Dimitru and his football boss Jozef (Tim Dutton), who needs her to complete a deal for a gas bomb they plan in Washington killing millions of people ... <br /> < > This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong and The Detonator and confirms beyond a shadow of a doubt that Wesely Snipes joined the action movie club that was relegated to making generics. action films in Eastern European locations, yes Snipes has joined such luminaries as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer and Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a bit of credit, since he's held a little more than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004) still fresh on many movie minds (every movie he's made since he went straight to the DVD) but it had to happen sooner or later, like many of the names I mentioned, Snipes lived on the reputation of some great movies and if you look at his career he has been in more bad movies than good. Like the recent JCVD ​​& Seagal movies, the Detonator is horrible. Martin Wheeler's script is as predictable, boring, and by numbers as anything out there. The Detonator is the kind of movie you expect to see on an obscure cable TV channel that hits at 2 o'clock in the morning. The Detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman and at first they do not like each other, but in the end they are in love, their best friend in the CIA ends up being a traitor while the obnoxious of the book's boss that no one really likes is a decent guy, the Snipes character is allowed to run around Bucharest by shooting, killing and blasting people like it does not matter and he is never arrested, the action is dull and unforgettable, the villain has a club of football, so there are many annoying terminologies for football and there is no funny phrase. Director Leong does nothing to cheer things up. Up, The Detonator looks cheap with a car chase in which the two cars seem never to exceed the 30 mph mark. OK, the action scenes are relatively well staged, but they are few and far between and totally forgettable in a 'bad guy' shoot Snipes & misses, in return Snipes shoots a bad guy and kills him 'kind of'. There is a decent half-car crash and explosion, but very little else. It seems that part of The Detonator was filmed in a Romanian football stadium, I think I'd rather have watched the game for 90 minutes instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 15,000,000, the Detonator is reasonably well done, but not much that actually happens. Set and filmed in Bucharest, Romania. The acting is not so good, Snipes just does not seem interested, and it looks like he's only there for the money I do not blame him at all. <br /> <br /> The Detonator is another poor one. cliché action film starring an actor and ensemble in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony keep doing these things? I can not recommend it, there is much better action out there.
