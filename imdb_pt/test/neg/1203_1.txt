I remember seeing it for the first time in the 80's as a teenager. Man, I read the reviews on this junk and I was surprised by the vote. This movie does not deserve four stars !!! This movie is not better than Topgun. Topgun has his own problems; Do not misunderstand me. This movie should be banned only for its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many holes, so VERY poor dialogue. I can not think of a redeeming quality of this vomit. This is not action / adventure. This is a bad joke in the movie. Kind of like watching Plan 9 with F-16 images. This film not only challenges logic and common sense within the context of a military scenario, but sends a disturbing message. The military will not save their father from the impending evil of the Middle East. Then go there and steal a multi-million dollar weapon and blow it out of the sinister claws of the anti-American Arab predecessor. Because you can not reason with these animals. This is a budget film by Bruckheimer. Bland direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, equal ... Iron Eagle.
