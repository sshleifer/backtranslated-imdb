I've had over 80 minutes in my life, but none comes to mind right now. Hell Ride is based on the 70's cults theme that Tarantino brought back, and did right, in films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with the Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is rubbish and character development as well. How many movies does Bishop think he can steal blatantly? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country, etc. Etc Speaking of Bishop, what the hell is he doing acting in this movie? I could not help but laugh at those scenes in which he stands with his trusty pelvis, desperately trying to look like a hardened motorcyclist. Nothing in this movie is believable. And why Dennis Hopper? Did they really need the Easy Rider motif as well? I blame Larry Bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt at the lead role. Do not bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
