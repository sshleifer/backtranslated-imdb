This is another original Sci-Fi movie starring Rhys Davies, where it's hard to decide what's worse, acting, or writing / directing / producing (John Sheppherd leads the three.) Basic story: Obsessed exobiologist captures the monster from chubacabra a cargo container aboard a cruise ship escapes and the bloodbath begins. Clich√© sci fi cast of the tough captain with the beautiful daughter, beautiful hero and mad scientist. Captian calls a terrorist alert to the ship (since, of course, he would not believe a monstrous story). There is not a dramatic helicopter drop from the Navy Seals here. The budget only allowed the full force of eight seals to reach a fiberglass fishing boat and mount a fleet of ships on board. Puleeze Also animated computer animation of the ship you could do better on your computer. I also loved it when the Seal commander, looking through standard binoculars ten miles away, was able to see three people jump off the ship. If the science fiction channel continues with the original films, I hope they realize that the audience is not the kindergarten level and that they buy better scripts and directors. If it went straight to the video, you'd find it in the 99-cent deposit.
