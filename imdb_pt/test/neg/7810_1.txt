I was intrigued by the unpleasant boss character, since I am one of them, and the royal boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger Ashton Kushner, but this film is so childish that I had to turn it off. It was a waste of time to watch. When people started peeing around the room, it was too much to watch. Painful, horrible crap. If they'd just slowed down a bit. Are there people out there who find it funny and like it? I was relieved to learn that IMDb readers rated him so low. The career side to the story was intriguing as well as the youngster trying to get a promotion and win the favor of the bosses. I liked that part. Also, the opening scene with co-workers on the train was cool as I like your co-worker's characters. If you can tolerate nonsense movies or you are too young then it may be one that you can stomach.
