I usually really like Steven Seagal's movies. They are usually a lot of fun and are a bit of Aikido fans, I usually like the way Steven incorporates these martial art techniques into the fight sequences. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is a very bad movie that makes effort. It seems obvious to me that the blame lies on the director and producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, much less drive someone like Steven Seagal and leverage their knowledge and expertise. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the end of this movie. I left before the end simply because I could not bear to watch this bad movie anymore. I'm sure many people also share my feelings.
