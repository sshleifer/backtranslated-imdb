Stupid horror movie about five twenty-something (3 men, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they do not know is that Dr. Chopper and his assistants attack and kill anyone who ventures into their forests. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something. Also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown to be killed and show off some cleavage. <br /> <br /> Very desperate. The story is confusing and boring; the blood is laughably false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants abuse TERRIBLE; There is a terrible "black humor" here and people stand while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> That was very insulting. There are some advantages. An hourly turnaround was very good and the five young actors are really good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is just like Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good as Tamara and Robert Adamson has his moments like Nicholas. Best of all is Chesley Crisp as Jessica - she was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well-placed and interesting. Unfortunately the dialogue was not really there for them. I'm giving a 4 for his performances - but nothing else is worth mentioning here. I hope these actors have roles worthy of them.
