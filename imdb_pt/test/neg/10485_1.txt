This cheap and trash movie is about a NASA test rocket that is sent to space with a load of animals. He disappears for a while and then unexpectedly returns, landing in a forest, unleashing a mutant creature. <br /> <br /> Like many such films, Night Fright, it features startled teenagers dancing to the music of the 60s before being killed. None of the murders, however, is remotely memorable, since we see nothing of truth. One thing we see, however, is that one of the teenagers seems to be about 40 years old and sports a rather impressive haircut. <br /> <br /> For a creature to work, it actually has to present monster to the viewer properly. In this movie, however, we only have the shorter glimpses of the monster. It looks kind of like the Robot Monster alien. But I'm not sure; as the picture was so dark that I just could not understand what the hell was going on most of the time. Although, my intuition was that I probably was not really missing it.
