This film was unlike most of the 1930s Jimmy Cangey movies that were not made by Warner Brothers / First National but were loaned to a smaller studio. Because it is a "poverty" studio, production figures are lower than you may be accustomed to seeing in Cagney movies. Also, the plot is certainly one of the strangest I've ever seen. Instead of him being a gangster, he was a good guy in this - fighting for the law. This is not so unusual because Cagney often made lawyers - such as an OSS leader (the CIA ancestor) as an FBI agent. BUT, making him an investigator for the Department of Weights and Measures was really weird - especially because sometimes he acted the same way he did in the movie G-MEN! <br /> <br /> All in all, a time saver and that's about it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the videotape I saw on Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever encountered. The sound was terrible and scratched and the print looked very white and had many films and gaps.
