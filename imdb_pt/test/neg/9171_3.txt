I waited a long time to finally see what I thought would be a fun nickname movie and I was shocked to discover a bad direction, awkward dialogues, a lackluster rhythm, unmotivated jokes and a rudeness that permeated the whole movie. Just is not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes of the normally excellent Donfeld are extravagant and disturbing. Even the title song is annoying. The characters of entire children's books do not come close to representing the couple whose life is turned upside down when he loses his job. For a film that seems to point to the injustice of welfare and unemployment systems, filmmakers have no problem being unfair, allowing Hispanic, black, and gay stereotypes to be practiced at such a cruel level. The look of the film resembles any episode of Love American Style. This is not a compliment. Extravagant fashions of the seventies abound in this world of white collar robbery that just gives an air of implausibility to all situations. Out of a clever initial idea, and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this exercise dating back to social commentary is considered forced and stingy for minorities, especially for gays. If you want a better movie, you're better off with The Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. This is funny!
