It's difficult and I did not expect ... But it's really the worst movie that my wife and I saw. Terrible dialogues that stretch incomprehensibly over time for no apparent reason except to fill the time. Does not storytelling follow a comprehensive intelligible form? everything is a mess. The action and the dialogs appear in jumps. The thing that disappointed me the most was seeing Dominique Pinon, one of my favorite French actors involved in this ?? uh ?? I do not even know how to describe it without being educated? The rest of the actors where the poorest. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, making a meaningless and flat performance. Bad special effects. I do not think it was a complete waste of film, but is it close to ?? If I say I advise everyone not to see this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Honestly, I would never say something like that about a movie, but ?? there is always a first time.
