It is very interesting to find another reviewer who had exactly the same reaction to this film that I did: It was much better when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Seeing this for over 30 years later, it's still okay, but only slightly kept my interest. What looked extremely funny at the time was just slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the things that surprised me when I was 10 years old seemed silly. For example, in a scene Trinity is walking and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking. In fact, he does not even bother to look and see if they're dead because he knows he hit the mark. Um, yeah, right. <br /> <br /> In addition, much of the dialogue sounds a lot of wood. Sorry, but 35 years later, it did not age very well. <br /> <br /> Although it's been a long time since I've seen that too, probably a Terrence Hill movie better than this being my name is anyone.
