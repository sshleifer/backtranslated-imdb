Well, for this abomination of a movie, I was not expecting anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there's absolutely no reason to have a sequel. Somehow, this movie was even lower than my expectations, even when I had none. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney movie Noah with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty ripped him apart in so many ways for the film to remain justifiable. In fact, Evan's Almighty had exactly the same plot as Noah's plot, except for some technical details, it was nothing more than a carbon copy of a much higher film that was actually FUNNY. <br /> <br /> Another thing, did anyone get sick of Wanda Sykes's silly, stupid, dull and redundant things that were literally in every scene? It was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie over and over. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I had basically seen the film ten years before (Noah), Evan Almighty has to be the most predictable movie I have ever seen. I discovered the whole movie from start to finish in the first five minutes and finally realized that it was pulling Noah left and right. In conclusion, if you're a bit unsure whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty, and you're already tired of Jonah Hill having the same role in every movie he's in, he likes Bruce All- Powerful, and I do not want to see a predictable, dry and bland movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, so please do not look at that piece of crap.
