This southern super-goth mellerdramer has a few decent moments - but is often spoiled by a novice director piling a cliché over a cliché, and a star who apparently decided to take the responsibility of turning the photo into his personal showcase instead of allowing writer / director Gabel to update Inge or Williams as a kind of "Midnight Cowboy" and meet "Lolita". <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated accents of the south, and try to decide whether you are watching a movie, or an acting class - filled with anxious amateurs. <br /> <br /> Johansson is tolerable for the first time (that is, less pouty than normal) - although not good at all, Macht is decent, though it's too cute to be believed, and Travolta chews the scene ever (with the help of a decent editor and some restriction of direction, his performance may have been really touching, as it is, he - and almost everyone - is too unpleasant to ever take us beyond the point of boredom or disgust). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of them all; if her role had been developed beyond a few lines, she might even have met with a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> Pic is almost saved by a Leonard Cohen-style growl theme song, decent production design and locations, and continuous reference to literary works (which won the revisions of the standard script as "poetic"). some veterans in the cast are known as Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, Soderbergh's cameraman Elliot Davis - whose excellent work will no doubt be credited to the novice director who in ten or twenty years' time can learn how to drive. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
