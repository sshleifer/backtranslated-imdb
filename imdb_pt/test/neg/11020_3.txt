After watching the TV commercials for this movie marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs. In the end, it was one of the longest 90mins I've ever spent. The Wog Boy did not really provide a story with enough substance to keep my interest, and predictable and sometimes insipid jokes did not fill that void. <br /> <br /> A scene in which the two 'Wog Boys' dominate the film. The dance floor of her local nightclub was the only one that impressed me. The only character worth watching was 'Nathan', played by Stephen Curry of The Castle, his fight with the opposite sex, providing most of the few laughs. <br /> <br /> One word for this flic is boring. Save time and just watch the TV commercial while the only laughs are shown.
