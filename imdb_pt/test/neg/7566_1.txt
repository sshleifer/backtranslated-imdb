There have been many films in living the American dream. And this is one of them. <br /> <br /> First of all, from the technical point of view, there is a lot wrong. The audio is bad, I had a hard time understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could have been better. <br /> <br /> They really tried to make a good movie, but for example the part they show, like Jonathan is getting lost in the dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, it's really bad. The acting is pretty bad, as well as all the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time watching it from beginning to end, and I could not wait for the movie to end. <BR> If your expectations are low, and you're bored on a Sunday in bad weather, watch. If you're into a deep story with action then this is not your movie. Usually I would not have a score of 1, but 4.5 for this movie. But the reason I gave a 1 is because of the bad audio, and uses camera, not to mention the bad scenes with cheese effects.
