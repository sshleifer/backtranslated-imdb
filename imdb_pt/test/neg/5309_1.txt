I rarely give notes below 5, but in this case I must weigh. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful and intricate books, original characters, clear dialogues, plot twists. Movies based on his books date back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson) and Out of Sight (Clooney / Lopez), among others. Even when done, the movies at least have some part of the essence of the story. This, ... simply is not a worthy addition to the catalog. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad (I do not know why, because they are very capable people here) and the story is treated with stupidity. The characters are rearranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are badly fused. <br /> <br /> Since Elmore Leonard is a great storyteller, I hope anyone who does not know his work. would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing version of one of his stories. <br /> <br /> The story is a continuation of Get Shorty. If you have not seen this movie, do not watch it. If you have seen Get Shorty, do not proceed to this. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago, and tonight they were re-visiting the vid. The first time should not have caused such a negative impression, because I had forgotten how sad this sequence was. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I think no less than those who have appeared in this movie for doing so. They probably expected something more. Get Shorty was original and a lot of fun. Travolta I almost always like, but he's much better at Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and the previous Get Shorty. He was clearly unable to appreciate what was happening here. <br /> <br /> And I heard that Freaky Deaky, another book by Elmore Leonard, is in pre-production for release in 2008. I hope they can do that. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They are almost all great.
