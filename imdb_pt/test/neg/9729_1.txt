Wow!! I do not even know where to start what made this movie so horrible. Maybe I should just start by saying that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was laughing so much. Yeah. The acting really was that bad. The acting was not the worst part. The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. The characters are all underdeveloped. Dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. The bandit is a caricature of a runaway, of drunken power, of sadistic. <br /> <br /> But, hey, the actors are beautiful, so I guess that would make it all better.
