I am a big fan of horror movies and I know a lot of information about serial killers. Obviously, the director of this one refused to investigate the film that was creating, because half of the film was fictitious. More than that, Ed Gein's character was portrayed in the wrong light. I did not rent the film to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I rented to watch Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was horrible, the only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the blood was not so bad. Acting = horrible Actors = sub-film = loss of time. <br /> <br /> A big surprise, but I will not give up on my quest for a good horror movie.
