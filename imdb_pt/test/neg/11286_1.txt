Cobb. He sucked. I did not learn anything about the man I had not heard before. The performances were over the top. A scene in which Cobb and Al are driving down a snow-lane in search of women in Reno has to be one of the worst scenes ever conceived in recent memory. It is simply STUPID and unentertaining. The flashback sequences were terrible. And they used the same sequences over and over again. If I saw the same scene of Cobb fighting with someone on a base once more, I would have been physically sick. Watching this movie, we learned NOTHING of what it was in the Cobb era. We have learned nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his managerial days, anything about his relationship with his family members, and "they do not like him." I thought when I sat down to watch this movie I would learn SOMETHING about the baseball era that Cobb was playing. Instead, all I could see was a retread of how Cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. Boy, what a great movie (I wanted sarcasm). Cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so that one of his stories must be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one is after seeing this piece of crap. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure your VCR's fast-forward button is working, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. I hope someone someday makes a GOOD movie about Ty Cobb. I liked this movie as much as people liked Cobb, which means - I HATED. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE FREE section of the store. I think I'm going to ask for my fifty cents back on the video, since I can not make up the time I wasted on seeing this crap. Oh, well, what could I have thought about a movie that would have Robert Wuhl?
