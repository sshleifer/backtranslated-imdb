Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll is undoubtedly the worst product of Western civilization. Monologues are uninteresting and pointless. In the rare monologue that captures the attention of the public, it is quickly lost by excessively long repetitions and unnecessary extras (the Hells Angels at McDonalds come to mind). I think a Bogosian man's show needed some stuff to fill in for a duration that he thought justified the price of admission. <br /> <br /> I'd rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained from my blood than see Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll again.
