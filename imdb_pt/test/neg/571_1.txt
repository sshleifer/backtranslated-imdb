** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, 'The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque New England coastal town where Helen (Kate Capshaw), the single mother Helen owns a small bookstore . One day at work, Helen happens through an anonymous letter (the title "love letter") that somehow lodged under the pillows of a reading couch. While reading her love prose, she believes it was written for her, purposely placed on the couch for her to find, and for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds her, believes it is for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. The circumstances then bring to the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen wrote the letter to him. And before all is resolved, you can only imagine the hilarious situations in which everyone involved was launched; and I mean imagine, because the way this movie unfolds, the audience gets little more than what it brings with it. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: it simply is not very romantic and is not funny; and this is a potent combination that makes this movie virtually flawed from opening credits. Once the setting and the main character (Helen) have been established, he basically does not get anywhere for the next ninety minutes. By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter, and to whom, you could care less. Completing the cast are Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It's a shame to see such talent wasted on such a claptrap as this, and looking badly at the scales. Kate Capshaw, who normally lights the screen just showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to have just come off a three-day hinge that lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres, in fact, leaves looking for the best of the group. They say that the journey is often a more intoxicating experience than fate. In the case of "The Love Letter," however, it would have been better for everyone involved if everyone had simply stayed home in the first place. I rate this 1/10.
