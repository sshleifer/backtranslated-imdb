My question is what was the worst element of this movie? Was it acting? driving script?. Maybe it was the waste of Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and especially Ladd are able to bring extreme sines to a role. In this film, it was difficult to tell who the bandit was. Granted, Ladd was playing a guy in disguise, but even in his role of good guy, he could be very creepy. Thus, the net result was a potentially good movie, devoid of any sense of conflict.
