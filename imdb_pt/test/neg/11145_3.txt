All the hype! All adds! I was upset that I missed it on the big screen. Where this movie worked was in the small details. In everything else, it failed. Arnold has done many better performances in recent years. I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero were gone from our lives. Unfortunately, this movie approaches the smallest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a writhing, grunting muscle that simply knows how to shoot guns and blow things up. In a last clich√© (and another time) moment, which was predictable from the beginning, we see a glimpse of the actor who proved that he is more than what he was paid early in his career. I was not impressed with the movie since it never opened new paths or was anywhere but where you expected.
