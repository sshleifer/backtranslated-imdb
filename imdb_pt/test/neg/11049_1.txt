This comment is mostly a warning to people who may be attracted to the title by their high rating of users (temporarily), which I find frankly intriguing. The reasons why I did not like this title are as follows: 1. The director must have had some doubts about making a Jackie-Chan movie or a somber Oedipal tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film sits between two chairs, while the tragic and comic elements collide and vanish instead of forming a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The motives and behaviors of the characters are incoherent and unconvincing. Truth and psychological logic are sadly absent. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd casting. I do not blame the actors, because it's a hard thing to create a compelling character, acting alone, if there is scant logic in the script. However, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the two main actors, whose ages in the film can not differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the movie was a bad entertainment, mainly because of point 2. If you can not find a character with whom you can sympathize with it, it is difficult to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist, it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some movies besides being fun are also thought-provoking. Having seen this movie, I began to wonder if the thought the director attempted to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly healthy and enjoyable. I can not put any other construction in the end. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is full of totally unnecessary violence. Violence in a movie (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. The purposes may be different and I do not want to go into that broad subject. Let me just say that I am not opposed to violence in such films as "The Rescue of Private Ryan," "The Passion of the Christ," or "A Pulp Fiction." In "Oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or auditory). Whereby? I do not know. Personally I do not feel satisfaction in seeing the teeth being extracted with a hammer or I hear a man cut his tongue with scissors and then see him gagging with his own blood etc. etc. <br /> <br /> 7. The movie reminds me of some Japanese porn manga in its fixation on incest and panties of Asian girls, urinating and stuff like that. It seems like there's a minority that really likes that sort of thing. If you are one of them, you may find this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this movie as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it's not silly, it's disgusting. Do not waste your time.
