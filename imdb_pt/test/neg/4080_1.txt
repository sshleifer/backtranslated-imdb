Should that be funny? This is one of those movies that just do not work. The first, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had some very funny moments. This one had none. <br /> <br /> Steve Carrell, who was brilliant at Bruce Almighty, can not deliver here. His performance is very common and he can not take it off as Carey did. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it is that I only paid $ 1.95 to rent it. It's a kid's movie ... very young children who have only seen about 4 movies in their short lives. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to note that Jim Carey stars in a movie and they make a sequel. without it, it's usually a huge turkey. Does anyone remember Son of Mask? (Worst 100 IMDB films of all time) Avoid movie lovers.
