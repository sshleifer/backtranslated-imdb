I recently rented this movie on DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice, since I'm from the north of England (Bradford), and also interested in making movies. However, it soon became apparent that this movie did not seem to have a decent level of development in terms of script. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and history had no substance. The subject may be an interesting basis for a movie. However, the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The ending was as if you were judging the characters - punishing and rewarding the place where the filmmakers felt necessary. That seemed a little clumsy and silly, and seemed to be at odds with the 'realism' used in the film style. For me, the film dealt with the characters and subjects in a rather awkward and awkward way. It was as if the writer had already decided how he wanted to finish the story and start putting it into practice to fit it. <br /> <br /> Another point I strongly feel is the watery Ken. Loach feels the film had. I get pretty upset that film financiers in Britain can not see that there is more in British films than "brave realism." It has become almost a safe option. The cinema is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and is not being explored by filmmakers in the UK. There's a lot of talent here in the UK. It is unfortunate that most of these people end up making video clips and commercials 100% of the time or going to America. <br /> <br /> Love + Hate would have worked better if it had been reduced to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared like a TV drama.
