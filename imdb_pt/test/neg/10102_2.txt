I watched this on TV today. It was on ABC's Sunday Afternoon Movie. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but for an independent low budget movie like this, fine. There is some suspense in that, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring down the movie. The script is very bad, and the plot elements are not very realistic, like the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone was reporting a murder. I do not know what the writer was thinking when he came up with this idea, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be a good suspense because there were some scenes that seemed to lead to something good, but unfortunately they never did. There were some plot elements that were used in other films similar to this, and in the end, did not turn out too creative. <br /> <br /> If there is anything good about this movie, it's the cast. All the actors in this movie did well with what they had to work on. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie of her that's really good, watch the great animated movie The Incredibles. In that film, she put her sexy voice to good use. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this movie is not worth much, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they were all wasted in this movie, which is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good thriller of suspense, but in the end it fell. If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, watch any of your other movies. You can actually stream this movie with ease if you get the chance to see it.
