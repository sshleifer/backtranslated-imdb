I ... speechless. No word can describe it. I'll try because of those few brave people who put knives in their toasters ... after watching this show. <br /> <br /> This ... person Cosgrove ... His acting is like watching a female gorilla dance in the nest of highly agitated insects. Maybe I overdo it. However, I have the feeling that the description fits into a normal day of writing this program. <br /> <br /> The characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun. on any day of the week. Although heart attacks have not been tried while watching them act like fools on cheap construction appliances, I have no doubt that this will eventually happen. The main plot of this burleson noisily on the faces of the actors is that of a silly girl who makes a weekly live webcast on the iCarly.com creative with her brainless friends, one of whom has equipment that the producers of this program probably could not afford it. Your legal guardian is some kind of idiot who is apparently your big brother. <br /> <br /> I did not watch this whole show for fear of developing cancer, or maybe a cold, but some of the plot points that I saw involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator, the doorman of the apartment almost dying and the fattest priest in the world come for a visit. Not really. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you are over the age of not being born or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to a mental trauma. If you decide to watch it, laugh when the laughter tells you, as this will stifle the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for a long time. <br /> <br /> The show gets a one star rating because the IMDb inexplicably did not adopt the use of negative numbers.
