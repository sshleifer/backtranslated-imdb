I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a lot of fun. Special effects are not worthy of school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving in speed boat in flat water, while the mist driven by the wind blows in the opposite direction. Red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever the cache that Vincent Price should bring as a narrator is completely overshadowed by the terrible production work. To call this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into that, something seemed very funny to me. Maybe it was the overly dramatic intonation of Price's often-used line "They disappeared in the Devil's Triangle!" [Cut to black, next story] Once I started to laugh, my friends joined in. Next time, Vinny said the crucial line Someone on the back shouted, "Good!" After that, he had almost as many laughs as a movie of the Marx Brothers.
