This was a disappointment in many ways. The filmed location in Ireland, while pretty enough at times, can not save this uninspired movie. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as the couple trying to regain marriage and inherit a haunted mansion, are not interesting characters. Paul, at the end of the movie, becomes incredibly annoying and he wants her to shut her mouth and shut up as it seems like she's screaming like she's just become an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are strange segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand rising over her bare and contorted body. Although the woman is quite adequate in doing so, she does nothing from the point of view of history. It is believed that the production team needed to travel a short time and just played a bit of T and A. The effects of CGI are also caricatured and the impetuous rival rivals of co-executive producer Roger Corman is much earlier and very film superior to the fall of Usher's house at all its ineffective low prices. Any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out of the window in this low budget bust. If you like pictures of Ireland, you can find something here, but it would be better to rent or buy a travel itinerary. Ignore this, unless you are indiscriminate and think the plot is secondary. Rent another low-budget ghost story (if you can find it) titled The Woman In Black and see how a movie can be good and scary. This was a wasted opportunity.
