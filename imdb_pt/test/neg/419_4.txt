I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I was hoping to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same reasoning process and got to enjoy the movie, despite the book changes. It was still pleasant, action-packed, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons have disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the film, symbols are found and discovered quickly without any interest to the viewer. They go through the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to take a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final symbol of the Illuminati, which was the most interesting and creative of the book, was replaced by the cross-key symbol. In my opinion, this was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is. Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book and fails to attempt to be an action / suspense film. 4 out of 10
