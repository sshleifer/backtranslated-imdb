Book of Revelations begins very well. Daniel, an egocentric dancer is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women. <br /> <br /> After that, nothing else happens. There is some suggestion of rediscovery, but the film does not give an explanation nor a real ending. Daniel's reactions after abuse are very basic. He stops dancing, has sex with all the women around and finally begins a relationship with a very simple and ordinary woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of art films, but this has something missing in it. The main leads are good; but some characters do not seem to be completely defined.
