Wesley Snipes, latest direct to the video, is a complicated mess, horribly reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is terribly written and does not account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Unfortunately too, Snipes fell into the trap of having an ADR double voice doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes in from time to time through points in the film. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes' talent making garbage like this movie, and producing a tired performance and clearly bored, barely bothering to produce his own dialogue. It became a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he did not conduct his own dialogue, but it is not something I would expect from Snipes. Maybe it's due to the producer, Andrew Stevens, who has previously worked with Seagal, or director Po-Chi Leong, who is responsible for Seagal's Bad Out Of Reach epic. <br /> <br /> The plot involves obscure government officials, terrorists who bus football teams, records with incriminating evidence and a heavy chuck to lose money. Ah and biological weapons. Now, as they are connected I do not know, but what I can say is that the diabolical script is very difficult to understand and like many of these digital TV movies, this likes to include a touch too. The plot is also disinterestedly told, throwing out is cards with people who have shaded ones in offices and dark alleys etc. It's all kind of "let yourself sit down and share some plot points for the sad bastards watching this movie!" The rhythm of the film as such suffers because, despite the blurring of performances and plot, the film has nice action scenes. As an example of how a digital TV movie managed to transpose a story of winding nature, I give you the premiere in the direction of Dolph Lundgren, Defender. This movie had a lot of twists and complexities, but the movie has a last-minute almost entirely of action, with Dolph surrounded by terrorists. Plot points are counted in the context of action, in motion, avoiding death. The movie does not tell us what's happening, it does not break the pace. As such, although the plot was somewhat complicated, it was more forgivable because the action never give up. The Detonator likes many of these movies, stops everything to give us a complicated ride of who is bad, and who is not, before we inevitably change that round in the pull of the final twist in the end. These movies may suffer from rhythm problems. <br /> <br /> Snipes, as I mentioned, is rather bland here. At first he is putting a person in the camp while he is disguised with some arms dealers. At first it seemed like he was having fun, but unfortunately the rest of the film sees him and his occasional voice wandering through the paper. Snipes comes to life only when he is called to kick his butt. There is a good deed here, with some quick and grinding martial arts and some pretty aggressive shootings. The film also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca co-star and she's not much of an actress, but she's gorgeous, with a costume that screams "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast enters and leaves with clich√©s and uninteresting roles. <br /> <br /> Snipes happily have better designs lined up from now on. He has another team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, so he will do Chasing The Dragon, by director Chris Nahon, who made Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally, Snipes is apparently doing Toussaint, a biopic drama directed by Danny Glover. The future suddenly looks brighter for Snipes, but let's remember that he was being paid extremely well for his DTV movies, about $ 7 million per film, possibly more. It's also funny to think that Dolph Lundgren, the god of DTV, is making the best movies, directing himself, with the funky Defender and the supremely violent and well-done Russian Specialist, and what else he's doing in one fraction of the budget of these diabolical offers of Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing. * 1/2
