*** Possible spoilers *** I read a bit about Dahmer and saw the new Dahmer movie (with the same name) at an earlier time. This film here focuses heavily on the victims and murders, very little on Dahmer himself. The movie called "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, was very little about his crimes and much about himself. <br /> <br /> I did not find the performance to my satisfaction, had a certain amateur feeling too, especially the probation officer. It also seemed that Dahmer's performance worsened every time he played against the actor of the parole officer. But I may be wrong about this. <br /> <br /> What bothered me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing, but that the filmmakers seemed to try to show "the real deal" about what he did anyway. That's okay - but what I do not understand is why the guy who ran away from his apartment while Dahmer was drinking beer was not described being naked, as that was how it happened. Not a big problem, but it just erodes the quality of the movie that these details are left out. What was not shown or even suggested was Dahmers' sexual obsession with the dead. Again, I do not care that they have not shown it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it somehow in the movie. Conclusion: I think Dahmer's really good movie is yet to be made, a film that embodies not only Dahmer's crimes, but also who he was, and why he did what he did . I think 1.5 or 2 hours are not enough to understand the complexity of it all. This film was just a clipping (sorry for the pun) of the life and personality of Dahmers and gives you no 'near-good' view of your life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
