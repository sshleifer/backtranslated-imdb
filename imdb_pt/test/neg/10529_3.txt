I really tried to like this movie about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young girl if he can accept the death of his wife. I suppose this was to play as a light romantic comedy, but the theme is a bit uncomfortable for me. <br /> <br /> But putting that aside, I found that the dialogue was very much like a play despite being based on a novel and also, the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially for the young protagonist Vincent Spano . <br /> <br /> I was kind of trying to catch up on all the eighty movies that I missed during that decade. It has been my concern that nostalgia fans of the '80s seem to focus on the same central canon of the films, usually featuring the actors and actresses of the maidre and neglecting the other films like the Creator that fell into the cracks. But in the case of this resource, I must say that I can understand it. Not all the movies of the eighties were magical and the Creator is proof of that.
