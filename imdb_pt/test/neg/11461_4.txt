This sequel to the above - and the final entry in the "Kharis" series - is a little more enjoyable overall, but it's also more artificial (hell, we even have a singer / hostess!): Peter Coe is easily the least charismatic of several Egyptian high priests we saw during the course of these films, and Martin Kosleck as his henchman seems disinterested in the process; Kurt Katch, then, is overburdened with a ridiculous accent like the man who discovers the newly reincarnated Princess Ananka: the latter, in the form of Virginia Christine (later a much-used character actress) receives his most substantial "role" and, fact, the sequence of his resurrection of the marshes is a highlight not only of this film, but of the whole series. Unfortunately, here too, Chaney has very little to do, because once again the emphasis is on Ananka, as I said; His Mummy (to which he most often returned to Universal - apart, of course, from his signature role The Wolf Man!) Remains, undoubtedly, his less memorable monster for the studio.
