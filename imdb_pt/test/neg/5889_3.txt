Having been born and raised in Odessa, and having graduated from the "other" high school in the late 70's, Odessa High School, I had mixed emotions about this movie. I do not live in Odessa anymore, but always will be a Texan at heart. I did not like the way this city of more than 80,000 people was portrayed as a small, poor town. If I am wrong about this, feel free to correct me, but I believe that the OHS also plays in the city stadium, and the "House of Panthers Permian" sign that was shown at the stadium used to be on the training ground in Permian . I wish I had seen a little recognition about the rivalry between big game cities in the city every year, OHS vs Permian. I'm curious because the outcome of the game was changed, I think it would have been so dramatic if the actual result was portrayed. Overall, the movie was fine, left me a little homesick, remembering the "good old days" of MOJO.
