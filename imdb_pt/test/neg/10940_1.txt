My friend and I rented this movie and in the first 5 minutes we had no idea what was going on. It looked like it should have finished in the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible movie, my little brother might have been a better actor than some of the movie, and the plot (if you can call it that) was full of holes. I would never recommend this movie to my worst enemy, although I really like it.
