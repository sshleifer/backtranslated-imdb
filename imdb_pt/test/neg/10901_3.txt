Young couple on the road, taking care of their own business and having casual sex in their car during daylight. However, all of a sudden, they are being threatened and terrified by a crazed psychopath in an old rusty pickup truck. Hmm, where have I seen this premise before? Oh yeah, now I remember, we've seen it a thousand times before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were way better than "Rest Stop"! This weak and worthy new movie insults even the intellect of the most demanding horror fans, as it does not feature a unique touch or memorable trick. It's very sadistic and unpleasant, but every horror-killer movie is sadistic and nasty these days, so it's no longer a real surprise, either. The absolute major problem of this production is the unbelievably large number of holes of idiot plots and nonsense subdivisions. Screenwriter and director John Shiban realized very well that the ultra-basic basic plot was hardly enough to fill an entire film, and so he fills his film as a Thanksgiving turkey with stupid and meaningless stuff. Nicole's boyfriend disappears at an abandoned, filthy California rest stop. Killing her character immediately would not result in a very long movie and therefore she later encounters a family of freaks, suffers from visions (?) In which she speaks to the previous victims of the insane killer and she has a deep emotional feeling (and annoying ) talks to a policeman who just will not die even if a truck has run over him ... twice! Donkey subplots never get anywhere and are definitely the most pathetic and desperate attempts to extend the length of a movie I've ever seen. Instead of all meaningless filling, Shiban should have paid more attention to increasing tension and making his main characters a little nicer. Nicole, the character of Jaimie Alexander, is a boring, brainless girl, and you will not mind if she survives the ordeal or not. Your boyfriend Jesse, as well as the cop, are both whining losers and their brutal deaths have not yet been painful enough, if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, all including torture and gratuitous mutilation, which were bloody and exciting enough to bring a sadistic smile on my face. This is still very little for a horror movie nowadays. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a miserable attempt to cash in on the success of movies like "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but you better watch the originals. This was the first film by the new producer called 'Raw Feed'. They are promoting themselves as the new name with great horror, but they will have to come up with something much better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
