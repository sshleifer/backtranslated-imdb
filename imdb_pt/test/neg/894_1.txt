(Spoilers Ahead!) This exact same plot of this movie was made before. It was made on Ferris Bueller's day off! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays sick. His credulous parents believe him. Your sister knows he's faking it, but she still needs to go to school! She is mad. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. By the time his parents come home, he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party. I like Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!
