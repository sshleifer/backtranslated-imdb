This piece of garbage belongs to the basement of an old moldy mansion, where you will never see the light of day again. The only scary thing about this crap was the price of the entree. I only had fun when the final credits began rolling and I was free to vacate the auditorium. How annoying not mitigated; a complete waste of 1 Â½ hours. When I die, I pray that I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the idiot who wrote this jargon.
