This is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that begin with two possessions of tough gang members facing each other in a park; and when the deal goes awry and the battle begins, they all know karate and kung fu! Woody Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, unimpressive and good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her law enforcement partners are trying to get rid of a fake ring, and when that plot is exhausted, the story turns to something else, and Cynthia becomes the personal guard of a rich and handsome tycoon. Within the budget of the film, obviously there is some helicopter action, some speedboats, some car chases, a fight in which Cynthia beats everyone in a western bar, some pool scenes with bikini bimbos and surprisingly good horse chase . About a dozen police officers are shot down. Many twists happen that simply do not make sense; Do not worry about them. (And counterfeiting is a federal crime, so where the hell is the FBI?) I think they were too busy.) The choreography of the fight was made by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent co-star, Richard Taylor, whose sleek, witty presence in front of the camera frankly made this a better movie. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she looks tired and bored, and does her best at GUARDIAN ANGEL when she is playing in front of a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. The dog almost knocked her down! She also wears some of the most horrible clothes that any protagonist has ever used in any movie: wide, loose jeans with acid washed areas on each buttock were the most shocking. The other actors are all over the map. You can imagine many of the smaller characters being cast like this: "Hey, me and some other guys I know will be in a movie. Then there are the professionals in the favela: the most entertaining is Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of "Red Shoe Diaries", "Baywatch", "Melrose Place", and to play many, many other variations of the sexy French bomb; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or an episode of "Alias" and not some direct trash for the cable like this. There's also the tall, dark, handsome Daniel McVicar, now a regular contributor to "The Bold and the Beautiful," John O'Leary, who played a worthy old man in dozens of sitcoms movies and episodes and does it again here, and Aharon Ipale, the veteran Arab actor perhaps better known as "The Pharaoh Seti" of THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL should be the most laughable entry of their resumes. I gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are martial arts enthusiasts, like to see a woman kicking her ass and having the big action scenes for a change. They're still a little too young to care about the low-key image they really were, and they just liked to applaud Cynthia while she did her thing with stick-legs, high kicks, and stick-fights. If you like this kind of movie, you could probably enjoy that level.
