The first time I saw this was when I was on a date, and she thought it was an incredible movie. I did not do. <br /> <br /> The second time I saw this was last night on TV. Still sucks. <br /> <br /> Like a love story, this sucks. Like having Julia portraying a street hooker, that's repulsive. To me, she was a librarian in miniskirts and high heels. She did not have a hard shell for her. She was not tortured, anguished, infuriated, hungry or anything. His "HOOKER" character was as flawed as comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. The two just do not fit, no matter how they look. <br /> <br /> The only cast that I felt was worth watching was the two sluts, who were excellently climbed. They did such a good job that I hated them for the few seconds they were on the screen. They had a real definition for smaller roles. Okay, so the movie was not totally trash ... the two ignorant salespeople saved the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two saleswomen, the rest of the cast ... including the big names was just crap. Either everyone was an idiot or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialogue in the film besides praising Julia Roberts or kissing Richard Gere's butt. <br /> <br /> This was a movie about how when you walk around in high heels and a tight skirt in Beverly Hills, people look at you and the guys who work in hotels gape as if they had a baseball in the face. <br /> <br /> Although, in reality, women who are dressed up in Beverly Hills are prostitutes and prostitutes to a greater degree, but since they are not wearing the garish Madonna looking for jewelry or patent boots, they can to despise others who do. <br /> <The cast of the hotel was sickeningly sad to watch, and anyone who had any real character had less than a minute of time on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas, and even prostitutes who confront rich clients every day with hopes that their lives will work out perfectly. <br /> <br /> The story is about Jul I Roberts being PIMPED (yes, PIMPED) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine. <br /> <br /> She still owns, it is still said how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. He is more controlling than a street pimp, but Disney Buena staff makes it easier to swallow. Richard Gere was a nigger with a gold tooth and an AK At his side, instead of an attache case, this movie would be about how a woman has to fight to get away from the harshness of prostitution. Same story, different characters will make a very different perspective. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, change the white man for a black man or an Asian or a Spanish man, get the business deal changed for a quantity of weapons or narcotics. and the whole concept of romantic comedy is thrown away. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Pretty Woman is still trash, dressed in ribbons and bows. <br /> <br /> I did not. I liked it 15 years ago when I did not get it and I was taken by Hollywood hype. I hate now that I can see beyond the beautiful decor that is called "love". <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT a romantic comedy. It's a story about how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income for it. <br /> <br /> This is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen. <br /> <br /> I hate it? Yes. Is that a damn? Yes, would I recommend it to you? NO ... well, maybe if I really hated you. <br /> <br /> This comment will be posted? We will see. <br /> <br /> Anywayz, that's all for now.
