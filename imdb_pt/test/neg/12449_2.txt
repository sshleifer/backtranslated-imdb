Returning to the sender, also known as Convicted, is almost imperfect. The only good thing about this particular movie is that I was never bored. That being said, the critics who consider this film as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Instead of writing a review and telling you what happens and what works and does not work, I will simply comment that nothing works. There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi. The acting in the film is not very good, although this may be the result of a script so poorly formulated that it could have been a ghost written by George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional costumes or costumes for that particular movie, and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention there were some holes in the plot? At the end of the movie, you're wondering how blind a man can be such a good shot with a shotgun, why Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, why would she sleep the night before her client gets killed, how Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps crashing for the rest of the movie because Aidan Quinn did not make a fifth instead of a lot of pinches, etc. <br /> <br /> With all that being said, this is certainly a B movie, and a terrible one in that. The most pitiful is that this is not bad enough to be good. If you value your time, please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this.
