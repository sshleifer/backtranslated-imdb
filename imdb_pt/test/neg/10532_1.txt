Every once in a while some amateur will come out with a weary bit of making action movies. this is so wrong that I do not think I need to comment on the plot, acting, screenplay, camera work. because you do not have any !! If you put a muscled guy in a cool leather jacket walking in slow motion and playing a funky rap song is the main ingredient of making a great action movie, then sayonara action movie !!
