This is one of those weird, self-important and self-indulgent movies that tries very hard to be profound. It is not. Instead they shed clich√©s that try to go through the Depth. Typical is the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how the man begins to nurse life, then suckles the breast of the girlfriend and finally the wife, concluding that life is a damn it . So deep. We are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective on life, the universe, etc. during the journeys of Adam through the Mojave Desert on foot. (He abruptly leaves L.A on his wedding day and his family, friends and fiance assume that he is dead when his car was found in a military test field destroyed by a rocket.) Some characters are more fun than others. The best, by far, is a fugitive from a psychiatric hospital that only speaks through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, makes some great prints, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with Adam again and his quest for the deep. It's a long trip, it creeps in many places. In fact, it's the longest and half hour I've ever seen. And the ending hardly makes it seem worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I discovered this movie playing HBO one day, waking up early and clicking on the TV. This will learn me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep.
