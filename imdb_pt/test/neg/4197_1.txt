This is absolutely the dumbest movie ever produced in front of a camera. I can not believe I was naive enough to rent this piece of junk. I've seen some bad movies in my time but this takes the cake .... Ice cream ,,, and chips too. Omg, I still can not understand how bad this thing was. The acting was a joke ... The plot was non-existent ... and the camera work had to be done by a 3-year-old child. I've never seen a movie take so long to go anywhere. I mean, the whole movie could have been filmed in less than 30 minutes. I think this guy had some extra time in his hands .... (like 3 hours) And an extra $ 60 in his wallet, and decided one night ... (Hey .. Let's make the stupidest movie ever made .) And they did just that. Give me a break. I'm going back to the video store right now to get my money back. Anyone else who has seen this piece of junk should do the same.
