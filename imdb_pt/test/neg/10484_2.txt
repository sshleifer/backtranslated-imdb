When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals falls in a small Texas town, people begin to die. The county sheriff tries to investigate, but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials. It turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla in the teen murderers loose in the forest. <br /> I like low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought there would be a good chance I would like this movie. Unfortunately, I did not. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the poor performance, the mushy dialogue, the atrocious soundtrack or the giant holes that this movie has. There are many movies that have the same problems that I have seen and enjoyed in such a bad way that it is good. <br /> <br /> But where others of this type and Night Fright differ is that Night Fright has ended has a terrible rhythm. And it creeps because of it. There are scenes that simply continue without anything happening - the search for clues in the forest is just people walking in the forest for a long time; there are lots of teenagers dancing seemingly endless at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting is happening. If these scenes were shorter, the film might not have been so boring (though I did not think that simply cutting those scenes would save that movie). <br /> <br /> I have now given this film three visions to make sure I gave it a go before hitting it in this review. Unfortunately, it got worse with each clock. There will not be a room.
