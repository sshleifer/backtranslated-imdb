A couple of friends and I visited the video store a few years ago and we were in one of those moods to rent a few movies without being seen. My friend grabbed the head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well, that made us laugh and we decided to make a bet to see who would be the one who would have to go to the table and pay for the movie. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life. We got home and put him on the ground laughing for about 45 minutes because that was the funniest movie in the world. I can not remember much about this, but one thing I remember was the blonde girl getting a guy in the back of a store every 5 minutes. That head made me laugh and when I look at other people's comments about this movie, it makes me laugh even more. Head of the family is so good and the head is funny and I'm still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
