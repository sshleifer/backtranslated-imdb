Man and Low Edward G. Robinson (as Wilbert Winkle) decides to leave his job at the bank and do what he wants, to open a repair shop behind his house. Robinson is married but has no children; He became friends with the local orphanage Ted Donaldson (as Barry). Young Donaldson is an attentive workshop assistant and sees Robinson as a father figure. Robinson's annoying wife, Ruth Warwick (as Amy), is dissatisfied with Robinson's choice of work and conspires to return the subject to his idea of ​​normalcy. Their lives are even more disturbed when Robinson is summoned. <br /> <br /> The war also disturbs what could have been an interesting story, as Robinson's character struggles with a domineering, unfriendly wife. Possibly, filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and redirect lives positively. Robinson and Donaldson are a friendly staff. Robert Mitchum has a little auspicious part. The end of the "trick" played by Warwick and Donaldson is predictably staged.
