I've been in a bad movie run. This is a clinker about a fire plan and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, whom I really like, was quite young here. He is a builder with a passion but he has a partner whose profit motive includes over insurance and burning. In the mix comes an agent, who is drowned, his daughter and his crazy boyfriend. James Mason plays the insurance investigator. Any idiot, given a little warning, would know that something was rotten in the nation of Australia. Still, they bumble their way. The most interesting thing for me was that the huge hotel that would be built never passed a lot of sticks. Low budget, I guess. The plot could have been interesting. Maybe they should have hired a movie editor (what did they do?). Half the time you do not know where the characters are, but I guarantee a reward of five million dollars would probably have done a close watch on the mandatory structure. Does not work Although there is a lot of pure fire.
