There's no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch that Stole Christmas, so let's take this part of the way. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and undervalued movie. Cat was ... well, just awful. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey has been cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian, and fearlessly commits himself to extravagant characters. Mike Myers stepped back in his old bag of tricks. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? Kids could care less, and the demographic of Austin Powers will not spy on this movie. So what was the studio thinking? <br /> <br /> The Cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond. We can talk? Why a New York accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has written. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish hut. I wonder how many different voices the director and studio tried to edit before they had just given in and said "as long as you do not say fahklempt", you can keep the accents. "Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort, whether with the costume, make-up, or dialogue." The jokes, which were few, were crude and age-inappropriate.When Myers picks a hoe in the garden, delivery to the camera: "dirty naughty", everything but the border photo was missing, and even that would not have helped. The same people who created "Whoville" clearly had a hand in creating the The sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer a much-needed distraction from bad writing, directing, and Myers. There was a bit of fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware that she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic and remained true to the genre. neutralized and never play again again. Please, please, no sequel.
