Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally explodes a school bus full of children who is so disgusted with his actions, decides to leave the IRA and runs away in London. > <br /> !!!! IMPECCABLE SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the film is quite disturbing, since the lives of little children end up in a fireball. Things like this have happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and the 1990s in Northern Ireland, which gives A PRAYER FOR THE DYING an absolute realism. However, as soon as Fallon decides that he will give up the violence (what, he is a terrorist and has never exploded innocent passersby before?) Realism disappears and cliches and ridiculous twists occur. Martin is employed by the underworld of London (they do not have their own killers?) To commit a coup while he wears a "uniform" IRA (he never knew that the uniforms wore uniforms) in a graveyard in broad daylight uses a bomb placed under a car?) Where he is seen by a priest who recognizes him while he was in the SAS. Hands up who think I'm lying? I'm not and we're in the middle of run time and there are still lots of cliches to come <br /> <br /> That all sounds pretty silly and it is, but what do you expect from a Jack Higgins novel? Everything is cliché, artificial and stereotyped and the bits that are not are simply bizarre. Critics massacred this film when it left, most notably they claimed it could have some potential if the film had Bob Hoskins playing gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates playing the SAS soldier turned priest and for the first time critics would be right. They should also note that the film could have been less terrible if Fallon was played by someone who could do an Irish accent. Rourke can be handsome and macho (Oh another movie with an Iber uberhunk), but accents are not his strong point any more than the character's acting is. To give an idea of ​​how PRAYER FOR DEATH is disappointing, the director eventually denied, which is always a bad sign. As a footnote, the original release of PRAYER TO DIE in Britain was postponed for several months. because of the "bombing Enniskillen". In November 1987, the Provisional IRA blew up a bomb in the center of Enniskillen, where a Remembrance Day parade commemorating Britain's war dead was being held. Eleven (11) people were killed and more injured. It was not an accident and no one left the IRA because of it.
