I'm a big fan of Shirley Temple. When I saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child Shirley really was. Ashley Rose Orr has possibly made the worst Shirley on the screen. Imagine an 11-year-old playing Shirley Temple from the age of five. That alone is wrong. But to make her "imitate" Shirley's voice? And she singing is pitiful. The dance was good, I'll say that. As previous reviewers have said, there have been little dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I wish I had seen more of the world phenomenon that Shirley Temple created. There was a lot of focus on the Wizard of Oz, when, in fact, Shirley was only considered for Dorothy. The film portrays it as the end of the world when it can not get the part. Shirley herself said she's glad Judy Garland played her. For me, the star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For great Shirley Temple movies, see Heidi, Poor Little Renegade and Little Miss Broadway.
