Here's a movie that was so pedestrian for 90% that it had no right to become so challenging and frustrating in the end. The director decided to become an author suddenly, 80% during the making of this film? Yeesh. SPOILER ALERT The thing usually begins enough for the young people of 50 years of age; there are vagabonds, good girls, bad girls, gangs, the gentle old manager of cafeterias and the creeping city. Things go the way until about 15 minutes before the end, when the only nice character is killed and the antihero is guilty (this would not be so unexpected if this was the main plot of the movie ... but all this things begin to happen and unfold during the last coil!). Then things get weird; the old coddler gently forms a mob and beats the hero in a bloody pulp. The mere presence of the hero's friend somehow draws a confession from the real killer - the weird and creepy weirdo (that in any real universe he would have been the prime suspect, even if the antihero was found with her body. <br /> <br /> We end up with a "happy" rather weak end, which is as out of character as the rest of the movie as the 10 minute events that preceded it. Even stranger is the insistence of this film on interpreting It was perhaps on purpose - perhaps Bix's resistance to settle with the girl was more because of her sexuality (which in the 1950s would have to be kept fairly suppressed and therefore not discussed or even admitted by him) than his need to be a "vagabond." If the director's intention was to turn it as a sexual thread - that the wanderer floats because he feels that is a sexually excluded; that his parental consideration of Danny is not, in fact, paternal, but conjugal; that her inability to remain with Carrie is rooted in a sexual revulsion she does not even understand-could have been clearer. Instead, we have this bizarre alchemy of homoerotism and completely heterosexual behavior. <br /> <br /> These guys sleep next to each other, even when they get space to spread. When Danny is invited (and once in bed with a woman), Bix dodges and takes him away. Danny pays the way for Bix (of course, there is another explanation for this, but there is still a chord every time you see Danny buy Bix's lunch). They end up living together in the end. Not since Hitchcock's "Rope," homosexuality has been so blatant, but denied. <br /> <br /> MST3K did the right thing by doing this. In addition to Jack Elam, there is little to praise the film.
