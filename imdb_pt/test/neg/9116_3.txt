Personally I watched this because of Lea Thompson's appearance and I really did not expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly I kept watching until the end. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - it's just one of the saga stories and it's not particularly original or entertaining, but strangely it just keeps you on TV. My take on Will of Their Own would be much better if there was not one point I just do not understand. <br /> <br /> There's a beautiful and really picky scene in which the character of Lea Thompson is running down the street holding the baby in her arms, the snow falling, she's cold, scared and has nowhere to stay, does not know what to do next. And then, about 10 to 12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same kid without any warning to resume the career she was dreaming of. <br /> <br /> I just did not get it. "I do not see how it is possible for her to do such a thing, it was the action opposite to everything she has done so far in her life, when everything she was doing aimed at child survival. After that character, I could not enjoy the rest of the movie.
