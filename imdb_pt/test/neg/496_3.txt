Here's another great movie that critics will love. The problem is that it's not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth goes mad and tells them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> The first time has a lot of clowning, something very broad, while the second time is a descent guided by a character. fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> The two halves simply do not mix. Individual scenes work very well (The guys who hit a friends house with a new Filipino fiance are hilarious, while a later scene with the big guy who works in the restaurant pulls out the heart strings.) They just do not mix. The movie is also missing entire set-ups. One scene shows the guys looking desperately for a vending machine to buy a snack. The next scene has all the crew standing in a restaurant. Where did they get their dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a dwarf.) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And more intriguing is why they are in the drag? Are they clearly expensive in the drag and let's face it there is something more memorable for witnesses than a big dwarf and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big man and the dwarf, because in addition to the old man everyone seems to mix. (In fact, they wear matching overalls for most of the film). The film has very little character development in the first time and as a result, the second time really does not have an emotional impact. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual reward scenes. Speaking of a second half drag has all these wonderful camera takes wonderful and great emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great movie. It's also terribly slow, which makes a boring movie. <br /> <br /> The 9 Souls is a big disappointment, the reviews talk about a great movie and it's there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.
