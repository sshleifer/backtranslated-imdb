A horrible mish mash of predictable plots and lousy players cliches ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart too beautiful, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father / daughter relationship etc etc etc). The movie looks like something created for the television network and probably should have stayed there. Even the talented Tommy Lee Jones can not save this PUMP. I urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin since the time when catastrophe movies traveled Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The two stars are given solely to the CGI people and the ability of public relations people. Get even a movie goer to watch it.
