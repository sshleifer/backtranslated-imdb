I was a teenager when it first appeared in theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The storyline of the movie was not my cup of tea in the second year of high school, but I went to see the 3-D process. It had been hyped in the press so even the overseas service people had heard of it, though it had never been shown in the Post theater. <br /> <br /> The film began the trend of throwing objects in the audience, which was taken. to absurd levels with later 3D movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this qualifies as a spoiler, but you've been warned if it is. In many films of the time, the actors used to work in front of a "rear projection screen," in which backgrounds could be designed to give the impression that they were in a different environment, like a jungle background when the actors were in a real moment. stage of sound. This works well in ordinary movies, but when viewed in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film in which the rear projection was used and did not work well in theaters. If seen in 3-D, it will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only importance of the film is historical, since it was the first of its kind.
