The premise of this movie is ughghhh. The guy is married, and yet everyone on this site seems to think, "Yeah, that's funny, cute, and a good movie." What the hell?!?! What's funny about immature girls fornicating with a man married to a new baby? What's cute about the fact that he's cheating on his wife? What was wrong with them finding some teenagers to have sex before they started college? Noooo, this is not good enough, the guy has to be married, out of bounds, out of the market, that's what we have to have. Dumb girls! Then one of the girls decides that she "loves" the guy. No, she just "loves" the way he makes her feel. Two of the girls are having fun with it, they think it's funny and no one seems to have any moral issues with what they're doing. It's just shameless, but yes that's all good with everyone on this site. The dark-haired girl even has the audacity to have her father take her to the boys' house, under the ruse of sitting down. This is a morally disgusting movie and where is the wife? Poor woman working and paying bills while he squeezes the nanny.
