Maybe I'm being very generous when I give this movie two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment. However, as "An American Werewolf" movie this is a missed chance! There are no actual plotting links to the original upper to speak, but the story is similar in some ways to "London." <br /> <br /> * Possible Spoiler Warning * American children go to foreign country, one falls in love with a cute girl. Another of the children is killed by a werewolf on the same night that someone is bitten, and despite the warnings of his undead friend, in the light of the full moon it gushes hair, fangs and claws! <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in history, for example; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; There are three American children. And third; There is a strange - werewolf @ $$ wishing to conquer the world! As crazy as it seems, that last one, it was not a joke! * Spoiler Ends * The movies suffer from many things, first the poor performance drags you immensely! Tom Everret Scott's performance is, at best, amateurish, and he and Julie Delpy, who interprets his love interest, do not seem to have any chemistry together. Second; A weak script that seems to be everywhere. Many elements of suspense and obscure comedy, which made the original great, are lacking in this. And who said that eating the heart of the werewolf who bit will change you back human? Lastly I heard this was not part of the werewolf lore at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are made with computer animation, which works for things like dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. But it seems agitated, fake and artificial, when used for hairy creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> However, there have been a few things that have saved this from the total "turkeydom", there is a hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he puts a lot of condoms on the table and try to pass them like chewing gum, chewing and blowing a bubble! Besides that; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word "moon" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is great, though. And another funny scene when a rotting corpse, played by Julie Bowen, tries to whistle and her eyeball pops, made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> But as a whole this movie seems to lack humor and suspense. of the original. And the overly planned end also does not help much. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half out of five stars (average.)
