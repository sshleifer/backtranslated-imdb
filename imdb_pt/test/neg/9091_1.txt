I was a bit disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me an INSTANT Tsukamoto fan of the first 5 minutes of the movie. It was fresh, innovative and just ..... different. I'd rather enjoy a movie in your face and push all the "make you squirm" buttons. Tetsuo did just that, for me, few movies do. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like to take in some fresh air, those who enjoy the unusual styles used to make indie movies worth it, Testuo II will probably be a cover-up. If you're looking for the visceral "HYPER-KINETIC" feel of the first movie, skip this one, since all of this has been ripped off. Tetsuo II is for some strange reason, just a typical Hollywood-style action movie. I was a bit confused. However, still worth it in my opinion to any fan of Tsukamoto.
