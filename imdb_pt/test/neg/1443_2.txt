Unbelievable. Great cast, good acting, interesting plot. <br /> <br /> But this movie has graphic cruelties that are not tense or provoke emotions, only disturb the sheer ruin. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone could see the abnormal coming back to their habits. And that Robert Englund was acting (was he?) Like an idiot; forbidding his daughter to sleep with a footballer, but he trying to kill an idiot and like kiddypr0n okay?! <br /> <br /> The cop that his daughter was kidnapped - did anyone feel he was a cop and not an actor? I do not. This movie continues and ends with an ending we see in other horror films: if the returns were good, a part 2 could be made. Bad things, very bad things. It may give shivers some inspiration ...
