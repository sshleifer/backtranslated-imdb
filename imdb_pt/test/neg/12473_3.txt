At least for me. I have been following Mr. Almdovar's career from the beginning and I have not been crazy about this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was miscast, the kind of woman she is portraying does not look so good, she makes the character unbelievable. Besides, the singing scene was just weird. I do not understand the point and the lip sync was awful. <br /> <br /> As Spanish, another thing that has driven me crazy are the accents. Why do people coming from the same place have a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and makes no sense. And the village? Are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", things are not like that anymore. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more, but this time Mr.Almodovar did not deliver, at least to me. I'm not saying that Miss Cruz does a bad job, I'm saying she does not belong there, not portraying this character.
