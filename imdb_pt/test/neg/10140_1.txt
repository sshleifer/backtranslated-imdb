Reba sucks. It's a hard drug. It's about this horrible country singer trying comedy. They can also call this show "generic," because that's right. It's dumb and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your retarded show was canceled because you suck, and Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-haired teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12-year-old kid who was knocked out. You are all bad and none of you are funny. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a gay devil worshiper who idolizes Hitler and tortured animals. And she puts subliminal messages into her program and into her "music" hoping to make the kids kill their parents and kill each other! But it was just a rumor. Anyway, this is the worst show of all time, Reba is gay, I do not like her, I think The Office is better than this show, and this show sucks.
