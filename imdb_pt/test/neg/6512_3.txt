A not so good action thriller because unsuccessfully has the same water as the first Steven Seagal films because there is not a very good piece. Steven Seagal plays the same type of character he plays since Above the Law. In my opinion, Keenen Ivory Wayans' performance is wasted on such a medium movie and it belongs to a much better movie. Bob Gunton is well as the main heavyweight. The best performance in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox, who is very scary in the role of the killer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the reasons for the film to see The Glimmer Man (1996) is for the brief appearance of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox. It's too bad that there were no more scenes with her in them.
