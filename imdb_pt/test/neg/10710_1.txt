Warning: this can spoil your movie. See, see if you agree. <br /> <br /> To think that we as humans can not learn from the past. The futuristic society portrayed glamourized what Hitler believed, obliterate a race of people (in this case men) for the benefit of society. It made my stomach hurt. Also the plausibility of a Y-bomb is insane. Even in war, our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity. We made mistakes in the past, namely Japan, Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 45, but because of this we avoided a bigger mistake in 1963 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
