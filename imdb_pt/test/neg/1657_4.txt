Very slow movie, bland and cryptic. Maybe the kind of movie that Jean-Luc Godard would have done if he was Italian. It certainly conveys how boring, repetitive, sad and empty a person's life may be, but I usually do not go to the movies to figure it out! The plot (as it is) does not convince. Why would a wonderful hotel receptionist (an exception to the stupidity of the movie) be a little interested in a lonely melancholy, inveterate and silent smoker who speaks in "deep" aphorisms that confuse me. Very difficult to feel some sympathy with the main character. A person feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to "get out of this!". Your brother is a much more human character. The ending is inconclusive and intriguing. Everyone in the movies (when I saw the movie) left mumbling about how they almost fell asleep. Of course it should not be a Bruce Willis-style party in Hollywood, but a little energy and action would make it all the more exciting. One of the best Italian films of all time? Please ... An art house, curiosity at best.
