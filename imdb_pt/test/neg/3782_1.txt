This is a really bad movie. However, I read it was done by a high school teacher, so maybe I should give at least a little praise for its ambitious (though horrible) special effects. Here's the plot: A monster emerges from a pile of litter and pollution in the town of Milpitas, California and embarks on a destructive fury. I'm about to spoil the "big surprise" about how the monster looks, so please read the rest at your own risk. You've been warned! The monster looks like a giant two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. To stay away!
