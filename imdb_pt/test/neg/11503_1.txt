I think it was like Lizzie McGuire except that it was much worse than the original. The only thing that is different is that she likes animals and science and all these nerdy things. everything else is the same she likes a guy she's too nervous to ask. and then she finds a guy who likes her and she has no idea. I think people need to stop doing that same kind of program. and another thing that is the same thing is that it is always defrost friends are two girls and one guy. people do not think these things get old and tired and these ideas continue to be used over and over and still continue to use those ideas. but I know people who watch this show and I know they like them.
