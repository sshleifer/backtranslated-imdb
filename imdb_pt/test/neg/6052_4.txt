The problem with this movie is that it's trying to compile a 6+ hour movie in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, too clear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only positive side is the beginning. It explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just jumbo mumbo which is put together. It has the potential to be a great movie like LOTR, if not forced for two hours. <br /> <br /> The acting is also not very convincing. Okay, not everything is bad. But most of them are. Special effects are stupid and seem to be made ten years earlier (though the first monster is very good). Overall, I give it 4 out of 10 for the reasons I described above.
