I can not believe how this movie really sucks. the plot (written by keira knightley's mother) is what spoils the film to the extreme. it's straightforward, meaningless, absurd, and it makes absolutely no sense ... <br /> <br /> This movie got so bad most of the time, especially in the beginning. the story kept talking about their daily flirtations, often looking like a trio. In this movie, you have a boring and ruthless couple (the poet and his wife) who are drunk full and complete from the start. the wife sleeps with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who lives off boos and cheap women. the wife, who waaayyyyyy quickly becomes friends with her former childhood lover (played by keira), suddenly becomes jealous, knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were children. something does not seem right here .... I mean, come on ... stick with the lady program! What did you expect? <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: ex-boyfriends are reunited with a new wife by embracing her, then she becomes envious, so ex-lover marries and her husband gets jealous, bombs the couple's house crazy and drunk the crazy husband calls the police and they end up going to court for attempted manslaughter. this is summed up in a nutshell ... <br /> <br /> This movie had moments like the quality and good acting of Cillian Murphy, but in addition, I can not believe I watched ... I complained about it during the movie and some family members watching with me fell asleep. I decided to take a chance and I should have stuck to my first instincts.
