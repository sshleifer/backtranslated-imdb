This movie tries hard, but fails. Perhaps for the non-Australian audience it may have appeal as a travel diary, but for the native it is simply tedious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who lives here knows that Broken Hill is a difficult and difficult mining town. If a couple of quoted fruits appear in the drag, well, everything is so predictable. Where have I seen this theme well worn before? Ah yes - city rat and country mouse. Save us. <br /> <br /> I kept hoping it would get better, but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where that was going and then I turned off the TV and went to bed.
