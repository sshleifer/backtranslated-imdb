Here's a summary of a typical Rachael Ray show: 1. The awful theme song begins to play, and Rachael descends wearing her Snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo lift. 2. She starts running screaming and / or insulting the audience, then yells at them to sit down. 3. A clumsy monologue. <br /> <br /> (The next one is in any order) 4. A horny honking Horn of Rachael (ie, "I lost 500 pounds with Rach's recipes", Rachael Ray saved my life. " Rachael's fashion. ") 5. A totally useless DIY tip (ie how to engrave words on casserole dishes, how to use your washer as a salad spinner, how to build a lipstick tube with a light on it) (Reaction photos of the first bites are never shown) 7. Celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously written questions from the audience 8. A person receiving help from one of the comparsas of Rachael (that is, I say yes to all woman, I do not own anything but lady overalls, and I can not find time to put makeup on) What would they do without you Rachael. * Sigh * <br /> < Reasons that this show should be avoided as the Plague: 1. Fakeness: Rachael Ray states that the whole show is unscripted. Those who participated in program recordings stated that the entire program was scripted. Many of these same people also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the program. <br /> <br /> 2. Your show jumps a lot: Where, as Oprah, who is the most-talked-about talk show host of all time, has a definite theme for her show, Rachael's jumps like a soda kid of ADHD in crack. His show has on average 10, short, worthless segments, a show. In the second you'll get Kojo fashion tips, and the next Rachael will be making "Spanish" thick chili peppers with Manchego cheese, and next his will be a giant anaconda on stage, and the next, well, you'll see the photo. . <br /> <br /> 3. Rachael is a poor hostess with bad ideas: aside from her annoying personality, Rachael's hosting ability is terrible at best. Their questions to celebrities are bad, and often are not relevant to the interview, and their segments are unattractive and offer little educational or humorous value. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you do not have to waste your time. with this schlock. It will be canceled soon anyway.
