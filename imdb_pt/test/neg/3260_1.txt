Watch this movie ..... just to really appreciate how good the original is. I'm not really that hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurt me deeply because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. The writing was simply terrible! I thought Chevy would at least ad libted some better things than it did. There was almost nothing to laugh about in this movie. I went into it wanting to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh, but I almost cried. <br /> <br /> In the opening credits, he reads the Chevy Chase Special Appearance. It worried me from the start. Chevy is actually more than I thought it would be. It is more than a "special look". Too bad the appearance was not special. The character of Mason would have been a good secondary character, but he was old as principal. I'd rather have seen more (much more) of Dyan Cannon. At least his character was fun if not well written. I also missed the gratuitous teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from cute and innocent to an unpleasant rodent that deserved to be blown up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that interested me and we did not see enough of him. <br /> <br /> I withdraw. Try watching half of that movie, so ... remember the Alamo, the Maine, and the Caddy Shack I.
