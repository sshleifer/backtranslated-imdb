I had been wanting to see An American Werewolf in Paris for a long time because I loved its predecessor, but this film did not impress me as much as An American Werewolf in London. In fact, to be honest, it did not impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his friends are wandering in Paris and in an absurd shootout of the Eifel Tower, rescuing wolves. Delia cat Julie Delpy. Before you have time to exercise, if constant dialogue with assaults and smugness is a comedy affair, a full moon hits and the brats are being chased by terrible CGI werewolves in the Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The script is disgustingly poor, the actors were meant to make this movie, they are horrible performances that match the status of the movie. From beginning to end, this movie is never fun, engaging or even slightly watchable. I had trouble watching this whole movie without vomiting my dinner, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are not exciting, the jokes are not funny and the werewolves are not scary. In short: Lose or be haunted forever. <br /> <br /> I rate an American Werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
