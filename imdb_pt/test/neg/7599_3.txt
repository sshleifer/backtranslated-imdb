It's a tradition since my first VHS recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut from Charles Dickens, and I recorded this and "Karroll's Christmas" this year. Luckily, when this one was run on the Hallmark Channel, at the unpublished hour of three in the morning, I was spared from editing his commercials. This was, however, just a saving grace. The writing was terribly dull, with almost no clever scene to save it from being anything more than a little novel like Beverly Hills 90210. In this, a good man who was left behind by his celebrity . seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a TV talk show host similar to Scrooge. Wasted Dinah Manoff who only plays goddess bitch to the other goddess bitch Tori Spelling (who, incidentally, had more layers of paint on his face than some colonial houses) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise melancholy adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best opportunities are wasted as the entrances of ghosts. Aunt Marla's entry might have been spectacularly funny at the hands of a decent writer, but this Christmas turkey did not have one, of course. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling may be a lovely person, but she has all the acting. skill of a mannequin, and this makes a bad show by itself. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman working again, but the script gives him nothing to do except roll his eyes and make a really lame dialogue. <br /> <br /> And what is it? The most infuriating thing was that the transformation from Scroogedom to Tori to "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. Now if anyone wants to write the final Scrooge tale of George Bush and Karl Rove, we can have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas Carol Clones. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are a fan of Ms. Spelling and / or 90210, this may be your cup of Christmas joy. I prefer a hard shot of whiskey and a cold beer to wash it myself. This I just can throw away before it's with me for a long time. <br /> <br /> God save everyone!
