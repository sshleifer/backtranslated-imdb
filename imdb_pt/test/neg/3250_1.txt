This movie beats everything out there. Well, it depends on what you're looking for ... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This movie is in a complete league .. I do not think any movie could get close to it. I'm not sure what the director intended it to be ... a thriller or a comedy. If he thought he was doing a thriller, then he had a stroke of luck, created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it ... a matrix + terminator + a series of other films in one, along with a storyline that dates back to the Hindi films of 1980, with an icchadhari naag (a mythical snake that can turn into a human) <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie if you're sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol next door, planning to laugh at the movie! I'm not sure if I should give a 1 or a 10 .. Based on playing a coin, I decided to give a 1!
