I thought that "dolls making phone calls" was very low, but I do not believe Carlos Mencia's program qualifies as a comedy. Its main purpose is to make the public incredibly uncomfortable by using the word "beaner" as many times as possible. I've never felt compelled to write a review stating the horror of anything about IMDb before, but I really hope this show is never renovated or re-run. <br /> <br /> Mencia is trying to be the next Dave Chapelle, and maybe he has only been hired by the network because they expected him to fill his shoes. It's obvious even the feature of Chapelle's intro (blues band vs. mariachi). However, Mencia has absolutely no attitude, and does not plunge into the popular visions of Hispanic culture enough to create a creative nudge each time. Instead, he sticks to a small number of nasty nicknames for his Latino counterparts and makes "jokes" about immigration. From time to time, he will take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of another person, such as Middle Eastern cultures. These jokes consist mainly of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against culture, and perhaps some incredibly old topics (like 9/11), in a watery style, while he laughs at himself to cover up the public's style. . I think he's too scared to really offend anyone, so it makes the viewer feel weird. He also knocks jokes to death. If you've seen "Why the f *** is this news?" You'll know what I'm talking about. It's funny at first, but he just goes on and becomes Captain Obvious at some point. <br /> <br /> It's a train that's purely painful to watch.
