The things I find irritating on the screen, the things I distrust and bother people trying to watch movies with are those times when the writer, director, set designer, or supplier, or whoever, does not think about it. to the end and, with a single act of omission - or commission - undoes all the work done by everyone who worked on the film. That moment of "Wait a damn minute ... What happened?" which stops the dead narrative in its tracks. (Not that the narrative of this movie has needed much interruption, because anyone who has ever seen it will know that Quintet's narrative movement has been very well frozen before the end of the opening scene.) There are several of these moments in this movie. And you take so long to think of them too. The film is two hours long and the scripted dialogue has probably reached five pages. There is a lot of time to reflect on your shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place on a frozen land. Another ice age has set in and the whole world is dying. Is cold. Very cold. It's really too cold on the screen. The film was filmed in Canada in the winter and there are real ice and snow pendants and the breath of people coming out of their mouths in every scene. We are often reminded of how cold it is. People wear big hats and layers and layers of clothing and gingam like Weeble people. It must have been a horrible shoot. My nitpick comes in a sequence when our hero walks into a hotel room. Woken up in the middle of the night by voices from the next room, he hears a conversation of vital importance to the small lot through a large grid on the wall dividing the two rooms. I am not questioning why there is a convenient grid on the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the barbecue had not been blocked by the long-term tenant with the noisy visitor. If you are trying to stay warm, the last thing you need is a huge hole dripping down your wall that leads to an unoccupied and unheated room. Trust me. I live like this, I watched this movie sitting on my couch in the living room under a comforter with a hot water bottle. My breathing was as blurry as the actors'. If that big hole was on my wall, I would block something. It may not be the best movie choice to watch in an unheated room in the middle of winter, but the boy made me notice the lousy isolation in the movie.
