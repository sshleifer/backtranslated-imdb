This movie was terrible. You can not advance fast enough to get to the end of this movie. It got to the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally pushed the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I've ever experienced. Worse than all the Dean Cain movies combined. For starters, the performance was terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivors, but one would think that any TV experience would have given them a little more talent. The main problem of the cinema was the exaggerated visual effect and the low quality of the film. In defense of the films, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was fine.
