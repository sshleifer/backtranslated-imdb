The worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie is pure junk. All things are bad in this movie. The direction, script, arts, cinematography, cast or anything else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is a boy. He has to be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role seems to be 30 years old, in addition he is a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> The issue tries to save him, but with this very bad stuff on hand they can not work miracles. <br /> <br /> Like I said, the cast is poor, the text is bad, it does not help the actors. <br /> <br /> I learned to "do not" make a movie.
