Cameron Mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to come out with the head of a movie studio (she's too young for both of them!). At a party, when he lights his cigarette, the studio boss throws a high-alcohol drink in his face, and it catches fire. At the hospital, his face is completely bandaged and he still lights a cigarette! He becomes the resident sculptor of the Movieland Wax Museum and Palace, where he also lights cigarettes! Mitchell recovers, more or less, having actually done poorly burn makeup on one side of the face that looks like Spackle and gray tape, and an eye patch. When Mitchell is not smoking, he's killing people. Well, he only kills people sometimes, since he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a kind of waxy coma. If he does not administer it regularly (and he never seems to remember), they begin to move again a bit, although they are in some kind of hypnotic zombie state. Not all of his sculptures are people, however. He evidently has talent as a sculptor. <br /> <br /> The ending, which seemed to have been taken from a much poorer print than the rest of the film, is really absurd. They seemed not to know what to do and went back to the title for an idea. In addition to the oddly grainy final photos, the rest of the movie is in good shape except for the audio in some scenes, which sounds like it's an exploded speaker. Definitely not one of the best wax museum films.
