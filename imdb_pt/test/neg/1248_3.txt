20 people rated this as 10! This urn was stuffed better than a Christmas turkey! Speaking of turkey, here is a traditional story, hoping to take advantage of the current poker craze - to no avail. Told entirely in linear flashback, and when I say "counted" I mean TALKING TO DEATH, this movie never lets an image be enough when words can be used to expose. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's infantile fascination with letters and his associations with ruffians may sound like an interesting movie, but the director manages to suck their lives. At no time did I feel a minimum of sympathy for Unger, a card genius who threw everything away into other forms of play in which he was not as competent. Of course this leads, as we go through THREE musical assemblies, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, loss of family, and ultimately redemption (more or less). Big yawn
