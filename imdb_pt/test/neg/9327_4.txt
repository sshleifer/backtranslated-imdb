I hate to admit it, but they were right to fire Schrader. The opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to attract an audience to a movie. It was not done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. The management was very poor. Schrader was out of his depth and it shows. I have watched it several times now, in the hope that there will be at least one ransom appeal. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or, hopefully, left well alone. Anyone who wants to know the best sequel to The Exorcist should read 'Legion', written by Blatty, should be the best accompaniment of an original piece to commit to print. Unfortunately, it did not translate screen very well and I doubt it ever could be. As for Dominion, Beginning. Avoid at all costs.
