San Franpyscho: 1 out of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. But his budget is nonexistent, his camera equipment is old and his stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and one of the favorites in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges of Different Strokes. There are probably ways to extract at least one watchable movie. The Quiroz brothers have no clue. <br /> <br /> First of all, much of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscar actors. Really, how difficult is it to play a dominating priest or mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has some professional actors willing to work for a few dollars and a screen credit. Clearly, Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger who play these roles have other talents, such as landscapist or waitress, who should be very attuned. <br /> <br /> Joe Rosete as the killer (yes, the serial killer is simply known as "The Killer"). ") is also quite awful in a mentally ill method, but I'm almost willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, since his character is written with style or zero personality. A boring and almost risible serial killer is a problem for a movie of serial killer. <br /> <br /> In addition, the Quiroz brothers seem to have originally planned this as an ABC Family movie of the week. <br /> <br /> There is no nudity or violence to speak of and the R rating is clearly for the rhythm of style <br /> <br /> The only occasional horror comes from the illumination of Estevez's face with a glow that makes it appear that his lower jaw has been removed. <br /> < I was not expecting a great movie when I rented San Franpyscho, but I was not expecting mind numbing boredom either.
