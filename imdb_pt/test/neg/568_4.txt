A very funny story idea with good actors, but he misses it somehow. The actors are older, but none of them looked particularly good. They needed a better makeup, a photo or something. It's supposed to be a love story and yet the film had the rough look of a street movie. I liked the cast, but I think the performances were pretty bland. This is where the director's weakness appears. Maybe if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg driving, it would have been a much better film.
