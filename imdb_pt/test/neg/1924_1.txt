*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: this contains spoilers I've seen some very lame movies in my day. And that only makes sense because I watch about 80 movies a year. I would have to say that of the 80 films that I see in the theater, maybe 5 are really very good, 15 or 20 are not so good, 40 or 50 are good and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. Here on Earth falls into a category itself. This is one of the most predictable, vehement and despicable movies I have ever seen. He is loaded with nasty characters, sentimental situations about special subjects after school and enough fluff here to make THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS look like an American BEAUTY. And I'm not being unfair. This is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all the city's residents. Are you getting hot and confused yet? Let me continue. One day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his father bought for him and he insults the pretty girl in the diner, almost gets into a fight with his longtime boyfriend and then runs against him and destroys the small diner she works for. Then he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and his boyfriend have to fix the diner together. What this does gives us plenty of opportunity to see Chris Klein shirtless, so we can understand why the restaurant girl would fall for him. He has abs !!! Oh and he is rich !!! And ... he's the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone. He's James Dean, he's a rebel who does not give a damn !! He's rude to everyone in town, he does not want to partner with someone who's trying to be cool with him and he acts like a rich, pampered kid. But Leelee Sobieski still falls in love with him. There is no reason given why she does, she just does. Oh, pardon me, it's true that I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet she does. Well, if it does not get you wet, then I do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Here on Earth also has some of the most predictable moments I've ever been in the movie. There was a time when I left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the bathroom wall and told my fiancee exactly what would happen in the next ten minutes. On my return she just laughed and said that I was right, even when I said there would be a dance scene. And besides, the disease she suddenly gets is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you watched a cancer patient die slowly? They lose weight, lose hair, gums begin to rot. It is not a beautiful image. Sobieski shines after contracting cancer, as if she were pregnant. What an insult to people who have seen those who love die slowly from this disease. And how do you get knockout cancer from falling into the field? <br /> <br /> Now I realize that I have seen a lot of movies and that makes my cynicism run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous. There was nothing to like about this movie or Chris Klein's character. He's an idiot, he's nasty and he never tries to make amends with anyone around him. Here on Earth is not just a bad movie, it's an irresponsible movie. This got 4.2 on the IMDb voting chart, and that's pretty high. This is an embarrassment to screenwriting, and whoever has given the go-ahead to do it should not just lose his job, but he or she must promise never to step closer to a screenplay. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and this is being generous. This movie should be screened at film schools not to write and direct a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this movie, choose to clean the cow dung. It will smell better and you will feel that you have done something good with your two hours.
