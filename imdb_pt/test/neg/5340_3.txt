Well, it's a monkey quickie from the dreaded period of the 1940s, when the poverty studios release a good number of horror films that are almost unimaginably dull ... So I was expecting the worst. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a doctor who has worked on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of non-utilitarian fixtures that light up very well. A dog's heart hangs under a glass vial and contracts intermittently, which we are told is proof that its method is perfected. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precedes the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a fairly undramatic - undramatic sequence even with the sparks. The important point of the plot is that a convicted murderer is only running at midnight, which ends up being exactly when the young man is revived. It is not surprising that the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesic and with a strange desire to visit the busiest places in the underworld and get acquainted with certain gangsters ... It is difficult to explain why this is not completely unacceptable, but perhaps it is enough to say which is slightly interesting and contains several murders and some interesting characters. In the end, it even begins to fiddle with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to warn you of a very, very bad end. An unnecessary tagged, sorrow in the end sorta ass. After the plot resolves fairly effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the kind of thing ... It's all a dream. Never happened.
