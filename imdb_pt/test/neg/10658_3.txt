Two redeeming qualities of this film were cinematography and a difficult plot to resist. However, the script, the direction and some scenes were terrible. I was wondering why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity that supports the plot of the film, but knew that the film was full of flaws. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better, and reached a larger audience accordingly. What makes me think is that with all the problems of the film, some scenes being painfully bad to watch, I still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would work out.
