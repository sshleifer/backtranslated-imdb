The death of children and horror films will always remain a sensitive and controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to devote itself to this topic should receive extra attention from horror fans. Of course, as in the case of "Wicked Little Things," controversial themes do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially intriguing plot, the atmospheric scene and the involvement of nasty video director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer"), this is an uninspired and cliché-filled film that could not offer a single shock or shock. After losing her husband and father, the remaining women of Tunny (mother Karen and their daughters Sarah and Emma) move to a small, remote mountain town in Pennsylvania, where they inherited an old ruined mansion. Their new home is dangerously close to the ancient ruins of mines, where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. Strange things begin to happen, like the young Emma making friends with a girl (imaginary?) Who lived in her house, and the mysterious places seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly happens that the undead children still leave their tombs at night to seek revenge against the descendants of the owner of the mine, Mr. Carlton, who was responsible for their deaths. "Wicked Little Things" is pretty tame and extremely predictable. The script blatantly serves a horrible cliché after another, like car wheels caught in the mud at crucial times, defective lanterns and horribly broken dolls. There is very little suspense, less blood and makeup effects are disappointingly weak. The toddlers do not look threatening. In fact, they all look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with their black clothes, pale faces and dark eyes. The emotionless ending is stupid and as derivative as the rest of this meaningless production. Lori Heuring is utterly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the remake of "Halloween") and young Chloe Moretz are fit as daughters.
