An extensive comedy, ambitious and without plot, that has no dramatic center. It was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealist style (at least in some episodes), but the separate stories are never raised in a meaningful whole, and the laughter is few and far between. Final fun, though. (* 1/2)
