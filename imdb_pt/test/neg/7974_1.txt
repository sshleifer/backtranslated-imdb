The first question is: how many untalented idiots are needed to spoil a movie? Answer: one is more than enough if he writes the script and directs it. The second question is: did anyone teach the actors how to handle the weapons correctly? Answer: Hell no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson was hit in the face with hot brass - because it seemed so! The third question is: how many times have we made the "super secret government agency conspiracy discovered inside the plot"? Answer: a good couple too! The fourth question is: Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman are overrated? Answer: in this movie, unfortunately, yes. The fifth question is: can a pair of boobs save this movie? Answer: Up to three (Kristy Swanson's pair and director / writer) did not. <br /> <br /> God ... If I see the (most likely) murderer packing his weapons for an attack, then the idiots in the propeller department give her a completely different set of the first bloody thing in the damn movie , the "suck" meter reaches the peak. Movie start time until I turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than it took me in case of "Alone in the Dark".
