I really belong to the demographic Zoey 101 specifically trying to achieve, so I can see that as much as she tries to be relatable to people my age, the premise is simply too ridiculous for an ordinary person to relate to. The show revolves around the richest boarding school there is, and the adorable, incredibly tanned and attractive gang of unilateral characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition among children's networks, the cast is a series of thin, white boys with the symbolic black face, of course. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Zoey and her gang of friends coming across creating some kind of small dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gym classes, resulting in Zoey planning a scheme to save the day all your friends. Generally, there is a B-line spinning around a unilateral guest character or putting supporting characters in completely unreal situations, like having a beehive of wasps in a dorm and no one noticing. These plots often throw away stereotypes, as any character who takes good grades in math should, by default, lack social skills. Most episodes have the continuous and excessive will - they do not - they, Chase-Zoey, dynamic. <br /> <br /> The characters, unfortunately, are incredibly unilateral; there's Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything, Chase, the constantly passionate but captivating Best Friend, Michael, the symbolic black guy (Congratulations to Christopher Massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners), Lola the Girl of the theater (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her stardom dreams, despite the fact that she never does anything in the theater), Logan, the womanizing narcissist, Dustin, the spazzy little brother and Quinn the science geek. The few words I've spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 manages to be entertaining at times, but serious flaws in the value system she promotes are a major departure. Zoey, who is the obvious and quasi-feminist model and who is on the surface portrayed as perfect, still manages major flaws in character. For example, when Lola was introduced for the first time, she was believed to be a gothic girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of her shared dormitory for being "crazy." <br /> <br /> As for acting, it is clear that Jamie Lynn Spears got that role because of her. name, not because of talent. Although she has definitely improved over time, it is clear she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, since most of the plot lines revolve around her character. The support cast is surprisingly good, especially considering the stuff with which they have to work. They deliver a good number of short sentences to the comic relief if the plot has not yet ventured into obscurity. <br /> <br /> In all, Zoey 101 is a flawed view of life in high school, and everyone in their Limited Years should not expect too much of it.
