I'm writing this missing 10 minutes to the end of the movie. I feel comfortable writing this now, because unfortunately I know exactly how this movie will end. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough, a rabid dog on the loose in a small town kills people. Great - simple plot for a good fun horror camp from the 80s. <br /> <br /> Uhh .. no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that this is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that it should not have been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. Because? Because it's boring! The first 45 minutes try to build depth for your main characters and create suspense. However, it lasts a long time (half the movie!) - the characters are unpleasant and we never care about them anyway, and that practically creates a zero suspense. The easiest movie (according to the plot and the time) to compare this with the classic Jaws. Everything Jaws does right, Whose does it wrong. Jaws created good characters and a genuine sense of dread. Whose does not do any. Jaws effectively creates a scary and scary villain on your shark. Whose got a dirty Saint Bernard running about growling and jumping, and not much more. Jaws is exciting and unpredictable. Whose fatigue is relentless and remains predictable to the end. <br /> <br /> It is also confusing the myriad of subplots that only act like boring red liars in the main plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> If this movie was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director, this could have been good. But it was not. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The people here are saying that this is one of the King's best adaptations - I'm sorry, you could not be more wrong. The Fog is a hundred times better, the Diluent is 10 times better and even the one with cats is twice as good! That in my opinion is one of the worst! The only good thing was that the action scenes with the dog looked real, even if they were dull. <br /> <br /> The movies are over now, and it has not improved. Avoid.
