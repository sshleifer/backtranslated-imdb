As a fan of author Gipharts lightheaded and humorous books (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I was eager to see this movie. I did not get it in the movies, and after watching it on TV, I'm very happy to have resisted buying on video. Out of a good book, they managed to make one of the worst films in the history of Dutch cinema. All good parts were left out, history is changed, not for its benefits. All the humor was cut off. What remains is a misinterpreted, super dramatic and non-consistent film that I do not want to watch again. <br /> <br /> I condemn Giphart with this result, and I am happy that Robbert Jan Westdijk did a hell of a better job on the Phippeine topper of Giphart zegt Sorry. Go see that!
