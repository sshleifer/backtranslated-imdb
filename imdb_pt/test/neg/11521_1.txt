It acted badly, poorly written and misdirected. Special effects are cheap. The best performance is from Yvette Napir, but that's not saying much. The story is a confusing mess about corporate greed that leads to the sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those trapped on board. <br /> <br /> There is little suspense and even less action. There is a car chase that is not bad, but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time.
