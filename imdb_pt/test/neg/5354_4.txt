Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before being famous, and the one that did not get him to fame. (This would be done by "The Firm"). That is why this film was not made until much later, after Grisham began producing meaningless books with the dollar signs of the film in his mind. Unlike most of them, this book was about something. He had flesh, weight and heart. <br /> <br /> But it also had a fatal flaw, and that fatal flaw was translated in the film. That is, "A Time To Kill" prepares you. <br /> <br /> Here we have a black man (Jackson) on trial for the murder of two white men who raped and brutally tortured their 10-year-old son. daughter. We have a lawyer (McConaughey) who fights against the big bad system to save his client. And, ah, by the way, the whole thing is against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses. In other words, we should sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We must believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We should feel the injustice of a system where a white racist jury could judge a black man who was just trying to get back at a brutal crime. We should feel as if we were standing next to the people singing "Free Carl Lee". <br /> <br /> But the question of racism is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is invented. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were extenuating circumstances for what he did, but the fact is he was not innocent. That would have been true, no matter what the color of his skin, or the color of the skin of the aggressors of his daughter, the judge, the jury or any other person. <br /> <br /> And what is so heavy in this movie? is that anyone who believes that Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe the law should not be taken in people's own hands, then you may also be burning crosses on some lawn using a hood. <br /> <br /> This is not the first time that a heavy dose of sentimentality is inserted into a story like this, and it will not be the last. As a movie, Time To Kill is very true to the book, and the acting is not so bad. But he threw the hand that had been handled, actually. Even a good cast can not raise the bad source material.
