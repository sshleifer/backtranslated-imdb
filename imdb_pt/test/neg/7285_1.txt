Sorry to say, but I did not like this movie. It was very boring. So annoying that I could not see the rest. Not as interesting as the Lion King or Aladdin. That's why I hate those stupid days because those days are no longer what they used to be. The movies that Disney has released lately really suck! I miss the old days, when they used to produce good movies like the Lion King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried my best to get interested in this movie, but I just could not. I do not think I could recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones I just mentioned above.
