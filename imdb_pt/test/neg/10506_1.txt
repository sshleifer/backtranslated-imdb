I hope the people who made this movie read those comments. The choreography was horrible, the plot was nil, and the actors where the budget power guards so low seem 5 stars for this crap. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were so slow that you could actually see the actors waiting for each other. to execute the next move. Camera cuts and dim lighting could not cover up the cheap effects. The lightning was just stupid. The guns looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the double bow and arrow was just annoying like anything I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Next movie you decide to try to invest in some wireless microphones, best script and really try to spend some time on your acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Honestly, there are TV shows that play every night and are played together in a few hours that look better than this. <br /> <br /> Stick to martial arts (unless it's as bad as your acting), then make quilts.
