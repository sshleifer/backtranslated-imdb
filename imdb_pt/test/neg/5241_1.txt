<br /> <br /> I saw this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. In the middle of the movie, one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was floating. Boring dialogues, poorly choreographed fighting sequences, a terribly dumb story, and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors did not have much to do except for looking worried or (in case of being female) showing their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who was among the public admitted after that ge could understand the disappointment of the viewers. Be warned, folks, of the cheapest fantasy film ever ........
