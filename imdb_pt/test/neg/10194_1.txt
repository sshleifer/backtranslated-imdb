This film was poorly conceived, poorly written and misinterpreted. All the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The film was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. Christian characters are more holy than you and they have no pang of compassion for skeptical or indecisive characters. The film was a real "catch" for both the skeptic and me as a spectator, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. I complained to the management of the theater and was given a free pass to another film. I remember another movie about a similar subject, "The Rapture," starring Mimi Rogers, which was much better and professionally done. I think I'll watch "The Rapture" again. If you appear "Unidentified" and do not like it, do not say that I did not warn you.
