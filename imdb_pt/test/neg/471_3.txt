This could have been a great film with a lot of educational potential for teachers from around the world about evolution, biology, creative work in science, research and life of Darwin, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The script is mostly historically imprecise and transforms a true story into a Mexican opera-soup melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, this was largely due to his discoveries during the Beagle's journey and not just due to the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but this did not make him literally insane, delirious and detached from his friends and family. Such a portrait of Darwin is an invention of the screenwriter. So it can not be used in any way as a place to learn a little about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had the theory ready at the end of the Beagle's voyage, and prevented it from becoming public because he wanted to further develop the consequences and check more data. In the film, it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after the death of his daughter, that prevented him from going public. <br /> <br /> The film brings a modern situation, the creationists vs scientists debate, in the life and times of Darwin, so it is anachronistic. He describes Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop a greater understanding of biology, but as someone eager to "kill God" in his own words from the film, and destroy the church, who would accept evolutionary theory for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of many disconnected data. Huxley is portrayed as a very arrogant and insensitive person, a combination I interpret as an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak against religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and prior to Darwin's work he thought there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support for evolution was published one month after the Origin of Species became public. He was agnostic, but he did not think it necessary to "kill God", he just thought there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate vs. creationist scientists appears throughout the film, and creationists pick up phrases like "It's just a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, there were no such disputes or phrases of effect at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive review of Origin saying that they saw the work of God evolving, in a sense, in fact in contradiction to how the clergy is portrayed in the script. Another terrible aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a crazy lonely man who just writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The conception of evolutionary theory was the result of meticulous observations of living forms by Darwin for five years on the HMS Beagle, and was developed gradually as can be seen in Darwin's notes of the voyage. Although the voyage of the Beagle was the single most important part of Darwin's life for the "Origin of Species" conception, the voyage is briefly mentioned only once in the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book came as a analysis. of observations. To make matters worse, Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and, in the end, to give it up. And I'm not sure if this experiment really happened. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment. It is by no means a tribute to Darwin and to science.
