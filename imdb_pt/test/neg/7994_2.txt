Franco Nero stars as Cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his wartime friend Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his wife (Susan George) to protect them from a gangster (Christopher George) who wants to land. Things get even more complicated when the mobster hires Cole's old nemesis Sho Kosugi, who is also a ninja. Inept martial arts actioner, despite having better production values, then most of the ninja movies, can not inject any life in the middle, or for the actioncenes case. A weak effort all around.
