this movie was incredibly stupid with the usual meaning. I feel bad for all the actors and actresses who ruined the career of being in this stupid movie. the whole movie was based on how unrealistic they could do, to do a little bit like it, which made it even more stupid. even some of the names were unrealistic. the movie is fun to watch and that's why he had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the third stupidest movie ever made. I was actually done after I realized that I had mostly adult actors still in a children's movie. the most disturbing was Danny Trejo, an ever-filthy horror-movie actor. the other actors were very clean as far as I'm concerned.
