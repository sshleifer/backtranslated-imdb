The opening scene really made me watch the movie. However, no more than 5 minutes later, I was already ripping out my eyes. Not only could I not understand a word that was said, the acting could have been better by a group of mentally handicapped. The only highlight of this movie was that there was a white punk dwarf. However, I did not quite understand how a white dwarf was the son of two African-Americans. But I think anything is possible. Besides, why the hell was Robin in the movie? I'm not sure if I added something artistically. Overall, I strongly recommend you hop off a cliff before renting this movie.
