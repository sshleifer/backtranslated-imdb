This movie is a disaster from beginning to end. 75 percent of the film is made from scenes taken from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN poorly edited together with original scenes that contribute nothing more than complete theft. I'm a big fan of these two movies and seeing scenes taken from them, reissued and re-dubbed with absurd dialogues made my head spin. This type of cheap producer tactics to make more money fooling the unsuspecting public basically killed the Sword & Sandal genre in the 1960s. There is a memorable scene in the new footage and this is what happens when Hercules struggles with the bad Hercules. The fight is still legal and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaius, definitely stands out. He makes an unforgettable foe for Herc. But the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably filmed in one day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs!
