This film is a good example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a good movie out of the gates at all costs. Just with this movie, it's almost a fault. Everything seems in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy follow-up to the groundbreaking first film. The complete original cast (besides the bass, of course) returns and gives the best of itself. Too bad that a banal script and an incompetent director and counteract their efforts. <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner may have been the ideal guy for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner, there is not much to ruin in Lucas's bland movie series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed Paul Verhoeven to return, or a director with enough money to give his own interpretation. Kershner does not know how to give his own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for it) and he certainly does not have Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> So what we have here is a film that goes through all the movements to replicate the first film, but without the freshness, humor or audacity of the original. Kershner probably thought he could outdo Verhoeven by adding more bloody and gratuitous violence, but instead he reveals how much he was working as a hired director rather than a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame, since everything was in place to do this other classic. As mentioned, the actors do their best, but Phill Tippet offers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story of Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential happen.
