OUCH, There's no real need to say anything else. This movie really made me think of suicide. As a big fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies I found this possibly the worst attempt I have ever been on par. The movie never really seemed to go anywhere! What was the point for all this, I'm feeling lost and lost. Hell that was so bad that I can not even justify hitting anymore. I'm just going to hang myself in the closet. OK, now I've tried to submit my comment, but the server will only accept comments with ten lines or more. So here it goes ... Bad, awful, not where near enough gore. NO TITOS !!!!!! How can you have a sinuous zombie movie? In fact, the female protagonist had a lot of pies and the only reason I watched the end of the movie was, perhaps, by chance, catch a glimpse. NOT! Of course there was a line that deserves to be mentioned, a phrase I'm anxious to use one day (when I just feel the need to have my face beaten) "This pig is not going to smoke alone" This movie is bad, so bad.
