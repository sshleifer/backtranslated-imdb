I saw the * star * of this movie on The Daily Show, and thought I could tune in (the movie debuted at Comedy Central, then entered the theaters). Oh Vey! <br /> <br /> It makes "Shakes the Clown" look like "Citizen Kane"! Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. Not a laugh, not even a smile. This movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes burst like the last remnants of "Raiders". I can not even think of a worse movie, either "Hands" or "Ishtar". When the Pythons waved, they fled, fled! Why did someone turn on the light unless they used their own money? The horror is that there is NO good line, not a good joke, and just one bad thing ... the making of this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel that if done correctly, it would have been Hilary. As it is, I need a new pancreas to vomit so loud. Damn anyone involved in this farce.
