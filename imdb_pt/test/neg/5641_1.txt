The only puzzle in this movie was how it was made. the British film industry needs to make films that people really want to watch and not seek to get taxpayers' money (a'la BBC) to keep Luvvies in their lifestyle they were accustomed to, doing nothing for it. <br /> <The film was all wrong with British Films, it had stereotypes, it had to be about London, if people were classy and corrupt, gangsters, luvvies or jelly types, the story script was pathetically weak, As far as the policeman picked up the phone and the ringing was the theme "Sweeney" I expected. The whole movie was a happy buyer / Minder robbery. <br /> <br /> The invaluable manuscript that I noticed was left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something that even I with my limited notion of street would not carry. Saying that Vinnie Jones is nice, that's the only one thing in the movie, poor man. <br /> <br /> When Derek Jacobi went into the water in the end because he was Dickens, oh my god, what crap, and I'm being positive here
