1 hour and 40 minutes of conversation - speaking boring, and more talking and then some. It's hard for me to understand how an actress like Anne Parillaud, who superbly shone on Femme Fatale, would sign up for such a crap! Unbelievable. If you need a drink, this movie can help, although I prefer good classical music. unfortunately I just discovered that I have to write 10 lines for my review to appear - this is almost unbelievable! therefore, short and succinct comments of one or two phrases expressing the essence of a film are not enough. Wow, people. I made my point and do not waste your time with more unnecessary words - like this movie does. Wolfgang
