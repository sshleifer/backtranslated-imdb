This is a pitiful Hollywood remake of a classic British movie. Everything that made the original "Italian Job" entertained was bled out of this painful wound of a movie "scripted" by Donna and Wayne Powers and improperly "directed" by Gary Gary Gray. It surprises me that Troy Kennedy Martin (screenwriter of the original film) has allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the best TV and film projects in the last 40 years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinky is NOT A GOOD THING. <br /> <br /> The humor is forced, the drama is worked out, all the characters are sympathetic crimsons (with the exception of Charlize Theron, implausible, beautiful). safe cracker / driver rally) and the plot only matches the original on the following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (the modern versions made by BMW but Minis, however) <br /> < (2) Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Interrupt a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Er, that's it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, what you get is an unsavory and implausible American assault movie where a gang of gay pirate friends ends up getting the best out of their evil associate. . Believe me, it seems like a very long time before them. The cast does its best with what's given, but it seems that they all accepted it as a polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the peculiar nature of the original film and distinctly British flavor survived being fed into the Hollywood burger machine. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 film instead of the chest injury. It's a wonder that Noel Coward did not do an Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this warm redo in the middle of their throats. <br /> <br /> Italian work? More like Italian Jobbie.
