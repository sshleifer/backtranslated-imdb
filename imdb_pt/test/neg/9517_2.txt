I saw this movie without knowing much about it. The split-screen device was immediately annoying, and things did not improve for me after the title sequence ended. The plot, characters and dialogues were all extremely cliche - a poor bastard from an abusive family is kicked out of the house, wants to get out of his 'lot', reinvents himself, changes his voice, wears other people's clothes, is adopted by a gay man which he goes on to become part of an international drug group taking British aristocrats. The estate of Patricia Highsmith (talented Mr. Ripley) should be suing the producers of this film. The triple screen for me, along with the duration of over 120 minutes, emphasizes the almost non-existent edition. It is not possible to decide which image works and is the most powerful, why not show three and expect to hit one of them. This trick removed any connection or interest I had with any of the characters. An important dialogue was repeated 3 times on each screen, as if saying "this is an important moment / moving / deep, ok!". <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. <br /> <br />
