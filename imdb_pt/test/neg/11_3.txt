Julie Andrews satiriously boosts her own image of two shoes in this overproduced comedy-musical drama, but if she addresses her role with resourcefulness, she is alone in doing so. Blake Edwards's film about a woman who is both a music singer and a German spy during World War I does not know the tone to be followed, and Rock Hudson has the unpleasant task of playing the second romantic violin. Musicals grew into disuse in the 1970s, and elephant productions like "Star!" and this film really tarnished Andrews' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in his catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" appeared. I always thought Julie Andrews would have made a great villain or an obscure lady; your strong voice can really catch your eye, and it hits a few low notes that can be imposing or alluring. Husband / director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can work much energy within this scenario. Writer William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, and neither has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews only a fabulous sequence - a striptease. * 1/2 of ****
