Let me start by saying that I never wanted to see this movie in the first place; I had to watch it one day, and realized that I think I can cheer myself up and enjoy it for what it is, and it can be fun. What I started with that expectation was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, none of them. First of all, there was nothing humorous about it at all. The creators hoped the humor would be laughable / passable if they included sarcasm on all lines that come out of Underdog's mouth and use scene after scene of insipid looks to "cheer" the audience cheerfully, while still doing "ooh" " and "ah" for more with boring action scenes and insipid and lackluster performances that made me want to scream at everyone in the audience they were enjoying. The performance was monotonous, the humor was tedious and the characters / storyline felt like they were about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities, which gave uninspired actors a way to portray their characters with minimal depth.This film is simply horrible in all fields and indeed only children under 10 years old you can enjoy it, which, despite being the age group for which it was directed, does not justify it because it is so evil and cause me to feel so penitent Parents, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best, recent family / kids movies, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks is better than this crap!
