How does David Lynch do this? Unlike the legions of thick-and-black-rimmed glasses and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, I do not see how this guy keeps being paid to do such a thing. How can Lynch mend the leftover scenes of a failed TV pilot into an absurd and misrepresented mess, and critics praise it and actually include it in the Best of the Year lists? <br /> <br /> I'm stumped. If you are looking for a good movie noir, rent "Bound" instead. If you are looking for a good puzzle movie, try "Memento". But beware of this super hype, unless your idea of ​​a fun night is throwing away two and a half hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard-earned money.
