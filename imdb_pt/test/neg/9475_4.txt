Well, first of all, the twins are exactly the same. there's no one who's feminine and one's a kid (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate) and her boyfriends are not French, so that's bad because they're faking their accents. Lamo. It's not too bad either, it's not the best of them. I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, do not get me wrong. the plot is OK and it's funny to watch. it's not the kind of movie you watch again and again. But, hey, when they made this movie, they were still new in the middle of the movie. Girls also act like they're over 13, but if you're a young spectator, this is a good movie. Not so good if you're over 13 unless you're a parent watching a movie with your kids. then everything is fine. Good luck MK + A with your upcoming movies!
