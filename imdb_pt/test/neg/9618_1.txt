The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was very poorly done. The mastering engineer must be drunk, sleeping or not in the room while it was being done. It looks like it was mastered from a copy of a tenth generation and in the middle of the movie, the audio sync disappears. The dialog box is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, please save your money. I remember watching this movie in the theater in 1973. In addition, the VHS copy of this film under the title "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining several minutes of the movie are "gone." Where is the original negative camera?
