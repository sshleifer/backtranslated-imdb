This movie has to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The humor was rude, hardly funny, and heard a million times before. The beginning was especially noticeable and it got worse and worse as it continued. I arrived halfway and could not bear to watch it. Fortunately, I was just watching on TV so it did not cost anything, but I seriously recommend that you do not waste your time or your money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was new. The characters were not fully developed. I really think it would have been better as a small kids movie where it was full of "funny" unreal stupid events occurring ... this is like what happens at home alone or something. Not implying alone at home was as terrible as that.
