This is a case of taking a fairy tale too far. The Enchanted Cottage offers Dorothy McGuire as a "ugly terrible spinster" and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Scarface marries Spinster, after which her love transforms them, miraculously (enlightenment, cosmetics and removal of fake scars), into beautiful people - a magical change they attribute to the enchantment of living in a house on the seashore, sea. has been the home of generations of newlyweds. <br /> <br /> If the story stopped there, fine; would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. But go ahead, seeking reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface greet the audience, it is a painful shock for them that they are still homely. You see, they just look cute to each other? a situation for which the public is well prepared because all the secondary characters have preached that disadvantaged people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. Do you know. Accept hobbies. Spinster makes woodcuts, for example. Scarface considers log collection. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and filmmakers have zero faith in human nature. Their message is: you are ugly or beautiful, and no beautiful person would love an ugly one. What's even worse, ugly people evidently need to picture their lover as handsome. Reality just is not good. <br /> <br /> One can imagine what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
