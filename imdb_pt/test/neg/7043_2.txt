If you have enough time to kill and the DVD was given to you by your friend for free, but still it may take a lot of courage to watch this movie that does not have good script or humor for that matter. <br /> <br /> In front of imran acting is frozen in time / acting, Tushar Kapoor was a little better than Imran in this movie Paresh Rawal was good at usual comedy. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a university campus where Imran is a bad boy n Tushar is good, they pretend to be the opposite of their respective nature and so the story goes on ..... < Watch only if you have nothing to do and the movie is running on your local cable TV.
