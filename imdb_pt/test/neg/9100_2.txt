Alain Resnais addresses three parallel stories that have to do with fantasy and imagination in the adult world. In one of them is a kind of operatic brothel story where a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people in agony of happiness - only his attempt misses his real target, the woman he later loves. In the same unfinished castle that he built, a group of teachers seeks love in a more modern story, as a woman believes inefficiently in the role of the novel, and the skeptical historical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by riding her with the greatest idiot of the love. the group. Meanwhile, a bunch of children fancy a George Melies adventure of a prince who saves a girl in distress from the swamp creatures and then kills the evil king, bringing the kingdom of love. The two main themes? Life is a fairy tale, and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> What sounds better than the movie really is. Resnais is the type of director where often the concept is good or bad, but exposure is what matters; here the concept is great but the film is absolutely painful to watch. Horribly outcast songs, bubbly characters without a dimension, disgusting pastel scenes - instead of giving an ice cream cone to your child, Resnais drowns it in a bucket of icing. Add a bit of French philosophy and you'll get a weird witch potion, one that does not bubble up bubbles and trouble, but only feels bad in your stomach until you want to regurgitate it. <br /> <br /> Resnais is a Venture Director, and even at his worst, you can see that he is trying something that may not work with total clarity of action. In "I Want to Go Home," he manages to go through annoying characters and stationary throws, showing a real change and taking a few moments of silence to catch his breath. Here he immerses himself directly into a fantasy that does not really reflect fantasy, just the reference of your baby's wallpaper. The biggest problem is that he was able to make a more flamboyant movie than a 1980s pop video, and more kitsch than Hollywood's Golden Age musicals. The costumes are more childish and naive, but the film (with nudity and swearing) is definitely aimed at adults, a target that he definitely missed. <br /> <br /> However, he follows the theme and never recoils. If anything, this movie is impressive simply because it is without remorse. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
