Aaran is one of the movies where you find the holes in Indian cinema. Here's a good example to show how great writers, directors and actors succumb to producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, performing in a movie about a real story in Kashmir. The severity of the film is plagued with scenes and comic sub standard songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the producer's son. So he does not have a haircut, though his officer asks him to do it. This kid does not know what he's doing and he's the "hero" in the movie. God help Indian cinema with these producers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pathetic display of what happens in Kashmir. A sensible viewer can intuitively understand the restraints of such wonderful writers, actors and directors who wish to share their real-life experiences. But the unfortunate part is that a movie about the top ranks of the Indian militia turns out to be a pathetic display that just makes you think the movie was stupid. <br /> <br /> We must expel these producers from the film industry. and make way for good cinema.
