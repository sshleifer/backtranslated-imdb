OK. I really tried using the silly and surreal humor that this movie sets out to be. I was told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one sent to America (it will figure!) And has fewer political references. On top of all this, I found this sexual / political farce as boring and purposeless as standard pornography. The central female leadership is easy on the eyes and can really act. I'd love to see her in a non-pink movie where she could really flex her acting muscles (and not, not the ones you're thinking). It is obvious that Japan can (and produces) as much junk as other countries. I could not recommend this to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone having a Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
