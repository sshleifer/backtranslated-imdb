I love watching a good bloody giallo. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. It's long. Very long. The story is tacky and makes very little sense, even if it is very obvious. The script spends a lot of time on the murders and the girls, but spends almost no time with the killer. That leaves a big hole in the story: we can see a group of youngsters bathing together, but we did not get the zero characterization of why the killer decided to kill these girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we were still in the dark when, why the [boring] killer decided it was worth the effort to get those girls so naughty. It's all so artificial that I could not understand anything. <br /> <br /> As for the movie's look, again, annoying. Nothing memorable about that. The actors? Boring. The script? Flat laughter. The whole "torrid" love affair between the teacher, the blonde, and the student was really embarrassing. On what planet are they living? The music? Boring. Skip this.
