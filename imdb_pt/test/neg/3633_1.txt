Imagine this: a college. Except it's a boarding school, and the kids have no parents around. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And the children are all thin, white and beautiful, with the exceptional symbolic minority or the fat kid to play the "strange" pariah. And there are no reasonable rules, like cohabitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stalls, a sushi bar and a complimentary laptop per student. <br /> <br /> Here's the story: girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, an old school just for boys. Absolutely perfect in every way possible, she's smart, beautiful, lean, athletic, creative and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost every boy in the school wants her, and every girl wants to be your friend. She is the one to whom all seek advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan and is simply wonderful. Too bad none of this makes her nice. <br /> <br /> Should we believe that if we do not get close to Zoey's perfection, will we be bad people? In the show, nothing is her fault, and if someone contradicts her, they are portrayed as the bad guy (Logan). He may be an idiot, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time. His loyal group of blind followers are: Chase, the average ass idiot who has a secret crush on her, Michael, the symbolic black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, an aspiring the actress and anorexic, squirted head, Quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teenage things and Logan, the rich idiot who has a soft side. Yes, this show basically spews stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is that everyone tries to pretend they are normal kids. They complain that Logan gets a lot of money while they have to work themselves, even though they have already gone to a very good boarding school to be true and have relatively enjoyable things that many teenagers can not afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, almost have no homework and tanning almost every day. Wow, they have difficulty! Any other problems? I am very beautiful, rich and stress-free! I think Zoey 101 (which is 101, anyway?) Is Nick's attempt to realistically portray teens. Except they had a glimpse of reality, they did not like it, and they decided to give children lives like asses in The Hills. <br /> <br /> But, hey, at least the scenery is beautiful.
