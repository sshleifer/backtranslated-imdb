Well, the plot is fun, but it's full of idiocy. To summarize things, the parent / cop wants to save his son from cancer, but the only way is to get the transplant of the criminal (Michael Keaton). <br /> <br /> Well, the criminal agrees, but escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the police-cop can not shoot the criminal to save his son. <br /> <br /> Well, the police in this movie have no brains, in case they have never heard of a TAZER to take down the criminal without killing him. End of the movie, simple as that. <br /> <br /> But when all the crazy and stupid, including the death of 2cops and some doctors burned very badly.
