It is unfortunate that, among this film, In the Valley of Elah, the Lamb Lions and the Home of the Brave seem all based on common stereotypes about veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The drunks, the fights, the short fuses, the broken marriages, the guys freaking out and digging a trench in the front yard when they're drunk, et cetera. etc. <br /> <br /> It happens - yes, but not as often as one would think after watching any of these movies. I think it is unfortunate that these directors / producers / writers choose to attack the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way. In this particular film, Kimberly Peirce has not even given us a bone, such as showing the new children born when a family member was implanted, or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the GI Bill. , or the couple who can afford a home, or start a new business, earn their citizenship, etc etc etc. Instead, we are treated with stereotypes because the people who made this movie just want to show the bad side. /> <br /> A couple of issues with the movie itself: 1) Someone erred by putting Phillippe in a bronze star with V after he took his squadron up a tight alley after being lured by a sniper in a taxi. Very stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) Humvees had no turret armor, so we must believe it's almost the beginning of the war, but does every soldier and his brother have an ACOG and all the possible attachments to their M4? sorry, do not think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as lieutenant colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked one that he turned 40 in May, so the weather is not too bad. 4) He attacks two soldiers to escape the prison after saying that he would not return to Iraq (after knowing that he had been defeated). So he's a fugitive. So when he finally surrenders at the end, and they take him back, does he hold his position and position himself with the same drive? Sorry, do not think so. <br /> <br /> I can only describe you as a giant stereotype of the Army and Infantry. Some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this movie you get pretty much all stereotypes in the space of about 100 minutes, and really things are not like that for most returning soldiers. I wish the director made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting with her schedule and then making a movie. From the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably the Lions for Lambs, which is one more comment on the sad state of the Y + Generation than on the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to watch this movie wait for cable or Netflix, do not pay cash directly to rent it.
