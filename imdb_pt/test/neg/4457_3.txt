Proof, if any proof was needed, that Hammer should have left his vampires firmly in the Victorian age. After all, vampirism is all about repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in London in 1972, in its thirties pretending to be eccentric teenagers. <br /> <br /> Remember, by now Hammer was floundering. The audience grew tired of the horror of the living room of the 50s and 60s, so the studio was trying everything to bring them back, including broad nudity (LUST FOR A VAMPIRE, et al) and updating their characters - none of which apparently functioned as Hammer. was practically resting on her just two years later. Shame ... <br /> <br /> But I still have a great affection for the classic Hammer period of 1957-65.
