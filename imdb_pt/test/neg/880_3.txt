Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to see Lane and Gere in this movie because it's BAD. The acting was bad, the dialogues were extremely superficial and insincere. It was well filmed, but again, it's a big budget movie. It was too predictable, even for a girl movie. I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end, the only thing I did not know was how. Very politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing worth seeing really was the scenery and the house, because it's beautiful. But if you want, watch National Geographic. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in such a bad movie. As far as Gere is concerned, he's a good actor, but he had movies like that, so I'm not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could bring it back.
