I took my family to see Barnyard this past weekend. We had so anxious for this, but had my kids not been there, my husband and I would have left. Coming from an agricultural community, we found that the fact that all the male bovines in the film had udders drawn on them was a bit disturbing. We felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something. It was strange to hear a male voice coming from a female body. After checking out some of the production notes on a different site, I felt that the animators could have slipped into that fact. I know this is just an animated and humorous show, but putting female body parts in a man, I had to suspend my disbelief so much that I just could not enjoy the movie as I could have. I know udders can be found funny, but they've definitely been used more. None of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender-specific body parts and I would have preferred that the bulls in this show had at least the correct ones if they had to be attracted. The kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time later to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
