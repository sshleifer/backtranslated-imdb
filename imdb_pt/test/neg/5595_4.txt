1 st attended 2/9/2008, 4 of 10 (Dir-J.S. Cardone): Sexual political suspense that really succeeds in none of these areas except at the beginning where there are some interesting soft-core scenes. The film begins by portraying a couple exploring their sexual fantasies in the midst of their work environments or anywhere else in any situation they like. The couple make an excursion to a retreat and a bathhouse, where they come across a woman who is willing to join a group of three and perform some of her fantasies. At this point we only know that this couple is well, but we do not know until they return that the groom is part of a wealthy political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of possibly getting a seat in Congress after the wedding. They then receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit photos of their meeting in the bathroom and their qwest begins about how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want, and how to clear their names before that this leaves. This qwest becomes an obsession that takes them deeper into sordid worlds and takes up so much of their time that their friends and family wonder what they are doing all day and why they look decadent all the time. This movie is interesting at times but drifts into ridicule as they personally seek out the problem instead of involving the police at first because of their pride. This mistake, of course, keeps the movie running. The performances are good, despite the cast without a name, but the folly of the situation overlaps and the film begins to get a bit discouraged. And of course, they play a twist in the end that defies and challenges everything that happened before (as is the norm these days when they no longer know what to do to spice up the movie). This does not help in this movie at all.
