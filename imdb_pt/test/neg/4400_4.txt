The Palestinian situation is fertile and, to a large extent, largely groundless for film production. "Divine Intervention" tries hard, and gives us insightful insight into the almost surreal life of those who are stuck in trouble, but the movie amounts to little more than a handful of (admittedly kind) visual jokes played on the celluloid, while links between them they become increasingly obscure as the film progresses. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very current issue.
