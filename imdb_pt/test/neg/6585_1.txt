This movie is horrible. Creates characters that are not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including a hateful little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the elves who speak Yiddish. The book was a simple story about belief, and this film is bleak, ugly and unnecessarily scary about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb, but the story was ruined by Hollywood. <BR> <BR> <BR> The good thing is that this movie is going to take a shower at the box office and maybe producers will learn not to mess with a story that does not need improvement. Hanks was exaggerated and I do not see why it could not have been used voices of other actors.
