An insult to poker and the cinema, this movie manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant and fascinating figure in poker history in total boredom. Still a fun movie to make jokes about, from the lame gangster movie cliches of the first half to the incomprehensible absurdity of that second hour. Hilariously, Stu Ungar wins all three World Series titles without playing a single hand on the screen. Your infamous drug dealer abuse? 1 dinner. Your cocaine habit? 1 dinner. Your incredible memory? 0 scenes. They could not even have real poker players. What did they cover? A lot of high angle photos from inside a house in the suburbs. Oh, and a Stu montage waking up every day and buying meat that does not even come close to making sense. Why do I care so much about this little Sopranos summer camp trying to profit from the poker craze? Because I think there's still a great movie to be done about Stu Ungar waiting for someone willing to do the right thing.
