I've seen "professional" comments stating that Julia Roberts interpreting herself was "clever and very funny." I think not. An actress playing herself? And doing it with the same habitual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird's narcissism to the fullest. Why does not she just stand there and say, "Me, me, me. Look at me!" The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of anything better than this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way, Steven, as the audience starts paying more attention to the camera's odd angles, then the story has a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, used some creative cameras, but they were talented enough not to miss the public on them or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a fundamental rule of cinema in the name of "style." The chemistry of Pitt and Zeta Jones is very good, however, perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with narcissism, it could have worked. Once again Zeta Jones shows how she has more talent and beauty than Roberts could dream of. Unfortunately, this movie wastes talent and fails many stories. I want my money back.
