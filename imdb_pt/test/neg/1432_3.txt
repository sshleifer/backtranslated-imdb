I watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing through all this uninspired scare. First of all, one of my biggest problems is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. It's a thriller! to hit! It has no monsters or anything supernatural. It's simply a movie about a distorted serial killer (actually there's a very small body count, so it's more of a serial torturer movie and did a good job of torturing me.) The Basic Premise of a Man Attracting Teens to Your Home . of horrors through online chat rooms could have contributed to a great movie, but we only see it attracting a couple of teenage girls over the internet at the beginning of the movie. One of these girls ends up being the daughter of a local detective and he gets emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly changes from a potentially clever sado-masochistic thriller to a boring cat-and-mouse game between the incredibly monotonous detective and psychopath Captain Howdy / Carleton Hendricks, appropriately played by writer / producer / Twisted Sister leader Dee Snider. Occasional attempts at meaningful poetic commentary on the positive effects of Snider's pain and the like are laughable. If he is trying to get people to take these views through this movie, he fails miserably and (unintentionally) makes little of them. John Pieplow's direction (whose only previous direction effort was Jurassic Women, which I'll leave the title to speak for itself) was not inspired and there was something wrong with the issue that resulted in the film being disjointed with some completely unrelated footage. plot, unless the script is to blame (which is quite possible). This film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to move from like a horror film that is just achievement was making me squirm with the sight of some body piercing graphics. If you see it in your video store do not waste your money, but if you need something to laugh at one night and Strangeland is on the cable, you can also watch. 3 out of 10
