I absolutely love stand-up comedy. I love hearing the raw thoughts of stand-up on stage, as they are appealing to an audience of their different life experiences peers who had or things they thought or saw that they just thought they were so stupid fuck they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There used to be stand-ups that took on a persona that everyone could relate to (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or they were so crazy that you could not stop laughing with them laughed at others (Richard Pryor ). And then there were instigating comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be crazy, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink the things they saw as they walked around, and realized how things were, and how easily they could change things. <br /> <br /> Now this may seem to have nothing to do with "Mind Of Mencia," which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy's Horrible Solution to the Loss of "Chappelle's Show ", but it happens. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show doing stand-up for his audience, sometimes on popular themes, most often just racism and racial stereotypes. It tries to be all three types of stand-ups above. He does a stage character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos, who, despite stereotypes, is just his average guy. He then tries to laugh at others, people whom he calls racist or only those who disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he sketches for the studio audience and the viewer, telling them that it will help them see their point of view. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says he's showing a viewpoint that people do not. What he's really doing is not just promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and jokes about death have been made but he stupidly encourages people to listen to them and do the only thing that helps to keep them around: laughs. <br /> <br /> Promoting stereotypes is usually the easiest but easiest way to get laughs in stand-up. The best comedians, who, I fear, Carlos Mencia feels to be in good company, need not resort to them. They speak universally, and they ask you to laugh at the absurd, not at him, as Mencia encourages. As he creates more "real life" sketches or situations that call for racism or the bruising of others with his use, he tells us, rather than asking us, to laugh and actually presents these absurdities as truth, rather than just extremes of it . <br /> <br /> Your show is an insult to the minds of those who watch. Mencia does not give us comedy and asks us to digest it and get what we want from it (something that, as much as I hate comparing the two, was the best quality of Chappelle's Show), it tells us exactly how we should see and react to that --- what, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "Dee Dee Dee!" This show is appropriately called. It is indeed a show about "The Mind of Mencia". It is Mencia's mind from end to end, and as such, nothing but stupid entertainment. The show is tailor-made to give life lessons to your main audience, ages 14 to 24, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial assault is legal to Carlos Mencia and therefore should be right for you!
