I just can not, go crazy on the planet are talking about this as a must see, they still dare to call you from a holding because the possessed girl is seducing priests and is masturbating all the time. Do not let me laugh. I watched the movie, seduce is just at the end of the movie and do not call it seductive, it's just a bad language she's talking about. And the masturbationscene is a big laugh too, she tries to seduce your father while masturbating, let me be clear, with your clothes on you perverted out there. It's not bloody or bloody, everyone's puking at Beyond The Door, well, let me tell you, one is better for me than this movie. Only in the last 5 minutes is the man possessed vomiting and having strange eyes. If I knew that this was so bad, then I would never get me a copy. If you really do not want to see an exploration of the exorcism, watch Angel Above, The Devil Below or other extravagant. a waist of time that is.
