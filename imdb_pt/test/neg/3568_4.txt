For me, this movie is essentially like a pilot episode of feature film for a TV series. This particularly reminds me of the British remake of the TV series Wallander, starring Kenneth Brannagh. People interviewed by the police are resistant, and often as bitter as time, the principal investigator has huge family problems, investigations invariably lead to cruelties from the distant past, and the conspiracy is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots that only make sense in the end. . Both have excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> The plot of Jar City is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard criminal series from the UK or the US. Effectively, you could take the plots from any of the episodes of Touch of Frost and transplant them to the darkest spot of this movie and have an effective sequence. <br /> <br /> Actually, the script could not be more obvious. of the cookie cutter. You get even the most familiar motives like the police going to the local jail to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely convinced that it is scones and jellies for many people, but I think it is necessary to point to people like me who do not go to the cinema to watch television. What I felt a great lack of message was. The film's theme is genetic studies in Iceland. Genetic Icelanders have remained largely isolated from the outside world, presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. Much information about the heritability of the population has been maintained, and many unique genetic diseases of Iceland can be effectively traced in a population that has refrained from crossing and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it is like trying to mount a London underground map puzzle in instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies). A company called DECODE genetics attempted to assemble a database with all genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. Due to privacy concerns, this project was terminated and, at the end of last year, deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. The episode is a rich topic for debate. <br /> <br /> But in this movie, genetics and medical science are not there for education, they are there for a strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this, there is a morbid focus on food to keep up with events such as a coroner who lunches between the incisions. The most sickening thing for me was when the chief inspector devoured the head of a sheep. Unfortunately for me this occasionally became ridiculous. The film tries the rather delicate task of mixing the horror with the sentimental one, and ended up providing unintentional humor in the end. This is the equivalent, in cinematic terms, of trying to prepare fugu, if you are not well qualified, deft hand and keen eye, you poison the client. This newbie director should have lowered the rate of his performance. <br /> <br /> I left this movie feeling a little sick to myself and life in general.
