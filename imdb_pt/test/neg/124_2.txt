STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning The former Homicide Police New Orleans Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is reassigned to Colombo, a small but violent town in Mexico to help local police with their efforts to prevent a major heroin smuggling operation in their city. The culprits end up being ex-military, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, also known as Jase of East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to bring him down, which leads the two men to an explosive final showdown, where only one of them goes away alive. <br /> <br /> After death, Van Damme seemed to be on the rise. , showing that it could do the best straight to video movies in the stock market. Although it was a much more drama-oriented film, with The Shepherd he returned to the shocking action style that made him famous for the first time and unfortunately produced his worst film since Derailed. It's not nearly as bad as that movie, but what I said is still. <br /> <br /> A tedious and predictable film, with very little in terms of exciting action. The little that exists mainly consists of a few relaxed fight scenes, trying to look cool and fashionable with some cheap slo-mo / sped-up effects added to them which, unfortunately, instead of making them seem more desperate. Being a joint Mexican film, director Isaac Florentine tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez / Desperado feel, but this only increases despair. <br /> <br /> The VD gives a particularly uninspired performance, and he's never been a kind of actor for Robert De Niro, that can not be good. Like the villain, the Lord should not expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. He gets little dialogue at first as he struggles to muster an American accent, but it gets mysteriously better in the end. The whole supporting cast is equally mild, and does nothing to raise the spirits of the movies. <br /> <br /> This is a shepherd who has strayed from the flock. *
