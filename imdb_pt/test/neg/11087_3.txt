Let me start by saying that I love Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I've seen a lot of Japanese movies and I liked them, but "Portrait of Hell" (also known as Jigokuhen) becomes ridiculous. The two characters who dominate the action - the "lord of evil" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn and crazy artist" are pure types with subtlety or zero nuances, and all his actions emanate from cartoonish extremes. The film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotion, but many of these scenes are so exaggerated that they actually become ridiculous and the general feeling is that of a TV movie that has come off the rails. If this rarely displayed movie falls into your hands or reaches your city, spare yourself and give it a pass.
