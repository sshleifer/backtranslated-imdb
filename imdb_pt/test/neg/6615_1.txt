His ESPN obvious baba whenever Knight is on the news, but did they have to make a damn movie about him? This was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic film I've ever seen. He had everything: a terrible performance, a terrible dialogue, a ridiculous cast, cheap sets, etc. etc. It looked like he had a budget of $ 10. Cummon, what about the game scenes? Were they in a high school gym? And the lighting, well, let me say it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me some time. Denehey looked ... Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. They poured millions of dollars into advertising, and the first was a big disappointment. Bob Knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2 hour film. ESPN spoiled everything. Even Knight himself thought he was dumber than anything else.
