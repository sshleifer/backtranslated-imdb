Tarentino should be ashamed to get involved with this horrible movie. The acting, directing and screenplay are of the third category - with the whole film appearing as an excuse for writer / director / star Larry Bishop to launch. The only reason it was done is probably because of its association with QT. The plot of the film is rather fragile, and it basically tries to survive on not-so-obscure references to old B movies and some special guest appearances from guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each is apathetic in his performance, particularly Hopper, who is in full payment mode at this point in his career. The saving grace, if any, is that the script is so ludicrously bad that it can be fun. Bishop tries so hard to get Tarentino's trademark and simply fails miserably, which can be quite funny at times and annoying to others. I would only check this out if you love bad movies ... or if you like biker movies.
