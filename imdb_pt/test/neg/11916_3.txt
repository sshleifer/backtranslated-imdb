I spent the last half hour reading the other reviews and I do not know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way ADJL to be like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fairly OddParents, another that is a secret magical world, which is almost exaggerated. Also, no way is ADJL anime. The anime is much more a style of drawing (and some will say more, like plot and Japanese origin), however the ADJL is not anime so stop saying it is and if you are looking for something that is like anime, look for another place, such as Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all the other Disney shows. An arrogant main character who thinks he knows everything and does not bother to listen to people older than him and keeps making the same mistakes. Best friends friends. Repetitive lot with a hint of a twist. And sibling rivalry. Can not they make a character who has a brain and is not full of himself? Can not they have children respecting their elders? Can not they think of something different with the plot? Can not they have the brothers get along and do not hate each other? The ADJL is very generic because you also have bandits who are defeated and come back again, and they are also complete idiots, who have no basis for their hatred. Come on, you will think that someone who is at least 30 years old will be able to have a 13 year old son. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost anything else on TV these days, the same thing and again. Nothing special, just new characters and a little idea that has been used over and over again.
