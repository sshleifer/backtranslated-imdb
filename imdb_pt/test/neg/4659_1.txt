This 'schlock-buster' must carry a government health warning. If you play on your DVD machine, you run a serious risk of opening a crack in continuous space-time and disappear without a trace - that 'movie' is so bad. The fact that this film has been so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern Hollywood cinema, and the continuing commissioning of films that appeal to the 'lowest common denominator' - though I really have afraid to think of the 'lowest common denominators' that this movie really appeals to !! <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood was just performing some kind of test when they did and they exhibited this movie! I can imagine the executive board meetings in the studio ... "How bad is a movie that we really can make - and STILL make a lot of money!" Sacred cow, I did not realize we could go that bad !! Woooo hooooo! ! "<br /> <br /> The only worst movies that I can think of (and trust me, it's close) are Die Another Day (RIP, the Bond franchise, as I knew it) and Independence Day! <br /> <br /> AVOID - AVOID - AVOID !!
