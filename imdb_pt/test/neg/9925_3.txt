As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really underestimated) I have to boo this movie. If you can not tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously never saw a psychosocial thriller or ever watched 20/20. It's as if the filmmakers and the actors did not care about how they were filming and how they were playing the characters would be a dead indication. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie serves to connect the pervert who likes to mix violence and sex. It's not a fun movie to sit in, although if you like Ellen Barkin it's nice to see her a tough lady's place.
