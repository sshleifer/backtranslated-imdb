It is very sad to see someone of the caliber of George C Scott in a low budget thriller that would have been better if the original novel were written by Graham Greene and directed by someone a little more experienced in the genre. DO NOT MENTION A BETTER CINEMATOGRAPHER. There are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and the carnival simply shrouded, rather than captured to locate the film solidly in the exotic setting of the novel. Elsewhere in the comments of the viewer on this site, one of them cunning observer complained about the variety of devilishly bad accents in this film. Ever since I saw George C Scott as Rochester at Jane Eyre, I prayed that I would NEVER take on a role again that required him to assume a British accent. Only once in a while could he pass by a British or a very South African Briton played obviously by an American actor. I can handle Meryl Streep's extraordinarily well-crafted accents (both British and Australian) - at least she's right, even with each statement, she demands that we marvel at her ability. Well, I regret that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and just destroy the illusion - like having Michele Yeoh speaking excruciating Mandarin with a strong Singaporean accent on Crouching Tiger etc. <br /> <br /> Peterson does not act differently. of what we see in the CSI. Except he's still very handsome and more or less skinny in this movie. He's Harrison Ford's TV. The same old expressions for all emotions, all situations. Not with a second thought, Ford has two - perplexed / distressed and happy. I've never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
