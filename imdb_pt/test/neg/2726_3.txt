"The Vindicator" is a small Canadian B movie. At first sight, it seems to be just another cheap (extremely cheap!) Copy of "Terminator", but strangely it also shares some qualities with the original RoboCop, which had not yet been released when "Vindicator" appeared (1986) . Coincidence? Who knows? Anyway, the story goes like this: scientist Carl Lehman seems to be a really cool guy who works for a high-tech secret government research lab, reporting to a despicable boss named Whyte, with whom he talks about project funding at the outset of the movie. Carl has a loving wife at home and a baby on the way, which makes it even more tragic when he is suddenly killed in a "laboratory accident." But wait! Carl is not really dead after all! Whyte extracted Carl's brain and inserted it into his pet project, some sort of experimental biomechanical space suit. When Carl wakes up inside his new body, he gets a little crazy, destroys the lab and escapes. This is a problem because Whyte (for reasons known only to himself) has programmed the mechanical suit with an "Anger Reaction" program, which will cause Carl to kill anyone who touches him for any reason. In retrospect, this little addition to Carl's psyche probably was not the best idea. So Robo-Carl wanders around the movie for a while, killing two random assailants and other assorted background characters, until he returns to his house and contacts his wife (this scene must it's painfully touching, I think, but it turns out to be comical because Carl's robot voice is so strongly synthesized that you can barely understand a word he says). He, of course, tells her to leave the city and never return because she is in danger, but she wants to stay and help him, yadda yadda yadda. Eventually, Whyte hires a gang of bandits led by "Hunter," an apparent ninja assassin played by Pam Grier (!) To hunt down and destroy his fugitive creation, using Carl's wife as bait and predictable (but ridiculously cheap) I'm a type of B-Movie, but "The Vindicator" was so half-idiot that it turned into high comedy very quickly. I'm guessing a good chunk of the budget was for the Stan-robston robo-Carl suit design because this really looks really cool but the rest of the movie suffers with a cheap, made-for-TV look. The script could have used a LOT of more work, but maybe the filmmakers heard of the "Robocop" coming into production and rushed to get "Vindicator" so they could not be accused of stealing them. Anyway, judging by the other comments here on IMDb, I'm not the only one who noticed the parallels between "Vindicator" and "Robocop", and obviously "Robo" is the top movie, so no need to waste your time sitting in this absurdity, unless you want to see a movie that can best be described, at best, as a draft of RoboCop if it was done by a student in 8th grade.
