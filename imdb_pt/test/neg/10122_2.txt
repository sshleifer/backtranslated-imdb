This is arguably the worst of Ava Gardner's top films. Yes, she is beautiful. But this can wear off over time, especially after the end of the tacky and predictable movie. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker has to pretend to be Eddie Bracken (which certainly embarrassed him). Olga San Juan plays the part of Jane Powell (golly, gee). Dick Haymes plays a sort of shadowy helper (!), And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a host of other female semi-comedians). Yes, the film contains a great popular song, "Speak Low." But check out the other pieces, entirely forgettable. Dick Haymes sings very well, of course, and also the uncredited vocalist who dubs Ava. <br /> <br /> The sets are cheap, the script is full of clich√©s and moody failure, and Tom Conway looks like he's been struggling with the liquor (as indeed he was). In short, if you want to see Ava in her prime, buy a picture and stay well away from that movie.
