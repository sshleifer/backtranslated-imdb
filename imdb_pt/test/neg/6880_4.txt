I would not say exactly that this is a good movie, it may actually be a bad movie. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least two good reasons to continue watching this movie, these are the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER. (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), both with solid performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the cast, which is really bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent at "Suburban kids goes to the hood" - HAVOC drama, but here she's far from good enough to be annoying. The HISTORY is decent enough, though nothing special, BUT it would have been much better since it happens in LOUSIANNA that any of the kids actually incorporated a southern accent, but they did not (!). <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie where "the monster" is really limited so deeply in Lousianna folklore, with voodoo and such is simply stupidity not to include that accent in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only rapper HOM METHOD, he plays Vice-Turner and puts a good accent on his few scenes, and I mean, if a rapper is able to do that, then why the actors could not "professionals" do the same? same? Mister Tical aka Meth is very nice in his very small role, Who knows the Ticallion stallion would never be a cop? Same as just the big screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in addition, it's a pretty stupid Slasher movie, but quite enjoyable, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young cast, this could have been really bad, fortunately they are good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent, but there are hundreds of better slasher movies out there.
