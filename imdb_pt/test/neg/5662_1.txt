iCarly is about a teenage girl named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, Spencer at a loft in Seattle. Carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year, so much money that she "does not even know it's a real number." Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy), who is as predictable as they come! She says "normal" things and knocks on Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is in charge of all the technical stuff for her web show. Carly shouts every word and it looks like she has no emotion. Sam chases Freddie and Freddie yells. In an episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the doorman) in the elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it unless you like teens screaming, hurting people and making fun of things.
