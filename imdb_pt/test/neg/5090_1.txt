This is by far one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen! And if you do not believe me, go ahead and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the plot makes no sense at all. People who fight do not make the least sense. I could not understand what they were talking about during the movie (in most cases I did not even care). It does nothing to keep him watching the movie, the only good point would be cinematography. New Zealand looks amazing. Everything else simply sucks. <br /> <br /> The actors do everything they can to keep us awake, but unfortunately you go to sleep. <br /> <br /> Do us all a favor, even if it does. enter "On Demand", do not watch!
