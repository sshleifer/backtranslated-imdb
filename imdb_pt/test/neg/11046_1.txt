Unbelievable. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen another "Old Boy" because what I saw was a poorly-written, ill-conceived, exaggerated and sordid piece of "Kraapola" that, even ignoring for a moment the ridiculously violent scenes they did not fit the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and thirst for conspiracy for seven years. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this excuse was exhausted in a small piece of wisdom. , "Laugh and everyone will laugh with you, cry and you will find yourself alone," the kind of annoying lucky cookie saying that a great author, be it Shakespeare or, more to the IMDb rank, Kurosawa, would have played in the trash can with no ulterior motives. Where this movie should have come too, if we did not live in a time when the shocking cheap and the perversely repugnant are confused with what used to be called "great art." In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It's not 1 out of 1000 just because of some occasional specialized camera work. It is by no means sufficient to save this childlike failure from futility, however.
