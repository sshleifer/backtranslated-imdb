I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I am an educated person. This movie made me miss 90 minutes of my life when I could have done something useful for humanity or just for me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is bad, the actors never seem scared! Even if it's a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be scared, but he looks pretty normal. The girl in the movie is a clich√©. The only thing I liked about her was the dress she wore in the final scene. And by the way, the ending was extremely predictable with the pink blinking cocoon in the box. In fact, I was thinking more of an ant walking in the back seat of the car. But it still did not surprise me.
