Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. I could not care less about anyone in this movie. Should this be a comedy? Maybe the mood was too subtle for me (up to the nano level). The problem is that he lost a lot of things. There were characters that might be funny, but they were not. There were characters you could have liked, but you did not like it. For example, the guy who thought the Beatles stole his songs. There was a lot of potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they robbed him. Haha And the previous poster talked about the 'I am the Walrus' scene as if it were special. What? He played "I am the Walrus" on an old piano and sang out of tune. Is there an internal joke there? It certainly stank of face value. This movie has the feel of a movie that people say they like because it sounds "intellectual" or "cool" to say you like, you get all the metaphysical message of art / trash the artist is expressing. If you want to have fun, stay away.
