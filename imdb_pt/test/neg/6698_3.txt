If anyone thinks this is a great sports movie, it's probably the only sports movie they've ever seen. There are different aspects that a sports movie can have. Be professional or college or high school. Examples of sports movies I liked (and I have not seen many) are Jim Thorpe: All Americans, All Right Moves, Any Given Sunday, Eight Men Out, and Rocky, among others. All of these movies had a little more than just simple sports. Whether it be the rise of a man and then the descent of greatness, or a man losing a dream by the actions of a vengeful technician, or the effect of money on professional sports. In Hoosiers, there is not much content. It did not even look like the movie had a beginning or an end. There was no development of character, they were all forced into us. I could summarize this movie, citing a very bad coach: "Get out and try to score more points than the other guy."
