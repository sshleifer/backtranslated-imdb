The peace and beauty of Koyaanisqatsi were a powerful affirmation of the natural world. In Naqoyqatsi, we are attacked by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent and the digital - the destructive constructions of our culture. <br /> <br /> Some freedoms are taken with images, with posterization, harrowing. and very slow movement. The connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if any. Naqoyqatsi is set at the end of the film, a missed opportunity to put the pictures in context. <br /> <br /> The film is difficult to watch, the quality of the movie unequal file, and is more redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of Philip Glass.
