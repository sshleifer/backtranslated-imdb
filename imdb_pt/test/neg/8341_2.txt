I saw the trailer for this movie before watching the Titanic, and I must admit that it whetted my appetite. The volcano appeared to be spectacular and full of promise. But what is a wet abortion? Corny is not the word for the script, and characterizations are often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is just unbelievable - she's not supposed to be 13 years old. But scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters offer nothing more. This movie is in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because these two films are completely shocking. This has some reasonable effects, but overall it is 1 in 10. Do not waste your time
