I saw this in the theater a few decades ago, and confusing memories suggest that I liked it. However, seeing for the second time two things stand out: (1) very poor acting by Michelle Johnson, and (2) very poor music everywhere. <br /> <br /> It's not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian songs were good, but the theme song and other clanging were remnants of the worst pop music of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Johnson's voice seemed all wrong, possibly dubbed. That was a distraction. <br /> <br /> On the plus side: (1) The story is not bad, (2) it's interesting to see a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better, and (4) Johnson looked quite attractive in various stages of inattention.
