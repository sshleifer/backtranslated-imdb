Yes! this movie was bad in all respects such as casting, effects, boredom, excitement and of course being fantastic and we all know that the four heroes of this movie were a little more colorful compared to the new ones but still have a boredom fantastic as this really was just silly rubbish that I knew no one would like when I saw it, I mean for sure with that budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been done but not. I'm glad that the new version made this year show everyone how the fantastic four should have been made with a good story, a great cast as Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses, otherwise would have been totally forgotten but fortunately not. The new one was great when I saw it with my friends at the movies, but this fantastic old man has to go.
