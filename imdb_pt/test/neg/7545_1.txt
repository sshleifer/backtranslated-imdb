The unthinkable happened. Having watched for the first time a few years ago, I had a movie that has been my point of reference for horror and that movie was called "McCinsey Island". A family adventure film with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I'm not making this up), plunged into the new depths of the movie and still the only movie I saw that made me wonder what else the budget of the film could have been. Spending on. Like new schools or drugs that treat cancer. However, for absolute and unadulterated levels, any movie will have to lower their standards even more if they want to beat "Guest House Paradiso" as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Based vaguely around the puerile but fun "Bottom" TV show, this movie presents us two of the biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager, as hostile as anyone you can imagine and so perversely lewd to the point of almost exuding the mud of every action. His friend Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is a waste of alcoholic drink from human life and together they try to run Britain's worst hotel, perched on a cliff next to a nuclear power plant. Among them, they engage in cartoon violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stand there and stare longingly at any woman. The plot, as it is, involves the arrival of the legendary Italian goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel), who is fleeing from her marriage and tries to lie down at Guest House Paradiso, to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And that's it. <br /> <br /> I used to think that Carry On movies represented all the bad things about the UK film industry and, God knows, we spent so much time and money trying to escape from that god. terrible legacy. We had films like "Trainspotting," "28 Days Later," "Four Weddings And A Funeral," and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg), but this ... it drags those movies screaming and kicking back to the days of Sid James and Barbara Windsor flying with the aid of a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch. I watched, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start, but they never came. Just an endless stream of gags caught in the trap, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, mildly entertaining violence with pans and refrigerator doors and almost nothing lifting as much as a smile. There comes the first ad slot (it was on TV, you see) and I was ready to hang up, but my duties loyal to you, my readers, kept me moving. "I'm seeing this so they do not have to" become my mantra for you to remember how much you owe me for it, because it was as much fun as having sand kicking in my eyes and being dog food forced. Trust me, I used to love the TV show "Bottom." The combination of Mayall and Edmondson's suitably dirty acts with OTT youthful mood worked ... for half an hour every week. Certainly not for an hour and a half, while Edmondson and Mayall indulged in their particular little joke and upset and depressed the rest of the audience. Honestly, that makes Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" look like "The Godfather," and if you find one of these two people (who are the only ones responsible for the chaos on the screen pretending to be a movie) be free to quickly deliver a boot to the region of the testicles. They probably like that. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship, but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson should not be so lucky. The cinematographic equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
