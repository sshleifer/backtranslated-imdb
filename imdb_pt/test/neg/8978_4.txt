Although this was the first documentary on Hunter S. Thompson, I saw that it was, at best, the average, despite the involvement of such great star appearances as Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and a few others. I was disappointed in that and yet it was a little interesting. What kept me watching was some of the old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where the Buffalo Roam. Not very good, mainly because of the old conversations and things that any fan already knew. I still think they were milking because it could have been compressed at least in half. Still, if you're a fan, I'd like something to do with the hunter. best regards
