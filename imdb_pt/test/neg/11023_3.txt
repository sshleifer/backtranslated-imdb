Since I bought the DVD, I watched as much as I did for a sense of obligation to my wallet. <br /> <br /> The plot has Kirk Douglas as a successful first writer who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love and marries her. Complications happen. <br /> <br /> Douglas is generally seen as an intense actor, given to highly dramatic roles, sometimes heroes, sometimes rats. He's not bad in this completely comic part. The problem is that the part is not particularly comic and nor is it anything else. <br /> <br /> The plot continues. A dozen "quirky" characters come and go - Keenan Wynn, more prominently, as a friend of Douglas, who does nothing but make ironic remarks. Thelma Ritter was better at this sort of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it could still have been rescued by some brilliance in the dialogue, but there is none to talk about. Some jokes are silly. Others do not clarify this bar. Here's what I thought was a fun line. Douglas has just hired Day and wants to take her to the beach house and seduce her. Day is disturbed and notes that she has never heard of a writer working at a beach house. Wynn asks if she liked Douglas's previous book, "Last Year's Love." Yes, of course she did. "Well, most of Last Year's Love was made at the beach house." Ha ha. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There were better sitcoms on television.
