I am a huge fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice cream scene haunts me to this day. I'm 33 now and I still remember being horrified as a child. When I knew they were remaking, I thought it might be good, but when I saw the movie, 100% is not the same movie. It's not a remake. It's a badly stolen idea. It was completely ruined. The cast, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors, but neither have they been able to save this movie. It was just wrong. Even the scenario was completely opposite. And how the hell did not anyone in this town realize that there was a war going on next door? Why did not you help show up earlier? Stupid. Meaningless.
