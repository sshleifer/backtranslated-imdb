BAG WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror film supposedly based on real events that occurred during the period from 1817 to 1821. This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, a film starring Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other movie instead of what I saw! I enjoyed the chilling performance of Betsy Palmer on Friday the 13th. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, she would achieve a better performance than anyone involved in the farce known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Regarding my position, this movie is not painful. to watch because the content is disturbing. It is painful to watch because it is simply boring. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive comments for this movie, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. The second possibility - the authors, although not directly involved, were paid to write positive reviews after the completion of production. The final possibility - none of these authors saw a sufficient number of horror films and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts use. <br /> <br /> The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston is visited by two journalists eager to hear the story of Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begin to happen at the home of John Bell and his family. It soon becomes clear that a vengeful spirit is behind everything. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the plot seems to be a standard poltergeist subject, though based on actual events. <br /> <br /> Where the implementation of the brilliant concept is concerned, however, almost everything that could go wrong goes wrong. And then some! <br /> <br /> First, the acting. The performance is almost uniformly awful throughout the board. This factor causes the greatest damage to production, harming any credible credibility or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenager experiencing adolescent anguish rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. I almost laughed when I heard some of his lines. Unfortunately, this voice started getting very annoying very quickly! I may not be alive in the 1800s, but I find it incredibly hard to believe that any young people alive at that time spoke the way this "ghost" does! <br /> <br /> Second, the direction. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes are promising, but the potential is wasted by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or lighting to add intensity to scenes that claim to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is supposed to be behind supernatural occurrences. However, the effects are so incredibly ineffective that anyone who has seen an appropriate horror movie would buy for them. I'll give you an example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. See the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the script. While it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to reports of actual occurrences, it can not be denied that most scenes are unbelievably flat and boring. Scenes as short as two minutes seem much longer thanks to poor dialogue - dialogue that does not add depth to the characters or story. This movie is very dependent on conversations to advance the story. Although this style was also the case with the British films of the British apogee of the 1960s and 1970s, it can not be denied that the exchanges of dialogues were always interesting to observe in these earlier professional works. Peter Cushing, for example, could read a phone book and still keep viewers' attention. The same can not be said of the actors in THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mood. The misguided attempts of humor in this film are excruciating. An obese boy is the subject of many jokes. A particularly terrible scene sees the said boy going into the outer bathroom. This scene should never have been included - but it is and completes with sound effects if you can not figure out what it is doing! <br /> <br /> The only good points about the film are the location and the costumes. The decision to shoot the photo near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE HAUNT is a shocking movie. It's not even in the league "so bad it's good". Instead, it's just annoying. I advise everyone to save money and avoid this movie like the plague. Do not worry about seeing this for free! <br /> <br /> I've never seen the other movie about Bell Witch. But really could not be worse than HAUNT. Could? I'm going to give this other movie a chance, if I can trace it. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I advise everyone here to check out some horror movies about ghosts and haunts. THE HOUSE LEGEND OF HELL, CHANGE, RINGU, GRUCE (Japanese original) and A LOST CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.
