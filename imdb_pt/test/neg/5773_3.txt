Oh dear, oh dear. It really gets on my nerves when a low-budget, senseless horror case tries to look interesting in the credits for having a lot of good names coming into the cast just to get everyone involved in the smallest and most useless possible roles. In this film, we have Richard Lynch in a scene, a momentary appearance by Martin Kove, a brief spot for Vernon Welles, a little more time on John Philip Law's screen and a little time for Karen Black. This bunch of random appearances does not really contribute much, although Richard Lynch and Karen Black raise some of the few smiles from this film with their appearances, and it's really painful, since none of the main actors is very good. I could not help thinking that if more scenes were filmed with any of the film's veterans above the movie it would be much better, but as it is, there are only a few tempting glimpses of good entertainment without the film actually really reaching much. Entertainment value. Of the main cast, the only charismatic or lovable performances in my opinion were Steve Wastell, like Axel and his girlfriend, whom I believe to have been played by Elina Madison (I've never heard of her before, but she has some onscreen presence and is a good spectator). The plot in this is simple, the undead miner of evil goes after those who want to steal his gold, and should be good fun, especially because it is directed by John Carl Buechler, who made special effects for many of them. sort of films including having worked on all three major slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday 13th) and small jewelry like Mausoleum. Sadly, unfortunately, the film is lacking in suspense, sympathy and satisfaction. There are one or two mildly bloody moments, but nothing worth the effort to watch the movie, I would not say. In fact, in addition to the aforementioned appearances, this whole movie is actually very old and uncomfortable with characters that could not be tanned fast enough for my taste and an unfortunate lack of real interest. I did not even find it fun in a laughable bad movie sense, which is rare for me, since I love a lot of really bad movies. I would say, avoid.
