I disagree with calling this a stoner movie just because the herb also makes an appearance. I can not imagine this as approaching "stoner classic". That would be like calling Singles "grunge movie". The film definitely moves along with a bleak plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script had been discarded and shuffled or if they had lost it entirely and just tried to improvise. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children play and inventing the story as they go along. <br /> <br /> The characters are wooden, the dialogue is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And that's how you act when your friend takes an overdose? Complete lack of emotion and complete disconnection from reality. <br /> <br /> As for the soundtrack of the guitar that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen, where the same track makes an endless loop in the background, without moving forward or backward. <br /> <br /> I kept watching and hoping that the plot somehow fell into the order, the acting and Dialogue would improve or something, somehow would focus that mess on a coherent film. After 112 minutes, this never happened.
