Was Norman Wisdom's last starred vehicle a departure from his previous tours? bringing its milquetoast accident-prone up-to-date, this being a product of Swinging Sixties! The end result is an uncomfortable and occasionally embarrassing comedy that mixes the typical comedy (and sentimentality) of the star with a mild sexuality and an even softer satire; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip to a banking conference that fits the teenager Sally Geeson (who does not care about getting involved with him, but does not take their relationship seriously); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman about his fickle character. <br /> <br /> The film is far from as bad as the BOMB rating Leonard Maltin would have and, if anything, is interesting for his mid-deal. life crisis (being in many respects similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979] - both, incidentally, I just observed); in the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife to his new way of thinking! The Pretty Things appear as themselves performing a number of good songs in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the captivating title track!
