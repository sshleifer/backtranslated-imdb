Only three words are really needed for this review: Garbage Piece. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a kid, you'll see that this movie is a complete waste of time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet stuck to the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all names and phrases of effect. The same name of the dog "Shoeshine" (in reference to the dog being "Shoeshine Boy" in the cartoon). They call it Polly's love interest, but she's not the pure Sweet Miss Polly. <br /> <br /> My wife and son drug me to see this. They should have drugged me to see him. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the ultimate nerd. This is voiced by someone with an attitude of "smart teenager who knows more than all adults". Like an independent movie, it's horrible. As a tribute to Underdog, it's even worse. It is not a tribute. It is not a rereading of history. It is not an update of history. It is purely an attempt to profit from a well-known title and create merchandising. Next time I go to the store, I fear seeing toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. McDonalds and Burger King probably fought over child meal rights. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. THEY DO THE THEME SONG FROM THE SUBTENSION TO RAP (read this with a silent "C" at the beginning)! Great, now that we're going to destroy something, let's go to the end. <br /> <br /> I knew it would probably be bad before I went. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my 12 plex location and discovered that they opened for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four seats without the stadium). Even the theater people knew it was going to be crap! Save money on tickets and invest better by going out and buying the original DVD series. It will be more fun and will have better production values.
