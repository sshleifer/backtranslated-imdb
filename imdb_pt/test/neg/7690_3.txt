The amount of hype and the huge success that this movie found is evidence of how desperate our employees are in relation to a good independent Saudi movie. In fact, the huge success of "Tash Ma Tash" is also evidence. <br /> <br /> I will not start as film production is important, as is obvious to those with half a brain like movies. changed the world. <br /> <br /> And I will not say how much our society needs a lot of movies to clarify many of the problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many more. <br /> <br /> Together came the news about the first Saudi movie that should have been a remedy for some of the issues we have, especially for youth. Instead, we tried a bald movie for that. <br /> <br /> The script's ignorance and naivety was obvious. It was as if a 13-year-old had written. <br /> <br /> Now I hear that the budget for this movie was huge. I wonder where the money went, right? The effects were really ugly, the editing was bad. The script was "kharabeet". You really do not know what the story is and what the director wants from this movie. <br /> <br /> A note about the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good, but with bad direction. Another thing with the role of the religious friends he had, it's not like religious faces act here in Saudi Arabia! They are not "bad" like this movie intended. In fact, they are some of the coolest people you've ever met with a really unusual lifestyle, and that's what should have appeared in the movie. <br /> <br /> Young people are following the religious here because of a reason, and this is that young people are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well-formed principles in which the religious live, young people follow them. Again, this is what should have appeared. <br /> <br /> We need another "First Movie" with a Saudi scriptwriter, actor, director, composer and even a videographer. For everyone to work passionately about your experiment, not just for the money! <br /> <br /> And we must do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we must include phrases from the Quran in the script of the film. As people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge that a Saudi filmmaker is facing is to change the mindset in that angle.
