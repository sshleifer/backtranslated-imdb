I just can not see what everyone sees in this movie. The acting is simply awful, the choice of the song is, putting it mildly, quirky, there are enough fighting scenes, the plot is nonexistent and any small entertainment that one can get from this movie is ruined by the annoying way as part of the film is filmed and gives you a split head.
