Okay, let's get right to the point - there's no way I can give anything other than 1 in 10; and yet you have to see! The acting is bad, but it's not as bad as the script, which pales before the production values. Cardboard shafts? Yes, we do. Car mats painted silver and used as armor? here it is! <br /> <br /> The movie itself pretends to be artistic, but it is cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in prolonged fighting scenes; there is (very well!) very little dialogue, and there is a lot of 'artistic' music to put horror home! <br /> <br /> And yet all this horror is compelling - you have to watch it just so you can tell what you've seen. I did not even get into the sterile scenarios, the "plot" or the laughable special effects; this is really the film school "how not to do". This must be seen - spread the word, and let the whole world come together in intriguing about what is happening in the end <br /> <br /> The best thing though is that they did a continuation.
