It is incredible to me that the best interpretation of this incredible story remains a cartoon made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but it's true. Here another awkward attempt is confused and alienates viewers with admirable effectiveness, while at the same time counteracting those who actually read the story. Irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature film is a challenge. It is possible to completely rewrite the story to la Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another occasion, or to calm the old woman's bust line with unintended details. The latter is what is tried here, and if I may say so, regrettably. New, unimaginative and entirely modern facets for character personalities such as Crane's religious fanaticism or the desire to travel in the old Bram Bones ruin the intent of the story and reveal a serious lack of talent on the part of filmmakers. As the famous climax of the tale approached, I completely lost interest. It's the kind of movie where you expect to see a stage assistant smoking in the background.
