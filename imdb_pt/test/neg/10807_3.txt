Now I watched it when it first came out on VHS, and all my friends and I thought it was a really good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. But honestly, not so good of a movie in retrospect. A kind of hair metal, Dokken version of the Carnival of Souls. But a bad movie does not exactly mean that it is unattainable; however, this does not seem to have the charm that many of the regular fodder of Mst3k contain. But if it was cable, and I was bored and drinking beer - surely I would watch again. But then again, I've seen Howling Howling about five times now, so maybe you really should not be listening to me. <br /> <br /> Anyone else finds it somewhat sad that the director has reportedly commented on his own. movie? And why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much?
