This is the first time I'm entering a comment for a movie that I did not see until the credits. Reason for this is simple ... people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. I usually stay away from a fair amount of comedies that are in bad taste, but I found that to be watchable. A deplorable decision that was based on other Ashton Kutcher comedies that were (semi-) enjoyable, like A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. <br /> <br /> Where those two films had their charms and laughter, this did not have none (and I mean none !!) The acting is horrible, especially the "boss". Tara Reid was not surprised, what's her name? The premise is thin and the plot does not thicken. Not a problem if you can keep it funny and / or sweet ... but as you probably already guessed, this was not the cast at all! The script seemed not to have ended, and I would not be bewildered if the director did some rewriting while filming. My dog ​​could have written a more coherent script, seriously. And he's not exactly Lassie either :-). <br /> <br /> Stay away from this scam, even if you like stupid comedies sometimes (like me). This low quality movie will not be appreciated by many ... <br /> <br /> I (almost) never give one, then ... to 2.
