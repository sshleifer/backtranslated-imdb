Oh my God, why did I waste my precious time on this movie? It's pathetic, OTT waaaay and unrealistic, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Yes my life. I am embarrassed by Yash Raj movies, the poor have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible movie. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most useless, sexual, eyebrow movie I've ever seen by Yash Raj Films. I shiver for them, I really do. Together with Uday Chopra's awful performance (or NO performance for that matter) combined with the lack of talent from Tanisha's "Look At My Boobs", Neal 'n' Nikki has nothing good about it. Even the music is not in the standard left by the YRF. The director, Arjun Sablok, did an awkwardly bad job here. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I expected more. Much much more.
