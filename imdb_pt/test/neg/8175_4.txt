In a year when "Singin 'in the Rain" and "High Noon" were released, this super-gifted turkey somehow won an Oscar for Best Picture. Half the film is nothing more than circus performances. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both struggle, although they are models of containment compared to the annoying Hutton. Playing an egocentric trapeze artist, Hutton acts as a super-zealous high school student in a poorly produced school play. Grahame is the only cast member to perform well. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, only in creating an exaggerated spectacle, no matter how boring.
