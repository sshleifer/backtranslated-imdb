This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. On an equal footing with Blair Witch and so annoying. The flashing helmet lights made things difficult and I think epileptics should be careful as there are times with strobe lights that make this movie even more irritating. I think if they'd been quiet, they might have found a way out. So when you think the geek can be overcome, even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh, and when the guy who is having sex realizes that when the girl says she can hear something. She can actually hear something. One of these guys must have at least seen Scream (where they draw their attention to such things). It's also a big disappointment when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script. So excuse people I have this weekly in the video store and I still would like my money back.
