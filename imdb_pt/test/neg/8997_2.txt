After reading the most brilliant comments about this movie, I decided to rent it, despite some suspicion of TV movies. I should have followed my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to heat up in the movie and find merit in it, but I just could not. History never appeals to you or it really touches you and the performance is superficial and, at worst, laughable. Everything in this production is amateurish. Always a joy to watch, Mary McDonnell may be the only artist to escape this disaster without harming her career or reputation. I will not even bother checking the protagonist's name - I hope he's back doing business. Even poor Vanessa Redgrave, who I love and respect, seemed to be channeling Katherine Hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really stoned at home. Maybe she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If I can save a person from wasting 100 minutes with this breeze, I will feel justified.
