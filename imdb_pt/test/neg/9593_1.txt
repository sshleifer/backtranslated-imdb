He laughed a lot, but probably because he was high. That aside ... this is by no means a horror movie, there is no horror in this whole movie and the holes in the plot are so big that even a person of IQ below average would think it was stupid. Also, I am living in Denmark and have been for all my life and I can assure you that Denmark is a country too small for you to need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you get lost. I would estimate that unless you really put the effort into it you could never be further from the city or other people that a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I do not think any part of the film, apart from two scenes from Copenhagen, where none of the actors was, has been recorded in Denmark. The swamp woman is speaking Swedish not Danish. The helmet on the first body of the swamp is new. The girl they meet in the forest is hidden under a kind of rock that does not exist in Denmark. That's just stupid.
