There are places for political commentary in the movies, but "Masters of Horror" is not one of them. I get enough of these things from Newsweek and all the other editorials in the paper. Now I have to watch this in horror movies? Come on! All I wanted was a good zombie movie and not another "Bush is bad!" Rant. If Joe Dante wants to voice his policy, let him join Air America. And if you must insist on making a "message" film, be a little more insightful about it. This had all the hint of being slapped in the face with a dead fish. <br /> <br /> By the way, Joe, do you really want the left-wing voting bloc to be associated with brain-dead zombies? You may want to think about this before you make another political horror film (may God help us).
