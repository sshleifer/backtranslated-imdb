I had no idea that this movie was produced by "WWE". Wrestling is lame enough. Why did they have to bury their name even more by making a movie as bad as that? I thought it was a complete disappointment. If I had known that this movie would be as stupid as it was, I would have stayed home and done something more fun. Of course, I'll give them credit for the legal effects; but the killer did not look as scary as he could have been. He did not have many things. But I'll let you point it out to yourselves. The plot was a great idea, it just could have been done in a much better way. Maybe in the future, WWE will stick to their idiot wrestling and stay out of the film industry.
