An Asian blowpipe killer knocks out victims in Niagara Falls and New York before being hit by a car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, having a hilarious "Southern belle" to show that she is from Alabama) finds a connection between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and leaves to investigate. This takes her to New Guinea, where she promises a dirty guide (Robert Kerman, that is, the American porn star R. Bolla), $ 80,000 to help locate her sister. After passing through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate Diana, who is under the control of cult leader Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical stuff of the crazy guru style, like fainting LSD, starting group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys and raping Agren with a giant dong dipped in snake blood. From time to time a character looks to the right or to the left and sees a bloody scene raised directly from the HOLOCAUSTA JUNGLE or MAN FROM THE DEEP RIVER (both also directed by Lenzi). I'm sure they also use at least two CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST scenes as well. Here we have the expected scenes of animal slaughter (evisceration of an alligator, natives eating live snakes), plus additional nudity and castration. Me Me Lai appears to give her breast implants another workout, playing a widow who is struck by three of her brother in laws over the ashes of her newly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a teacher and does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with MANGIATI VIVI! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you're a dumb dog, by all means, watch. Personally, I got bored with it halfway and just wanted it to end. The original US release in 1985 was titled THE EMERALD JUNGLE to trick people into making them think they were renting EMERALD FOREST from John Boorman. It was also called DOOMED TO DIE and EATEN ALIVE BY CANNIBALS!
