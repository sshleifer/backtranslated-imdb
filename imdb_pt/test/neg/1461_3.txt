When I first saw "Race Against Fear" (do not you just love LMN movie titles?), I had to keep scratching my head. Was that meant to be serious? Why could not the main character even run like a normal person running, much less like a star runner? How did I know that the coach was barely barely 1 minute in the movie? All these questions and no answers. So I just let the script go insane and the horrible direction take me away ... it was easier not to resist ... so the movie got funnier by the minute, and now I rank it among my ten LMN trash films. . Some have said here that Ariana Richards is really talented, but that material was flawed - I honestly disagree. Not only can she not convince me that she is an athlete, she walks wide-eyed for the rest of the story, as if she has just landed on Earth. Maybe the coach ran away from prison and finished with her ... at least I hope so.
