This was presented as a continuation of Crash Dive, which was a very good movie in the low budget category. I assumed this movie would be good too, but man I was wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive, as well as both occurring in submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases utterly absurd. <br /> <br /> This movie will not catch the eye of most people. (I remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes that must be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. After I got over my initial shock that someone would slip and not meet people, not only would I discredit but laugh at his sheer foolishness, I was able to find humor in him. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the MD in a good movie, watch Crash Dive and leave this lame movie on the shelf.
