This is definitely a "lesser known" comedy short of the 1920s. The only reason I saw this was because it was on a DVD from Kino Films featuring non-Laurel and Hardy Ollie shorts. They are interesting and historically important, but they are also generally below average for movie style. Compared to the short films by Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely one step below them in quality and humor. In addition, the accompanying music was very poor by the standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound due to the inadequacy of the song to set the mood. But despite that, they are still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest about it. It was the last of the 8 of this DVD and when I got there, I was very bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 short films. So it's possible that the movie is A LITTLE better than a 4 - but certainly, if this is the case, no better than a 5! The film is a short pattern on an incompetent messenger. Nothing particularly interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there.
