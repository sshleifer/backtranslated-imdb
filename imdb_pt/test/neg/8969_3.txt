Any chance of seeing Katharine Hepburn in something I have not seen or her movie career is a treat, and at that level the movie is fun, but she's awful as a Billy Hill. His famous enunciation of New England escapes, making phrases such as "I better steal some very ridiculous Vittles." Is she so handsome and so young? almost overcomes this great fault. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and therefore a younger generation might think this thing rather corny, but this was the staple of American entertainment as well in the 1940s. It has its moments but you may need to be an amateur for movies to enjoy it.
