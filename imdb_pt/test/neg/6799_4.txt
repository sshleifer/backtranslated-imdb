Bizarre. This movie must be based on a famous photographer, but everything that happens in this movie is fiction. I think he tries to explain why Diane Arbus had a fascination with oddities and made it her main focus in photography. In the movie, the werewolf enters the apartment above hers. She apparently becomes obsessed with him and falls in love with him. She puts her children and husband in second place on the werewolf, and even tries to incorporate him into their family reunions. Some of the werewolf side freaks show kicks aside to visit and she mingles with them. The whole thing is very bizarre. FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. There is just something strange about a woman who makes her earrings scrape the werewolf. I think you can find better movies out there.
