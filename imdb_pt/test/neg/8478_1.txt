-Then the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy who wants to be an animator but can not get his career on the ground. His super hot wife is more successful and she does not seem to care that he is a loser but the man is not satisfied with it and wants to make more of his life. One day, your dog brings a magical mask that changes your life. Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to retrieve it and that's the whole story. If this sounds exciting to you, then someone needs to throw some water at you to wake you up. <br /> <br /> -This movie is terrible. There is no other way for me to say it and I can not stretch it long enough. The only good thing about the whole thing was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was hot, but outside of her there's nothing about this movie that's worth watching. I know it's for kids and that's why it's so stupid, but what about the adults who have to take their kids to watch this crap? Why do we have to suffer with this horrible vomit bag of horrible crap. The original mask was a very good film that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling. This is a stupid attempt by the filmmakers to hack to make money from the franchise and, judging by the ridiculous BO gross, I'm guessing the franchise will not last any longer. The director of photography needs to be severely beaten because the sugary colors of the film will make you feel like vomiting. If there was music, I did not pay attention because I had already drilled my eardrums so as not to hear the horrible dialogue. Then there is the acting or at least what happens to act nowadays. you can watch an infomercial and see a much better acting than that movie, but I can not blame the actors as it is the director who deserves the blame for seemingly not realizing that the actors needed to make another f * king leads. If the new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need it for their game by hiring writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /> <br /> line -Bottom If you are a sadomasochist and you love to torture yourself then please, by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you are not and you really enjoy watching movies that are good then avoid at all costs
