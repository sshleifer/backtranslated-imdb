Shakalaka Boom Boom is a steal from the movie Amadeus. I personally classify Amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it's about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the true story of a musical genius that is not just remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music that it produced. during his lifetime, but by his very self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35, being practically not celebrated during his life because of the policy pursued by some people, particularly Saliere, the Italian composer, who was I jealous of him Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka .. as the director invariably clipped most of the scenes from the movie Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and I am skeptical about the kind of films that Bollywood keeps stirring day after day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians in the film do not give you any feeling of being realistic, the film is tasteless, insignificant and total failure in each account. The only person who has an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs. <br /> <br /> The irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen of the film says that all the characters in this movie are fictional and that any resemblance to someone is pure coincidence, which is a blatant lie, because all the similarities are very clear and are very intended. I wish I could bring Darshan and Co. to court, not only for copyright infringement, but also for mutilating a fine work of art.
