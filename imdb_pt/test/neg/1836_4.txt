Medical student Paula Henning wins a place at an exclusive medical school in Heidelberg. When the body of a young man she met on the train appears at her dissecting table, she begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death and uncovers a macabre conspiracy perpetrated by an anti-hippocratic secret society operating within the school. Disturbing and gross, many scary parts. It even has a good script and final. But it has a poor share. What else could you see from this movie? It's a good mystery and horror movie. But of course, if you like, go buy. If you do not, there is still no reason to waste your money on it. <br /> <br /> Evaluating R for extreme graphic violence, sexual situations and profanity.
