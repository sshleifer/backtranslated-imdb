The comments to the Commune make it sound like a very interesting film, in which I would be deeply interested. Unfortunately, producers did not find it appropriate to include subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing. This leaves me and countless others like me, who depend on subtitles to follow a movie, completely out. <br /> <br /> This is inexcusable for any film produced in the year 2005. In a world where all kinds of disabilities and disabilities are accommodated, it is infuriating and ironic that the always hypocritical entertainment industry fails to demand that all productions and cinemas should be subtitled.
