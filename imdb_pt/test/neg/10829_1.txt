Why can not there be better made TV movies that I was in for a loose end today and watched this movie on a satellite channel in UK. What a terrible waste of my time it was. Poor sets, poor acting and Oh my god what a terrible flood. Heck, this woman can even overtake a torrent of water too! <br /> <br /> I would really like people to make TV movies using better, better or at least more conspiring and much better acting effects. Killer Flood is right up there with little acting. Some pieces of ham could not get worse. <br /> <br /> 1 last thing, I really agree with the comment about the dog but I believe it would have already been brushed in real life!
