First of all, this movie is disgusting to the point of nauseating, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you want to eat ice cream again. I tried to watch it because it looked like it might be funny, but it soon became quite disturbing with the ice cream made from body parts and amazingly graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg witnessing the horrific murder of an ice-cream man (Greg subsequently goes mad and grows up to be the title character) with what appear to be mafia killers. There is no explanation for this murder, making it the biggest moment of WTF throughout the film. Other, smaller moments of the WTF include the surreal asylum that Greg goes (featuring evil clowns), a woman speaking in tongues because she was possessed by the Holy Spirit (which has something to do with something I do not know), and the fact that Olivia "Damn your career has plummeted so badly" Hussey is in it. <br /> <br /> None of these is enough reason to watch it. The only reason is for the character Tuna, who is a skinny kid with pillows stuffed under his shirt, so that he looks like a fat kid. For some reason, that seemed hilarious to me. I woke up later in the evening than I should watch this movie just to find out if there was any reason why they could not use a fat kid for the role. Although I have fallen asleep before the end, I have gathered from other reviews that Tuna ends up losing the "weight". Ok, so they did not have the budget to do it realistically. Suggestion for the director: how about making the character ... not being overweight? <br /> <br /> That's it; if the prospect of tuna did not interest him enough, there is no other reason to acknowledge the existence of this film. If disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your favorite source of entertainment, check out the superior "The Stuff" instead.
