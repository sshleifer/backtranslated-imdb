Although this movie (and I used the term loosely) was made in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we had never heard left him a little apprehensive. I cheerfully watched it anyway, sure that if Jones were in the movie, it would at least be worth two hours of my time. After all, he's been one of our actors for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was even more relieved to see another familiar face. The list of talented actors continued to grow, so I endured more and more this film, certain that if I insisted on clich√©s and trivial social statements, I would be victorious on the other side of the plot. Unfortunately, there was no plot. It seemed burned by the lava of misery, always dripping. <br /> <br /> The characters were paper thin. The plot was so full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the film. Was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for the budget of this film? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (like sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no deadly ash ... no scorching heat just a few meters from the lava. Wow ... it's the friendliest lava in the world! <br /> <br /> Events were no better than the characters. Each incident was so planned and exaggerated ... is how the writers said "Ok, we need to get rid of the little girl NOW" ... and poof, she is hit by a lava bomb that burns enough for her to be transported to safety (not from the lava, but from her own helpless stupor) ... but moments later in the car she is not in any apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the building (moan!) that (oh no! is about to be blown up. After enduring all of this, your reward is the little boy's line at the end (about all people looking the same) ... it has to be one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Even if it was not so painfully scripted, it was a ridiculous time for all the characters involved. Boy and cop aside, as if the mother was still in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she's just not talking ... what ... she's waiting to escape into the shadows and move away from the little brat once and for all. all? I think not. Obviously, the child's mother would be missing or dead - or screaming her head to find her child. <br /> <br /> The symbolic black gangster with a secret weakness against the chip on his cracker police shoulder A secret, smooth scene made my eyes bleed. Even if such characters existed, they would not behave as the film portrays them under the circumstances. Something about imminent burning death and massive destruction tends to catch people off guard, you know? <br /> <br /> There are many moments of canned movies like these to mention ... in fact, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. Those poor writers ... where are they now?
