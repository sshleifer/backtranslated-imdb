Even though he has only made his debut film in Australia and has left for Britain and America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the biggest movie star they have ever produced was Errol Flynn. I'm not sure he has returned to Australia after his success in Captain Blood. Still, I attribute this film to the well-known Australian irreverence for destroying one's reputation. Part of the problem in telling Errol Flynn's life story was that he told enough stories in his life. until the end of his memories, My Wicked Wicked Ways. I could see that a lot of the film was based on this and after reading between the lines in that book. <br /> <br /> His mother's infidelity to her father was not written, but could have been inferred from reading My Wicked. Wicked ways. He did not particularly like the woman, this is clear from some sources. <br /> <br /> I wish the film had dealt more with its adventures in New Guinea, which to me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Wicked Ways. As for your street fight in the Depression, I tend not to believe it. Even if he had been successful at it, I guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his appearance and he would never have had a career as a leading man. <br /> <br /> Still the people down there seem to think that the atmosphere of Sydney during the Depression was well captured and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. The American public knows him better as the Frank, but honest Lieutenant Exley in LA Confidential, who left the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a much better movie.
