I am insulted and angry at the idea that a sequel to 'Gone with the Wind' has been performed. Having expressed this, I have no problem with the acting quality or the actors in this film. Artists are talented people whose talents have been wasted on this piece of junk. The hype around this book and movie just happens to be an exercise in futility. I think it's going to fall like one of the wrong Hollywood movies. I do not believe that the beloved characters created by Margaret Mitchell should have been suffocated by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. The film and book should be on the list of the worst ideas conceived in the world of movie publishing and production. The sad thing is that people really made money from this gut.
