I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We could not find it since we saw almost all the movies created. We decided to look in the low budget horror section. We are looking for the most attractive cover, with half-naked women. We finally decided on the Last Slumber Party, THE. Oops, we made a mistake. It looks like this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that can be found in K-Mart. The actors were caught up in a Salvation Army, and as for Steven Tyler. Let's leave it to the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT While watching the movie, there is absolutely no closing. So come and find out that all the events were just a dream. This movie should also have been about 30 minutes. If the whole camera zoomed in on still pictures, and the wall scans were removed, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is I'm glad there was not a sequel.
