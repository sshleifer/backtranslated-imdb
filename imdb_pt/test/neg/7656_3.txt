This movie is not a bit bad. It's not bad at all. It's awful. You know you're in trouble when Charo appears in a movie. She must have had the week off from "Love Boat". George Kennedy, at least he's a player - he's out there trying. In fact, he's fine. And it's good to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is fine. There is a bit better acting than at Airport '75, but which movie has no better acting than the Airport '75? One thing I liked about this movie is that it had more things than many other disaster films. At least they made an attempt at subplots. What really hurts this movie are the special effects - ugh! It's not very special if you ask me. This is the kind of movie that at 2 in the morning is really funny if you had fun with your friends and are looking for something to laugh at.
