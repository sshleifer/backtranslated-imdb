First and foremost, I would just like to say that I'm back to retirement for writing well-deserved comments about horrible movies. Only the movie titled "Crazed Scarecrow" could bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> That said, I like to start with this comment. OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really awful, I mean, I know it would be bad. But I had no idea that I would be spending 60 minutes of a possible 90-minute movie laughing at what I thought was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest flaw in the movie (for me it is). Ken Shamrock. Now, if memory serves me right, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now, if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a comic relief and stupid (or so it seemed to me). I mean, how do you explain all of his lines? My all time favorite line of his in this movie called was "It's been a long time coming". IT'S OK????????? The funniest thing about this line was that no more than five minutes before he said that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the dead children about how the scarecrow of the dam could not be killed. So if he knows about it, why the hell would he start trying to fight it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that sees him). As I said before, it must have been the comic relief, except that I do not think your UFC friends are laughing. <br /> <br /> Now that I've finished it deserved a paragraph for the movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I admit that I can not remember many scenes, and that's no good considering I only watch the movie no more than fifteen minutes ago. So what I'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this movie: 1. Generally, when a horror movie monster has its own theme music, it is not heard by the victims or by the monster itself. So why did all the people involved in this movie were able to make this whistle pathetic? I mean, I saw the face of the scarecrows and nothing about it said he was a whistling type. <br /> <br /> 2. Why the hell were there murders on a beach? I'm sorry but threw away the beaches of history are associated with party time and holiday type feelings. But I think this horror movie thought it would be such a success that it would change all that. Also, it was me or the beach seemed to be the size of a living room. I mean, every time an actor or actress was running down the beach, it felt like they were running in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl running in gray pants. This really bothers during the duration of this movie. I mean, she looks so ridiculous. Besides, it did not help at all that she seemed to be the youngest of the whole group. I mean what she was like twelve or something. There's no excuse for anyone being so skinny on the camera. I mean, the camera does not add ten pounds or so, so what was her excuse? <br /> <br /> 4. People trying to get offers to record on the camera. Just when I thought this movie could not have any cheesier, it comes out what I want to be Gorth Brooks and oh man was he lame. I do not remember the whole scene, but as far as I remember it was not pretty. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I have nothing to do with what is happening in the movie. The funniest part of the whole thing is how everyone seems to enjoy it. I mean, the only person who really does not know how to react to this is the "symbolic negation." And that is sad because, if I am not mistaken, it was he who encouraged this last addition of the American Idoal. But here's where it gets funny. While this guy is all in his new song or whatever. From afar, we see either the villain is known as the scarecrow. And man, he seems puzzled by it. I mean, there's a moment when he looks like he's envious of this guy. So what he does about that jealousy, well, I'm glad you ask. He waits for the guy to finish his song, and then he completes the guy. I do not want to give the scene of death, but I can tell you this. If this scene does not make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was longer than I expected. And it did not help that they try to pull some pathetic bulls at the end to extract another 10 minutes of the film. I mean, I admit, I did not see the turnaround coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that I was waiting for the movie to end and end. But they did not have to make them cheer. Needless to say when I say come, I just turned off the TV and said f ** k this, there is no way the movie could have gotten any worse. Thanks to my quick judgment, I can say that I will never know what would happen next. But I promise I do not care !!!!!!!!!!!!! All and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please do not buy. Just overdo it for one of your friends and watch it at the extension.
