Andy Milligan, New York's independent filmmaker, directs this little "treat" as his version of the Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney cuts the throats of customers in her barbershop and her cohort, Mrs. Lovett, turn them into meat pies. Thankfuly I was well informed of the plot before seeing this transvestite movie. Milligan, for my money, has to be really the leader of the worst directors ever. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles by comparison. This movie is so bad in so many ways. Let's take the direction of Milligan for beginners. The quality of the film is grainy. Sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan were using a camcorder to shoot. Credits say "Photographed and directed by Andy Milligan". Does he want to take credit for ceilings appearing after a death scene? How about the atrocious musical track selected for the movie? The film is cut with one bad transition after another. Little logic is used in plot creation. The story has little to do with Todd's real legend. The murder scenes are plentiful, but not horrible at all. Hands, legs and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the edit was made: choppily! And let's get the brisket on the pizza scene. Yeah, it's there. Did the pie maker not know that a whole breast with a nipple filled a whole pie crust? Later, we heard from our characters that they "were careful not to get caught" by the more than 200 murders they did. Obviously, they are a couple of breasts not able to keep up with what is happening (sorry, it was very tempting). The actors are not terribly bad to be honest. Some even have glimpses of talent, and all appear to be genuinely English articles. Many non-erotic nudity scenes are forced everywhere. Milligan apparently has some problems with sex. Plot lines are left untied. The ending is almost impossible to receive due to poor camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like anything about the movie? There is not much to be honest. I have a high level of acceptance of such films in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film has no real purpose other than being rude and ill.
