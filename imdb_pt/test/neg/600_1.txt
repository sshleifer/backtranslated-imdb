This film is basically a poor version of the old urban legend of the nanny who receives phone calls asking her to check the children, she calls the police who track the calls and finds there coming from inside the house. when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little boy could have written. There is not much suspense, it is clear who the killer is in the middle of the movie. in the beginning, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a fetish scene from a porn site or something. What is up with that? the film is as typical of slasher with a plot as original as a Beatles show. even by the low budget slasher standards is tacky. Do not waste your time on this. nuff said
