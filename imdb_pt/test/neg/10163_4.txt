John Wayne is undoubtedly one of the most popular and beloved actors of all time. His career spanned over forty years, and in that period he starred in films such as "Angel and the Evil Man," "The Green Berets," "Iwo Jima Sands," "Rio Bravo," "North to Alaska," and "The Undefeated." <br /> <br /> The films listed above are acclaimed as some of their best, unlike the 1934 Randy Rides Alone effort, which has been largely forgotten over time, which is not surprising, as it is not is nothing memorable beyond its very short runtime of just 53 minutes. <br /> <br /> A young John Wayne plays Randy Bowers, who for reasons never explained, arrives in a hall in the middle of nowhere and discovers that everyone inside has been killed. As he looks around, a pack arrives and finds Randy there and they arrest him, accusing him of being a gang member and demand to know where the rest of his gang is. He's arrested because of the murders. Sally Rogers, whose uncle owned the bar and was murdered, arrives in jail to see Randy in order to clarify that he was one of the gang members (she was hiding in a secret room when the shooting occurred). Sally does not believe Randy is a killer, and does not recognize him, so while the sheriff is away, she gives him the keys and Randy escapes. While fleeing from the sheriff and his pack, Randy conveniently stumbles upon the gang's hideout in a cave that was responsible for the murders. Randy tries to clear his name and also bring the gang to justice. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" can be a fun movie to watch, especially if you're John Wayne's fan. But at the same time, there are many failures that are impossible to ignore. The film is also extremely dated, as you'd expect; we have the bad footage from the camera, which makes everyone seem to be moving in super fast movements, and the dialogue is terrible. The acting is not big either, and Wayne's character is a lot of wood and he, along with the rest of the cast, looks like wooden figures being led by someone (in this case, by director Harry Fraser). Harry Fraser is in charge and does a good job, but the story is paper thin. One can not help feeling that it's been about ten minutes since the beginning of the film, because Randy has just arrived from nowhere in the hall and wants to meet someone. An explanation as to why Randy was there is giving later, which ends up being something like he's a P. who was sent to investigate allegations that someone is trying to dominate the town. To be honest, I did not really get it, most of the time I expected the movie to end. <br /> <br /> But, having said that, I did not find this movie quite awful. I liked some and found it a lot of fun sometimes. But it really is not a great movie, and it really is not worth watching or crawling. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Randy Rides Alone" is unbelievably old-fashioned and is a tiring western with few redeeming qualities. It can be fun, but overall it's not a great movie and it's certainly one of Wayne's weaker rides.
