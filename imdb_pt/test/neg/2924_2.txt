The most notable thing about "Talk Radio" is how bad it is. All the voices of the callers have a false ring, reading a script for them. One night with an annoying speaker at a Dallas radio station is told in the rush of a Sartrean glimpse into Hell. Stone attempts an existential revelation and receives unintentional comedy. Whenever an interlocutor makes an "empty" (empty) spot on something, Stone pushes the camera to the face of his character while he is hit by some traumatic accomplishment that is never revealed to the public. Bogosian overacts throughout one of the most annoying performances ever smeared on celluloid. Classic underrated? Give me some time.
