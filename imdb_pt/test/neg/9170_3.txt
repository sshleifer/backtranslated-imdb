Essentially, this is a terrible movie, with some features that may or may not be redeemed for you, depending on how much you want. In "opening" The Red Green Show for the big screen, the filmmakers dismissed the carefully crafted rustic charm over a decade-long set of episodes set in and around the Possum Lodge in favor of a road movie gently photographed with a horrible faux-Hollywood "big" soundtrack and deeply annoying storyline that is not embellished with good jokes to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the TV series. Having invented a plot that keeps most Possum Lodge members off the screen for most of the movie and requires that virtually everyone involved be despicable mean to the lovely Harold (who is the hero of film, the normally affable Crunchy Red being relegated to this incarnation to nothing more than the role of Harold Abuser, the only artists who really shone are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who deliver satisfactorily large-screen versions of their characters of small screen.
