I really like certain things about this game. I loved the first person perspective and wish we had that choice in the first three games. There's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. The graphics really were not bad, but I would like to have more things to interact with, even if it's just a shooter. The music was good. The things I hated were: the kind of sucking and pointing movement was a total pain. The story was too lame for words and much of the same old thing without any originality. The inability to save was awful !!! Some of us have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. I thought guns were crap too. This game is fun for some time but it's nothing like the top three and it's only good if you just want to film things. I recommend for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. Play at your own risk.
