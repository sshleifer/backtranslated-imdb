I'm sorry, but honestly I can not see why anyone would really like it. It's stereotypical and REAL homeschoolers are nothing like they were at this show !! Personally I'm glad it was canceled after the first few episodes. I mean, this kind of show would certainly be okay if everyone knew that homeschoolers were not like that, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of it. If someone out there who saw this really believed that this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then I sincerely feel sorry for them. It reminds me of the kind of portrait they have of homegrown children in "Bad Girls." It's sad, really, that people think so. That's complete junk, IMHO.
