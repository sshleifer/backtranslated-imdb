Some enlightening comments are in order. Herschell Gordon Lewis contributed a brief introduction to the video release of DOCTOR GORE (aka THE BODY SHOP), in which he mentioned his collaborative efforts with J.G. "Pat" Patterson, director and star of DOCTOR GORE. Patterson invented the "bloody effects" for THE GROSSOME TWOSOME and a few other Lewis films in the late 1960s. Lewis notes that while 2,000 MANIACS was a five-gallon film (referring to the amount of blood needed on stage), productions of Lewis-Patterson were portraits of "fifteen gallons". Lewis does not describe DOCTOR GORE as a "fifteen-gallon" movie - he's just talking about the films he and Patterson did together. Lewis confessed (elsewhere) that his introduction to DOCTOR GORE was improvised even before he saw Patterson's movie! Then, take it with a grain of salt. <br /> <br /> This may be an "unfinished" movie, but like some unfinished novels, it has an "end". You are missing just some connective tissue. <br /> <br /> Patterson has a definite stage presence and a dry sense of humor, helping to make this simplistic show a little more watchable than it should be. There is an extremely misaligned storyline - even BLOOD FEAST is more complex - and a repetitive soundtrack by William Girdler. A little bit of nudity and a lot of skin. The entire middle section of the film involves building a "perfect woman"; this is concentrated to the bloodthirsty and laughable. <br /> <br /> Patterson, the director, is going over his head, but he struggles to tell his story creatively if it is possible to use Frankenstein's cliches creatively. But the best reason to see this movie (on the Something Weird DVD if possible) is that it features a perfect Nashville thriller, "A Heart Dies Every Minute" by Bill Hicks. Not the truth!
