I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is easily the worst movie I've seen in 10 years, and I see my share of movies. A stinky one. This is a bad idea for a movie, poorly executed. Nothing is funny, credible or interesting. I was looking for wit, irony and genuine humor. Instead, it seemed that most cast members wandered the set to do Tea Leoni a favor. It's too bad that actor talent was wasted in such an emptiness. Do not bother yourself. I have to ask myself what opinion the producers of this film have of the audience to subject them to the idea of ​​Polish gangsters in Buffalo, NY, sending a hired assassin to San Francisco to become a mortuary attendant while attending AA meetings. Bill Pullman should start reading the scripts before agreeing to participate in a movie. Sad.
