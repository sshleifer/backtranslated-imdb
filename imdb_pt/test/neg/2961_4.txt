I've seen Shallow Grave years ago, and * that * was one of those movies that I kept in my memory for a long time. It was intense from start to finish and with many sudden twists. But that all made sense. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same about Dead Bodies. Above the title there is a caption that says it is "better than the Shallow Tomb". This is a big lie. <br /> <br /> Dead Bodies lose strength and become much less convincing during the movie. <br /> <br /> Two supporting characters, for example, end up being far less innocent. than they seemed to be. That might be a surprise, but it did not surprise me. I could see this coming minutes before, and * this * is a big difference with Shallow Grave. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have to mention is that the characters in this movie are usually not very realistic. They behave this way more often when the movie comes to an end. <br /> <br /> I would have found it much more interesting if some of the characters were completely innocent without knowing what is happening. It would have been better for the contrast with, for example, Tommy and his friend who have to carry a huge secret with them. <br /> <br /> But no, for some stupid reason that the creators of this movie decided that all characters should show their darker sides. It does not work on a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The end seemed a lot with an open end. It left me feeling unsatisfied. I expected a lot more from that. <br /> <br /> At first I would have given this movie six stars because it is not a bad movie. I enjoyed watching. Mostly. <br /> <br /> But occasionally I've seen very bad acting and unrealistic scenes and, because of the disappointing open end, I get four stars this time around. And because it ended up being a mistake I spent my time and money on it. Unlike Shallow Grave, I'll probably forget Dead Bodies very soon. It's not just such a special movie. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers could have done a much better job with this movie. It's a shame they did not.
