With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, I do not think Shakespeare is in great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy that was devoid of rights. Your stuff has been taken and it really bothers you. He seems to know who is doing it, despite being a revolving and delirious entity. I loved the two dull men telling the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard, full of cheap crosses and other crap. There is a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can not begin to reproduce the idiocy of this, including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door beside him so he can crawl) to the robot, a mass of metal cans with a face inside. The dialogue is horrible. There are long pauses between the speeches as if someone off the stage were feeding their lines. I love the scene where the two young children accuse the mother of going out at night (she goes into that zombie state or something). However, if you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at and never take seriously, watch this. Have a couple of beers first. Like a direct line from the mummy's tomb, "Watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will smell bad." What else can I say?
