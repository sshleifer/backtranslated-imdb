It is disappointing to see such a talented actor as Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he was beyond sensational in BLACK (which I recommend). One line in the film states: "Sakar is not a mere man, he is a thought and a philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma credits THE GODFATHER as an inspiration for this film, and maybe that's the problem. It looks like a very mistreated American movie in India. The Left Elbow Index considers seven elements of film production - acting, continuity, plot, character development, dialogue, art, and production sets - on a scale of 10 to 1 low, with 5 data as the average score. The continuity of the film seems high, an 8, keeping a violent tone infused with drama in places, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotion related to the evil of organized crime. The acting rates to 4, seems very weak, even when someone is being beaten or murdered, it seems hoohum. For example, when a character is shot in the forehead, I wonder if, or when, he would fall. He does not, and ala Ronald Reagan he is put in a car, with bleeding face packed winged John F. Kennedy. The plot ranks a 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism, with a family-oriented Robinhood in its head. The character development seems static, and the characters look like chess pieces on an abandoned chessboard, thus earning a rating of 3. The dialogue seems flushed and seems to be forced to fit into some Bowery speech pattern - a 4 for the dialogue. The production sets seem to be below average - a 4. And the art is intriguing, with lots of close-ups, very fast panning and lots of group scenes in which the actors seem to be rehearsed - a 3. For me too much movement camera is disruptive. The average of the Left Elbow Index is 4.4, and with a slight deduction based on poor drift, it drops to a 4. Four questions arise continuously in the film: one, why so many people eat so often: and, two, India does not have its own brand of organized crime? So movies need to rely so much on Western cultural examples? As much as I like Amitabh Bachchan, I can not recommend this movie.
