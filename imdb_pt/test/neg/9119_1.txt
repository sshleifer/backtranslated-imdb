Were it not for the fact that this came as a set of 2 DVDs paired with the original American Graffiti; If it were not for the fact that I'd been here in Iraq for several months and at this point watching pretty much anything, I would have thrown this movie in the trash after the first ten minutes. This movie was terribly bad on so many levels that I just do not know where to start. He acted badly, shot, directed, wrote, scored, edited. My 9-year-old daughter's first forays into the movies are superior to this - and she was filming the sleeping dog. (Come to think of it, I give this piece of cinematography 9 stars. But I'm biased.) If you even have the slightest appreciation for producing quality movies, then avoid that piece of junk at all costs. No character in this movie has a single quality save for the Icelandic girl who does not even have a single line in English. I will not waste any more of my time describing what a bad movie is.
