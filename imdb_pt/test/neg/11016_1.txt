I'm glad I did not pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. <br /> <br /> I sat there waiting for something original and / or funny to happen. <br /> <br /> It reminded me a lot of those predictable English comedies of the 70s. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with a plot synopsis, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes. > <br />
