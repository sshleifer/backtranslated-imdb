I got this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. However, as it is supposed to be an action movie, I can not give more stars, since the mood was not intentional. Chuck Norris plays a truck driver who arrives from the road to see his family, and in the first five minutes, the conflict arises that leads Chuck to seek revenge for the rest of the film. Good thing too, because the sub-par of acting all involved was beginning to age very fast. Actually, the judge was very good, but I can not describe what makes him work, you're going to have to take a look for yourself. <br /> <br /> And Van Chuck Norris's car is horribly classic!
