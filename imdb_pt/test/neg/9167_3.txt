Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are swing bachelors planning to kidnap a casino, "Ocean's 11" wing, and fix it on Hell's Angels. Bad move. For a movie with the words Hell's Angels And number 69 And with the true Hell's Angels, this movie is surprisingly tame. Hell's Angels really deserve a better movie to center around them. It's not that snoorefest. Fortunately, this is one of the DVDs that features comments from Joe Bob Briggs, so the pain of having to sit is greatly relieved. If you watch it differently, let me recommend something to you. NOT !! <br /> <br /> My Notes: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Joe Bob Brigg Commentary; Conny Van Dyke's message to her fans (she has more than one?); Photo gallery; Theatrical Trailer; and trailers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
