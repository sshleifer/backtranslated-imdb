The beginning of this film made me doubt that it would be little more than a typical science fiction film of B. But as I progressed, I started to get interested and saw the whole thing go by. The premise is interesting, original and has the function of making a classic. Unfortunately, instead, a mediocre movie ended, made by the usual factors that turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad acting, low budget, etc.). I'm interested to see how this would happen if it were remade with good actors and a big Hollywood budget.
