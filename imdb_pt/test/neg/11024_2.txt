Unlucky, molly-coddled, self-pity, bad provider Jimmy Stewart is having a bad marriage with Carole Lombard. After falling into difficult times, he faces a humiliating job, a passive-aggressive, over-supportive, hopeless mother desperately in need of an epic attack, and a baby who cries unceasingly. The film cuts through failure and misery without a perceptible end. Do you want to see a couple quarrel with their mother for ninety minutes? Many scenes feature a screaming baby. The movie fails to elucidate why we would want to support the mother of hell, or why Jimmy Stewart can not cultivate a pair. Who wanted to see this? Who wanted to see Stewart and Lombard without laughter or charm? <br /> <br /> It's absolutely depressing and unbearable.
