Having avoided seeing the movie at the movies, but buying my wife's DVD for Christmas, I had to watch. I did not expect too much, which usually means that I get more than I expected. But 'Mamma Mia' - total, total cr **. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this movie is just terrible. The stage show sounds a bit musical, but this run along with the songs accompanying hastily, uncharacteristically, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras of the DVD) are simply thrown away with only half of the bodies ever on the screen, the Northern European dance chorus appears on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the 1960s! Meryl (see me, I'm acting) Streep can not even do her usual assault on an over-the-top musical! Her big piece - 'The Winner Takes It All' - is Meryl no Met! Note to the director - should have been photographed quietly with the camera gradually showing the growing distance between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the songs are a horrible karaoke on amateur night. The camera can not stop moving as bad MTV. You can never settle down and just enjoy the music, the enthusiasm and the characters. But what's even worse is how this spoiled piece of excre **** has become the highest grossing film in the UK and the best-selling DVD? Blair, Campbell and New Labor really reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties, anyone ???
