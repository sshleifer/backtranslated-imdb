A horrible B movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge anyone who is a fan of "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" to count how many times almost entire lines or sequences have been ripped from the first two Alien movies to make this classic piece of junk. <br /> <br /> Cast members like R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two talented actors and the protagonist "Jack Scalia" was actually absolutely horrible. I think they threw him to his massive cracked chin. I was also annoyed with the stereotype of the only black man on the set John Toles-Bey, who should look at this movie and just imagine. Look at it at some point, since it made many interesting films. <br /> <br /> But in this film: The script, as I said earlier, was an Aliens scam, which changed the subject and turned into a submarine "thriller." It included such phrases as "I have a bad feeling about it" and "Kill me" when a team member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly begins to make the "alien jump" just before it leaves the stomach. There's also a rip-off of the classic "get some!" via Bill Paxton. We also have a lot of navy grunts running through caves with crawling crawls coming out of the walls. Even the explosions of the mutant creatures are very much like the bursting of aliens while they carry Marines in the movie "Aliens." And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood). There are many other important examples. So, if you want to see this script done well, watch the first two classics, Alien and Aliens (with Sigourney Weaver). You will have a more pleasant time. <br /> <br /> The plot could have been interesting and made better if it were not for confusing sequences at the beginning of the movie and generally bad editing. The camera photos were pretty boring and honestly it was not too difficult to stop watching and walk around the room to grab a snack or check the email. Many of the interactions between the characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not. The entire command structure between crew and captain was poorly made. I'm not even sure if there are captains in the military who have full control over nuclear submarines. In general, this only shows that there was little research for basic information to make the film seem at least a little respectable and there are many other similar examples (such as depth of dive etc.). <br /> <br /> If you like horrible movies or are a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head then this movie might be for you. As for me this is coming back to the shelf ... permanently.
