Steven Seagal has played in many action movies. Most of them were bad, but not bad like the Patriot. This is a low budget action movie from the Z series. After Operation Delta Force, War Act, Substitute 2, The Plato Corridor, The Base, Directing, Sabotage, etc., comes The Patriot. Now Steven Seagal is certainly considered a bad actor like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scene was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (maybe because of the really bad actors) and the $ 4.25 that you spend renting The Patriot is called Lost Money !!! I give 0and and a half (for laughs) of 5.
