I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 and this movie was too much for me. I could not imagine having a teenager, preteen or (especially) a kid for this movie. It was rude and offensive. I was totally fooled by his PG-13 rating and the previous ones I had seen for him. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought it looked pretty cute (maybe I did not remember the preview correctly). In addition, Drake Bell (the film's main character) stars in a Nickelodeon television show that attacks pre-teens and young teenagers. I really did not think the content of the movie would be as risky as it was. I should have done more research on this before going. However, I hope parents read this movie before taking their kids to see it just because it has the Drake Bell. <br /> <br /> Seriously, DO NOT bring your kids or teens to see. This movie. The rating should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, drug references and disturbing events throughout the film. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes involving men grabbing the breasts of women, a lot of words, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla cover (or something like that), people are stabbed, bruised and bruised film , and an elderly lady and her dog are undone. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the film. It was really humiliating for women in general. The movie belongs to the people who made the Scary Movie series, so that should tell you something right there. Please remember that watching movies like this can offer children and teenagers all sorts of misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and teenagers can not decipher between parodies or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the mood that was in this movie is typical of its genre. But I think the possibility of children and adolescents see this movie HORRIFYING. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the film, I do not think it was so original or funny. He dragged on parts and a little humor was just stressed and painful. The acting was not too bad considering how bad the screenplay was. If you are an adult or older teenager looking for a funny movie, skip this one or rent it out.
