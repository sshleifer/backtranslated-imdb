No matter what you've heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It's not worth the investment of more than two hours to watch stereotypically disturbed teenagers dancing, singing, learning and staring at girls in the changing rooms. <br /> <br /> Every clich√© finds a cozy little house in this movie. There is a gay teenager looking for acceptance. That would have been great if it had been treated as something more than a secondary point in the plot. There's a ghetto kid who has a lot of attitude - what, I was surprised? And guess what? They all want to become great stars, find fame and fortune, and everyone would be willing to crawl over the corpses of their own mothers to pick it up. <br /> <br /> Oddly, this movie is remembered for its music. But in fact, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still very tacky to be of any real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing, either. "Fame" is a nonsense buff drowned by the spectacle of a huge dance scene in the streets. And "I sing the electric body" (what on Bubba's behalf does that mean? !!!!!!?!) It's just an incomprehensible joke. Bad acting, insipid dialogue and hacking (after all, it's from the director of "Evita") are only marginally aided by Michael Seresin's appropriately ordinary camera work. But cinematography alone can not carry a movie, especially one so uninspiring and meaningless as that.
