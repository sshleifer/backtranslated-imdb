Rarely have I seen a work of literature translated so poorly for the canvas. The hysterical cast of extras from movies and comedies simply makes the characters look like bad Jewish stereotypes. Worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, who you hate in the first scene and never develops any sympathy for her. Presentations like this must be observed and used against actors who wish to work again. All in all, a weak, low budget TV movie of the kind that gives TV movies a bad name.
