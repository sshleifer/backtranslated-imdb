I actually saw this movie in a movie theater. At the time, I was working shifts and went there during a matinee on a hot summer day when I could not sleep. The movie theater had air conditioning. <br /> <br /> It was an initial multi-screen complex and somehow got in the wrong place. I intended to nap with something else. But as things happened, there would be no sleep. Soon after the wrong movie began, I was also baffled by a group of janitors who came in and used it as a social club. I was the only other person there, and it is a measure of the appeal of the film that they usually expected the place to be empty and ask me if I cared about their presence. <br /> <br /> In about half an hour, the cleaners' conversation proved to be more interesting than the entertainment I had paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie leaked from the screen with the mayonnaise cheesiness very obsolete. The type that has tiny dark, hairy tufts growing on the surface. I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident strings of music that sounded with very little warning and even less meaning. The janitors provided an anticipatory clue as they put their fingers to their ears. <br /> <br /> It was about some city bird dwelling on the sticks among a burden of a backwoods people, putting them straight, but at the same time being taught a moral lesson or two herself. How do you do. A kind of "journey of discovery". There was a feigned presumption about the whole production. In particular, the leading actress had an irritating habit of facing each countrywoman with a kind of intense beatific compassion, as if she herself were the patron saint of deer. <br /> <br /> And I believe that at some point she wrote a book. Long before the end, I was fascinated by a hurried, panting tail of sexual impropriety. <br /> <br /> We suspect that there are some for whom to sit in silence for a few hours and not have to think, constitutes a meditation. The best I can say is that I would not want to share their salad. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this movie be advertised as appearing on television, which surprises me. It's exactly the kind of paparazzi that is shown in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs. <br /> <br /> If you work in shifts, be sure to get into the right theater. Or wait for some cleaners.
