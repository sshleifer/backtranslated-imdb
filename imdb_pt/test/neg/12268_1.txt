this movie is the one that belongs to the cutting room floor. On the one hand, the opening sequence does not present the gang element related element. If it was not, then at least they got it right. Secondly ... what's with all the looks to the left and then to the right? they even do it in synchronous style. Nowhere have I witnessed a member of a rival team walking up to a bar, looking for someone from the outside looking like he's all this and a bag of chips in a barbie and leaving without even being confronted and much less' . I lost money with the rental price and am glad I did not buy the DVD itself. <br /> <br /> If this was done by college students (T.A.F.E), then at least they gave the old Aussie attempt. Better luck next time.
