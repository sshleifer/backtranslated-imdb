I do not recommend that you watch this movie if you get offended easily. I do not even get offended easily and this movie made me frustrated. It's so disgusting. And that does not make sense. The whole thing on the internet is so clich√©d, and the producer obviously did not understand all the "rules of the internet". When you talk to someone, you CAN track their IP address. Same? (see the sarcasm here). It was stupid. Meaningless. And I did not even watch it at the end. I could always say "this does not make sense, that's not ..." This movie sucks at its best. Good comment right?
