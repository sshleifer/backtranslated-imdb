Telly Savalas is the Mexican revolutionary (although he was chosen by Chuck Connors as a military soldier) in this fun and boring pastiche on the life and time of the famous historical figure. An earlier attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-starring Robert Mitchcum, dealt with these events more soberly and on a larger scale. As such, the PANCHO VILLA is a typical European venture too and without distinction, despite its credentials; the end result is more often silly than fun - although a few moments, most notably the action scenes and a scene involving a fight inside a church, offer a little pleasure. Oh, and Savalas can even sing the final titles!
