I went to see this movie today, hoping that this would involve a story at least kind of clever. I was extremely disappointed, as this did not happen. The plot and the decisions of the main character were so improbable. I was hoping for a "Dog Day Afternoon" movie, but instead I got something totally unacceptable. I actually found myself fully expecting the "hero" to be overthrown, and I almost left the theater several times when this should have happened, but it did not. Assault movies are not meant to be good, and this tried to be just that. Every two minutes during the second half of the movie, I saw myself saying "no way". Without leaving the whole story aside, it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out, and whose house was running. He was invited in a robbery, and accepted, only to retreat once the action began. Weak.
