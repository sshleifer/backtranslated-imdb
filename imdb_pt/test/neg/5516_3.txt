This hardly compares to the space adventures of his time. Those being Star Wars and Star Trek. And while I'm not a Star Trek fan, I recognize that this movie pales in comparison to the Trekkies series. In fact, I would put back into the future in better light in terms of space and travel. <br /> <br /> The story is of a boy who is captured by space invaders (pirates). In an obviously fake and unsuspecting battle, the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, these invaders die. In the end, the boy is able to return home and the last pirates are seriously injured. <br /> <br /> The acting was not so good. But what is really obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogues, effects and plots. How they got to 80 minutes of this is beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you want to take a look at this because it involves space, go ahead. But be warned. "D"
