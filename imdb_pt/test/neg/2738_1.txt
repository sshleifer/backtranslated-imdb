The script for this film is indistinguishable from others, most notably The Core, another bad movie. It is quite clear why Luke Perry does not have much work, but seeing the beloved Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) resigned to something like that is simply sad. <br /> <br /> I really can not think of a twist in history that is not seen a mile away. This is not an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very bad, even for TV standards. The lava flow at the beginning of the film signaling the oncoming global disaster starts things on a very amateur level. And it does not get any better from that point on.
