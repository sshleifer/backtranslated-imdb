This time, The Beastmaster (Marc Singer) returns only to face a new enemy Arklon (Wings Hauser), however, due to an annoying teenager (Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future, where they then fight. Many (lame) fish out of water jokes follow. You honestly can not get such rotten sequels at the core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to watch. The references and "hipness" date the movie wrong (this was done in 1991) and really who wants to see the Beastmaster in the present times? Also noteworthy is the embarrassing performance of the Hauser Wings, which is easily the best asset of the movie. Singer seems clumsy, Wuher is annoying and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie absolutely incontestable. This is easily one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (Awful)
