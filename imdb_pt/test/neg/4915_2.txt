What movie is this ??? A horrible movie with the old annoying concept of infidelity that has already been achieved by "Bhatt's camp." The film stars EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The movie has "No Base". That's right ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich mansion. However Dino does not like Udita to heart as he just wants his wealth. He loves another person (Tara Sharma). Then he bribes Emraan to have an affair with Udita so he could pick them up and finally separate from Udita .. AS CRYING !! However, Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita is arrested for killing Emraan, Dino attempts, presumably, to save her by showing his false love to her. Udita, on the other hand, does not understand this and feels that she truly loved her. So she lends all her wealth to Dino. Finally Dino leaves the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What fraud !! The songs are good and are the only good thing in the movie. Now individual ratings: (Out of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 General Performance: * 1/2 Direction: * * History: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final Rating : * 1/2 Poor performances and bad cast ....... Music: Good ... I evaluate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (do not waste your time !!!!)
