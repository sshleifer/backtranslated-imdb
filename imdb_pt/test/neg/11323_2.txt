Tough and tiring, the one liners almost made me cry. My 4 years left the room and ended up making a puzzle. I do not know for what age group this was written, but the writer himself did not even want credit. As for music, it's slightly fun. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen a few times more than that, they are still nice. Whenever this happens, I try to encourage my son to watch something else. One positive note, which allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. That would have been encouraging if someone had been watching.
