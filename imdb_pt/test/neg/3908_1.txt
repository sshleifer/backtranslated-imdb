About five years ago, my friend and I went to the video store to buy something to watch. My friend saw Space Truckers on the shelf, and we did it. When we got home and started watching it, we realized what an absolute mess! A can of beer floating in space? A guy taking a dump in a bathroom? A guy with a mechanical cock trying to wake up a woman saying "Whizz, whiz!" WTF !!! The stupidest piece of junk, idiot, retarded and horribly throne that my eyes have ever been exposed to. My friend and I still refer to him as the worst movie we have ever seen. Just another movie came close to his shit (and that would be Jackie Chan's stupid movie, "The Medalion"). If your eyes see this piece of garbage on your shelf, do the following: 1. Take it off the shelf and throw it on the floor. 2. Step on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. Continue to set it on fire in a contained installation (toilet box). 4. Lastly, take it immediately to your local hazardous waste management facility so that it can be properly treated. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM "TRUCKS-SPACES" !!!!!!!!
