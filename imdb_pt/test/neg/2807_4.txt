As mentioned before in other comments, the biggest problem of the NVA is that it can not decide what it wants to be, the cheapest type or an honest parody of the East German Army. There are a couple of moments that are quite touching, for example, when one of the recruits returns from the army prison in Schwedt with a completely broken personality. But in the end, Leander Hau√ümann seeks childish humor. No wonder the film failed at the German box office as it is historically false to the real situation in these training camps and led by an actor who unfortunately is unable to perform differently. <br /> <br /> Frank Griebe's camera job that - as always - does a wonderful job. If it were not for his beautiful pictures, I would have rated the film much worse.
