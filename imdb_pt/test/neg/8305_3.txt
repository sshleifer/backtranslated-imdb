Low budget but still scary enough to keep your interest in another take off on Frankenstein's family history. This film is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The seductive Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay) newly arrived medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still prepared for his old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by becoming a lover. This is closer to being a sinister melodrama than a horror movie. The supporting cast features Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. It's still a fun watch.
