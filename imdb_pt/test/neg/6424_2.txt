I know some people who look like the lead actress in this movie (or at least as the character she plays). They all give me shivers and I would be the last person to lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. She has a medium and ugly expression. If you can conjure up a little sympathy for her, let me know. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could have the same expressions of worry and fear if I had an imaginary friend who has been killing my real friends and acquaintances for the past 15 years. <br /> <br /> And to our European friends on IMDb, I'm sad to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the US teach courses on paranormal phenomena, relying on the pathetic defense that stands for "academic freedom" and research open. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth it. You will have no sympathy for any of the characters (except for Aunt Lydia, who is expelled very early) and the plot does not make sense.
