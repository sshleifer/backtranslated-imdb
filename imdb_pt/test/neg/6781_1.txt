One of the worst shows ever. The show would start with clever comments to each other that would be totally out of the norm and unnecessary. The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible of the bible, the evil girl, who are these actors ??? I've never heard of any of them except Cole, who was totally unbelievable in that part. Every time he opens his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids ..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. The stories were as unbelievable as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. Somehow, this show makes a slug like Ice-T more believable as a cop, and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded.
