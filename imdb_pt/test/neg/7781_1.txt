If you want a complete waste of time, because taking the lint from your belly button or cleaning the wax from your ears or grout the tile is your idea of ​​an exciting ride, then you will not want to miss this. On the one hand, forget the VHS cover. No body in this movie looks so attractive (ie the Indian girl). Someone commented that whoever posed for the cover is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> To put this into perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds into the movie, I knew I had been stolen. <br /> <br /> I finished watching because 1) I paid 99 cents after all and, 2) maybe there was a chance of some scene in that turkey worth more than a compressed loaf of bread. <br /> <br /> There was not. <br /> <br /> Good suffering, Fonda. I know you were hard for roles when you did it, but that's beneath you.
