The real star of the airport's last film is that great supersonic carrier created by the French called The Concorde. If you have in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle plane could do in the sky, then the whole movie makes sense. <br /> <br /> But if you're expecting some serious drama here, than by all means take part in the evasive action that the Concorde shows here when some nasty people try to overthrow it. <br /> <br /> Susan Blakely plays a television reporter who also happens to be the lover of the military. industrial tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's aides has just brought information about some of Wagner's dirty business, selling weapons to people who are not US friends. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed in front of her and she is almost ready for a killer from whom she escapes, of course she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course he denies it. But shortly before Blakely embarks on The Concorde, McCalman's widow, Kathleen Maguire, hands her the necessary documents. <br /> <br /> But on his way to Moscow with a parade in Paris, Wagner and his minions try to bring down the big bird. But the fearless team of Alain Delon, David Warner and George Kennedy is up to all his tricks. It's a full bag as you will see if you want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you absolutely will not mind the plot. It's like the movie Le Mans with Steve McQueen, who has a legion of motoring fans that have become a cult item. Maybe Le Mans is better at it because they just did not bother with any kind of story. Among the passengers, there is a marijuana-smoking saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker, a troubled mother accompanying a new heart to her. child, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye, a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the bathroom. She's really the best here. Robert Wagner must have been psychic because I'm sure that with the power of this film, he landed the number two role of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers series. /> <br /> I'm sure everyone interested have a great payday, but it seems to have killed the film saga of the Airport.
