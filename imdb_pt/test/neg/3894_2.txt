I've seen this movie twice, once a few years ago in college and again this past weekend. Although I despised it the first time, I decided to give it another try. Terrence Malick is clearly a respected director, and it seems that IMDb viewers at least think well of the movie. But unfortunately, it seems my tastes have not changed at all. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? For one thing, Linda Manz's narration is awful. Your voice is so annoying with that horrible New Yorker accent (please do not try to convince me that Chicagoans talk like this - they do not). She herself admitted to just sitting and talking about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. She's not even acting! I arrived at IMDb expecting to see it torn apart, since its performance is so ridiculous, but people really seemed to like it! She's simply unpleasant in every way - I kept waiting for Malick to simply kill her. <br /> <br /> The other actors were fine, but certainly nothing special. Adams was probably the strongest of the cast, but she also had the only decent part. Except the old man - he was very good. Speaking of acting, how could Shepard's character be ridiculously stupid? He bought the "brother and sister" act because ... uh, why would he buy it? Bill and Abby took every opportunity to be sensible, as if they did not realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. It was completely unbelievable. And finally, after a considerable amount of time, the farmer suddenly realizes that, "Oh my god, they are together!" So he goes after Bill with a gun, but seems to stumble into Bill's hand and ends up with a deadly wound. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which, the fate of the characters was equally stupid (and, dare I say, lazy). Of course Bill has to die - could it be more annoying than being shot in a lake by a bunch of cops? Abby continues her happy life, taking a train and feeling very pleased with the way things worked out. And the annoying narrator randomly finds his imbecile friend and they wander into the sunset. But that's okay, because Malick never gave me any reason to worry about the characters anyway. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, this movie trails endlessly without twists or real development. I can not believe it's only 94 minutes long - I could swear I was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours. The sudden disaster of the locust was like throwing the Bible in my face; I am totally fine with metaphors and allusions, but this has been completely exaggerated. Clearly the message was, "Do not marry for money or bad things will happen to you." Very original. <br /> <br /> I understand that "Days of Heaven," like all of Terrence Malick's films, is a work of art. And I will certainly agree that cinematography is simply stunning, and magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film. But I need more than beautiful photos to enjoy a movie, and that was not enough for me.
