A mysterious and terminally dark suspense, which may sound theoretically beautiful, but performs very poorly. The ridiculous script is full of people (MINOR SPOILER) dying and then coming back to life when the plot demands, and the director does not seem to get energy and suspense. The sticky sequence that kind of "explains" the title of the movie is the only memorable half in this tiring movie. (* 1/2)
