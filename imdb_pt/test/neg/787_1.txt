This is my first criticism of the movie, and probably the first time I wrote a movie I did on my own - not for some class task. I think only the fact says something about this movie ... it's not a good thing! I'm not an experienced journalist or critic (although I've seen my fair share of films), but I found this film so painful to watch, it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent on the experience. Where better to do this than the IMDb? As I forced myself to sit on the film, physically squirming at the inability to connect the dots, I was sure there would be some "light at the end of the tunnel" - a revelation to explain what was happening at the same time. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as the dog. After several setbacks to review certain scenes, I have not been able to conclude anything sensible. I found myself wanting to scream "Does that make sense to anyone?" I would recommend not to waste your time, but then again, if I were you, I would probably like to experience it myself. If that's the case, bring a crossword puzzle or something so you do not get bored.
