Simply put, I was incredibly disappointed. I'm a big fan of the Asian Horror, and I can watch the lack of originality (I liked "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but that was just plain bad. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of elements that are very high quality: photography is attractive, the visuals are cool, the direction is inspired, the acting is very good, the music is easy for the ears and the CGI is incredible. But since this is a horror movie, we are expected to be afraid, which will not happen with this movie. Like most South Korean horrors, this is not common almost from beginning to end: there is the female ghost of long-haired revenge, menacing clusters of thick black hair and puddles, and near the end, a twist that * almost *, but does not make much sense of the whole thing (the turnaround is easily one of the best qualities). And to the irritation of the viewer, when the film is not recycling (sometimes so accurate that could easily be nicknamed plagiarized) images of other movies, is making you skip. Very. And by leaps, I do not mean jumping things out or anything, just LOTS of loud noises and squeaks on the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air (there are even a few moments of "make you jump" which are simply annoying ). And when you're not ripping out other movies, it's boring and difficult to sit on. <br /> <br /> And it's a shame, because "Ryeong" could easily have been very good, and have everything to do. is good, but it's the overuse and irritating of loud and predictable noises that end up spoiling the movie. A perfect example of how good it could have been: there is a moment when one of the characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back. It's totally predictable, but the use of silence in this scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, this is as scary as the movie caught my eye. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, "Ryeong" has some good features, and even some jumps that are not so predictable, and work. There is a very good and sad story used to explain the events, and the change is quite unpredictable. These are the only things that separate the movie from any other Asian horror / horror movie. But the problem is that despite working, they've been used before (J-Horror fans will easily realize that the big revelation was inspired by "A Tale of Two Sisters"), and that the background story is good . fifty minutes to start. <br /> <br /> So in the end, "Ryong" really seems like a truly wasted opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped the turnaround in history and other good features would work as amusements so the public would not notice the huge flaws. But he failed, and well ... We noticed everything. My rating: 4/10.
