This story had the potential of a good movie. The difficult choice of love versus money and the anguish and regret of doing wrong. However, the film was ruined by Robert Redford's horrific mishmash as the villain who offered $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. Like Redford has to pay for it. Redford's youthful good looks and all American charm simply do not make him such a despicable and menacing barbarian. Redford's acting skills are insufficient to make his character menacing. I can see now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK tell the lady, but you'll have to give me some time to raise the money. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect as the sleazeball.
