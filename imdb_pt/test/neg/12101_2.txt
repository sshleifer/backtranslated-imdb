What a waste of energy and money. What a waste of talent. <br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez was completely wasted and almost all unused. Jon Lovitz was a lot of fun, but pointless. Harry Dean Stanton - why bother? And was it just me or Kari Wuhrer could hardly do that? <br /> <br /> The story was quite non-existent and very disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that took place. How do surfing "guys" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? How about you never saw surfing once !! The set-up for some scenes took a long time with not enough pay to make us give a shit. Nothing in this "movie" really seemed genuine or genuine. <br /> <br /> The only good things I can say is that some (very few) scenes were filmed well and some scenes were slightly interesting. I do not see that when there are so many nonsense movies out there.
