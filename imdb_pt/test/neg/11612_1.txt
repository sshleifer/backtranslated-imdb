The plot seemed fine, the actors looked good, the movie should be fine. But it sure was not - it did not get us anywhere, the scenes are strange. Maybe it was created to create something new, to make us think. At least this happened: Where is the rest of this movie? For me, it was a waste of money, time and talent. Someone may want to see this out of curiosity, to see if they can figure it out. Others I personally would not recommend this to anyone.
