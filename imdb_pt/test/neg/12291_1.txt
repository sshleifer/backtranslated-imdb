I'm sorry, but I can not understand what people were smoking when they wrote how big they thought "Ethan Mao" was. I've seen better acting, character and plot development on porn! WARNING: I'm going to give a key element to the "plot". After keeping his family hostage at night, Ethan lets his vicious, evil, and hated stepmother go to the bank - ALONE !!! - to retrieve the piece of jewelry from his mother that he wants so desperately. Guess what? She calls the police! Wow ... what a turnaround! I could not see this coming at all. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes. Pure, unadulterated garbage!
