Eight convicted teenagers are taken to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it as community service. They soon discover that it is the home of a burly psychopath (Kane) who has something to pull out and collect eyeballs. It does not help that the watcher (Steven Vidler) has had a previous confrontation with the beast four years earlier. <br /> <br /> A pleasure of mine is a horror movie. Most of them are poorly directed and acted, but still have some value of attraction and entertainment. See No Evil is a good example of this. It features atrocious writing and acting, but the death scenes are very good and the movie proves to be fun. The premise looks like a mix between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it did not work very well. It was really just a bunch of clich√©s and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan focused only on the scenes of death and apparently nothing more. The very scenes of death are good and horrible. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative deaths. <br /> <br /> The acting is very bland and bland. This is because all the characters are one-dimensional and we do not know much about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were so unpleasant. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was hoping his on-screen presence was more frightening, but he did not do a good job. A second rate from Jason Voorhees, if you want. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this movie is unlikely to help or hinder their careers. <br /> <br /> While the death scenes are bloody, they do not need to be scary. There's really no suspense just a few bloody scenes of death. Because of this, the film does not have much repeat value. Also, if you do not like horror movies, then do not waste your time on this one. It will do little to change your mind. In the end, See No Evil is a decent horror movie, but it's generic and forgettable so it's not worth watching. Overall Rating
