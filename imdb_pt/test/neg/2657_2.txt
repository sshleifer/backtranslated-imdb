Why do so "romantic" movies, which never get anywhere, always start (and probably end) with low-quality jazz? It's not smart and makes it look like a fucking TV movie. This movie was silly, slow, boring, unoriginal, wooden and I said annoying? <br/> <br/> Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and rude, but he was just a creepy cop who looked like we walked into the congresswoman's house as if everything was fine, when he behaved like a pervert - staring at Thomas with a perverted look, hardly ever minding to speak. <br /> <br /> And why on earth do they always get British? actors to put low quality accents - they are blown because they are famous, and everyone knows they are Brits exactly because they are famous!
