One Night at McCool's wants you to think it's a smart, witty comedy. It pushes its "quirky" characters and "outrageous" situations to the viewer as a crack dealer doing overtime. The premise is about a woman digging for gold, named Jewel, who dates men to get them to steal and sometimes murder, so she can have all the worldly possessions she desires so desperately. You know, that would not be a bad strategy if she pursued rich guys. This movie really wants someone to believe that a crook artist would waste time with bartenders and Andrew "Says" Clay. Please. This major flaw in Jewel's scheme is actually the only entertainment found in that stink (and this is not intentional). Noting this, it's not hard to believe that there might have been a good movie somewhere. One Night at McCool's could not decide which direction he wanted to take, so he just sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. He tries to be sexy, but no clothes are removed in the camera, and the few scenes of the body's head are terribly pedestrian. There is a recurring scene in which a killer is asking the protaganista (played by Matt Dillon) about how sex is with Jewel. It seems Matt does not know, nor do the spectators. Why was he dating her anyway? One Night at Mccool also wants to be funny. Sorry, bizarre coincidences and misunderstandings did not even work at Three's Company. The worst thing is that this movie really seemed to be going into a somber atmosphere to accompany his comedy. More or less like a Coen brothers' movie, but his shallow script could not be more delicate, nor his sleazy cock in every crash. What remains for the public is a movie that seems to be busy trying to please everyone and simply missing out on any appeal along the way.
