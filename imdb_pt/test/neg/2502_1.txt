Joe D'Amato could have made other notable films in his long and prolific professional career, of course, in shifts to make VERY cheap Z-grid movies in Italy's great exploration boom in the late 1970s, early 1970s , but Porno Holocausto. not one of them, or at least it should not be. Of course, I should not expect too much from a movie with such a title, but I thought of considering the description of the box that could have some fun horror scenes with the mutant and excited "cannibal zombie." It turns out that the zombie does not appear until more than half of the film, and in each turn we have a scene of bad taste sex as hardcore as you can imagine. That's fine. But it's not very nice except for the more "what's the BS" type. There are laughable dialogues involving lobsters that cost more of Japan by mail than in Paris, elegant and skinny women play biologists and zoologists who have sexual problems (let the door unlocked to be raped and a kind of bipolar fun of everything. > <br /> Everything leads to the island, where the "main attraction" is a guy who, at first, spends an absolutely pathetic amount of time (he forgets ridiculous) staring at newcomers to the island's radioactive desert of the Caribbean, and once revealed has a face as one of the guards in Jabba's palace and has a sweet potato for a main genital. But much more stupid than anything before it is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has an excessive amount of time to escape, but just sits there, her face empty, how the monster brings presents and what must be a racially motivated exploitation movement part of the filmmakers the only monster rapes and kills white women, not her. And it ends, of course, with a "happy" ending. I use quotes, of course, out of a kind of shock that this could have any sort of legitimate end at all. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this is not what you might expect, like possibly being a bloody horror movie with a bunch of monstrous and funny zombies but that devour human flesh. If anything violence is in the film is done on a shoe string; a log blow on the face is immediately cut off to the bloody result, which is like the result of a tomato hitting someone. So, in fact, the last part of the title is more for the market. However, even being a porn movie, he has little to offer except as a reason for the cast and crew to get paid vacations in the Caribbean (as George Eastman suggests, this was just one of the few quickies made as an island). It has working cameras and similar actors, full of genitals for 3/4 of the entire time and with a sinister lip sync and songs like Nino Rota forced on the gun point to do something sullen in a brothel, and is STILL a piece of celluloid manure in the same way; all this can be an immense guilty pleasure, but it is not.
