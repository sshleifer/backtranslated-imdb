What was the purpose here ... I started to take a look at this, but then I realized I had no purpose ... bad acting ... no action and no story ... I ended up listening while surfing the web reading about David Beckham's US $ 250 million football contract. Do not rent it Do not borrow it DO NOT BE A LOAD BELOW I've seen so many movies that I could feel like this would suck from the start. War movies must be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually do not feel like a Christian melodrama ... This movie pales in comparison to any other I've seen before. I must say that I am truly disappointed with this movie.
