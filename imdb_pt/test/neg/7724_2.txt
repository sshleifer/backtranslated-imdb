When Uwe Boll, the extraordinary film, released the first adaptation of House Of The Dead to a complete deserved mockery, it was generally agreed among fans of the original video game that it would take incredibly stupid to think about making a sequel. The per capita ratio of Hollywood idiots must be really high, because not only do we have a sequel, but it has also been distributed on the antipodes by Sony, a company not normally known for its taste for costly discounts. Launched directly into television in the United States, the sequence improves the original in most aspects, but in doing so, it becomes softer than interesting. The scale of the scenario is magnified, with the action occurring in a deserted city that happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead occur. In particular, the action is spread throughout the university, where the first infected inhabitants can be found. Simply put, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs inside a home where dead people can be found. <br /> <br /> The cast, on the other hand, is a real step backwards. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specifically created to resemble a low-rent Angelina Jolie while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a sloppy Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that will stand out among this cast is a Fixed Fingaz, who probably did not want to be recognized so easily by the people he faces at home. Simply put, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. Say what you want about Boll, but he at least inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight his ineptitude. Having said that, the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their movie is a drug and that they too can have fun with it. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was working out some kind of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took it seriously. Unfortunately, with the actors failing to take their characters or the situation seriously, the little dramatic tension that could have been impaired. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot relates to the pursuit of a zero-generation victim. whatever the plague, is causing the death of the dead. Or to translate in more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected shortly after the virus had turned into a form that was threatening humans. How this would help when a non-mutant strain is usually needed to create a vaccine is a guess, but the way in which this search is passed suffers problems of its own. The we-have-to-go-back plotting device is used to fill the runtime, but the actual mission time extra is also problematic. One point tells us that the city will be destroyed by Cruise missiles in ten minutes, but the heroes return to the university, locate the sample they are looking for and fight enough zombies to eat China's army, all in that space of time. Filmmakers take note: it's only worthwhile to be specific as long as it can serve rather than disrupt dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated character deaths using idiot camera tricks, Michael Hurst uses all the graphic detail his budget can afford. Necks are bitten, arms are cut, heads are thrown. All this contributes to a much more convincing yield, but it also does not allow the ridicule of obvious falsehood. Photography is also greatly improved. As the Crypt DVD says, being in focus everywhere makes it an improvement over the original, but it also deprives us of something to chuckle at the expense of. Writing is also both an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, referrals are offered to other horror and survival horror games, the most obvious ones like Run Like Hell. For the first two times, they work because they offer clever ways to turn titles into everyday, everyday dialogues. After the eighth time, however, they just get on their nerves because they remind players of things they would rather do with their time. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, House Of The Dead 2 cost only six million to bring to television screens across America. Since Tom Savini on his own would cost more than that to work on a movie nowadays, I have to say that I'm a little impressed with the visual results. In contrast to the very revolted original, the zombies here look like real zombies, instead of extras in bad compositions shot bad. In contrast to the original, the actors seem to have an idea of ​​what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that, in addition to some real zingers scattered everywhere, the characters speak like real people. However, history is nothing we have not seen a thousand times. When Aliens, the true Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were released to be acclaimed, the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before or did so well that we did not care. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough not to mock her, but brings nothing new or particularly bright to the table, so we do not care. <br /> <br /> For this reason, and many others I gave House Of The Dead 2 two in ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. Unless you're into sucky movies as much as I am, it's best to avoid this.
