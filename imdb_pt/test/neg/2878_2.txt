I read the reviews of this movie, and they were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I am a great lover of francophile and art films, but I believe this is yet another case where critics do something "artistic" or "intellectual" in something that is not. I'll be frank: it contains scenes of sexual perversity that I've never, ever really wanted to see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some important psychological problems, but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically. The film is essentially disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was disgusted by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was nothing close to the kind of disgust and disgust I felt during this movie.
