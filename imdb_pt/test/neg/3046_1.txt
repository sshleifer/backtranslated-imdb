This movie is bad. Too bad. So bad that it made me want to kill myself on the forehead. I hated this movie. First, the plot was absolutely nothing and nothing shocking about this movie was seen in the 30-second teaser trailer. Secondly, anyone who saw the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie too and completely unworthy of a remake. By far the best part of the movie is the house in which it happens. Which is not saying much to the actual movie. There were parts in the movie when the song got really full of suspense and you're sure someone's on the corner and ends up being the housekeeper or the cat, but when someone really is around the corner it's impossible to be scared because you're expecting it all. So save the money, save time, save yourself the headache and watch the trailer. There is absolutely no point in seeing this movie, not in the theater, not on DVD, not on TV, ever.
