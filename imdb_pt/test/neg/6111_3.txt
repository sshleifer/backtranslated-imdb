Somehow I failed for a few years to see this movie, although it has been successful and spawned many discussions in Israel. I'm sorry I did not postpone indefinite time. <br /> <br /> The theme of 'Kadosh' is very real and painful for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the Orthodox family. and society. The basic situation that is in the premises of the film is possible, the problem is that the way it is brought to the screen and the "solution" that the described conflicts receive in the film are wrong. Gitai does not seem to have much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach of choosing fanatical characters or being unable to express his human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic. Not a much better service for the female characters, although at least here have more sympathy and also have the participation of two beautiful and talented actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall, Gitai's view is very one-sided, his film media are too basic, he focuses on the technical details of Jewish religious life, which may be of interest to people who do not know them but who are not really relevant in context of the whole story. Starting from interesting premises, what we have here is a boring film that seems longer than it is, with a rather static acting, obsessive use of music that touches the same record not only of a musical but also from an emotional perspective and very inconclusive if not even confusing end. What a difference between this film and 'Ha Ushpizin' inspired and described the same social landscape and that managed to convey human feelings on the screen. In 'Kadosh' there is very little cinema and few human emotions.
