I'm not a director or writer or anything related to a movie. But watching more than one movie every day gave me the idea of ​​what a good movie is or not. So here it is: The fast and the undead is a robbery of the Rapid and the Dead. I was thinking it might be a bit of a parody of a cool movie with a lot of premieres. But oh no, I was really in a very big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie sucks. I'm a big fan of morgue movies, but this one is just a bit here and there, but they're not that consistent. <br /> <br /> But I have to give them credit in creating horrible characters that gave me a little squirming. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of zombies, check this out. If you're not ... better to look for other stolen zombie movies.
