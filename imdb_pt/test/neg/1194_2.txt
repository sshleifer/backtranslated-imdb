I watched this movie at the theater in Edinbourgh along with 3 other Americans and our friend from Manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time. We would have spent a lot more an extra hour to watch the insipid dialogue of Star Wars III that was playing down the hall than all of this. Opening with one of the worst jokes I've ever seen compromised with celluloid on the big screen, it did not take off with a bang. Throughout the movie we had the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard, the writers thought so much about the setup that you could see the joke coming in 2 minutes earlier, and when it came it was so dull that you could not even smile; I cite the cum-ming giraffe as a prime example. <br /> <br /> The plot itself makes some interesting thoughts in my mind, which entertained me much more than what was happening on the screen. I think a lot more could have been done with that angle (the two different worlds, the experience of fishing out of the characters' water, the confusion and the surprise as people try to understand and distinguish the characters and writers from each other. time is wasted by pushing this painful plot to the end with as much "bizarre" and "goofy" as is humanly possible. And to say that the characters of the sixteenth century show that any extra talent of writers is a insult to clever writers and editors who could possibly have made this film an estimated 40 minutes, but no, it's a complete torture torture film. <br /> <br /> As we were leaving the theater, we had very little laughter inside him, I heard the young couple of British electronics behind me saying, "That was very good, was not it? You never really knew what was coming." And the girl responding "yes, quite surprised. tooth. "and that was it. If this is what it means to leave the British people watching a comedy: do not laugh for 90 minutes, but a little communication between two lovers in the end, then this movie was successful. But I believe in British life more than that. <br /> <br /> I have not laughed so much at a comedy movie since American Pie II.
