I just saw this movie on opening night. I read some comments from other reviewers that convinced me to go see it ... I must say, I was not impressed. I am so impressed that I feel the need to write this review to save some money for some of you. <br /> <br /> First of all, "The Messengers" is very predictable, not much of a thriller. It can be scary for someone under 13, but really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie was solved. <br /> <br /> In addition, the performance seemed a little superficial. Some of the emotional arguments among the family were less convincing than the suspense scenes. If you've seen prior to this movie then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth seeing in theaters.
