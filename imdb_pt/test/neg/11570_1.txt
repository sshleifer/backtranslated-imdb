I kind of like JAG. It has charm, but lately it's a lot of advertisement. For a foreigner (a non-American), the patriotic sentiment may be a little too much. <br /> <br /> I do not like Rabb and MacKenzie to stop being lawyers (as they were in the early days of the TV show) to become super heroes who stop the wars and rescue entire continents. It's almost like watching a US Army recruiting video. <br /> <br /> I still watch the show, so it's not so bad. But I would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigated military accidents and did not save the world in the future.
