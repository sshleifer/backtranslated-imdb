I think Purvis starts to make a gay "Gone With The Wind" If so, sorry, Tag, that did not happen. It also did not happen as a gay movie of sexploitation. I think I'm confused; What are we trying to do here? As much as I want, I just can not seem to get where I care about these characters at all. This film is effective in capturing a taste of decadence that lives in the south; does nothing to explain, clarify or advance my understanding of a gay relationship or the conflict with which the protagonist seems to be struggling.
