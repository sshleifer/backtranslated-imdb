Tarzan, the environmental awareness leader, faces four hunters who, according to most heterodox ones, kidnap animals to take them to zoos. Tarzan has a bland wife, but sexy enough with a flawless hairstyle and a child. No one should blame Tarzan for being suffering from the vicious actions of the hunters. <br /> <br /> This Gordon Scott Tarzan movie is one of the most foolish, completely and unnecessarily silly; for one reason or another, the team found nothing of charm to support the film, and it's just dumb junk. Tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil hunters because Tarzan's environmental conscience has led him into an open conflict with the evildoers. The boy and the chimpanzee, both belonging to Tarzan, are kidnapped by malevolent hunters; then Tarzan summons the animal forces unleashed from the jungle to release the boy and the chimp with Tarzan leading the attack. TARZAN AND THE HUNTERS is silly, unattractive, rather uninteresting. Maybe as a kid I would have liked it? Now you have to be very cruel, as cruel as those pathetic hunters punished by Tarzan to ask a Tarzan movie not to be silly; I'll admit that. But it's also really legitimate to ask these Tarzan films, foolish though they are, and show a little pleasure, even a little pleasure. Some kick, some emotion, some fun. Now the failure of Gordon Scott Tarzan is very silly, exactly in the sense of having no enthusiasm, all the excitement. (Yes, I liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake.What the beast? Watch the movie, kids, now here I just gave you an excuse to do it.) For one reason or another, villains look a bit pathetic and provoke piety instead of righteous anger. <br /> <br /> The books leave the impression that Tarzan looked quite clever in his own way; and if you find a decent bodybuilder or other sportsman who looks smart enough for the role can be a very demanding, almost impossible task, Gordon Scott was very far from meeting that ideal. <br /> <br /> The wife rebukes Tarzan for not liking books. The script suggests that Tarzan was uneducated, almost illiterate, and adverse to learning; but the book says the opposite, and we know that Tarzan studied a lot, alone, using his family books before even meeting white people. <br /> <br /> And I did not like that scream. <br /> <br /> (It's supposed, dear little ones, to be a genuine wild cry, not a lost yodeler.)
