Rs.30 / - is all I paid as rent for the DVD of the movie and believe me it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do Bollywood directors think show- ing fools is funny? well it is not. Please grow up. <br /> <br /> Here's a dialogue from the movie -AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE FOR LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI. <br /> <br /> Land is useless, criminals and cops Running after idiots. It is. BHAGAM BHAG. <br /> <br /> Well, lived the title, I had to run away from it. :) I moved to Star Movies and watched Home Alone 2, and I had a good laugh.
