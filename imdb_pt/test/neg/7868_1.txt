Target is the story of a special agent who, after serving orders to assassinate Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those "American films for guys who love stupid super-patriotic movies"), goes home and finds that his ex -Wife and two children are taking hostages. Charlie Snow has only a few hours to do what the terrorists tell him to get them back. <br /> <br /> This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And if it were not for someone I know (and probably by mistake) get him out of the store, I would never have seen that heap of junk to begin with. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like any generic action movie story I've seen before. In fact, these are the kinds of things they fake in variety shows, and that's how bad it is. I'd half expected Living the Color 'Homey the Clown' for Will Sasso from Mad TV making his impression of Steven Segal onscreen, to remember that this was just an overdone action movie, but now our characters are here to ridicule the how ridiculous it really is. There were not even good sequences of struggle or action. By the way things happen, you do not even think that someone was kidnapped, that there were terrorists, or that anything remotely interesting was happening. <br /> <br /> It's not just the story completely and completely. uninteresting, the acting is so terribly wood. Just watch the part where Stephen Baldwin, like former special agent Charlie Snow, is talking to the hijackers on the phone. They tell him they have his wife and put her on the phone. She says "Charlie, help!" or something to that effect. And Baldwin replies, "It's all right, dear" in an unimpressive way, you think he was reading the script and trying to sound the words phonetically. I imagine that despite being such a ridiculously bad movie (one of the 100 best IMDb - a list that they should expand to at least 250 films and contain almost every Stephen Baldwin movie), someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to bother so much. Someone. Anyone. I could not get past the fact that everyone seemed to be reading a script. But the only person in the entire film who has any talent (and therefore should not be in it), Deborah Wilson of Mad TV. <br /> <br /> This was the capital's cheese festival. How truly embarrassing.
