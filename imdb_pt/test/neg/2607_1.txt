Wow. After seeing this movie, you will know why the youth of the United States remain without intelligence and without any characteristics that contribute to the well-being of society, except for becoming more inept in their functions. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two stars most reprehensible people imaginable, who in the center do not have any kind of talent or brain to make something of themselves (especially Bam Margera and Steve-O), and the only option for the fame was to earn a living entertaining those as stupid as they are to harming being. A guy drinking horse semen? Just disgusting apartment. A man putting a hook on his cheek and acting as "bait" for the sharks? This is not humor, it's evidence to institutionalize it. <br /> <br /> In general, I left the theater without hope for humanity.
