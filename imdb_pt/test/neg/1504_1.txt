An objective lesson on how to make a bad movie that disguises itself as Horror. Without going too close, I imagine this is the result of a group of film school students, all adding bits to the story and then actually acting on it! It's like a movie studio of some kind and it's a movie that needs an editor - in that case it would have lasted 10 minutes! The warden probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of submitted scripts or even unpublished films that would have benefited from that. Calling Granny, who was killing people in very stupid ways, looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future - or maybe musicians Johnny Winter / Edgar Winter. It starts with 20 minutes of boring, boring nonsense done by students - something about paranoia. Giving this garbage 1 is because it can not stay less. It does not have a single redeeming feature - and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the cheating guy, she has to taste the red stuff before she knows it's not tomato ketchup! It is an insult to the intelligence of an idiot.
