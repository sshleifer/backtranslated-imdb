No wonder this was free with Mail on Sunday, going slow, bad acting, and filming (flare camera, near the beginning of the movie, it's not even artistic) = straight to the video, but not in this case, why not retrieve some of your (film production costs) freeing them with a Sunday UK newspaper, at least in that way you get a captive audience and recover some costs. <br /> <br /> I did not give this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the effort to pull some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, this is not Blow ?? Up ) but Vinnie Jones as the leader, and I think he was better in Gone in 60 seconds when he did not speak. <br /> <br /> This movie is falling in ratings every day, I think this will find its true mark in the 3-4 of 10, in the very near future.
