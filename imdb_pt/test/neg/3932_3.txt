This movie was not so good. Here's the first clue and that's not going to be a strong movie, the name of Harrison Ford does not just appear first but it's also bigger than the title. The song was nominated for an Oscar, what the hell was that? This song was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. The acting was insignificant at best except the Amish boy that he did a decent job for being so young. Then you have the story that was weak and a little on the place, and won by adapted! The music was horrible, I know I said something, but it was really bad. The place was very good and should be redone. Well, that's all I really have about it. <br /> <br /> Your movie face, <br /> <br />
