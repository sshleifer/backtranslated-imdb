This was a movie that could have been great if there were not so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors had been chosen or created to look a little more like real (not too difficult) people. Sissi did not go to Mayerling to see her son dead, neither did she die in the street; they took her to the boat and then returned to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I'm not sure about the wedding night, but I find it exaggerated that a company lady stripped the empress and leave her completely naked (and that in 1850) or that the emperor would proudly announce "yes, I finally she" to the cut together. As far as I know this was done the very first night and no one rewarded her like a prostitute. The saving grace of the film is really Stephane Audran, an excellent actress and faithful to the character.
