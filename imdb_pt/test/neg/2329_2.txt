A work colleague told me to watch this movie, since he considered this film one of the best films of all time. So I watched. First I have to admit that I do not like conventional movies and I prefer watching movies with real meaning. <br /> <br /> And that's the point, why I do not like this movie. It has no meaning. It's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, funny, absurd and exciting pieces. At first I thought this movie could be a real mystery thriller (as the German packaging used to say), but the movie was very mysterious to me. <br /> <br /> David Lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images, but the composition looks as horrible as a combination of milk and beer. Both are good, but together?
