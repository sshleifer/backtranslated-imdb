Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I'm called the attention that was the trailer and not the poster. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film centered on a video I play that was created by a countess to kill the people and live forever is acceptable. <br /> <br /> First that bad horror movie, the blood sees more or less sparks (spreading gossip), these scenes are bled, they are the worst. /> <br /> But in fact (really) how bad is this movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all respects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone, trailer well, bad movie. <br /> <br /> I do not care, since (how, how) they spend (consume) money and time making these films meaningless and very bad.
