Awful, Awful, horrible show. The "real world" issues dealt with the lack of originality. Stereotypes in abundance. What the hell is going on with the African American eyebrows? Power Tyrone! Awful, Awful, Awful, Awful, horrible show. The fact that it lasted three seasons beggars belief. This show is really a wash for the dead brain that accepts mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Except for the Bell, it almost seemed humorous compared to this. Well, in retrospect, no. It is of the same banal type and therefore equally devoid of intelligence. The only thing that is missing so far is the message of Jesus is GOD. The mentality and liberation is the same, but somehow it feels bad and soulless. You can almost hear TV executives sprout words at each other. In fact I felt so annoyed at this shows excremental existence, I felt compelled to comment. <br /> <br /> Horrible show, horrible and horrible.
