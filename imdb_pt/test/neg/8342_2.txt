Considering the subject, I thought this movie would be at least enjoyable, if you stop a little before a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it was over - I thought the ending was what happened before it got exciting. The only reason I gave 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition.
