I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old son. He did not laugh once throughout the movie ... and he loves dogs and will laugh at almost everything! This film was horrible in every respect: poor screenplay (even representing a film for minors), poor production (the camera shuddered made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes), poor acting (maybe they were "targeted" to act cartoonish), and even poor sound quality (there are parts where the audio level looks good, so you can not hear what the next actor is saying). I'm willing to put up a lot when it comes to watching a kid movie, but that was worse than having a stick in my eye. I also did not like being beaten in the head with the belief in sky god. In total, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I wasted my time in my day!
