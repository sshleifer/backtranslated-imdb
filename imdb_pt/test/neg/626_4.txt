Irwin Allen's first venture into every star show was a disaster every star. The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as the blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chewing the landscape with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dining on the stage for weeks like Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe, that's just a few of them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known to be the last film to feature the three Marx brothers, although they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is a confidant of Christopher Columbus, Groucho eucres the Indians off the island of Manhattan as Peter Minuit and, most surprisingly, Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton, who discovers gravity when an apple holds him in the bean. <br /> <br /> Keeping all these pictures together is a story where humanity itself is being judged. A super H-bomb is about to be discovered and let loose in the world's population. It is the Day of Judgment a coming. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its defenders and detractors. Speaking to the prosecution is Old Scratch, which has brought the worst in man for centuries, in the form of Vincent Price. But the man has his good side too and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate the man at his best civilized moment. Colman and Price defend their case before The Judge plays Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In these three individuals you have some of the best voices the English language has ever known. When the film is about them, each bringing the exhibits to their case, it is a pleasure to hear. So when the focus is on individual stories, you want to scream in agony. <br /> <br /> What Irwin Allen was driving, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately camping with some of these selection decisions? If it was satire, it just does not get off the ground. <br /> <br /> This was Ronald Colman's farewell film, and although it's hardly something I'd like to do, I can not think of anything. man who could have declared the case of civilization better. <br /> <br /> When you see The History of Humanity, move quickly through some of the exhibits and appreciate every moment that the defenders stand before the judge.
