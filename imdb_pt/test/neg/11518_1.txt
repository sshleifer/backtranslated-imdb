I'm in a movie club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this completely bleak movie. The story of the film is not bleak, but the whole movie itself is extremely bleak. The acting was absolutely terrible. The children were excessively whiny. A metal pole could have done a better job. I desperately wanted to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept in peace. The monkeys are neither cute nor funny. The drama is laughable. I do not remember when I saw a more terrible movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely false. Adults try to be good actors, but they just can not break stereotypes. The girl seems to want to leave the movie falling from a hill during the movie so as not to leave her, I do not blame her. Micheal Anderson should apologize publicly for this film. Not just for me, but for everyone who was forced to go through this horrible movie. Actually, I apologize to you. Even though I have nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this movie, because that means at least somebody else will. This film still surpasses the sadness of the films of Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls. I'd even say it's even worse than Hilary Duff's movie collection, but that's a push. Just please do not watch this movie, otherwise you will be forced to write a comment similar to this about how horrible this movie is. I'm so sorry.
