About your terrible movie copying Beethoven. As a professional musician, it is my duty to watch every movie about any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it's a terrible combination of empty emotions combined with the worst taste possible. You proved it in your terrible b movie. The only thing that takes the movie is the music. Of course you did not bother to look beyond the good, but in my taste for Tackacs quartet performances, but I have to admit that the performances have at least quality in contrast to the movie you made. It starts with the dying DEAF Beethoven who understands perfectly Anna, who is just whispering. Beethoven's audition during the film is best by the minute, but this must be because of something vague and divine. Then there's the almost impossible semi-pornographic scene of "eyes closed" that is totally exaggerated with the hot Anna and the nephew crying at the end (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my GOD what a performance). And as the culmination of Amadeus's theft, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes, but in total absurdity, which she understands perfectly, but no one else in her audience, even trained professional musicians will understand. Of course his reaction will be that the negative answer is at least an answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning into his grave because of his worthless creation and with good reason. This tribute is blasphemous and I'm sorry for renting one of the worst movies ever made, even if it's about my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you can not understand the greatness of Beethoven in his wildest dreams and certainly not after some regency and violin lessons. That's the problem with you Americans: you think you can understand everything, even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yes, we can do that anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All these Beethoven Copy creators are missing. See you in kindergarten.
