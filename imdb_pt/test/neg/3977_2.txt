I've never seen this movie on its own, but like many others who have commented, I saw it as an episode of MST3K. Really terrible television schlock of the 70's. But someone saw its potential because it just turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. <br /> <br /> And for the person who asked if there was ANY good film made in the 1970s, I want to remind you that it was a golden age for American cinema, with directors like Robert Altman and Martin Scorcese standing out. Not to mention little things like Star Wars (1977). Just a reminder that the 1970s were so much more creative than the 21st century has been until now.
