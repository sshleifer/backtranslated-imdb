This was more of a love story than one about an angel coming here to Earth, although both angles of the story receive a good deal of the film. <br /> <br /> If I took this film to heart, as someone who knows and believes the Bible, I would have canned it very quickly, but I do not think the general atmosphere has been mean or blasphemous. It was just ridiculous or just stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean, John Travolta like a dirty angel? Smoking Scratching his groin? Quoting the Beatles? A "warrior angel" who knows nothing about heaven? An angel who flirts with all women? Yes, it's all absurd and certainly biblically incorrect. <br /> <br /> I could tolerate all this, but I do not know how many people, whatever beliefs they hold, who could endure a boring movie, what happened during the second half of the movie. It begins to drag when the romance begins between William Hurt and Andie MacDowell. Some of the dialogues during this novel are so stupid that they are insulting to any discriminating viewer. <br /> <br /> This is another film directed by Nora Ephron. Dude, I can not believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman wrote or directed. At least she's consistent.
