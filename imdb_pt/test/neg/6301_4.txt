This is one of those harmless and slightly fun little movies that strive to make you like them more. But like many others, the material is not strong enough to successfully fill a few hours. <br /> <br /> The pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They are faced with many problems - with homophobic local residents, with the engine, with their past. <br /> <br /> The real problem is with dialogue. The clues are good (although Pearce's continuous camping becomes tiresome), but the henchmen and epithets feel forced where they should be casually discarded. Characters should not laugh at their own gags. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Elliott also feels the need to stack the pleasantly incongruous photos of extravagant costumes of raging against desert backgrounds such a cheap makeup. For a film about self-confidence and just being yourself, everything seems very unsure of itself.
