A lot of filming (almost a third of this 53-minute film) really messed up this movie. Admitting that the plot is that John Weston is sent by Marshal George Higgins (George Hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say "Ro-DAY-oh"), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. The relationship between the bad girl (usually a Latina - even in the big "duck soup" [1933]) and the "heroine" Polly Ann Young, a Loretta Young look-alike (Hey, she's your sister!) Could have benefited from more time on the screen. The happy ending is very abrupt - although this time John Wayne really kisses the girl. <br /> <br /> The most interesting film was the long parade of rodeos of Indians, women and real papooses. But when the best part of the film is Mighty Yak's stunt work, Yakima Canutt, who gives us jumps from one horse to another and several different running jumps on a horse, you know we're in trouble. As noted by others, the final fight with the villain is very poorly done. <br /> <br /> My copy, from Platinum Disc Corporation, contained an added, scarce and poorly adjusted (pseudo-classical) stereo track. which spoils the authenticity of the original movie (the DVD box had 'enhanced audio 5.1'). If you are going to modernize and color, you should add a 'western' score with acoustic guitars, klip-klopping helmets, bagpipes and an accordion. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have to say that this is one of Lone Star's weakest efforts.
