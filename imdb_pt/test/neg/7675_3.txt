"Oh, you guys are guys like that." "They do not call it a cockpit for nothing, darling." Dialogue like this is just one of the many reasons why the Concorde? Airport 79 (or, if you saw it in the UK where you dragged your heels being thrown there, Airport '80: The Concorde) was the last and by far the smallest in the series. The disaster film was in trouble in the late 70's, with The Swarm having offered a lot of unintentional hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, When Time Ran Out and City on Fire simply offering much boredom, and the desperation to find a new version of the genre is all too apparent here. This time it's a conspiracy, with Susan Blakely's news anchor discovering that billionaire boyfriend Robert Wagner has sold weapons to terrorists and to North Vietnamese. Of course, she decides to tell him everything, instead of making the story public, but, he says, she explains, "I am a very rich man, I have everything in life that I could ever want. so incredibly stupid? "Just in case she does not buy that line, instead of, say, hiring a killer to kill her on the ground, he decides to do things the smartest way to destroy the Concorde while flying to Moscow via Paris. "I've done a lot of things I'm ashamed of, but I'm not a killer," he insisted indignantly, reprogramming a guided missile to destroy the plane. So nothing incredibly stupid there. And when that fails, he sends a jet fighter after him. And when does that fail? <br /> <br /> Do not even think about looking for something like logic here: this is a real thing that even the studio gave up and marketed as a comedy in the US after critics laughed. off the screen. Where all three previous appearances have had the appearance of big-budget entertainment, this small-screen friendly effort (the only one not to be filmed in widescreen 2.35: 1) has not even managed to make the Concorde look good, which is quite a feat. . TV veteran David Lowell Rich probably assumed the position of director because it was fast, cheap and had previously directed the TV movie SST: Disaster in the Sky, where Peter Graves's supersonic plane was unable to land due to sabotage and Senegalese flu (which was not intentionally at least a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and seemed the natural choice for what looks like a $ 14 million TV movie that somehow escaped to the movie theaters when no one was watching. <br /> <Brenco as a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, stars are very scarce this time, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been taken from rehab clinics and busted sitcoms. Alain Delon gives Hollywood career that a last shot as the pilot, "Happy Fish" (do not ask) George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co-pilot's bench, hoping to remind people of the other films, while the The rest of the group includes a couple of veterans of The Towering Inferno (Wagner and Blakely), a soft porn star (Sylvia Kristel, trying to be respectable), a member of Ingmar Bergman (Bibi Andersson) and she is the one who is playing the prostitute . !), David Warner's navigator on a diet having nightmares about being chased by bananas, the voice of the Devil (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and his Chihuahua Eye Seeing ("Dohn miscon-screw me"), Martha Raye and her weak bladder , Jimmie Walker playing the saxophone in her chair and smoking marijuana in the bathroom (the few moments when Martha Raye was not busy), Cicely Tyson kissing on her credibility as the mother obliged with a seriously ill child and a frozen heart in the closet, owner of the airline Eddie Albert and his wife Sybil Danning in the best place in the house, Ed Begley Jr with goggles, the Russian Olympic team and his lovely coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on a good tour the United States (who knew about the boycott?). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to the proceedings, Harry Shearer reports on the same tones he used later for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlight? Despite an impromptu wedding ceremony during a forced landing, George Kennedy must divert a heat-seeking missile by opening the window, reaching out (almost twice as fast as the speed of sound!) And firing a beacon? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon shuts off the engines so there is no "heat source" for the missiles to get home? Yes, someone actually got paid for writing this, and that someone was the future Oscar winner and screenwriter of Munich and The Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone has to start somewhere) although in his defense was producer Jennings Lang who came with the plot. Still, what do you expect from a movie that credits stunt balloonists and ends with a picture of the Concorde flying at sunset? Surprisingly, in one of these it does not admit that the studios of defeat tended to be prone, Universal filmed another 20 minutes or more of filming a few years later to include in the screenings of networked TV (not included in the DVD). Unfortunately his box office failure led to the fifth entry in the series, the riot that would have been the 1984 Airport: UFO, never coming off the ground. Even more genuinely tragically, it was the Concorde used in this film that fell in France 21 years later. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo says to his Chihuahua in Spanish without subtitles when it's not allowed on board, it's "What do you think? Do not worry. I promise that you'll fly in anything you want. "I promise, what a pity, my love, what do they think they are?")
