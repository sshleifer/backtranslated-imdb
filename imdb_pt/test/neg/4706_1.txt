Well, Dude Where's My Car can be at least a novelty as one of the few Hollywood movies that seems to have been written, released, filmed and edited in less than a day. I honestly can not believe this was done (or that I allowed my friends to make me sit through the whole thing). The jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "stupid and funny," and the actors involved do not seem to be able to get any kind of grace if the script really provides. Curiously, unlike most nonsensical comedies, this movie has a TOO MUCH plot - each scene seems to introduce a new stupid and uninteresting subplot. Of course, they were obviously going for the asshole, but it does not work on any level ... There's only one aspect of this movie that I liked: Donkeylips from Nickalodean's old show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role. This is the role that will turn you into the next Richard Gere, you just watch ...
