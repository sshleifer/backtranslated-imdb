I'm surprised to read all the positive reviews about this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year olds were bored. Squirrels are cute ... but the plot is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with less sophisticated tastes. <br /> <br /> We heard some laughter from the audience while we were present; but I wondered why. <br /> <br /> I do not admit I'm ever a fan of 'chipmunks', but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie, as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy vision of 'very young success spoils'. We've seen more than enough of that with Britney Spears, and others, have not we? <br /> <br /> Do not worry.
