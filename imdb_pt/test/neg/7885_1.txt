This is one of the rare movies that I did not immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. That was not because it particularly fascinated me or impressed me. On the contrary, he gave me nothing. <br /> <br /> Why? Because somehow, everything was so exaggerated that I could not take this movie seriously anymore. There was so much sex and violence that I got the strong impression that the movie was trying very, very hard to be offensive, like it was targeting superlatives in ugliness, instead of telling a compelling story about two women caught in a spiral. of crime. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi had been described as "Thelma & Louise with real sex" for me. Well, it's true that the main idea is similar. There are two women who travel around the country because they have committed crimes and know that their lives are over now, that the police will pick them up and decide that now that it's all over anyway, there's no holding back. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi has been described as a feminist film in which women, who have suffered from male dominance in the past, take revenge on the men they encounter. something that I have never played in this movie, simply because none of these women have ever been innocent, and because they do not kill irresponsible and violent men, but also men who seduce, men who demonstrate the desire to have protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are by no means any better than the characters they encounter and murder in a hideous and brutal way. <br /> <br /> How easily the "heroines" decide to murder, and how much pleasure they get for it, made It is absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even to take them seriously. It was all too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I had the feeling that sex and violence were only there to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than convey a story or make an argument. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi left me without any impression, without making me think, because it was so far from any real world. So constructed, unrealistic, and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this movie, there was nothing to think about besides "Why did they make this movie terrible?" If the intense discomfort occurred in this film, it served a purpose, I would accept it easily. But since I have not found anything, since the story of the film seemed to be no more than an excuse to squeeze as much ugly sex as possible into a movie ... I filed everything under "unnecessary torture," I have never, watch this movie again, and now I consider this the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Worse, not only is it not really my cup of tea to watch people being raped, raped, having sex in other ways and killing each other ... but because whatever that is the makers wanted to tell the world about their movie ... if they wanted to say something ... it just did not work out. And there is nothing else that can save this movie, because it is also filmed in such an ugly style.
