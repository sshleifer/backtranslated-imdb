The scenes of devouring the animals (geeks) were not as bad as you'd imagine. After watching Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are medium-sized. The crudest was when the guy ate the rat's head. But they were so quick and few that did not bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was interesting. I always like to hear the silly voices. They never sound like what you think the actor / actress would sound like in real life. I liked the bright colors used by the princesses. Photos of strange bugs were cool too. The younger princess looked REALLY young, almost 14 or something. The fight scenes were not as long and boring as most of the fight scenes, so that was good. 3/10.
