This could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! I had this movie when I was a theater manager. When I set up the film and watched it, I thought it had some rolls out of order. It turns out not, and if he did, no one would have noticed. I could not figure out what's going on! Everyone who came out practically felt the same way!
