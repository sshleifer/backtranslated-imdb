Thanks to silly horror films like "Troll" and the indescribably outrageous cult-favorite "Troll 2," it has become virtually impossible to take movies with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of green hobgoblins seriously these days. Just recently I watched the 70s movie made for the TV "Do not be afraid of the dark," which is basically a rather terrifying and serious movie about domestic goblins monsters, and yet I could not help but think back on the smelling bugs the potato clad in garbage bags that were running in "Troll 2". The same thing happened to me now. As much as I tried to get into "Inhabited" with a clear mindset, I unconsciously continued to compare the supposedly frightening and threatening garden fairies with Nilbog's badly sculpted goblins! Still, even without all the preconceptions, "Inhabited" is a remotely entertaining, yet straightforward video horror movie. It is a cheeky, smooth and politically correct pastiche of the family drama and mythology of northern Europe. The small boring and murderous creatures in this movie are not their ordinary goblins; they are "The Huldre": perverse little Norwegian devils who live underground and try to expel happy families from their homes, influencing the younger children. This beats the Russell family when they move to their house of ruined dreams in a small remote town. The MILF actress's blonde and sweet daughter Megan Gallagher begins to behave strangely whenever she's in the lovely playhouse at the back of the garden. She claims her friends are fairies, and even though the sinister do-it-yourself also warns of strange occurrences in the past, Gina's parents simply think the girl has problems adjusting to her new neighborhood. As she continues to chatter about fairies, they make an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist Dr. Werner while "The Huldre" is slowly emerging from her botanical shelter. It is not very special to mention here. The pace is acceptable and attempts to increase suspense are very sweet. You understand that this is a familiar horror movie, so no sequence of bloody murders is being shown graphically here. Heck, even the corpse of the family pet cat is kept off the canvas. This is the nonsensical horror movie Malcolm McDowell appears in and he almost always portrays an unreliable, greedy, self-centered authority figure.
