This 'documentary' sheds absolutely no light on what it would be like to be behind the scenes during the Hard Knock Life tour. I was not there, but watching this movie did not make me feel like I was. And for a movie like this, this is not exactly a compliment. The whole time I watched, all I could think was, "What are they leaving out?" When it's all over, the only rapper you feel that has any insight is the DMX, and that's mostly because it talks about your dogs. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
