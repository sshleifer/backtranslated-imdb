This program should be titled "When bad writing happens to good actors", considering that most players have shown immense talent in other places, for example. Andre Braugher on Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse on St. Elsewhere. I'm hoping the frenetic pace of the show will adjust as the series unfolds along with the obvious cliches and dialogues so absurd that I wondered how stupid the writers imagined the main audience would be. We are losing sight of the main points of this show, rather than being left to find out gradually, almost as if the writers thought they should say that the main character is some kind of avenging angel, doomed to be redeemed. of sins, venial and mortal, via many things in his cab passages. Watching the debut required a lot of suspension of disbelief, that Mike Olshans' fares would leave their crews so quickly and he would feel compelled to intervene in the lives of strangers. That he possesses these Super-Police skills, to be all things to all people, gun expert, martial arts master, psychologist, father-confessor, locksmith and so on, ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What happens to the recent Philidelphia-based television shows that they all seem to be imbued with an unpleasant ex-wife and a very badly ravished child? Exaggerated. I wanted to enjoy this show, I really enjoyed it, because it had the virtue of having a slightly different premise than many of the clones that appear in the season of this season and counts some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid this is just another good idea ruined by careless execution.
