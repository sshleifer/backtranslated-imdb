Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT !? This movie is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason why Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans, just to have their hearts broken. He kills a guy, takes a shot and dies before half the movie ends, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared to the point where he died ... WHY put him on the cover if your character explode . 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes promised on the back cover page? 3. It was very confusing, I mean, what about the girl? She had to narrate the movie to try to catch our attention, she failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie, he fails. Now I'm going to watch 24 ..... THIS MOVIE FAILS!
