what a waste of a movie again the film industry does not trust to make a movie that could have been just about man's ideas. There is virtually nothing in your theories or evolution, instead of the more boring story of domestic life and relationship with a daughter, a heavy script, great freedoms taken with Darwin's life, dialogue given to your character that I find hard to believe he would have expressed. Darwin never gave up believing in a higher power, he may not have correctly believed in God's established Christian idea, but he was not an atheist. that this movie implies. what would have been a fascinating and much better film is if they had started with the publication of In the Origin of Species and built a story of the great revolution that involved and an incredible cast of characters involved on all sides. instead we have a tedious and boring drama, most invented, a great injustice
