This movie was so bad it became nice. If you want to see a soap opera cast decide to make an action movie, this is for you! Overacting, irrelevant incidents, implausible dialogue - it has it all. The main character has a split personality and can not decide if he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. He is plausible in none of these roles. This sets the standard for many of the other characters. The head of the company whose building is on fire shows the same unpredictability, and his wife too. And the joke - who took the "chip" - minds belief. I found myself laughing willingly, and for that reason, I recommend that you watch.
