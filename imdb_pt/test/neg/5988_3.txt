SHRIEKER is a full moon production. I knew what to expect (very poor quality), but I did not expect it to be as painful as SHRIEKER was to watch. <br /> <br /> It's horrible. Bad acting, confusing script and direction. Irritating characters that I wanted to kill. The whole thing was probably made in a week. I've seen CHARMED episodes that were more complex and compelling than this cheap. <br /> <br /> It has the appearance of an orphaned episode from an ill-conceived TV series that no one has ever seen. It was a difficult task to watch and I could feel my mind growing weaker and weaker by the minute. Watching a movie should not be that difficult.
