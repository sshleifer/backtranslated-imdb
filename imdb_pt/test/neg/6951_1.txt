Bad. Personal opinion? The people who did it? They knew this when they succeeded. To star in this movie, again my opinion, you needed to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to own your own clothes and jewelry in Gothic style. It makes the wardrobe easier and cheaper as well. # 2: You had to be able to remember and repeat your lines without suggestion cards. Notice I did not say you had to do this well. Saves time and paper work. # 3: You had to be willing to be naked. It gives an R-rating and therefore boosts sales. Want to watch a better movie? Easy. Get a camera and some of your friends together and make it yourself. Trust me, you will not do anything worse. Like vampire movies, well, this one sucks. And a tip here for people like me who like to look for little quirks in movies ... Consider the connection between vampires and crosses. Now take a look at the symbols and names on the gravestones of the graveyard that were filmed. Ed Wood could not have planned this kind of accident better.
