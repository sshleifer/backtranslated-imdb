How bad? Well, compared to this movie, Cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There is flamboyant acting, the atrocious dialogue, the half-cooked plot and how the piece of his very companion in the slaughter mode of animals on the screen that was actually made. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a direct movie. It's not meant to be a pseudo documentary. In a way, this helps the production in which the film is very crisp and sharp compared to the granulation of the Holocaust. Unfortunately, once again we are given a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They torture the natives and essentially bring everything they get about themselves. Nothing in this movie is worth it. I was quite tolerant of my Holocaust review because of a real attempt at declaration and style, but in the case of Ferox there is no reason to watch this unless you have only blood and blood.
