Recap: Since the warrior queen Gedren created and slaughtered most of Sonja's family, she trained in the art of sword fighting. Now, Gedren has picked up a very powerful talisman, which threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing Sonja's sister in the process. Now Sonja is out for revenge and to save the world. Along the way, she meets the same Conan-like (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, the son-prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. At first, Sonja declines all aid, but then is forced to accept it, and together they will save the world. <br /> <br /> Comments: When you watch a movie like this, and think that it is the story that is the best element in this movie, the movie is in trouble. Because 1) a movie like this should attract its strength in good sword fights and effects, and 2) the story is very, very bad. It's simple and uncomplicated and really does not offer anything in terms of character development or even suspense. It's predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry whatsoever. And the kid is just boring. And most scenes are prolonged for so long that they become boring. Although the film is not too long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And so back to point 1). The fight is slow, uncomplicated and very bad. This clearly shows that most fighters clearly block the opponent's blows long before the opponent begins to attack. In my honest opinion, I believe that most children, struggling with sticks, create more exciting fights by playing knights than this movie did. All in all, this is a really bad spin-off, which should be avoided by everyone who liked Conan's movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
