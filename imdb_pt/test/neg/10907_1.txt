Nothing about this movie is good. It is a stereotyped and predictable "romantic comedy," aimed at making women compel their significant others to watch. In other words, it is a predictable chic movie that is not comical or romantic and is extraordinarily forgettable. If you like watching the same thing over and over again, this movie will fit perfectly. I was also forced to watch this with my g / f at the time and it comes as no surprise that we're not together anymore. I like great movies that are wonderful to watch while she just wants to see the same thing over and over again just with different actors. Nothing good to say about this movie. The title says it all. 1/10 (a b / c I can not give a zero.
