A coach who used to be good, but had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a hopeless team; the ace who has a line with the coach; the technical assistant with alcohol problem, the face that is kicked around the winning basket; the whole city against the coach (all except for the protagonist). It's the old story - taken from the British comic books, where a team of geeks and cats fatten Brazilians in football and win. <br /> <br /> This film, admittedly well assembled, is full of these stories. cliches. The only part I did not anticipate was when at the town meeting, the star suddenly decided to stay on the side of the coach. No reason was given. It seemed a very strange thing to see that everything was going his way so far. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor boy. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays a Popey Doyle locker room. I'm sure an actor of the caliber of Dennis Hopper did not find anything particularly challenging about his role. The same can be said of Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie full of cliches that could have been made much better than it was.
