*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> I was super excited to go see Blood and Chocolate with my friends. I could not wait because the book is one of my favorites. But as soon as the film began, I could not believe how different it was. At first I was fine, so both her parents are dead ... maybe everything will be fine. But then came the rest of the movie. When it was over, I was furious. Nothing was correct, but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden. At the end of the book, Gabriel was my all time favorite ... and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot? The movie also showed the shifters, or werewolves, how these evil creatures were when the book showed them as if they wanted to fit in and keep their backpacks safe. They would never kill humans for fun. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a movie like them, they should have given a different title and called the different characters. Because then I would go out and watch and buy again, but when I think about it everything I see is bad. You could not pay me to go see him again or buy it.
