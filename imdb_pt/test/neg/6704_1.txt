First of all, I'm a gay man, although I do not live my life within the so-called "Community", and it's because of movies like this that Gay-themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them suck. Like this. I could give it a zero. (I do not understand all the positive reviews unless they were all made by people who made this movie) I actually stopped by this at the 24-minute mark when the so-called "Anthony" direct kissed Adam outside the restaurant for no reason at all . And how is the kid stealing from the restaurant if he does not live in the city? Bank transfers? The acting was HORRENDOUS! The sound editing? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam when they're sitting on the wall eating lunch.) Every time the camera shifted between the two actors, the sound changes as if there was no filter in the microphone.) Seriously, do not rent, or god free me, buy this movie.Horrible Horrible Horrible acting and just a stupid plot.
