As the characters begin with "Unknown" identities, they are not identified by name, so you start with the handsome James Caviezel waking up in a warehouse. He finds out that the place is locked. Do not ask - the windows are made with safety glass, and it is impossible to leave. Four other waking men make him a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as a chair "Bound Man" and Jeremy Sisto shot and "man in handcuffs". Oh man ?? <br /> <br /> These five men have collective amnesia. They think three of them are hijackers and two are victims - but they do not know who is which or who is who. Forgetfulness is due to a leak in the tube. Do not ask - it happens. Meanwhile, outside, David Selby (as Parker) sends his cops to resolve the kidnapping, while one of the men's wives, Bridget Moynahan (as Eliza Coles), frantically waits. But, the leader of the gang of criminal elements, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots", is also on the way to the scene. As the DVD's synopsis says, "How secrets are revealed and clues are unveiled, men must run up against time to find out who is good and who is evil to stay alive." This story is much better than it looks in the movie, unfortunately. When the secrets are finally revealed and the memories become clear, there is more interest in what happened. Quite simply, director Simon Brand has a great premise with the idea of ​​Matthew Waynee, but they hinder the slight investment in the characters holding the short end of the staff.
