This is clearly a French movie. It is a young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. Long leads. LOng close up. A minute or more dedicated to an attempt to light a pipe full of hash / opium. A long view of how a group knocks over a car and burns it. It's a black and white movie. The captions were white, so about a third of the time was unreadable. (Why do they do this?) I left after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was not going anywhere, slow. I was not the first to leave. It was the first time I left a photo in my long life. (Well, maybe the second)
