This is a totally forgettable image. A friend of mine picked up a bargain box at a local rental place for $ .50. He should have demanded a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot is something like this: A giant monster threatens the earth and the aliens decide that the median human being on the planet should be chosen to save the earth. So a tiny holographic space alien appears before a post office clerk and tells him that he is "this." <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it's time to rate a movie, and on that count Zarkorr! The attacker fails miserably. Monster Zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen, totaling perhaps 5 minutes at most (with a generous estimate). The cute alien hologram has even less screen time and may be the most interesting character to see, and only because she is wearing a teeny bopper stereotyped outfit, complete with a provocatively short pleated skirt. The final climax battle with the monster is over before you can say "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over". The next moment you are left to reflect if you just went through a train accident or if someone just drained 3 liters of blood from you. <br /> <br /> I admit that this film has made a line that my friends and I still repeat today and we laughed and we were the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal image. As the cast of "protagonists" is being "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them answers the questions with the statement "What are you, some kind of question?" It is delivered in such an absurd way that if you are sitting with a group of friends (who will not be your friends for long if you actually talked to your friend to watch), you may actually feel one or two cries of incredulous laughter. <br /> <br /> While this is not Manos or Eegah (nor bad enough to be classically bad) this movie will still annoy you with your terrible dialogue, unimaginative characters and nonexistent special effects, and still deserve to dwell on the background 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
