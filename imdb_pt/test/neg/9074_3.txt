It's been a long time since I was in the arts theater and I went to see the Douches Froides because it received great reviews in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> What's with this movie is that it has no head or tail, but only one section in time about the lives of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started, I already knew it was going to be a long sit, but sometimes things can get better, in this case not. There is no real character development or interconnection between players. You start in the middle of a situation, suddenly there's a girlfriend and then there's a guy with whom he needs to be friends to fulfill his sporting ambitions, but the way they're put together is quite strange, since they are "just together" , so it seems. <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one you can see. The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all I could think of during the movie was "when are they going to have sex again?". And when you think about it, it's really very insane. Because it basically means there's nothing really worth seeing, but three teenagers doing it and that, at least to me, makes a really bad movie, stay clear and save your money (my ??? 7.50 is wasted )), there are better art films than this. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for performance performance, one for each.
