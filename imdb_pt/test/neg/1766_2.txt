I was very excited to see "Cold Mountain". Unfortunately, like most of the movies that I'm really excited to see, it was a disappointment! If it were not for that miraculous invention called DVD, I think I would have put my head on the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I've watched Kidman and Law closely when they meet because their characters are supposedly "meant" for each other. However, Law's face showed anything but stupid love, while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! The character of Zellweger is pure Granny Clampett (as if we did not understand her, corn banjos mark her every entry), and on top of that, it was all I could do not to laugh! Ironically, its performance serves to highlight how hard the leads are. <br /> <br /> Ada almost starves to death because he freed his slaves; we never learn why. Most disconcerting is why none of them stayed as Ada and his father were extraordinarily benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) was a very dangerous time for blacks (as they are politely called here). Why did not the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or plant? Why did not she just sell the farm and go home? And for all the practicality of Ruby, when she dispatches Ada's "evil" cock, that sort of thing ends up with the fact that they have more chickens! <br /> <br /> When your lover finally returns, Ada does not need him or anyone else - that's the big joke! In fact, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her real intimacy is with Ruby, who turned Ada into an Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else notice how they came down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, when they left Inman behind? <br /> <br /> I doubt Minghella would acknowledge this, for he was too busy making a Bush Movie. Inman tells us that he is "like every fool sent to fight with a flag and a lie," and Ada's father says "I imagine God is tired of being summoned on both sides of an argument." These "observations" are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the economy of the South, the reasons for war were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, most of those in line were indifferent to it). For the filmmakers to stamp their views to a period when such views were unfamiliar to those who lived in that time is beyond the unpleasant. Structurally, the film is hectic and episodic. Law and Kidman are miscast and have no chemistry! The script is little more than a half-cooked dialogue and a lot of clichés and banalities. "Small moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
