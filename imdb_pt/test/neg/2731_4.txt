For science fiction fans, this will be better than anything that might be happening on TV at any time; this is the best you can say about it. Good points; Replication and sense of humor are less boring than usual in these films, the plot is coherent and uses no mystical magical revelation. Bad points; writers try to make good science, but it falls into the direction and production (for example, a drill using superheated rock drilling equipment breaks the surface under the water with only a bubble or boiling cauldron to be seen), the characters are clich√© and the plot unfolds is beautiful stock pattern. Ok for a night so tired of doing anything else; but do not expect any great edification or even speaking points really.
