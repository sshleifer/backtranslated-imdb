A wasted effort. On the surface, it's a typical disaster film: we're involved in the lives of some people caught up in the Great Event. However, the script is so horrible and there is so much explanation of the history of the characters within the dialogue that we feel we are being treated as idiots. Neither Sesame Street explained the origins of Mr. Snuffleupagus or how Mr. Hooper died: we can solve this. Someone thought entering the 'Enron' script would give money by discussing power companies. The acting is generally mild, with the exception of the older artists (Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy), and after the first hour, I could not care less about who the storms came from. <br /> <br /> But maybe there are special effects to watch. Unfortunately not. Even on a 20-year-old TV set, I could see a poorly computer-generated tractor and trailer. Maybe there are budgetary constraints, so I can forgive this. The filming of an airplane trying to land seemed real enough, but I kept telling myself I'd seen it before. This site confirms this: it was from an earlier movie, Nowhere to Land. <br /> <br /> So in summary, the only good parts are from another movie, and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a 30- second network promo, it makes Category 6 look very good . My advice: rely on your network to make some good 30 second clips, watch them and save two nights.
