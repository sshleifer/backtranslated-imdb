This film is slightly entertaining if one fails to recognize their innumerable plot incongruities and sheer lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning underworld mentor. Instead, he stirs in broad daylight, parading a mixture of shoddy disguises. Why this man has never been captured before (or even identified) is beyond me. Not once is the audience impressed by their cunning or daring; Considering the price it requires for its services (exorbitant $ 70 million), its methods are decidedly low-budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As for those who pursue him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. . They show no sense of expertise; instead, they rely on half-baked conjectures that lead them across the country at their own pleasure. Incredibly, these absurd guesses (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc.) invariably take them straight to the Jackal, who once again escapes his clumsy claw. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent comes and goes as a distant radio station, plays the inexplicable role of a convicted prisoner who is released from prison to work alongside the FBI. He actually makes a compatible partner, even though his media are as amateur and inept as his professional friends. At one point, he actually confronts the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although they trust him enough to leave him out of his sight, they can not equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. What kind of operation are they running here? <br /> <br /> The film also seems overly dependent on macabre violence, which is totally superfluous and offers no suspense. The allegedly sneaky Jackal acts more like a demented and meaningless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing in the victim's blood. <br /> <br /> The action scenes of the film are predictable and unreal, and many moments are ruined. with melodrama. This movie is poorly executed on many levels, the only bright spot being the consistently consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you feel like thinking while watching. <br /> <br />
