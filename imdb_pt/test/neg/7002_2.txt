I rarely close a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with this movie. What discouraged me was that it was so obvious that the sole purpose of this film was to expose the maximum skin of as many B actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; I like beautiful actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits, but this director does not do anything right anymore. <br /> <br /> For example, see the scene in which the two policemen and of course there are all these supposedly witty jokes between them) are talking about the first dead body. The camera panes between them for each line (there's more than one screen width between them!) And you wonder if you're sick of it or the clueless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, that COULD get better after the first 10 minutes, but I would not know. I refused the sucker's bet and found something better to do.
