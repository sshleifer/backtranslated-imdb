Even John Wayne fans will have to admit that this movie is a mess. Wayne's character, John Tobin, is behind the gang that killed his parents, led by Apache half, renegade white middle Pandro Zanti (Earl Dwire), posing as a Mexican. <br /> <br /> There are many points to tell, but the ones that stand out include Sheriff Williams (Jack Rockwell) handcuffing a Zanti captured around his boot, so all Zanti needs to do to get rid of it is to remove your boot! Tobin's friend Dusty (George, pre-Gabby Hayes) takes a knife from the back and comes back as news for the rest of the story. In a chase scene, Tobin mounts an impromptu trunk channel through a drainage chute surrounded by walls of logs in the middle of a desert, and erring his mark, chases (actually walks after) Zanti walking through the desert. Zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but OOPS !, he did not see the sign above the well that says "Do not drink poison". As Zanti falls dead, Tobin resumes his pursuit after the remainder of the gang, and captures the whole plot by blowing up a stone wall sealing a secret passageway in Dusty's cabin - as convenient. <br /> <br /> In closing In the scene, the new Sheriff Tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new Mrs. Tobin (Sheila Terry), the daughter of Dusty, Ruby, who at the beginning of the film was a target of kidnapping of the Zanti gang. Apparently the studio was keen on Wayne having the girl in virtually every movie he did with him, since this kind of ending is completely predictable for almost every Lone Star movie.
