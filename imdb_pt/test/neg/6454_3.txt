Ugly Hollywood shit, heartless, expecting nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from the public. The SEM Spacey scenes reveal how truly horrible the movie really is. But the COM Spacey scenes are so much fun that you can hang out there until the end. Yes, he could play this role during sleep, but he does it so well that it is a joy to watch, so believable and wonderfully monstrous. Enjoy it for your performance, but do not expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great movie about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out "The Player" by Robert Altman. This sad potboiler is not remotely in the same league.
