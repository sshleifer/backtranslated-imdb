Having grown up in the West and considering the current shortage of Westerns on TV and in the theater, I was really looking forward to the Commanche moon. <br /> <br /> After watching two nights, not another, it seems to have been shot on a tight budget. The level stars of Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are conspicuously absent. There's Val Kilmer, but what the hell is going on with him? Four or five buildings on either side of the street, plus the Scull mansion form the entire city of Austin. The Capitol is never seen, only the interior of the governor's office. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is often corny, meaningless. The disjointed plot. All in all, completely forgettable.
