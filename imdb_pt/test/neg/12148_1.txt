The horrible production does not qualify as a "movie". It was obviously filmed on videotape, and really bad at it! There is a constant sound for the audio (it sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that sometimes you can not understand what the characters are saying. Poorly dubbed music will suddenly appear in one scene, and every issue of that thing is worth a ZERO! <br /> <br /> The plot is artificial and ridiculous. A late 20's gay man trying to hide his lover from visiting parents? PLEASE! And the reaction of the mother when she finds a photo of her son kissing her garden-child is beyond melodrama and rolls straight to stupidity. Talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! The acting is worse than a pornographic film, and the direction is very poor! <br /> <br /> As for "production", there is none! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a filmed attempt to call itself a "movie". There is no heart or soul to give the least praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid loss of time, so avoid at all costs! GOOD ATTENTION! BAD WRITTEN! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "producer" is vanity as this rubbish probably cost them the price of the video tape they shot at it. <br /> <br /> This ametuer garbage has no business being released on a dvd as it is misleading for the cunsomer. I can not emphasize how horrible this crap of "SUGARPLUM" is! <br /> <br />
