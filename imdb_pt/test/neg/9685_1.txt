Even though I have great interest in Bible movies, I was bored to death every minute of the movie. Everything is wrong. The film is very long, the acting is most often a joke and the script is horrible. I did not understand the point in blending the story about Abraham and Noah together. So if you value your time and your sanity, stay away from that horror.
