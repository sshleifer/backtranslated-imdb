Why did I buy this movie on DVD? Well, the short answer would be: I really do not know. As for the longer version, it pretty much comes down to the fact that I really like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in it. <br /> <br /> Now does Tatyana Ali make a genuinely good effort in this film? I must say she's one of the best, and she's getting ready to be a pretty decent actress. I'm really looking forward to seeing it in action, when better material will be available. That said, this movie was terrible - and my score is based on it: 1 star for not being the worst movie I've seen, 1 star for Tatyana Ali's performance, and 1 star for no think it deserves only 2 stars, there are worse movies for that. Ja Rule should stick to rap, not my favorite rapper, to say the least, but some seem to like it - and if it's contained there, I'd be very glad not to see it contaminate the acting scene. Ving Rhames: Oh man, Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here - you used to be a nice guy. Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor who has made so many terrible and good movies, you do not have to copy it. Ving. <br /> <br /> The rest of the half-big names in the cast: Okay, there are bills to pay, and we all have to do things we do not take pride in every now and then. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. It is so massively flawed, it is very difficult to know where to start. It's more like a lot of scenes together, just as the director said "we need to say this, and we need to say it." There is a story, unfortunately there is nothing surprising or inside it. To say the least, the changes in the plot of the story were overly obvious and, therefore, it was predictable what would happen all the time. <br /> <br /> To sum up in one word: Reallynotgood
