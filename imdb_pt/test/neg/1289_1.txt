If you are planning to rent (hope not to buy) this movie, think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun in his head and was forced to act or die. I just wonder if Busey was arrested for anything and was ordered to play in this movie because I do not see the guy who acted much better with Keanu Reeves at Point Break in this disaster. It was a feel-good movie, but there are thousands of other movies that make you laugh without wanting to get your money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I would tell someone to rent movie is to watch this movie is to see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, stop by Quigley and go rent Spongebob or something.
