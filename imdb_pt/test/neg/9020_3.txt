There are a lot of Wayne's worst movies. This movie is poorly edited, but has an extravagant element that makes it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican outfits and affects an exaggerated Mexican accent that is hilarious. The girl is dressed as an aspirant to Jean Harlow, that's 1934, after all. At least the places are beautiful and nice. <br /> <br /> Watch and laugh. Do not expect a serious Western story, but light and superficial, with poor acting but occasional glimpses of camp mood. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome and one can see that his ability to act flourished years after that unfortunate undertaking.
