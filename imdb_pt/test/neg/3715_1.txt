'Til There was You is one of the worst movies we've ever seen. It fails in all respects. Jeanne Tripplehorn was best (as an actress ...) in Waterworld. In comparison, this movie is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once, or even twice, in the course of a movie, one can understand it. But Jeanne's character falls, stumbles so often that she may have a bit of Jerry Lewis in it. In her defense, every fall (prat.) Was probably blocked, choreographed and rehearsed. And rehearsed. While that is bad enough for a movie, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot "going out to smoke" or trying to find a place to smoke. If the movie was a diatribe about having no place to smoke - Ok - BUT, it is not. <br /> <br /> No matter how long this movie runs, it is too long in 10 minutes after the runtime. /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALWAYS acts in a public forum meeting. You almost see her break life in the character. Oh, it's almost as compelling as her scene screaming with Michael Douglas in Wild Instinct - hmm, on second thought, not really. <br /> <br /> This is a film to avoid at all costs, unless you need a cigarette and are stuck in anonymous nicotine addicts or forced to watch HOOPER (Burt Reynolds) outlets. And anyway, flip a coin or go to sleep.
