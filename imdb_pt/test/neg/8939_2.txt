The most obvious fault ... awful and awful script. This movie had a potentially good history, but it was ruined with bad dialogues, continuity issues, things that were never explained, little empty spaces, subplots that came to nothing, and just stupidity. Not to mention the horrid direction and clich√© of Sandra Locke. Not even two great performances could have saved this movie. So it did not matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette gave horrible performances. The thing is, they are better actors than this movie wants you to believe. The best of the Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) has some good times - like a great scene at the beginning when she painfully takes off her handcuffs - but gives poor overall performance by her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When Trumpets Fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse, acting without any conviction or emotion that never existed. But I will not blame the actors, who were good at other roles. The script is horrible and the bad direction does not help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
