This is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen, probably only surpassed by the dreadful and absolutely pointless Blueberry. How could Harald Zwart have put his name on this shit? I'm feeling every ounce of respect I had for him dwindling fast. <br /> <br /> So what is it about this movie that makes it so poor? Is it the story? Yes. Are they the actors? Yes. Is it all the "look and feel" of the movie? Yes. <br /> <br /> To start with the story, my God! It's as clich√© and predictable as what you'd expect from a 14-year-old drunk who's late writing his "What I Did This Summer" article. The sense of well-being that manufacturers try to achieve just drowning completely while we suffer another embarrassing change in history. <br /> <br /> Actors are amateurs, I know, and so we can not expect them to be the same quality as the professional actors. But for this to work, the characters have to be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so that viewers do not care about the daring acting, or maybe even add to the characters. In this case, not even baby! You get to repel the characters gently, and at the end of the movie (I think it's about 90 minutes long, even though it looks like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt someone to have your mind of those stupid annoying guys! It should be impossible to find success in the movie's attempt to succeed, unless you're yourself like those stupid idiots. His lack of talent and credibility, as far as acting is concerned, only makes the silly, overly simple scenes fall harder on the floor. Even the family of the people involved will find it difficult to find this, but very embarrassing (I prefer that my sister plays the fool on American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why to cram? in a lot of displaced Norwegian celebrities? They seem even more out of place than the actors, if that's possible. These celebrity appearances only increase the film's cheap sentiment and are in themselves a transparent shot in the dark to try to improve something before it even starts. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to emphasize how much I'd rather watch the paint dry than never watch this movie again ...
