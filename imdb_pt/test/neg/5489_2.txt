Illuminata extended the limits of John Turturro's mediocrity, from second-rate actor to director, writer and third-rate producer. This movie was terrible. It is disjointed and flows from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main plot. <br /> <br /> We are served with a miscellany of fragmented scenes, each one a non sequitur of all the others. The only topic that seems to go through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatrical repertory company. The few scenes that matter to the plot are so complicated that you often can not tell if the dialogue is history or if the actors perform their lines for the play within the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were a person, it would be a schizophrenic with multiple personality disorders. He could not decide whether it was a drama, a novel, a comedy, a tragedy, a sexual farce or a parody of theater. It came closer to being bearable as a sexual farce. <br /> <br /> Turturro was lifeless and impassive as Tuccio, supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose piece has its big chance when the currently running show needs to be canceled due to the disease of the lead actor. Susan Sarandon did a good performance as the elderly actress trying to seduce Tuccio into a role. Unfortunately, she found it necessary to go topless which only serves to illustrate that the hardware of the aged sexual symbols is much better left to the imagination. Christoher Walkin made a delightful performance as a theater critic who makes passionate openings to a cast member. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also played minor roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a vignette 2. In addition to the Walken, there is not much to recommend except that the puppets wore at the opening and closing. the credits were phenomenally alive and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague it is. <br /> <br />
