Greyfriars Bobby was not a westie - Bobby was a skye terrier. A highlight of my childhood day trips to Edinburgh was to go to the monument to Bobby. I grew up with the story of the brave and loyal puppy, like all the kids of my generation, and I remember lining up with my mother out of the movies - with many, many other Dundee children and their mothers - to see the wonderful Disney. movie. How could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a Westie, for God's sake? It's like making a movie about the life of Robert Burns, for example, and portraying him as an Englishman. I say, give Bobby back to your race!
