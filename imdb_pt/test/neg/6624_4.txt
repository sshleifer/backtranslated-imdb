People do not seem to agree with me that movies can be good and bad at the same time. The same type of person who sees a film with Carrot Top on the cover, surfs in an office and continues to watch the movie with serious expectations. Is Carrot Top Funny? Of course not. Was this movie something special? Of course not. It was a stupid movie and everyone took it so simply based on what they know about Mr. Top. Films like this one, or Kazaam, or Killer Klowns From Outer Space and almost any movie that Pauly Shore was in, should not be taken seriously and because of that they should not be considered the worst movies ever made. . You watch them or waiting for a stupid movie that's hilariously bad or you're six and you genuinely think Carrot Top is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Please people if you know that the Carrot Top is retarded and you want to watch a serious movie and bother writing a serious review .... I do not watch it. Choosing in this movie is like choosing a 5-year-old for not knowing the alphabet.
