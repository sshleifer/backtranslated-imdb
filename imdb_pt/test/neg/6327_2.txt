Ok, the only reason I watched this movie is because Krista Allen is in it. Since I admit to watching Days of our lives ... I know her as Billie. Oh, of course, maybe there's a reason to watch this movie ... that would be the area of ​​pornography. They seem to exhale it. And little more. I hope someone renting / buying this movie rents it just for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rented it for anything else, they say quality tv, they may die of a heart attack. This movie involves little imagination. Although I have a good laugh of stupidity, and maybe I buy myself, I'm just a fool. Rent before you buy in this. 2 of 10. (Note that I still have to give a movie to 1 star.) The sensual scene only gave itself and above a 1. if they did not have a straight 1 in the pot and I want a refund if it did not have t .)
