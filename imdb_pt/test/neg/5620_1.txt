Who wrote this movie? A 15-year-old uninspired kid? <br /> <br /> It could have been written by one of the children who did the Columbine shot. <br /> <br /> Totally meaningless, not funny, boooooooriiing ... <br /> Plus: the French do not put their flag everywhere. You do not enter a French bank and see the tricolore flag displayed like this. Even on the day of the Bastille. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the bloodbath thing. It's just that none of this is credible or funny. Or parody, or anything like that. <br /> <br /> Okay, anyone who likes this movie will say that I must be some kind of fascist, so forget about my comment.
