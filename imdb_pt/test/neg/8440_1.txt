this was absolutely the most tragic pile of movies I've ever witnessed. not only was the name a complete misnomer - since the film has almost nothing to do with piranhas - but the acting is as empty and obsolete as trying to actually do some kind of plot. when you watch this movie, you can not miss every second you're wondering when you're fed up and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately I waited until the end in my case. It's two hours of my life that I will never be able to recover.
