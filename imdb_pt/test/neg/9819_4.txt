Disappointing film with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to assassinate Hitler. When he is discovered, he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted under orders from England. His refusal to sign the document leads us to the plot of the film. Pidgeon is chased back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohort, John Carradine, who speaks little, but is again as ever, the embodiment of evil personified. <br /> <br /> Along the path of being chased, Pidgeon meets Joan Bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent. <br /> <br /> History somehow ties in, love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War II, realism becomes the object of the day. <br /> <br /> The near-final scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is well done, but we know where that arrow goes. <br /> <br /> Very interesting is that while Pidgeon is fleeing from Nazi Germany, he meets again with a young Roddy McDowall, one of the many co-protagonists of Pidgeon the same year. memorable "as green was my voucher." How green was "Man Hunt"?
