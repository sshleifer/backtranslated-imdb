I found this movie to be mainly a POSIT was low budget, but that's not the problem. It's the problem, the movie is just lame. It does not really much sense.yes, it explains why things happened, but it is not That's what I mean. There was no reason at all. The film also moved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than that. Besides, I think they went to sea in the midst of the deaths. That meant they were very rude, but the killer seemed to spend a lot of time crushing his victim in the head, or stabbing his victim. maybe I'm being mean, but I just did not like the movie. The whole thing looked like a lower-rate version of "When a Stranger Calls" and maybe that was the main point. but, what for me "When A Weird Kills" is a 4/10 *
