It is a pity that someone so idolized by many children, as well as parents, should step down when he appears in this exploiting and bouncing trap. I often wonder if Mr. Wisdom, in his later years, recalled his apology for a movie with some pride. At least Sally Geeson had the decency to retire to do something worthwhile after appearing in this low-budget junk. A cameo of some long-forgotten pop called The Pretty Things can not rescue the movie from its horrifying. If you want nostalgia from the '60s, invest in "Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush," starring Barry Evans and Sally's sister, Judy.
