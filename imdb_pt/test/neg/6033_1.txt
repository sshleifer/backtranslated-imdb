This has some of the most stupid fighting scenes of all time. If I were a veteran of any war, I would cry when I saw this movie, not because I would remember being in Vietnam, but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war. Even though the troops are carrying M16s, this movie does not look anything like Vietnam. The Viet Cong uniforms look like Japanese uniforms reminiscent of a World War II movie. The setting is obviously a crappy Hollywood back lot. The worst scene contains a US soldier fighting "hand in hand" like in a bad martial arts movie. After he dispatches several enemy troops, he says, "Hey, get down here and we'll kick some ass!" for a helicopter in the air. He is then shot. This movie is crap.
