"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is an urban version of "Willard". I can not believe this movie was made, much less distributed. Someone at Universal Studios thought people watched and liked this "movie." The only good thing about it is Ice-T as the landlord. He was funny. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hate about movies is accelerated action. Once or twice is bad enough, but the whole movie is like that. Each scene transition is a special fast-moving effect. The director must be banned from making movies forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
