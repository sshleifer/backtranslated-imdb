I'm so disappointed. After waiting for 3 years for replays / the DVD of the original series "Darkplace" I could not wait for this series. The first episode is over and I'm shocked. Everything that was great about Darkplace has been deleted here, basically. Worst introduction: canned laughter. this removes the original point and only makes it almost unattainable. (a joke about Garth's eyes fertilizing the audience was good ... the rest I can barely remember ...) seems like a bad quality "Knowing Me, Knowing You". I hope this improves as the series continues, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You are the most compassionate man I have ever known, and I know God ..."
