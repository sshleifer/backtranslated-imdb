This is the film is rubbish, it looked very funny in the previews, but I did not laugh once throughout the movie. Do yourself a great favor and do not waste your money on it, do not spend anyone's money on it. I gave a 1/10 believe me I would have given less if I could have. I'm a 15 year old and I thought it was crap if you want to see a good movie come out and see Jay and Silent Bob fight back.
