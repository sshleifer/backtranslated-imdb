John Candy was much more a successful comic actor. His death was a tragedy and we all miss him so much, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays a cheat cheater who agrees to take out a group of pioneers from the wild west, is even sadder. I do not understand why it was released. The story is meaningless and weak, and the jokes are not there. It saddens me even more that Candy's latest movie is her worst movie ever. So, let's forget about all this and remind you in your best movies, such as SUMMER RENTAL, PLANS, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILE and TUNNEL BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
