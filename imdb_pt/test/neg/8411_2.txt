Sam O'Steen, the film editor of the superlative 1968 thriller "Rosemary's Baby," directs here a quick TV sequel, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, for Mia Farrow) unfolds early - and inexplicably - presumably to help detail the most macabre aspects of this flabby story about Satan's son on earth. Most interesting is Ruth Gordon's return to her role as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Mill and her husband, Roman), but she does not have much to do - and seems terribly uncomfortable in being involved anyway. . This script is strictly low-income, and should have embarrassed the original author Ira Levin (who went on to write his own sequel). Quite dark and pale, with little photography and no suspense or scares.
