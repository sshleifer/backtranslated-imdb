I remember flipping channels on HBO and I saw that. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There is no excitement in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure) heading for a small town in a trance. She stays with a couple who coincidentally had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townspeople agree that they are alike. The thing is, Laura has been dead for over a year. Her boyfriend disappeared around the time she was murdered, making him look like he killed her. <br /> <br /> While settling in the city for a while, Drew begins to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares can prove that Laura's boyfriend is not the killer, after all. Throughout the film, you discover that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) is the one who raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her. <br /> <br /> The movie is very long and very annoying. The movie just creeps on and on. Surprisingly, I saw another TV movie after that called (Cloned) 1997, which was fine, but I'll review it later. <br /> <br /> I give this film 1 star of 10. Avoid this TV movie. Not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
