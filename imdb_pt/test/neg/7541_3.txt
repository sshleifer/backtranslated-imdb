Herman made his own northern drama with Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula falters in this low-key, flat, planned tale of two delinquent teens trying to get tickets for the season to see Newcastle. <br /> <br /> Truancy, underage smoking and drinking, underage sex, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, substance abuse, depression, child abuse, child sexual abuse, store theft , car theft, violent assault and armed robbery. None of these questions is explored, they serve only to move the story from one implausible situation to another. The film is not as keenly watched as Trainspotting, as poignant as The Full Monty, or as a reflection of times like Wonderland (from which it blatantly steals music in an overly manipulative way). I suspect that none of the filmmakers is from Newcastle, and certainly never experienced the social problems that the film makes reference to. I'm all for entertainment, and Herman's background shows that he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. It simply appears incredibly short here. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good ending, but there are many flat and banal moments to sit to get there. Well filmed, not very well represented and finally fails in three crucial points: script, screenplay, screenplay.
