Although this is not one of Miss. Davies, it's too bad. And it's sad that, in a revisionist way, recent IMDb reviewers have deliberately over-inflated scores on some of their films to make up for the fact that they've been overlooked in the past - or so it seems. For years, conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible actress and only got the papers she got because her boyfriend, William Randolph Hearst, bought his way to Hollywood. This is certainly the image created in CITIZEN KANE, by Orson Welles. It is true that Hearst used his considerable wealth and influence to build Davies' career. With all that money, it's not surprising that she made great films and it's no wonder people get stuck because of all the extra attention she got. Sleeping with the man who finances his films is bound to be noticed. However, despite this advantage, she also made quite a few bad movies and I think we really need to balance when it comes to the scores of her movies. After all, no rational person could believe that as of today (05/01/08), PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies films recently shown in Turner Classic Movies (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserved the exceptionally high scores - classify them above such films as HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES and EVERYTHING QUIET ON THE WEST FRONT !! In fact, MARIANNE would now be the fifth best film of all time, according to IMDb, with a score of 8.8! Considering most people out there do not even know who Marion Davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters, this is a serious problem! However, she was a far better actress than CITIZEN KANE implied and initially broke the films before she started sleeping with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes PEG O 'MY HEART from the other two films is that MARIANNE and FLORODORA GIRL were nice little films - while PEG O' MY HEART is, in a way, simply terrible. Much of the reason was Marion's awful miscast. While her French accent in MARIANNE was cute, in PEG her Irish accent sounded bizarre - not particularly Irish. Plus, and maybe I'm wrong, but her continued use of the word 'ye' makes her look like she should be doing Shakespeare, not a movie set in 1933 in Ireland! In addition, there was a bizarre insistence that Marion should be the consummate multi-talented star - so they made her not only act but dance and sing. The song really fit the scripts of some of his films, but here it seemed out of place and seriously undermined the film. It sounded like you could almost hear Hearst yelling "look - she's a great actress - watch her sing and dance." Unfortunately, Marion seemed uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes. But for me, the biggest problem was the idea of ​​Marion, 36, playing such a young role. It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film should be like what Mary Pickford played in her teens and teen years - complete with pig's tail and brave attitude. Miss Pickford COULD take on these roles, though she was not a girl either. But here, Marion had a little weight and looked at least 30. No offense - she looked fine for her age - but she did not look like a teenager! Strangely, with the millions Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money was a good script and one that fit Marion's talents. Believe me, I evaluated several of her very high films (I particularly love SHOW PEOPLE), but here she just could not help but fail - this movie was a turkey.
