As other reviewers have noted, this movie is a cross between (ie stolen) stories we've seen before. Specifically, this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max. Take out Clint's cigar and replace it with a cigarette; take the horse from him and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voila, an up-to-date wanderer. In this movie, the "hero" is even more blatantly a "Savior" than the High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers a wound on the left, and his entrance into the city is preceded by a request for "salvation" by the city's residents - a very transparent reference to a "Second Coming." I watched the movie on a hot, humid morning. Sleeping was impossible, and when it appeared at 4:30 in the morning, there was nothing on TV. So the film served its purpose. Although not original, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the movie is still a little fun ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
