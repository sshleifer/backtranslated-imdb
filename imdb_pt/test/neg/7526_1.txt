H.G. Wells is spinning. No doubt. <br /> <br /> Actually, this would be a decent sci-fi / adventure film, if it had not been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. The result was pathetic and simplistic bastardization. <br /> <br /> Romance is a great science fiction story, but what many people miss when they read (probably because they read when they are very young). is that it is overflowing with social commentary. Eloi and Morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of Victorian England, and the overall message of the film is that ALL DECAÇÕES E DEGENERADOS, a satirical coup of Victorian complacency and its belief that its civilization would last forever. There is no love story or romance with a beautiful Eloi woman ... In the novel, Eloi are infantile beings three feet high with a mental capacity not much higher than that of an animal. The Time Traveler befriends an Eloi woman, but of course he thinks of her more as a pet, and anyway she is dead before the romance ends. <br /> <br /> This movie first tries to give us a stupid stupid story totally stupid. "because he wants to travel in time." The novel and the lessons he must learn are enough to make movie fans vomit. <br /> <br /> The journey to the future is punctuated by a future disaster. OK, not bad, but it would have had more impact if we were allowed to see that humanity generally degenerates, as in the book. Another reflection of the times, I think, when George Pal's version had a nuclear war. <br /> <br /> The general story? Ugh A total misrepresentation of the novel. The Eloi are very competent and bellicose. Morlocks are very intelligent. UberMorlock is a constraint and there is no configuration. He only appears in time to be killed. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mumba is fine. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he often seems confused and in pain. (They say he broke a rib while filming it.) He also looks unhealthy and excessively thin, as if he's been sick for a long time before doing it. <br /> <br /> A sad and sad version of a movie. the classics of the world. H. G. Wells deserves better ... MUCH better. <br /> <br />
