Not as bad as "Nails" from 1992 (where Hopper plays an "unstable" cop), but really bad. How can a movie with such a big cast be so wrong? This movie manages to find a way. The story was very stupid and Hopper's direction looked like he'd never driven before. All the long shots in the beginning were uncomfortable. Lots of nonsense scenes with lots of nonsense dialogues.
