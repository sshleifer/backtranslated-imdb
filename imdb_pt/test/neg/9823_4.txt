Hellboy revolves around classic lines of comics / action / superheroes. Essentially, Hellboy is a type of demon that found its way on earth. He is educated as a child by a priest and within a governmental society and chose to protect the people of the earth from the supernatural, rather than being a threat (the normal career route to a demon). <br /> <br /> The montage of history involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's absurd, but the whole idea of ​​a demon wandering the streets as well. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how well they were treated. The sequences are straightforward and very entertaining. Actually, opening is the best part of the movie, that's the problem. <br /> <br /> Essentially Del Toro, who both writes and directs this play, bottles it. The film is absent from any tension or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible in the first act and so the rest of the film is composed of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rude because we know that Hellboy will inevitably be well and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action / hero movie. Well, yes it is, but once we're drawn to a well-made action movie, we can not help but feel that the hero might die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks like he's going to die everywhere. He escapes death by the finest margins. Are bets raised as your spouse is also in danger etc etc? Terminator and Terminator work because in both cases the villain is far superior to the hero. The threat and tension are constant. <br /> <br /> Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. The characters usually disappear and reappear when their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in perhaps three scenes. He has no motive. Increase unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the only scene that Hellboy seems to face a real threat (groups of monsters), a character releases his abilities - the screen turns white and inexplicably, the monsters are dead, but everyone lives. A lesser character established in an annoying and underdeveloped love story becomes the key to the movie's completion. Your character is so thin, the relationship so underdeveloped. It is clear that she is nothing more than a kind of support to push the plot and to make everything sense. I do not want to ruin the end of the movie, but essentially a character who is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from poor dialogue and a lining that simply is not smart or funny. After a while, everything starts to creak. <br /> <br /> What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever has made the creative decision to make the primary weapon of hellboy, a weapon instead of his arm, should be fired. Essentially, the use of the weapon weakens the concept of the film, degrading the struggles for nothing more than a one-sided shooting. <br /> <br /> The few positives include: Cinematography is very good. At all times, a sense of humor is established by dark lighting and by the palette of darker colors. As well as the use of interesting places. However, maybe it's all a bit too. <br /> <br /> The use of CGI and Fx is well done. We never received an excessive load. When effects are used, they are well used and the sense of realism is maintained. Quite akin to how Nolan used FX in Batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a very poor movie. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted too much potential. Hellboy as a character has many instantly fascinating dimensions that are completely unexplored. The movie has the ability to watch, in the sense that if it appears on TV and nothing else is connected, it may be worth watching. But in any other situation I would not bother with it.
