This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to see. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection reaching the planet Earth with MS rupture is fairly fair, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a 155F lift? The performance was so terrible that I had the feeling that the pitching agents simply picked up a handful of people from Boulevard Santa Monica and threw them in front of the camera. In all honesty, I have seen less of the wood acting on my ironing board. Sorry, this movie was poor, poor and poor.
