I could not. I was bored not only because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a movie b, whose plot was all about cannibalism, but the fact that I was watching a foreign movie with caption, which did not bother me at all , but was STILL nicknamed. <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were terrible. When the back of the plane splits, you can see that the model is hollow when it "breaks" in the fictitious snow. Most of the film takes place on a sound stage that is clearly not real and almost looks like a play, since the "sounds" of snow blowing are heard, but not in the scene. "But as they have no food" a military person (it is never clear what this guy does or why he is in charge) says, that I'm sure no one ever really said or even said he thought of food, since they were worried if people were alive, not how they would eat. It was simply a stupid line written to indicate that, yes, they would have to eat the corpses to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the bodies, a man finds a shirtless body, which despite being in the snow for a long time, is not remotely frozen, in fact, its flesh is very flexible and fresh. It cuts the fresh meat off its back, which again, is not frozen or even cold, and this scene continues for five minutes. That's where I had to stop. The remake "Alive" was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that I'm sure the true survivors lauded while I can not imagine either of them had something good to say about this version. It was simply about eating corpses and everything else was secondary. Avoid.
