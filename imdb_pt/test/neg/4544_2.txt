Woof! Very annoying, and they might as well have filmed in black and white, it was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a text explaining the cryogenics, and asking if God or Satan is behind it. There are some protests outside a cryogenic laboratory. Some people rob a bank, and many of the thieves and guards are shot. The father of one of the thieves (I think) makes his son freeze. There are many jumps in the beginning, from scene to scene, introducing characters without us knowing how they relate. <br /> <br /> There is a power outage, and cans containing frozen people are struck by lightning, and they emerge as zombies. They are all wearing silver suits like mylar, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (you have no idea why they look so bad - being frozen evidently does not preserve their appearance), and they have silver eyes. They've been killing people, sometimes rocking like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair keeps popping up from time to time, for what purpose I'm not sure. I think your character works in the cryogenic laboratory, but she's not very important to the plot, and her role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with some frozen pictures with subtitles that tell us what happened to the next characters, who are very silly.
