This movie may have some historical significance, and it certainly seems surprising how well the facts are together, the scenery, the rocket, the space suits, the moon surface, they all shout "a classic" - but in the end, the result makes a really boring movie for today's eyes, and the 50's technological scenes that you can expect in a movie like this are not far enough to reward the rude dialogue and predictable plot developments. The characters and plot can reward a scientific sociological analysis, but have little entertainment value often. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie seems to be a good movie for nine-year-olds. Mature themes, human drama and violence are kept at an ideal level for children as well. The images of the Earth and the Moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than those in "2001", but hence their use is drastically inefficient. Especially in 2001 may it seem like a prolonged meditation on the themes of this film, and somehow Star Wars did not model its opening titles in the opening titles of this film? But again - the inheritance is marginal. <br /> <br /> If it's a mature and mega-influential Sci-Fi classic from the 1950s, you're looking for, check out "Forbidden Planet."
