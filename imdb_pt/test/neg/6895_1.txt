By the 1980s, the name Godfrey Ho was attached to a series of low-comedy action movies starring an actor with the unlikely name Elton Chong. "Although there are no masterpieces of the genre, they remain surprisingly entertaining films for those with a high tolerance for nonsense. <br /> <br /> It is unclear why Ho (or who) would like to make a film that could attack Jackie Chan's Drunken Mister, which legitimized the production of comedic action films in Hong Kong, that is, a savage attack on Chan's film (the imitation of Chan starring in this movie learns to make his opponents burst into laughter to death - a useless device in any genre) Along with all the flaws that one expects from a film of Godfrey Ho of this period - no continuity, no motive, incomprehensible plot, irrelevant and unbelievable characters - the film suffers from two unforgivable imperfections that effective mind make it unattainable: fight scenes are bad and comedy is not funny. <br /> No sense.
