I'm sorry to say that this movie was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. After one of the biggest disappointments in the history of movie monsters, you would think they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel fits into many of the same traps, the plot was completely forced, the dialogue was so bad that the film could be better in the dumb, and the action was planned and away from the heart brilliance of each original monster movie. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually the trailer, which as you go through the movie ends up realizing that almost all the killings and all the cool scenes of the movie have already been shown in the trailer, which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about. I gave the film an extra star by letting the extra hot female almost naked. the film unfolded as a party color-by-number science fiction monster that also touched on the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened because you had seen it thousands of times before. The main failure of these two films is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us more interested in the story, as if one day could happen to us. but what attracted people when they launched the arcade game in the past was that it happened in a futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy, which allowed yet another suspension of disbelief. this is where future films need to be inspired. because to be honest, seeing a waitress killed by the alien that everyone fears from childhood does not do that for us. Let's take the series back to its roots. learn from the old masters and not mess with a winning formula, trying to make a "bold new vision" we like the originals for a reason, we want to see it again. Finally, the end is the real moment of the WTF of the whole movie, * SPOILER * after the great climax, the survivors are ambushed by Special-Ops soldiers who justify their terrible actions saying "we were following orders" and then they connect a penny and begin to act well and are transformed into saviors. after the long pull back with one of the survivors staring grimly into the sky, we cut to the strangest bizarre cliffhanger I've ever seen, with characters you've never seen in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) subtlety of a punch in the face reveal that there will be yet another movie with the suggestion of a plot that would make an original film of the sci-fi channel flush and turn its nose. So, in short, if you have to choose between this movie and do any other activity on the face of the Earth, skip the movie and do the other thing.
