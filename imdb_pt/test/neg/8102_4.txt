This was a weird movie. A bit of horror and certainly film noir. Some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in their hands after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) appears. <br /> <br /> Soon, the Lone Ranger arrives in the person of FBI agent Richard 'Dick' Martin. (Clayton Moore) Martin is ineffective in finding the killer as he is most interested in the niece (Joan Barclay) of a missing doctor who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last man dies, and the doctor is horribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that's where it gets interesting and strange. I will not spill it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was wonderful as the elusive killer.
