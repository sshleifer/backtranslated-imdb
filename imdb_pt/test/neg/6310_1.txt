I have not seen this movie for years, but the horrible "taste" of Quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. Some commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis "for a tee", but the fact is he only seems to have the most extreme Jerry stage in mind. No one acts this way all the time, and performance seems derisory, reducing Lewis to a cheeky caricature. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the debris of over-action. <br /> <br /> The author of the book is based on (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who wrote several good musical biographies. (I particularly liked "Dino" in Dean Martin); In the books, Tosches gives us a complete human being, both separated and involved in the "biz". Quaid's acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like that, no one would bother to stay near them. As the cartoons go, it's kind of fun, but other than that, it's one of the most notorious movie-destroying performances I've had the "honor" to watch. Terrible...
