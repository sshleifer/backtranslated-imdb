I thought the film had an interesting name and could be triggered, but I was wrong. This movie was boring, especially at the beginning and in the middle. I can not comment on the ending because I just could not bear to watch the whole movie. The premise of signing a researcher-student just because he enters his lab does not make sense. This student had an interesting type of robot moving in his apartment and unfortunately this thing does not live is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So if you are having problems with sleep then I recommend that you rent this movie.
