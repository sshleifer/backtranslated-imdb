OK, we have 4 city electricians who find a nuclear mini-reactor, turns it into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant queen also from a parallel universe, who managed to escape with some of his relatives to dominate the Earth. , but is she the only one left? If so, why did the rest of humanity not join and persecute it? In addition, what happened to the military, by no means a few billion and more of ammunition could have been used and why hiding in a basement when much more defensible places had to be available. Also it is not an excavation in city workers, but how did they know what a mini-nuke reactor looked like and as if they did not have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the crack? Sorry, but there was nothing kind about the movie
