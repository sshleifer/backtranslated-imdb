This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. And this is compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The New World. <br /> <br /> I should go back to the blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes I was zooming in on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be off the screen. I did not think it was possible to make such a bad movie these days, I was wrong. As I type this message, I thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke this Christmas. I'm blaming Mrs. For this one while she picked it, thank you, baby. <br /> <br /> Be warned ....... A real shock everywhere !!!!!!
