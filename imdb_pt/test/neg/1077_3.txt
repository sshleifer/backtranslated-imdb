"The Italian Job" is a caper movie made by numbers. Mounted on the back of each caper cliché, it does not rise to particular heights and will be a film footnote by the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "The Italian Work" has no imagination. at all. I've seen it all before and did better then. The acting is good, the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film does not break any new field at all. <br /> <br /> Let's point out the clichés: <br /> <br /> - figure of the criminal father of the "old school" and his protégé <br /> <br /> - another gang member jealous of protected <br /> <br /> - a double cross <br /> <br /> - only thugs use guns while good-looking criminals do not have to <br /> <br /> - good criminals always deceive the thugs <br /> <br /> And that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the scenes of assault and car chase, supposedly the highlight of the film, seem pretty common. This is especially true since they appeared in the movie trailers so I already knew what to look for. For me, a movie only works if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, this could be done without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. Parts of The Italian Job just play out the window, with computers doing things computers can not do, the good guys hitting no one with whom they drive (especially down the stairs) and not a single police car responding to the street. explosions, minis recklessly or even a low-flying helicopter. It must be a city for these things not to give an answer. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable with the team (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is very clever as the hero "cool guy" while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called to show some kind of break. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows the shortcomings of Wahlberg every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a rather uninteresting movie. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls who really love this movie, which I can understand to some extent, but there are so much better capo-films out there - even the dullness of the recent "Ocean's Eleven" outweighs the non-event that is " The Italian Job ". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> In conclusion, take a moment to think about what will happen to the Norton character. Do we pretend to be cheering the good guys for causing his death, especially because it seems to be long and painful? He did not deserve this, creep pretending he was. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
