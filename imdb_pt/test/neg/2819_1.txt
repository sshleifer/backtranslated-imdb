This movie was absolute rubbish. The director and stars (?) Should be banned from making movies forever. The thin-film plot concerns a despicable director portrayed by the director of the sleazy (now this is acting) internet advertising for women to star in a snuff film. <br /> <br /> There's no horror at all, the girls look tired and bored, the direction is meaningless, the music is shuffled (heavy metal in a library scene?), and the lighting is awful. The director should have changed some more shopping trolleys full of aluminum cans and got a script, sober actors and some lamps. As it is, this is a disgusting, nasty and useless mess of a movie.
