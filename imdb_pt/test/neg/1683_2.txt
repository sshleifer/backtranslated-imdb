I jumped for joy knowing that this show was over. The characters in this show were extremely annoying. None of them had a redeeming quality. Damon Wayans is probably the most reliable. Kisha Campbell is ... Kisha Campbell. She's as annoying as she was in Martin. <br /> <br /> Children are very annoying too. The older one is an idiot, the older one is a brat and the younger one is frustrating to hear. <br /> <br /> I think I liked the smart little boy. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> You did the world a favor when you finished. <br /> <br /> Let's pray that a Wayan will never star in another show ... NEVER.
