My first impression when I read the synopsis of the next movie was that it would be very, very different from the book. The movie trailer said the movie was supposed to happen when Vivian turned 19 after her parents were killed in a fire in the United States. She meets Aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. Working at a chocolate shop on the day, she must accept that she will never be normal, because every full moon, she becomes a loup-garou - a mythical creature that can be likened to a werewolf. Most of the small changes did not sound too bad to me, though I'm a fan of the book with the title shared by Annette Curtis Klause. I knew it would be different but I wanted to see this to support the book, thinking that a change of age, a change of scenery and some minor changes of occupation would not affect the plot as a whole enough to make me want to rip my eyes out of their orbits and leave me bleeding on the floor of the cinema. <br /> <br /> The film unnecessarily killed many important characters, one of them Esme, Vivan's mother, soon face the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. I pushed it aside and ventured into the movie, tired and slightly irritated. Running through Romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was ... interesting ... but left me with the impression, "Why does Vivian look like this, and why is she using a hooded sweatshirt. "Jumping to later parts of the movie, I must say that I'm surprised that the scriptwriters seemed to support incest in a way and instead of joining the book's character relationship between Vivian and Rafe, the leader of the Five now (astonished!) Aunt Astrid, who in the novel was the bitter and hated rival of Vivan's mother, and, I might add, has no relation to any of them. <br /> <br /> Despite character distortions, Gabriel somehow became the leader of the pack and obsessed with Vivian being his companion so they could fulfill some non-existent prophecy. His physical appearance not only took a total of 180 out of the description in the book, he was apparently also Rafe's father. Yes, that's right, it's a small incestuous wolf pack, all rolled up. Little things that bothered me were scenes like the hunts in the woods. There was a redhead who stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed his enemy" before his prey was released to run and be hunted. Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I suppose my mind is not wide enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why it existed besides kissing beautiful victims. <br /> <br /> I loved how Amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. I loved how legally intertwined was Aiden's past, what between the supposedly dramatic scene in which he was telling Vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father "in self-defense" to make him look like a tragic character. <br /> <br /> The 180s character is a lot of fun when it's completely unnecessary. At the end of the movie, it felt like a person flipping through the novel, scrawled half the list of character names, made some connections here and there, mentioned that Gabriel was a bit of an idiot, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he fears her when he finds out she is a loup-garou of legends, and "someone" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is some sort of happy ending because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her for who she is. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 2/10 because the camera outlets were relatively decent, and the cast might have been worse, but as far as the direction was concerned, why did the lupe-garotoso jump on the air in human form, as if they wanted to fly (with their arched backs and propensity to jump from high places), shine briefly, and then fall to the ground like wolves? The only aspects of this film that even made me watch it at such a sordid and sad end were the wolves, the beautiful landscape and the boys with the cute eyes. <br /> <br /> All together, I must say that in order to enjoy this film, one must be prepared for misunderstandings, strange events that are not always explained, incestuous insinuations and that either did not like the book or did not read the book .
