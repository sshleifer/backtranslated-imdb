I know it's a little unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the whole piece - but I'm going anyway! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give time. I think 20 minutes is enough time to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laughter never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid mood, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. It is nowhere near this high degree. Let me fix this, it's just * stupid * - not a stupid mood. They may have intended certain scenes to be funny, but they were not. I suppose if you were really bored, you could somehow mix the movie with a hallucination and end up with a slightly fun experience. <br /> <br /> A very pathetic effort.
