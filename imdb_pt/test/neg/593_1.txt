I'm completely into that kind of plot, but once the movie went off, I honestly said out loud, "I just rented a two-dollar Christian POS." The only thing I found to like this movie was that it has a history of descent, but it was terribly run. Horrible actors, horrible direction and production. <br /> <br /> The director and producer need to watch the cube before trying to make a movie in one room. There was absolutely nothing that puzzled him to the point where you did not realize he was in the same room as the entire movie. Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell they were the director counting to hold your attention. But these two and their biographies can talk about it, they're horrible in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Do not rent it. Unless you're blind because you can climb some stars if you just listen.
