A tedious effort by the not-yet-great director Budd Boetticher and beautiful but still non-quarreling actress Nina Foch, this movie is, like one of the other commentators, the quintessence of a certain type of B movie. Not the good kind. And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic storyline - Nina, a nurse on wartime leave because of her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a colleague at the resort where she is taking the time to breathe and realizes that he is in the dream, despite never having met him before. Meanwhile, our smart guy is working as a spy, and is about to go on an extra secret, secret mission that should not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are Nazis. And draw holes. And smart people acting in a way more prone to make them into totally unnecessary scratches, so that the execution time can be exceeded in an hour. In the end, the film becomes a dispute between which group of spies can act more foolishly. If the FBI and the OSS had acted like this crew, we would have lost the war in 42 years. The film itself is a very direct shot (despite the best efforts of the smoke machine) and acting - as it seems to be in many of the Columbia Bs that TCM has been showing lately - is curiously uncommitted. It's less stylized than what you would find in a Warner Bros. movie, but less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Boetticher's strength, of course, is a de facto style that allows for strong stories and acting in his Randolph Scott westerns to come to the surface. Perhaps the problem here is that such a style will not work when the script sucks and the actors get tired of their five movies a year.
