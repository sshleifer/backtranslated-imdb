This is a great movie for ninjas for the first time they are dating. If you are trying to impress some cute little ninjette I recommend playing this masterpiece. It's one of those special movies that allows you to lose large parts of it without interfering with the plot. <br /> <br /> I was also wondering, where does a Teal ninja hide? Are ninjas color coded like this? This is normal? If I were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas, I would have laughed before succumbing to his sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my black ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, it was very good. I found many questions about how to "peek" around and look bad. It's all about the eyebrows and the attitude. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film could have been better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or color-coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to avenge him 3. Several monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced by another character 6. The French guy was also a ninja black star 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock were added as "comic" relief. 8. The forces of the ninjas came from the mityclics.
