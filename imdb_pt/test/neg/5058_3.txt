This is not a terrible movie, simply tasteless. The plot is deeply flawed and implausible. He tries to be a number of genres and fails in each of them. It fails as a comedy, as a thriller of suspense and as a horror film. It almost succeeds as science fiction. The direction is uninspired and Katie Holmes, the cute cherub face she is, should be modeling teenage clothes, not acting. The only thing that prevents this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is Helen Mirren. His performance is unbelievably nefarious and worth (almost) suffering with the rest of it. Its ability to transmute from imperious to sympathetic false to manipulate and control its prey shows masterly scope. In addition to the delightful version of Marissa Coughlin's Exorcist, Mirren is the only reason to see this movie. A solid 3.0.
