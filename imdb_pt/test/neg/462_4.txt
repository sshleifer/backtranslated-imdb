The filmmakers apparently had enough money to pay for decent makeup effects, but not enough for a convincingly moving creature. We never get a chance to see the "monster" move from one place to another - whenever that happens (supposedly), the camera focuses on the "terrified" reactions of humans around. And when a man is attacked by him, he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself, lest he fall to the ground. This is still not the worst "Alien" rip-off (the two "Xtro" movies are even worse, for example); In fact, it's fun enough if you have 68 (!!) minutes to spare. (* 1/2)
