Give director Stanley Tong of Super Cop and Jackie Chan in the Bronx, and what do you get? You get a series of kung fu fights and a lack of madness from Magoo. <br /> <br /> The limited storyline has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) placed in an international plot where he steals a world-renowned jewel. Of course he has no idea what he's doing. In fact, he has no idea he had the jewelry. <br /> <br /> Within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. There are some very funny moments, like when he is cooking the chicken. You'll want to be as short-sighted as Magoo. It's a fun movie to watch, but it's a disaster! You have to love Leslie Nielson because he made some very funny movies. This is not his best, but he does a good job playing Magoo. I thought it was a funny movie, and it should be recommended to small children, because they'll probably find it very funny.
