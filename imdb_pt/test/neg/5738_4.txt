I actually got into this movie with some expectations, not because I thought the movie sounded particularly good, but because I'm a fan of Italian exploration films and with a cast that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas starring alongside Oliver Twist, I realized that. it had to be interesting at least. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things going on, but most of the time; is a bland and lifeless movie that is as ridiculous as it is useless. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a boy (Oliver). The twist of the story is that the boy realizes that he would have more fun if he were accepted into the "gang." Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have proven they can hold a movie on their own on numerous occasions, and they have some memorable moments in this film - albeit really for all the wrong reasons. Savalas, in particular, makes a silly portrait of the "bad" criminal. The plot does not flow badly, but as nothing interesting happens, this is not really a positive and unsurprising point of the movie being mediocre. Overall, I can not recommend this movie; may appeal to some for their worship value, but did nothing for me.
