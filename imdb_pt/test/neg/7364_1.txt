The actors were not credible, the story was really weak, totally sap and completely predictable. Really disappointed in Depardieu. It was a shame they did not focus more on the Canadian struggle for independence. We've seen this love story many times before, only with better actors! We had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a little sense of drama! The soundtrack was totally disturbing. The underline slammed his head with sentimentality. But really over. The only thing we discovered was that they let the Indians speak their language. And we find the cinematography of the Indian village relatively realistic.
