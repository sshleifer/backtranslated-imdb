The seven collaborations between director Joseph "von" Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so distinct in appearance and tone, and so different from anything else happening at the time that they almost seem to be a subgenus of their own. Like any genre, they have their masterpieces as well as their absolute turkeys. Time to send Venus Blonde back to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the seductive beating at Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, where Miss Dietrich established her screen image as a cabaret singer and prostitute, someone at Paramount decided it was time for Marlene to play a mother . There is nothing wrong with that in itself; as an actress, she was up to the piece. It's just that nothing else about the format has changed. It's like the blue angel plus a child. Just enough, the story of a woman dragging her son on his despicable escapes is a solid premise for a tragic drama, but that's not how it's done. Dietrich's journey is played as a kind of adventure, using his intelligence and his accomplices to stay ahead of the law. Is not this an insolent example of pre-code libertarianism? it's just bizarrely unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Although we can accept Marlene as a loving mother, there is no way to buy Sternberg as a director of warmth and pungency. Despite being one of the few images for which he also wrote a written credit, Sternberg simply can not get the bow of the story. The emotional reward of the film is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family, but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth retaking. As usual, Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like brothels or lunatic asylums. The Farford house is actually a scary and gloomy environment, and it's a wonder Little Johnny was not wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light on. <br /> <br /> But as anyone familiar with them will know, the point of a Dietrich / Sternberg image is to make Dietrich look fabulous, and in that respect, at least Loire Venus is a success. Marlene is introduced emerging from a puddle of forest in a brilliant and sparkling close-up, and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her. The same can not be said for the rest of the cast, which Sternberg used to see as mobile scenarios. The normally friendly Herbert Marshall is here reduced to a bad mood lurking in the shadows. Even the soft, lively Cary Grant becomes just a boring background bubble, and it does not seem interesting enough for Dietrich to run away. <br /> <br /> The only highlights in Blonde Venus are Marlene's music and dance routines. , especially the renowned Hot Voodoo number, where she parodies her own surreal stage persona when emerging from a gorilla outfit. But even these seem to have been cut and pasted from a different film. Sternberg fans may consider it as another masterpiece, as they usually do, but for the average punter is a big disappointment. Audiences of the time did not cheer when they had their previous successes, and this heralded the beginning of the end for Marlene's boom. A year later, would there be a new queen on Paramount ?? Mae West.
