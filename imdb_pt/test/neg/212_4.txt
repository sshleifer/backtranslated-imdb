Disappointing the assault film, in fact, I was actually expecting a really cool cat and mouse thing going through the movie and it has few of those cat and mouse things going on, but it was pretty stupid. And basically it showed all the good scenes of the trailer, actually, if you saw the trailer of that, you basically saw the whole movie because it's simply predictable. So basically, the plot is about some of the company's armored truck workers trying to steal the $ 42 million they should carry, until one of the members is aware. I thought the movie would be better with the cast of actors known, but I was wrong. I mean, this is not necessarily a bad movie, but it was not as good or deep. This is definitely a rental at best, just not worth seeing it in theaters. assault <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
