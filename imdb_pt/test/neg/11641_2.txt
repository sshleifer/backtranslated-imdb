Why are not there good reviews? Because this movie is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> Situated in a Japanese prison camp in World War II, we have Jim Brown as the hero who faces a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and so hysterical is the way the Japanese officers spot the nose of Jim's character Brown. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie that any of these actors ever made. Stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best thing about the movie, maybe because it has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> It's even hard to sit back and enjoy the mindless fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to convey. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies, and we thought that shit was so stupid like that. It was never popular.
