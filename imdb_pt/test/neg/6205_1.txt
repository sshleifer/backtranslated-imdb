Soon after this movie was released, Salman Khan was given a 6-year prison sentence (Read on to know why I'm mentioning this). <br /> <br /> And I breathed a sigh of relief. that he was arrested for something that because he was a celebrity but I was happy because that meant no more Salman Khan movies, no more his histrionics and nothing more about sensational performances (read Overacting). <br /> <br /> This movie made no sense at all. <br /> <br /> The scene where the boy belonging to one of the family members makes a rocket that has been activated by voice. According to the script of the film, it would persecute anyone. But ultimately he finds only Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well, that's what happened. <br /> <br /> Rocked is otherwise foolishly activated and you have to have an IQ of 0.001 to believe that. Then he chases Salman Khan who was on his water scooter and the pursuit continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show the foolish public. (In my view, all the people who gave this movie 5 or more, unless they are paid to do this.) Another breathtaking scene, unbelievable, was at the end, when all the arrangements about The marriage is made and Salman Khan with Govinda in Disguise arrives and suspends the marriage for another of those highly unwanted songs. Later, even if everything is ready, just a confession from govinda and Katrina Kaif for Father and Bingo from Katrina. All is well and Govinda marries Kartina ... <br /> <br /> It made me wonder if convincing was so easy because they did not do it and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money. <br /> <br /> This movie should avoid and not even think that there is some scene that is worth watching. The plot is very disconnected with characters popping up from nowhere and finally disappearing .. for ex don Choota ... What a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this movie I made a promise that I would not watch Salman Khan Movies for the rest of my life unless I win an Oskar ... (hahahah ... which means I I never watch)
