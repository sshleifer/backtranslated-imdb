I was really prepared to watch when two of the best movie critics marked this movie as a 'laugh'. But the film turned out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home, but you simply can not ignore the flaws and the flaws. <br /> <br /> 1 The missile scene was total stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. Katrina Kaif and Govinda pair were horrible. (He's 49 and she's only 24 ... more than twice her age.) 3. Salman's comedy is less active and more exaggerated. <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good, but they interrupt the rhythm of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes were deliberately tempted by filmmakers to be funny, and 6. History was poor and defective. <br /> <br /> However, there are some advantages: 1. Govinda. Great individual performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are really funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Kattrina Kaif. Looks and Acting continues to improve with each film. <br /> <br /> 4. Sequences Don of Rajpal Yadav. Although underutilized, but hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, 4 good points, 6 bad ones ... this one has 4/10.
