Every great romantic comedy needs a conflict between the romantics leads to suspense, anticipation and fascination for the plot. This story falls flat completely in this area. There is no conflict - at least none that can inhibit the eventual union of the two main characters, and so the suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no fascination at all. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of the friendship at best, and with the talent of these two actors in particular, I was quite surprised. During the film, I expected them to play another piece of chess and talk about the weather rather than seeing any moving passion. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a fan of both actors, I believe the cast of this movie was canceled - or maybe the direction was off base and impacted their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which also may have impacted the performances; Certainly, the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat on the novel. <br /> <br /> This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
