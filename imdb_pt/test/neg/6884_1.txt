I watched this movie (film?) Casually and I never stopped watching because it is so ridiculous that any dog ​​can do this act and will be better than the actors (actors?) Of this bad remake of Fatal Attraction, there is no Direction, no touching , just a copy of Adrian Lyne's movie if you have a question about suicide, watch this and you can choose ... for "yes" <br /> <br /> I can not imagine people who went to the cinema to see this garbage ; maybe someone had an empty afternoon and chose the first movie theater near the house to stay 2 hours with some others to forget the problems but it is difficult to come home relaxed
