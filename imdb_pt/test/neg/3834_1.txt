I think it's been two years since I've seen the movie and to this day it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after seeing this movie was that it was done for some tax reason. So, after all this time I finally spilled my gut;) And now the IMDb says that I have to fill 10 lines with comments: "Sorry, you should provide at least 10 lines in your comment Please return to the edit window (or use the BACK option if this is not a new window). <br /> <br /> Please, there is nothing left to say ... <br /> < Sorry for some english problems.
