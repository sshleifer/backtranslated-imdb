I had watched this as a kid, but not being much of a fan of Jerry Lewis, I had completely forgotten (not that this is memorable). The film revolves around the representation (which seems to be on the curriculum of all comic stars!) - in this case a German official - and although not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (granting a BOMB rating), it's not exactly a classic thing or - certainly links behind Chaplin's THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), even if comparatively narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes before the appearance of the so-called wacky general offer more happiness than forced humor at the expense of the Nazis! <br /> <br /> The film was really the last breath of Lewis during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it is painfully apparent here that his particular mark of foolishness would not have passed in the days of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
