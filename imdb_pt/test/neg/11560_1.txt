Some movies are just silly beyond explanation. This is one of them. Words can not do justice to the acting of wood, the stupid plot and the always predictable result. About the only thing that makes this movie halfway worth watching are the meowing women (and the dumb guy to you, women) in it. The leader of the female warriors and Valeria is quite attractive to the eyes. But that's about all this movie that's going for it. Some absurdity in question: a scene, as they begin to travel to the lair of the Dark, they are moving away from a supposedly destroyed land. But we clearly see a New York from the 80's behind them. About 2/3 of this movie seems to have been filmed in a high school basement. The half-dead puppets look as scary as a sesame street monster. I have to agree with Latronic that so many junk b movies in the 1950s did a better job than that. About the only one I can think of that was not Teens from Outer Space.
