I'm in two minds about following, the film debut of Christopher Nolan. Part of me admires her for costing $ 6,000 to make, but part of me hates it for being too much a house of art. In many ways, it reminds me of the cult PI movie, a movie I did not like, and I can not understand my central plot of a man who wants to be a writer following the people around. Would not it be more logical for someone who wants to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write? <br /> <br /> Well, I think FOLLOWING gives indie filmmakers hope that just because they made a film without a budget costing $ 6,000 more than two thousand members of IMDB will vote for it and more than five hundred members will comment on but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well seen if it was not done by MEMENTO's director?
