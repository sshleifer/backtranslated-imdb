I just got back from "AGS". After seeing it, I am convinced that no matter how much it is written as he extensively researched the movie, Stone NEVER watched an NFL game in his life. Great cinematography? Give me some time. The montages of the game were almost impossible to see and 90% of the other scenes in the movie were close-ups. Was there anything in this movie that was not mentioned in "North Dallas Forty"? <br /> <br /> Aging the star ... check it out. Young hot shot .... check it out. Analgesics ... check it out. Owner who does not "get it" .... check it out. Crazy off-field behavior .... Also, it's the playoffs in Dallas (ie December or January) at an outdoor stadium, but people sitting there in tops and shorts ! And what about those lights? Were they playing at a Japanese Kabuki theater or a sports stadium? <br /> <br /> And the strategy shown in the game was laughable. It's the fourth and the first inside the "Sharks". 30. Dallas leads from 35 to 31. CHANGE THE FRITURING FIELD OBJECT. Not only would this make sense in football, but you would have an even better final sequence where you could have scored and have to go for the colon conversion. Hell, tie the game w / the extra point and Stone could have done an even 3 hours with overtime. <br /> <br /> Were the lame mounts of football players "old times" supposed to be a tribute to the game? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> And the script ... ugh. More cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there is another. <br /> <br /> "Slapshot" was better than this movie. By far. <br /> <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Ignore this at all costs. <br /> <br />
