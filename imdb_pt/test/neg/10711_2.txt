Manufacturers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them in the hope that, with a little time, they will convince you that it is possible. Unfortunately, with the TV movies, it seems that they set out to make cheap movies for Cosmo. With a small budget and big claims, you should spend every penny on the details to convince the public. Not here though. The movie earns some points for the good performance that the two top ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately is not enough to save the day. oh, and how much less said about the end, the better. Happy Movie - Seeing Everyone!
