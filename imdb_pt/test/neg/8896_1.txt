Hey, I know Angel is not the kind of show that gives people a happy ending, and I know they could not just do everything perfect, but I could not believe the ending for Angel. I absolutely love the show, it's possibly the best show of all time. However, I really hated this ending, as did the second part of Angel's fifth season (similar to Buffy Season 7). My favorite character deaths were very unhelpful and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters on the show, and as soon as she and Angel finally got together, she turned all evil into a demon. I really wanted to have her back, do not get me wrong, the episode where Cordelia returns is fantastic, but I was still very angry that she was gone. So on earth was Fred dying shortly after she finally arrived with Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was useless, did nothing for the plot, and the blue-haired demon girl is a horrible and useless character. They spent much of the weekend centered around it. Another major problem is that they do not connect the elements well enough. I know those guys in that black thorn wanted to bring on the apocalypse, but there was not even a set date for when it should happen. The apocalypse should have been performed and discovered throughout the season, rather than just mentioning that there are some evil guys an hour before the end of the season. One of the biggest problems is that every character the audience cares about is dead or has nothing to live for. My three favorite characters died, and Angel, Spike and Gunn (which I'm not sure do not even survive) have no office, they're not even back to help the helpless, they're in the middle of a great battle and they've lost everyone they care about . Angel and Spike are never redeemed, they lose the girl they care about, and almost everyone is dead, and they have yet to fight against this strange army of evil. I get the whole, you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to end it right in the middle. There could have been some redemption, with the knowledge that there would always be many more battles to come. I do not understand why this episode is so well rated because I think the ending of Buffy was 10 times better, and I was not even a giant fan of that. Because they had to slip in the end, season 3 and 4 and the first half of five were so incredible, so they went and messed up the show.
