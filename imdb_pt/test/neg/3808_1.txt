another eli roth in manufacturing. self promotion, bad script written excuse for a director of terror. The winner is as far away from the new icon of terror as Mary Poppins (reference to the Disney score). what's going on here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing that crap and chitty chitty bang bang. Can this even be called horror? horrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. David Lynch should prosecute them for stealing the prosthetics of the elephant men. please stop with those fans who want to be directors now. video directors already have enough competition to invade the film industry. getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true. stop insanity. I work in the industry and yes, these films are fun to work with, but they are rarely fun to watch.
