This is a great example of a filthy bad movie. There are movies worse than this (Titanic, for example), but this definitely shares the stack of smoking movies. <br /> <br /> OK, apparently it was filmed in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so dumb. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and he's even dumber than him! I did not even think that was possible! In fact, he and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the WORST DRAMA EVER! It was not only that acting there was very dramatic, well, in fact, it was, of course, that the script was terrible, which combines for a mortal blow in a terrible terrible drama. <br /> <br /> The scarecrow, Let's talk about it. The whistle you hear every time he's around is stupid, and obviously nicknamed. Now your costume, I can not get over it - it's a guy wearing sackcloth bags and a stupid mask! I'm simply puzzled, maybe if you were 3 years old with brain damage, you'd be afraid of him / her. <br /> <br /> One of the characters, the symbolic black actually used the phrase, "This may be a chance to win my red wings" when referring to trying to score with one of the girls in his period. Wow, yes, that's the kind of dialogue you can expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the beginning, when the half-naked girl is running in the middle of the corn, why is she tied? I'm sure that's not to be obvious, just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'movie'. Another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yes, that's right), there everything on the beach, and the only dorkaziod has the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and it's obvious that it's nicknamed funny. Fortunately, the scarecrow responds to all our prayers and throws a spear through the chest of the guy when he finishes singing. On the whole, this kind of thing is very good, this is one of those movies when you're hoping for these people to be killed by the killer. <br /> <br /> Okay, there's a scene where the two guys bury one of their friends. in the sand, then get up, pull the peni and urinate all over the face in the sand. Who does this? Really, imagine, "Hey, let's bury the sand in the sand, then lift up and take off our genitals as if it's not a big deal and pee on it." In fact, that brings homoeroticism in that movie, what the hell? A good part of the beginning of this film is the fact that the athletes are inside, in underwear, in the locker room and in the field of corn, while they make the trot. What the hell is this? Traditionally, in film and real life, athletes make girls and nerds do not. This really does not make sense, since all nerds think about girls and sex, and apparently all athletes think of sports and are close to each other in their underwear, I do not understand. Come on. to get to sex. As someone who watched this movie with me said, "I've never felt such disgust for heterosexual sex in my life" and it's true. If you like a hot cup action, or ugly old woman boobs, then this movie is for you. I swear, they found a girl with the smallest breasts of all time and that's what they do to make the nudity scene ?? Then the ugly old nurse shows off her bouncy a few times, and man, I just did not want to see it. <br /> <br /> Now, I have to talk about the continuity of the timeline for this movie, that's what's really bizarre. It starts during the day, then everyone goes to the cornfield, and within 2 minutes its dark in the middle of the night when they leave there saying they go to the beach - their day instantly again, and apparently they stay at the beach until the night again, and until the next day. So basically, these events in the movie cover 4 days, without either character needing to sleep or something, it's really weird. <br /> <br /> After the main murders happen, he blinks forward '3 weeks later'. and apparently none of these people really cared to see their friends brutally murdered! The survivors literally burst some champaign! And that's when I realized that the budget was not going to the script, to drive or to act, everything was going to that crazy bottle of champagne. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now, if you do not want the ending to be spoiled for you, it's really nice. <br /> <br /> OK, so the end happens in a church, and the scarecrow puts his soul inside the body of the diabetic kid. , so he fights with the guy resembling steve guttenberg, and he fights it with a movie version of the power that the emperor had in Star Wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So, somehow, in the middle of the fight, the soul of the scarecrow jumps bodies to the guttenberg jr. face, and then with the last amount of will he has, he impales himself on a cross in the church! It's incredible! A little blood, but what's even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! You can see the bottom get off the ground! Wow, yes, have fun watching.
