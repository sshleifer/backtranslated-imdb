It is difficult to criticize a movie with the title "Deathbed: The Bed that Eats" and involves a ghost narrator who is trapped behind a 2-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and ?? if I'm not mistaken, he masturbates. (Now, this is coming back to your human companions!) Also, foam (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb edible that are on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and of course people. Again, suffice it to say, do not expect too much when you see what I think is stomach acid? the final remnants of anything that light orange foam? dissolving only certain things. Go drink the wine, but the bottle is fine and will eat the chicken bone, but the bucket is fine. Heck, the bed even replaces unused containers. Hilariously, at one point, Pepto-Bismol is knocked over. I had to laugh about it. I do not think they really wanted you to take this seriously. It's a low budget and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and save a lot of money. I thought, in a world where there might be a 'Lift' killer and a 'Blood Beach', this 'Deathbed' can be fun to watch. For reasons that may involve cost, 90% of the film is voice-over, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fear / confusion about why a bed hits (I can think of one?) And I've never been one of those kids who jumped in bed) and you will have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. (A victim loses all flesh in his hands, barely saying "ow".) Only one scene, which lasted a long time, was meticulously tense ?? a woman tries to drag herself away to be dragged back, using a sheet. Where are the MST3k guys?
