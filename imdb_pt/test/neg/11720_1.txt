This film was not only disappointing to the lover of the horror / thriller film, it was disappointing to anyone who sees it. Wow. I thought this movie could be funny because the guy with the huge head. However, it was filled with a long and prolonged conversation that was not necessary. There was so much sex I hate women and men now. This film was not only annoying but there was no substance. Wow. Wow. Regarding all of this, each scene looks like it was light from a single lamp, and I think they used the same scenario for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies, because in the end, it seems like a waste of time. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> -party
