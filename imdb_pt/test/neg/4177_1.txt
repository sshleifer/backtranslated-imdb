My friend Zac has rented this movie for free since his mother works at a rental store. I still feel stolen, since I will never be able to recover those 100 minutes of my life. Having watched the first "Black Harvest" the night before this performance, I expected to at least see a low quality remake of the first film. Wrong. <br /> <br /> There is not a single scarecrow in the movie (unless you tell the one on the cover of the box), nor are there any real death scenes. The film received R for an 8-year-old girl shouting "god d ** n" for her father. <br /> <br /> There is no amount of tequila that can make this movie bearable. Believe me, we try.
