I remember the trailer for this infamous, weak spin-off of Conan. I watched the movie years later and laughs with my head. Unintentionally! Poor Briggite Nielson. His career has never had a chance thanks to Cobra and Red Sonja. The plot of the film is this: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of warriors who were killed by an evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb the warriors were protecting and uses to destroy every city she passes through. Sonja goes in search of Queen Gedren and later discovers that Gedren killed its parents. In her quest she reluctantly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his bumbling servant, Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together, they go in search of a queen Gedren and the orb. The acting is sub par and the action scenes are solos. I mean Brigitte Neilson seems so emotionally distant. For someone who has lost all her family, as well as her companions, Sonja does not seem at all disturbed. Arnold is playing his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... that annoying brat he was in this movie! The brown servant Falkon had more personality than these guys. The action scenes are the only redeeming moments in the movie, although they sometimes fall flat. The scene in which they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh until my ribs hurt. Dialogue is a joke, too. It's as if the screenwriter thought that no one would take the film seriously, so he gave everyone stupid lines to work with. I can only recommend this movie to you if you like your extra campy epic movies. No one else bothers.
