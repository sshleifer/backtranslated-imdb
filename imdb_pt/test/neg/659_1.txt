The most delicious movie I've ever seen, not scary, just bad. First film made by WWE, and believe me, the only person this movie can appeal to is wrestling fans. It has a terrible acting and the worst direction I've ever seen. I found myself laughing at the story and the bad actors. I saw that the WWE people tried very hard to put a lot of wrestling moves on the killings, and various camera effects. I think they copied a lot of silent Hill. This movie is not interesting, so if you come, you will see yourself out because of the lack of Suspense. The end is the worst, no matter what, you'll leave wanting your money back
