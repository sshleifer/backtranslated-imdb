Well, I'm going to come clean and admit that I was forced as part of my history degree to watch this movie, and then write a short film review as part of my note. <br /> <br /> Even if I had seen the film movie alone, in my own discretion I found it extremely boring and absurd. The style is dated beyond its years, and the acting is ridiculous. Instead of using dialogue, instead, they exchange glaring glances at each other, or sometimes in the air. To me, this exaggerated performance does not convey any greater emotion, and after seeing one end of Ivan's face for the hundredth time I was praying for the movie to end. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing is how wrong Ivan's character is. This man was unpleasant, the murderous thugs of his bodyguard and his cowardly character. For me, the film was nothing more than a propaganda of Stalin, imprecise and bland.
