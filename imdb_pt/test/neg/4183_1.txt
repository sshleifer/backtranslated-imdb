This thing. oh god this thing I can not even call it a movie. a movie is something that does something. goes somewhere. has some semblance of a plot or SOMETHING. I do not know how I'm doing this. I really do not know. first I say dark fields is the worst movie of all time. and I thought it was. so ghost island pirates proved me wrong. and now, for the third consecutive time, another film goes beyond the call of duty to prove that I am wrong. <br /> <br /> OK. Black Harvest II: The Corn. Lord, this is awful. Let me break it for you. The man feels that the daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his Act II popcorn, apparently, and runs to find them in a cornfield. Of course this is the largest cornfield in existence, being the size of the corn fields of Jeepers Creepers, Corn Sons and Signs combined. The main character, whose name is Shy (incredible name), then runs through a cornfield .... meets some ghost girls, talks to them and ... crosses a cornfield. Dig a little ... and cross a field of corn. And the incredibly sad thing? I'm not really leaving anything out. That's pretty much the whole movie. The only thing I can be leaving out is how he is chased by two cops who want to arrest him for ... I do not know. pretending to be an actor. I did not care about this point. He runs away and the police are with the killer off the screen. Holy shit, is there a killer? apparently yes there as it is introduced almost 4/5 in the movie. but wait! so he flees for a while and you guessed it, running over the cornfield and digging. Then there is the end where he saves his daughters. huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it's annoying. IT'S UNBELIEFLY, UNBELIEVABLE, TORMENTLY annoying. I can not explain how atrociously dull this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as a root canal, and it's only an hour and a half of NOTHING. The ONLY good thing that came out of this movie was that me and my friend may have found enlightenment due to the near state of nirvana this movie put us in after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to accelerate to keep us alive. During the folly that followed, I found the hug of a much more pleasant wall and my friend found a new passion for laughing hysterically as he fluttered across the floor as if he had a seizure. This is the kind of insanity that this movie brings. not just bad. it's bad for your health. The cover looks amazing with a photo of a stunning killer AWESOME that I would totally consider dressing up for a horror scam, but this was the most misleading box ever. DO NOT LEAVE THE FOOL YOU TOO! DO NOT watch this movie. Watch a better corn film. Any movie about corn is better. Just do not let it get you! do not do! one 0 out of 10
