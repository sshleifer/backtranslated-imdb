My general feeling about this movie is that it was a slow, slow, unstructured, through some of the world's genuinely unhappy situations, with a bit of redemption and an obvious message. The film is made up mostly of very uninteresting video footage of the countries it visits with bad re-enactments, all at a slow pace and covered by depressing songs. Certainly some of the material and interviews contain some compelling stories, but contrary to what the description in the back suggests, it was not so much the story of the victim being told as the director's, Mr. Ripper, and he does not count. This film could include longer and better interviews with the people themselves, allowing them to tell their stories. Instead, Mr. Ripper indulgently draws the story for himself, making it a kind of personal journey and, unfortunately, does not end up being too much of one. I have never had a sense of growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what on the subject attracted him in the first place. It just drags us from one place to another, plays softly on the situation and the characters, walks around exhibiting slow-motion scenes without much movement of people just walking the streets, and then moves on to their next destination. He does it again, again and again, with no real development. I felt that this movie could have been reduced to 45 minutes but it was reduced to almost 2 hours slow. We feel morally obliged to worry about it, but the self-indulgent, sinuous, uninspired delivery of your journey makes you numb after a while.
