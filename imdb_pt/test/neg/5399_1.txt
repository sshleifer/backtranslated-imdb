Should this be a comedy? The black cloak and the skeleton mask are hilarious. It exists as a zero plot. The film begins with an archaeologist and his assistant. They make a small mention of their excavation site being cursed. And then, lo and behold ...... in drops Halloween Costume Man, dressed in the shiny black cloak, with a skeleton mask face, holding an ax. So he kills these two people. Then we cut to the forest with a bad imitation of Predator, only the commands are being hunted by Halloween Costume Man, who is now riding a horse! More commands appear, but these people must be disguised as a walking group. Yes, the production probably ran out of command clothes. Can you say, low budget? Anyway, they find a lone Indian sitting in the woods. He is very funny. And he starts babbling about something, but you do not really know what he's muttering, so they flashback for some Indians to be killed. None of this really makes sense. And then we return to our commands where more of them are dead. And that's basically the plot. It's so ridiculously bad that you just can not look away because you want to see how low it sinks. You could make the same movie with a camcorder, a Halloween costume and a lot of friends with fake weapons. Do not watch this if you want a horror movie. If you want a comedy, maybe? Or simply hop and catch something like the real Predator.
