It's a pity that so many people "love" Family Guy, because it's easily one of the worst shows on TV, there are many points to be addressed here. <br /> <br /> The Flashbacks: Now, in Season 1 and Season 2, which I think was exceptional, the flashbacks were quite frequent, and actually a bit tied to what the plot was and was even funny. Now in season 4, flashbacks are taking place even more and have nothing to do with the plot, they are not funny and they are really long, boring and pointless. Family Guy thinks the long drag scene going nowhere is funny, when in fact it is poor writing. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a baby that sounds British. How funny can this be? It is not. Your character is so unstable that it's unbelievable. Remember early in the season when Stewie was all over the world dominating and killing Lois. Well, now he only has scenes that are awkwardly cheery with Brian. Of wanting to dominate the world to be gay = to write badly. <br /> <br /> References: How can they continue to make bad references to TV shows or events from the 1980s? Well, they just reuse the same old junk. You know, 20 years from now, I hope the Family Guy is canceled by then, if they're still making jokes about the '80s shows, it's even more irrelevant than it was before. Because you will have forgotten. It still makes me wonder why they can not just write good episodes with quality jokes. <br /> <br /> Voice acting: My God, the voices in this show are so bad. Seth McFarlene should focus only on his low quality episode writing and quitting voices. All the extras in the already bad episodes of Family Guy are all the same. The Simpsons make 6 or 7 people do ALL the voices. Some of them are expressing about 15-20 characters ... all sounding very different. But why can not the Family Guy do this? Oh, of course, it's a low-quality show. The Stuttering: Generally done by Peter, Stewie, Brian and any extras, whenever they talk or are offended by something, they have to stutter the phrase just to try to get a cheap laugh. I can not believe that the family guy can not even speak normally to get people to laugh at their "jokes". <br /> <br /> Offensiveness: OK, short and simple, Family Guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge, but in fact they fall off once in a while. Go see the South Park ... Terrible Grounds: The plots and the plots are just total rubbish. The Simpsons started their 20 seasons still have better plot lines than Family Guy. About 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and drag scenes that have no relevance. <br /> <br /> Popularity Many little kids have Stewie shirts and think he's so funny, when in fact they do not even get their sexual jokes written. They just say, "ah, ha ha, stewie!" when they do not understand. Family Guy was canceled twice and brought back by DVD sales, how sad that. They were canceled the first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season, and I honestly believe it should have been that. the episodes from then were superb, they should be left on a high note. <br /> <br /> Drag Scenes and Fall There are scenes that last a long time. One that aired last Sunday, Peter went to an executive bathroom, in which about 2 minutes were passed, mimicking the introduction of Jurassic Park, and the plot of that episode was also stolen from an episode of Seinfeld. Also a scene where Chris is working in a store and he is talking to the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie, which also features stuttering. The chicken fights are so stupid, three of them, each one longer than the last. Writing useless and bland, thinking that people like long scenes of reprise of fighting, between a chicken, yes a chicken. now, every time someone falls, and by the way, NO FAMILY CAN DENY THIS, that every time they fall, it is less than a fraction of a second, and they ALWAYS land with their arms on their backs to make them seem strange. I think it has been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh, everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny when it's just a really bad joke. they even bothered to give him singing scenes (which are very bad) and based ALL the episodes around him, they did the same thing with other characters, like the doctor, who I know had an episode based on The Simpsons Well, there is not much explanation needed here. There's so much evidence that the family guy stole Simpson's jokes. As family guy is just a poor man Simpsons. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I've forgotten a few key points somewhere, but I'm sure this is enough to prove that the family guy's really horrible writing TV show that everyone seems to love, when in fact they should watch Simpson, Seinfeld and Frasier.
