If I had never seen the first Road House, then I think this movie could have one more star, but even so it makes it a 3-star movie. Incidentally, I was very surprised by the relatively high rating it currently has. <br /> <br /> In fact, I could not finish this movie because it was painful. Where everything went wrong (at least in the most obvious way) is that it practically parallels the original, even though the original plot is still referenced. This does not make sense and does not work. Besides, the acting is weak ... I never felt like I was in the movie, but I felt like I was watching people act. Even good actors like Busey do not work, probably because of the script or perhaps the awkward editing. The strangest thing is that the movie looks like a mid-90s B movie, it's still done in '06. I'm not sure why, but then again, this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason. The music, the look, and the overall feel remind me of movies you saw 10 years ago at Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing of all is that I'm also waiting for Ja Rule to come in at some point ... often reminds me of more current films with rappers as actors. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing is love interest. Girl that is character looks like a total theft of character Lois Lane in Smallville, which is also very annoying. And let's not forget the "Southern accents" that sounded fake since the Walk the Line. I realize that this is a common place in the movies, but no accent would work better than trying to look like you're from that universal caipira place on TV, where anyone from any southern state (or KY and WV) sounds exactly the same. Of course, people in the deserted cities of AZ sound like people in the Southeast states more than 2000 miles away. That was wearing off 10 years ago in the B movies where the technique came from. Why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> In short: I really would not recommend this if you are a Road House fan or if you like good movies. Also, if you have not seen it yet, do not ruin it by seeing this version first. The original Road House was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over again. It was an unexpected success as American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused, and more recently Office Space, Fast and Furious (only the first!) And Napolean Dynamite. Why did they ruin everything? <br /> <br /> They should never have made a sequel to Road House in addition to a high budget version with the right actors / directors. Of course, you can never beat the original (eg Bad News Bears, The Longest Yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it correctly it will be presentable as is the case with the examples I mentioned. But to make a low budget out of the network, the self-production of Road House is criminal.
