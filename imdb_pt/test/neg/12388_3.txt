Oh, yawn. It's no longer a girl's movie where men are all pigs and women will take revenge for their abuse. The only difference is that in this movie, everyone is a pig or porridge for a brain. I hated this movie for the moral issue of why it is right to send a man to life for a murder he did not commit. Is that a more immoral act than your abuse and dishonesty? This film shows the whole situational ethic of poor writing. I saw it on CBC's "Best of Britain" series. If this is the best of Britain, no wonder the British film industry is in trouble. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in this film was David Tennant, He interprets his character as so despicable that I probably spit the next person who speaks with a Scottish accent. Kate Ashfield tries to play the victim, but ends up being immorally dishonest as the character of David Tennant. They deserve each other. <br /> <br /> In the Brain Brains category are parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic Brendan. British police officers are so incompetent that they are unable to distribute traffic tickets. The British Policeman's Union should sue the producers of this film for defamation. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the electricity it takes to run your DVD to watch it.
