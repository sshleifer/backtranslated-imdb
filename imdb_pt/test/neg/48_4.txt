It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I watched "The Crime Doctor's Courage" all the way. It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of usual suspects - each with their own possible motive for crime. The story begins abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot without character development or narrative of any kind. I think it's not too surprising for a B movie this period. There are also a few moments that seem and are like this is pre-WWII, but maybe this is due to the writer's record on radio shows. <br /> <br /> "Doctor Crime" is the detective who is visiting California for some R & R from his psychiatric practice on the East Coast. He meets a mysterious novelist friend with whom it is implied to have participated in one or more mysterious capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of aide to our detective (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally illuminates things with a bit of comic relief (more or less). <br /> <br /> There is also a bit simple, but not a bad police captain who sometimes gets annoyed with the nosy detective. And then there's the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists in a nightclub. Dance is a kind of interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments that look more like the thirties than the 1940s. Although the location of the story is California, the Braggas seem to live in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was an element of the plot that managed to keep me a little amused but I will not divulge more than that because I always enjoy more movies when the story is discovered rather than being known in advance . (even though I can think of many, many B movies that would rank higher and it's hard to say watching this movie is time well spent) I did not see any other "Crime Doctor" films so I can make comparisons.
