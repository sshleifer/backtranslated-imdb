This movie is about a young couple fleeing to start a new life in LA, which ends up being pursued by a psychopath in a deserted rest stop. In fact, it's just about the girl (Nicole), since the boyfriend literally disappears in a few minutes. The movie is going extremely fast, and at first you wonder how it could stretch your story to the end. It does not take long for you to realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that get nowhere. <br /> <br /> History is not only paper thin, but unstructured, stupid and incoherent. Minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car, Nicole finds a mobile home in the rest stop. She sees the flash of a camera and KNOW that people are inside, but she easily gives up trying to get help when no one answers the door. After she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, she walks around the rest stop, doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things. This includes turning on a TV (and even sounding funny when she thinks she stumbled into a porn movie, even in this hideous situation), sitting, wandering and drinking from a bottle of drink for hours on end. She does all this, KNOWING that her boyfriend has been kidnapped, that the killer is still on the loose and chasing her, and taking no action to ensure his immediate safety (she does not care about locking the doors or staying alert). Oh yeah, she tries to use a radio to ask for help, but why bother when there is a mobile home with people inside the parade? It seems that the writer forgot that important fact while writing this part of the story. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of trap or danger ever present in this story. The heroine wanders freely around the various buildings at the rest stop, and the killer only drives from time to time to frighten her, before leaving again. There's nothing to stop Nicole from simply taking off (even if the rest stop is too far from anywhere else, that's better than sitting still), but she prefers to stay anyway. At one point in the movie, the main character even RECOGNIZES that she can get away but can not. <br /> <br /> History is not going anywhere, and instead it just jumps from a nonsense segment to a nonsensical segment. Nicole finally enters the mobile home and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of religious fanatics housed, supposedly endogamous or psychotic. They seem intentionally ignorant or indifferent about the killer's actions (but there is no indication that they are attached to him at all), and then drive Nicole out after a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant segment, the main character enters the bathroom. She discovers one of the killer's previous victims (a young woman named Tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy begins to vomit ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole fetched a crowbar to open the closet door, and when she returned a minute later, Tracy and her pool of blood disappeared without any explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing people, and sees that Tracy disappeared in 1971. So, was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never bothered to explain. <br /> <br /> Then a police officer appears in the middle of the night to look after the police station at the rest stop, which had been conveniently left alone all day until now. Nicole tells him all about what's going on, and when the killer drives in his truck outside the office, the cop goes off to face him. What does the officer do, knowing that something is seriously wrong? He climbs and quietly talks to the killer (whom Nicole even pointed out to be the guy who was chasing her), and believes the killer's lie that he was simply driving and needing directions. Seriously. The cop talks to Nicole outside, totally unconscious when the truck turns and runs over him. <br /> <br /> The cop quickly begins to tell Nicole that he is "still lucky to breathe." Strangely, he does not die for a long time. They both do some more useless conversations, and the very important fact that he has a weapon is annoyingly not mentioned for long. When the two finally try to use the gun, Nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets by firing blindly at a door when the killer is possibly behind her. With two bullets to the left, the cop tells Nicole to use one to sacrifice him. She shoots one in his mouth, and he stands for a few moments, with a piece torn from his head. Then, he suddenly and inexplicably yells "You missed!" and she has to shoot him again. Completely cheap shock attempt. <br /> <br /> Nicole finally confronts the killer and fails. The film ends with a scene taking place not long after, with a woman coming to the rest stop now, strangely, much more active. In the bathroom, she hears Nicole crying for help in the closet (locked as Tracy). She picks up a police officer to come in and check, but he finds a seemingly normal and clean closet. The policeman leaves, thinking that he was deceived. A battered Nicole is seen emerging from behind some boxes in the closet (she would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent 10 seconds looking), apparently too stupid to have said or done anything when the cop was there. WOW. <br /> <br /> This film is apparently the first in a new line of "direct" DVD movies of "quality", marketed as being too extreme for theaters. In fact, it's just more clich√©, the B-Movie trash.
