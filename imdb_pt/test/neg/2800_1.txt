Few videos in recent history have been as politely produced as this - at least none that have been released by such a reputable distributor. Each frame of this film is a plaguerism of the best films of the past. The word 'clich√©' gets new meaning from an untalented writer / director who must reserve his imagination for minor masturbation efforts that do not victimize moviegoers. Helping in the amateur endeavor of nightly 'horror' is a number of less capable technicians who contribute with bad cinematography and special effects and laughable makeup. Unfortunately, one or two of the film's amateur actors display a hint of talent that will go unnoticed because of the reputation that this atrocity will produce.
