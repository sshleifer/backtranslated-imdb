I spent a lot of time analyzing all the comments in this movie. I completely agree with almost all reviewers to say that Noah's Ark is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! Do NBC executives have no classes? I feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this miniseries. The script is so dumb, so meaningless and, yes, TOTALLY INCREDIBLE! I can understand some changes for dramatic ends, but this movie has changed almost everything in history. God himself will take the trouble to kill the entire population of Earth, but somehow he misses a guy who is sailing trying to sell things to Noah. Give me some time! And what about Noah's sons acting like Indiana Jones, saving girls in danger? If all this is not bad enough, there is the part where God apologizes to Noah and says, "I'm sorry, Noah, I was wrong." Newsflash NBC, GOD CAN NOT BE WRONG! This movie is the most tasteless and shameful biblical movie ever.
