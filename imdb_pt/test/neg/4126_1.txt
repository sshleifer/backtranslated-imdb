By far, this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I watch practically all the movies that are connected at night (be it showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc). "Three" AKA "Survivor Island" keeps you with as much suspense as watching paint dry just to disappoint even more miserably. If you want to feel like you've just wasted what looks like an eternity in the worst movie ever created, then by all means watch this movie. I must have shouted at least 900 times of idiot twists. If I had 4 hands I would give this movie 4 thumbs down. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals.
