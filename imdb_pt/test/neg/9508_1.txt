<br /> <br /> The play was heavily edited and the order of the scenes was completely mixed. The acting is shocking (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and cinematography is poor. <br /> <br /> The result is a slow, confusing and boring film that will instantly put Shakespeare's newest in Shakespeare! <br /> If you can not see a play, then at least see the version of Olivier (1948) instead of this drivel!
