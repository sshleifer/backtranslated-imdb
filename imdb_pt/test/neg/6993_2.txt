So pathetic that it's not even funny. Since the first scene in the movie I knew I was in a bad time. Thank God I only saw this movie on tv. The plot was terrible, not to mention the acting. It was horrible. Very unreal and unusual things happened in this movement as. The lady shoves a whip under the door and knocks a little on the guy and he just hands over the keys. I'm kind, REAL. The creators who try to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike of the film. To tell you the truth, the only good thing about this movie was the fight, which in itself was very bad. All I could ask myself when I watched this movie was "when are you going to leave!"
