I watched the first 15 minutes and I can say that there was no consultation with any military personnel. The character of Judith Light (an officer) has her hair down her shoulders! One of the first officers to greet her when she walks into the medical clinic where she works is so fat that the gap in her pockets! No - there were no military advising them about this movie. Even an ex-military enlisted man could have helped here.
