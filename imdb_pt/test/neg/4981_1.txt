I remember seeing the first Underdog trailer last March, I also remember when I smiled to myself a bit. Of course it was a cheesy idea, but I really thought the time when the concept could work, hell, could not be worse than the disappointing Cats and Dogs, could it? Then in December, and suddenly I remembered the movie, I realized how likely it was to suck, the fact that it was postponed in the UK made it seem inevitable would be terrible, but the terrible comments only made me realize that it was almost impossible for the movie to be good. Still, I swallowed my feelings and went to see the movie with a friend today, when I walked into my screen, I was embarrassed, it was the first time I watched a movie with a friend and being the only two on screen! Little did I know what I was about to endure. Underdog to be blunt is horrible, really. Imagine how bad you might think this movie is and then get ready for an even worse movie, that's just how pathetic the movie is. While the goal is to entertain children, it seems like an embarrassing mess that seems to insult children instead of allowing them to enjoy the movie. The issues can not be helped by the fact that the story is beyond mediocre, the acting is generally poor, and the film looks like a long Saturday, tired and downright boring drawing! After a brief five minutes in which I thought the film might be acceptable, the film suddenly seemed to die and then hobble toward the signal already finalized. I'm just amazed that the movie was released, it's a shame for Disney. What is even more terrifying is the fact that the ending leaves room for a continuation! <br /> <br /> So, let's go to the acting (finger joints). Okay, let me be honest. Jason Lee is decent, his voice matches the canine, and if he had received a decent script, he could have done the performance job. However, with such a dishonest script, it just seems to get in the way. In many ways he reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield, Murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had was not enough to make it acceptable. So we get into the human actors, and most of the atrocious ones. Alex Neuberger plays Underdog's friend Jack. My biggest concern is that anyone could take you seriously in a hearing. The scene in which he begins to fly with Underdog is perhaps the most remarkable scene in recent years just because his acting is so bad. Not once did I believe he was a real person, actually part of me is still convinced that he was a robot made especially for the movie! James Belushi seems half dead in the movie, he has nothing to work on, no decent lines, he just seems to wander the set hoping to become relevant to the plot, which writers try to do in the end, but do it in such a way Poor is laughable. Fortunately Peter Dinklage is the only redeeming factor of the film, he is great as Dr. Barsinister and seems to be laughing on paper. He steals all the scenes in which he is, although this is not difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the cast is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she just needs to end her acting career now! <br /> <br /> Underdog also fails drastically in terms of delivering something like a funny scene. When the funniest scene involves Underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong. This could easily be ignored if the film had a decent action or a good story, unfortunately the film is even worse in both terms. The effects are so imprecise that any scene Underdog flies seems absurd, and the dog uses its powers with so little effect that you often forget that it has superpowers. What's the point of making a movie about a super dog if the damn dog never looks super? The final fight also borders on the embarrassment purely because its ten minutes of nothing, the dog flies, other things happen, some things are scattered, all this is irrelevant, since this is happening because things happen. The script is also dishonest, at best, and undoubtedly painful at worst. When someone says, "Look, it's an airplane, it's not a bird, it's not a frog ...", yes, you read it right, I just wanted to cry there and then. In fact, I wanted to get out, but I remained compelled to see if it could get lower than that point, this happens near the end, so it's not pleasantly. The Underdog in general becomes the worst movie of 2008 in this initial period, and is really as bad as last year's Epic Movie. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans comes here soon and I hope it's even worse. So if you do not understand my point of view, avoid the movie at all costs, if you want to watch a movie with a dog, watch Cats and Dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, just do not see it!
