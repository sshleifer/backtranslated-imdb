In this Silly Symphony, a country mouse visits his cousin in town. Most of the short ones are the two mice that explore the dining table. The animation is good, where this short suffers is lack of humor. Maybe I just saw this "dinner table adventure" in many Tom and Jerry shorts. Even if this happened first, I just did not find it so enjoyable.
