Okay, so I'm Singaporean and I'd like to say it's time to stop stereotyping the Singaporeans and make those films. Some of the actors / actresses really have talent, but unfortunately not been shown much in this film. I was moving in my place when I saw this, being very young then, my parents dragged me to see. Honestly, I could tell you were going to fall asleep. And there was this arrogant Westernized boy who got on my nerves. Overall, a boring film and a general waste of talent from the actors. I've seen better Singapore films than that. The Chicken Rice War was good. However, I can not believe this is considered a better movie from Singapore. Sorry, I would not recommend this.
