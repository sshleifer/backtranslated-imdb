it's hard to tell non-actor actors. Bad American films can be seen by all young people who prefaced every line of dialogue with "You know what?" Bad Canadian films can be seen by all young people ending each line of dialogue with "Eh?" Have not we learned anything in a movie century? Can not the full weight of millions of aspirants come down in Hollywood with scripts and reels on hand in rescuing those horrible on-demand TV movies?
