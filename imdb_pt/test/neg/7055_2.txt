The title of the movie makes it look like a porn movie, but it's not even a sex comedy. Instead, Hot Summer in Barefoot County is about an officer sent from a southern state to a small town to locate and arrest the footmen. The moonlight though comes from the farm of an old woman with three beautiful daughters. Almost anyone can guess what happens next, but strangely, the movie is very tame. It hardly qualifies for a PG rating. What's more, the low budget is obvious in practically every scene and the acting is sooo much amateur. This movie was probably intended for the public drive-in, but is unlikely to have satisfied them, even in 1974.
