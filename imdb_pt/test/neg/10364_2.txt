Every time I see a movie like that I get sick from the stomach. When I watch a movie, I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, etc ... How do you make a movie and not even think about the possibility of other ethnic groups passing you? I'm sure they did not do it on purpose, but pay attention. I do not care if it happens in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was a black token. That was typical in the '80s. Hey! is 2007 with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to his cast. Are not the actors supposed to be more liberal?
