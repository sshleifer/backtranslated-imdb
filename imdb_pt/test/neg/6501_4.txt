Avida is a play on words that mixes life and enthusiasm, but I personally think this movie was exaggerated by its ambition and does not do justice to its title. It brings together a set of strange characters united by unbelievable links. Also, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What's left of it was a set of images ... interesting, but not enough to make this a good movie. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I certainly did not notice! The absurd and caricature nature of the film is actually the only good thing about it, but when it creeps up and in, it does not become more bearable. I have to say that I struggled a lot to continue seeing until the end, and still not sure if it was worth it ...
