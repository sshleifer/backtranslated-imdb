This movie was bad, but it was so bad that it can reach cult status in the distant future. A kind of film-noir meets Plan 9 From Outer Space. The story was, well, there was not really a story. There's a place reserved for the Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world and this movie proves it. "So bad it can be good" is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt that this movie is chosen by any legitimate distribution company, so it's unlikely to be a major release. <br /> <br /> I'll add that I hope to see more of actor Ron Carey. He did the best he had. The rest of the performance, if I may call it that, was quite forgettable. I have seen worse of large studios with vast budgets.
