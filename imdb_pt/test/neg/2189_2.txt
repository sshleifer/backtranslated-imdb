It starts very well, with the accident and the decision not to return to Los Angeles. But everything fits in very quickly. There is a twist in the decent plot at the end, but so many scenes that do not make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put in the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? I do not want to spoil it, for those who decide to watch it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even the acting, which was not bad at first, turns out badly in the end. Do not bother unless you want to see how bad it is.
