In efforts to make a rather comic and yet serious film about the art of marijuana cultivation, Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) fell a few bits of a good movie. While the cast is nothing less than incredible, this movie is extremely difficult to sit on. The performance of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch failed to save this movie from failure. It would be wiser to wash three dollar bills by the toilet and then check out the movie at the local store. <br /> <br />
