What a horrible movie. Filled with cliches, bewildering scenes, very poor acting and an atrocious script. It's hard to believe the same guys who wrote The People Vs. Larry Flint and Man on the Moon wrote this crap. Man, this makes my list of the 10 worst movies ever. This guy, this director, if you can call him that, do you realize that the first Problem Child was bad enough? Let alone make a sequel to it !! ??? Incredible pieces of junk like this can be shown to children, much less to be released! 1 out of 10 *
