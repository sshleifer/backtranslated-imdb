The acting was terrible, the green screen effects, cheap, fake and cheap were ridiculous, and the creatures were absolutely retarded. The only good thing about this movie was the concept, and the laughs I had when watching such a bad movie - so I was really angry because I realized I lost 4 bucks when renting it. Why would such a movie already be in theaters? I know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone struggle to make movies? I'm just writing random stuff to fill the space, because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should just do it. Annnndddddd there!
