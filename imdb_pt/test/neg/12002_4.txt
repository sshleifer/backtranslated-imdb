I could not help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total drag. Childish humor, cheap appearance, cheap effects, a plot that makes "Legally blonde" look like "The Usual Suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez went through brain surgery somewhere after 1996. The only thing that he left as his trademark are some cool camera moves, but that's where it ends. Ok, so the guy decided to do something new for a spin, a children's spy movie. Well, if I was 12 years old, I'd be insulted. The best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino who just robbed all the scenes in which she was. Unfortunately, there were not many. 4/10
