It gave two stars because the DVD cover was good enough to make me buy this horse dung. I paid a dollar for it on the local DVD exchange and I want my money back. I have some good movies (at least I think they are good) who have never seen the inside of a video store. After seeing this, I'm really insulted by this. Years light worse than anything I've ever seen, I can not even recommend this as a campy playful movie. It's so bad, instead of making you laugh, it makes you angry. How did this horrible movie find some kind of distro? I can only believe it was self-distributed as the amateur DVD authoring would suggest. For the producers of this "movie" to leave the business, it is obvious that you have no talent for it.
