This episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season Masters of Horror has produced a really good episode ... The Damned Thing ... it's still early, I have faith that the episodes will improve. I admit that the vampire episode was good, but it lacked a solid storyline. The episode about the couple getting the serial killer started boring, but the last fifteen minutes were pretty good. However, I am simply disappointed by the lack of originality and horror that the episodes of the first season possessed. Please save this John Carpenter season! I have faith that Pro-Life will rescue the entire dull season so far. <br /> <br /> "You're a rabid little elf!"
