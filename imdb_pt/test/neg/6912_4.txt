When I watched this movie, it was one afternoon after I got home from work. I love horror movies and I've seen some really fancy but that takes the cake. The plot presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems a bit intriguing, but as the film progresses, the screenplay goes the wrong way with horrible clich√©s and poor presentation, which makes the film completely boring and annoying. I do not want to continue to criticize the script and plot because believing me is not the worst part. I have to say as a whole that acting was not terrible for beginning actors, and I was impressed by Taylor Locke, this being one of her first films. The worst part of the movie was the special effects. They smelled on low budget, and really ruined the entertainment of the viewers, even if he was remotely interested in the plot. I recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
