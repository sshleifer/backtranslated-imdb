YOU BELONG TO ME (1941) is an example of the 'Comedy Ball of Balls' that began in the mid-1930s and ended in the post-World War II era. Some of these films maintained their status. Others have won unmerited accolades when they were originally critical and box office failures. How to BRING BABY (1938) or SR. & MRS. SMITH (1941). So there's this value that keeps sinking. <br /> <br /> Why it can be rooted in the script / story. It lowers credibility from the start by betraying a superior cast. BARBARA STANWYCK is married to millionaire HENRY FONDA, who is incredibly jealous. He would be content to sit with his million dollars and love her, she wants to keep her profession as a doctor. She wants him to become what his eyes are a useful member of society. This conflict should amuse us. He can not be saved by either the directors or the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> The flaws in this scenario can be clearly placed at the feet of DALTON TRUMBO. The character of HENRY FONDAs is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has an instant dislike for him. BARBARA STANWYCK simply has nothing to do but react to every idiotic situation of jealousy. TRUMBO must have spent a lot of time out of the studio, being a "useful idiot" then being at work. COLUMBIA obviously did not get the value of their money, maybe ROBERT RISKIN was replaced.
