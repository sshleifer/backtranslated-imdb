I watched this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it invades the imagination. It's poorly built for one, so is the script and the acting is just awful. But even Johnny Depp has a number of bad movies on his resume. The positive side of this movie would be Amy singing, and even with that I believe that better songs could have been chosen. Amy is naturally gorgeous to see and if you are a diehard fan of her you will probably watch that title no matter what happens, just do not expect too much. I wish I had found more to like but it was painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
