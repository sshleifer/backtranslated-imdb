I rented this movie with the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest", thinking it was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another extremely laughable series of films and all together). I was not disappointed though. It was so awful, if not worse, than I expected. I was laughing over the whole movie. Every piece of bad acting, filming badly filmed and cuts and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth to be rented. <br /> <br /> Special features include a pathetic view of the six months of filming of the cast and crew. Favorite line, "The sins of my ancestors! They have come to this very moment!"
