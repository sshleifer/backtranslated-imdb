In yet another misleading marketing case, this movie is included in a 10-movie DVD called "Women Who Kick Butt," but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. In fact, for most of the film, Tweed plays the typical female character who is rescued by the male lead, and even when she is trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged by him! There's a female rebel who's a stronger character, but she's mostly kept on the edges of the movie. The male protagonist is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally, I think) funny moments (like when he is electrocuted). The action scenes are misdirected and poorly executed: some of the stuntmen needed some lessons on "how to get shot and die convincingly." I suppose if you're in the right mood, you might find some things in "Firing Line" to laugh at (at one point, we can hear Tweed talking but his lips are not moving!), But mostly I was bored. (*)
