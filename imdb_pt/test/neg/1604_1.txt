Very dull show. What's worse, it's very racist. The white guys are idiots idiots and the only novel is between a black and a white. There's nothing interesting about this novel, it's not exciting, it's not fun, they do not even seem to care about each other, it's more like writers and directors want something interracial going on. Why is this so popular in the media today? It is social programming and will lead to nothing good, there is always tension when many people want the same thing. This show is not worth the $ 20 for the season, it is a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use TV programs to sell products, they are more discreet, selling any agenda here is quite obvious, and without a clear thought, some may feel bad about opposing it, but some of us know better.
