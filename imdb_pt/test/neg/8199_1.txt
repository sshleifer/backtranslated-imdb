The only redeeming factor of this film was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that probably helped the Romanian economy. In addition, Hallmark needs to reevaluate this division of its empire, and perhaps keep its films more bizarre love affairs among hemophiliacs stricken by cancer in Mississippi. Go into detail about how foolish this movie is to give credit to it for being memorable. It was not. I remember watching him, of having vampires (some of them teenagers) and some very bad voiceovers. Whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be transferred to another sector of society ... maybe food service, for the deaf. If you get the chance, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other really bad movies look Oscar-winning in retrospect. So again, if you really did end up in the profile of the movie, I imagine it might be too late ...
