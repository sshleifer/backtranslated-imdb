My guess would be that this originally would have at least two parts and therefore at least a quarter more, because otherwise how to explain its confusing and abbreviated plot. I was never completely lost, but many times I was partially lost and generally unclear on the character's motivation. The film has the impression that conspiracy points have been discarded to put it into its time slot. <br /> <br /> If it were more, it could make more sense, but still it would not be very good. The most interesting idea of ​​the film is that of the war between Zeus and Hera as a war between the man and the woman, but the film leaves the ball behind, making the followers of Hera quite awful, although they are not clear on what the followers of Zeus do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no certainty that they exist. So you have some intriguing ideas, but it does not do anything useful for them. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, cardboard characters and an interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic children. Not unwatchable but also not worth watching.
