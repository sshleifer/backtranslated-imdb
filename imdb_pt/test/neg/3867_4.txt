Well ... there were some really nice, creamy facial pictures of Marlene along with her "shocking" gender outfit (in addition to her "no-to-be-lost" transmogrification from ape to human); but overall, the generally unconvincing plot and dated performance - not to mention the less engaging melodies from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice - did little to make Blonde Venus a permanent place in the Pantheon of Memorable Films of my mind . Cary Grant - still at the height of his cinematic childhood - seemed to be always looking for "meeting" while Herbert Marshall was probably never anything but Herbert Marshall from the day he was born until the day he died. Of course, from the historical point of view, Blonde Venus was fun to watch, as long as you could let go ... "high expectations".
