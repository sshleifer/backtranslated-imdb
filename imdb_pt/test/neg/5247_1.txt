"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no characters, no story, no real dialogues, bad fights ... It's probably the worst movie in film history. It's deadly boring, a waste of time. I'm really sorry for Christophe Lambert, who obviously does not know how to pick a role. If someone suggests you see "Beowulf," believe me: run like crazy.
