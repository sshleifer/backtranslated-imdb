There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail represents a major event in Australian military history, the brave defense of Australia against the cruel Japanese barbarian army. However, this film does not take into account the history of the natives of "Fuzzy Wuzzy" or New Guinea. that Australians used to help them carry out military operations. The film also fails to give a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behavior at this event. It is more like a contemporary misinformation than it was. <br /> <br /> Again, the Australian film industry was unable to give this important chapter in Australian history the film it deserved. This is the worst film with arbitrary cinematography, scripts and bad dialogs, no character development and cliches of war scenes in the jungle. <br /> <br /> He can not imbue the public in any meaningful perspective beyond the Japanese Army being relentless and vicious killers of a poorly trained and poorly trained group of Australians struggling in the jungle. <br /> <br /> The film failed, as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience, in fact they have stayed away in droves. I'm not going to join the parochial trash to say it's great because it's an Australian movie. I say or do a great job or just leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure of Australia's rich and pampered rich children. <br /> <br /> I am giving it zero stars because it is an insult to the descendants of these really great Australians and their enormous sacrifice. What a shame waste and disrespect and I know this review will provoke more negativity from the film show team and most critics, but I have a right to my opinion and this is what Australians have fought for OUR FREEDOM and this includes freedom of expression and the right to express an opinion.
