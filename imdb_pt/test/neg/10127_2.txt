You might think that a program on regular teenagers with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from it. Take the concept, for example: the main character (s) have a big secret that they hide from their peers. It's like Hannah Montana and that's so crow. Then the acting is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Lastly, the jokes are clich√© or boring. If they are not wearing they are colorful, but a strange dialogue to make us "laugh", they are throwing various objects around the room. I really would like this program to use more original and fun stuff. In conclusion, Wisps of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
