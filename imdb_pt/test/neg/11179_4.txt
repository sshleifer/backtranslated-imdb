Matt Cvetic is a loyal Communist at a steel mill in Pittsburgh who works to recruit workers for the party, although this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. What makes this even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent posing as a Communist in order to gain information about party activities. The party is trying to create a strike at the factory, where the pro-strike movement will push workers to a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to deal with beautiful Eve Merrick, a member of the group and teacher at her son's school, who discovers the fact that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eva learns the ugly truth about the real motives of the party, the reds decide that it must be settled and Cvetic must help her without putting herself in danger. The film must have a lot of suspense and double crossing, but there is very little in this movie, but (by today's standards) very tacky advertisement and little action or emotion. Lovejoy is very good in the lead role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem apathetic. Few surprises here and how this movie received an Oscar for best documentary? Classification, 4.
