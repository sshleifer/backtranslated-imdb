There are so many logical errors in this program that they are hardly worth saying. 1) Mystic Gohan is non-existent 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU and plays no role in the show, somehow he is easily dominated by all bad guys 3) The whole idea of ​​Super Saiyan 4 is delayed and it is horrible that he loses to super 17 (which is the worst idea for a villain DB EVER) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is no match for Super 17 but not transformed Goku using a move he learned in a movie that should not happen, 5) Vegeta is totally useless 6) No character other than Goku has any impact on the outcome of the battles 7) The series ends with a spirits bomb ... come on 8) Goku invincible? absorb dragonballs? lame 9) Gotenks? ... even better Goten ??? Underwear??? the two suck 10) Super Saiyajin 4 involves a magical transformation in an adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with Gogeta animation 15) Gogeta totally useless 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest disappointment in anime history (not really logical but I'm coming off on a tangent) 17) Shorter character fights ever <br /> <br /> I could continue for longer if I did not repress most of the memories associated with this show. When I make enough money, I'll fund the redoing of this series.
