being a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr. I had to see this. How silly the only good thing about it are the clips from Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr. along with all the old clips, which do not gel. with new black and white images. nor near Steve martins, dead men do not wear chess, that was great. with all the technology we have now, why was not this done better? If you're planning to shell out 5 bucks and make some changes, be aware that this is really bad. but if you like Lugosi Karloff and Chaney Jr, then watch your movies. Even so, the wood was better than this. The new red-branded actor is very good as an imitation of Bela Lugosi. the monkey, Mr. Wong, the most dangerous game, the lost world, the indestructible man. and the bat of the devil. That Bela Lugosi's notorious classic believes that this production had a very low budget, and shows that 1 in 10.
