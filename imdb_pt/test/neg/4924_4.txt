A lot of aura and atmosphere that this movie has, but unfortunately the impression I just saw. Raymond Massey provides a laid-back Sherlock Holmes, almost comically, in the first scenes of his bathrobe, which he uses as a workman's outfit to investigate Dr. Rylott's (Lyn Harding) scary mansion. What was not clear to me was why Rylott wanted his stepdaughters to be dead. If, as in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), he did not want her to run away to get married, he would have done the same thing by having her dispatched. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities are also plentiful. . After marking an early encounter with Helen, the bride is no longer heard for the rest of the picture. The presence of a bunch of gypsies at the time of Violet Stoner's death provides only one detour, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a venomous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a snake, the musical depictions of Servant Indian Servo. Athole Stewart competently portrays Holmes' advisor Dr. Watson, though he gets used to it if Nigel Bruce is more his cup of tea. Like Rylott, Lyn Harding is sufficiently menacing, a feature that would be well-liked as Holmes's son-in-law, Professor Moriarty, in two later films - The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes (1935) and Murder at the Baskervilles (1937). With repeated oscillations and an unstable camera, it is surprising that the plot is no more disturbed than it is. Its integrity is generally maintained, even if it extends a little to fill in the gaps. I think that would be my main complaint with the film, since mentally transposing some of the cuts jumps in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp.
