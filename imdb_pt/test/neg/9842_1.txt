This movie is terrible. It's not just the unbelievable story, the situations in which the characters stand are so silly that they are not shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, star of The Secret Garden on Broadway, has decided that this would be a career step. The idea is interesting, two old girls very quickly. But sex is not even exciting. The film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept, while interesting, falls flat. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls get their asses after they had their first period and tried to wash their panties off the toilet. Better luck next time folks. My Scale * T-Scale *
