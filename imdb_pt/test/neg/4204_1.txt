I work in an office on weekends, and there is a TV that only receives ONE channel. So, I do not have the option of turning to something better. I remain connected, however, because it provides a bit of background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I received "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a set of third rate (which of course it is). All actors and thugs seem to have just graduated from stunt school. I've seen better dramatic decrees at a carnival. The special effects (flames at the end of the movie are more fake than Michael Jacksons' manhood). Even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor ... A poorly played, poorly filmed and poorly written film.
