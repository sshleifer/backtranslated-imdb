Uwe Boll returns to his filmmaking skills once again to offer a science fiction horror tale about mercenaries and reporters facing super soldiers on a remote island. A well-led cast by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll, which makes the worst script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been killed, but this script is fun enough for the plot to have worked, moreover, the effects and design of the super soldier with his dead and dead eyes have some degree of strangeness, but Boll is able to shoot everything in a reckless way. It's as if he could not bother to really figure out what would work and instead shake the placement of cameras and move away. Also, the set up of scenes does not have spark or life, I think Boll just shot in one or two outlets and just used what he had. That really stinks. Clearly Boll is in one of his periodical retro movies where anything he has ever learned about the movie is released. The last movie he did that was so bad was Seed, a serial killer movie that is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is not so bad, but it's close simply because it should have been better. Then again, Udo Keir is good enough to make your scenes worth the effort and make such a bad movie. I'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're picking up the cable.
