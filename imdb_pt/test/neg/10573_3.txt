I thought this would be funny. I made. I do not know what happened. But I think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls in the cast. I do not know who this kid is, he could be a really nice person, but he was not right for this movie. And the support cast was great, which just makes it more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest and his mind just starts to drift away, but then Keith David starts talking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it's like someone turns on a light and suddenly you could pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad. But when they return to the main characters, the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful, so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean, I had some funny moments, as I remember laughing a few times, but now I do not remember why and this happened a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Actually I am giving you an evaluation or evaluation, but I think most people should simply leave it.
