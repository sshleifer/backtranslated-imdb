"Delusion" is what you experience when you watch this movie and then believe you've seen something worthwhile. This movie, which speaks of a trio of semi-psychopathic travelers who are not good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateur and simply stupid. The film suffers from a horrible story, a bad script and a terrible direction just to mention some of the deficits. If the film has anything to do with it, it's the performance of the B-movie diva, Rubin. Do not waste your time with this turkey. (D)
