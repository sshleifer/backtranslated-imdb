I get the feeling that many people liked this movie (not all people, but many of them) because they do not want to admit that they do not understand it. People of average intelligence, if they like, who pretend to always be so avant-garde and fashionable that they think Lynch is a genius. <br /> <br /> Lynch, to me, is like Tarantino. Both are great, but none of them is the messiah, as many fanboys want to believe. No director can change the world, so relax. And both make movies sometimes sucked, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And clearly, since this film was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a movie, it was not done with all the passion and premeditation that one should put in a movie. Face it, much of the film is babbling unintelligibility that can not be understood. We can all make meanings, Lynch may have his own opinion, but none of it matters. It was scattered on the screen incoherently. It is true that the first part had the appearance of a passionately interesting and intentionally complicated story, but then hesitates. <br /> <br /> The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phone calls, the lawyers ... let's go. I can almost imagine David Lynch screaming, forcing the team to gather around him and explaining to them all "Look how crazy I am crazy! Is not it great? It's so weird and crazy!" Strange and crazy works if it is a byproduct of your style. However, it is pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do anything beyond that. It's like all those Pulp Fiction counter-attacks that came after Pulp Fiction. Is not cool.
