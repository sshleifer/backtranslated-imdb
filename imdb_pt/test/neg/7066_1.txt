I had this movie, in the back of my head I saw it. I wanted to tell people about it over and over again, but I never remembered. now I found it. now, finally, I can tell people precisely which is the worst movie, the worst I've ever seen in my life, but none is. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete rubbish, and is unsuitable for a garbage dump. . all copies and other copies of this film must be assembled in a large rocket and thrown in the sun. only the purifying heat and the pressure of the sun can purify the materials in which this film is stored, so that they can be useful to the universe again. <br /> <br /> I like movies. I like bad movies. and yes this is an opinion. but this film was pure garbage, dirt and excrement of some animal that should never be seen, much less called by man. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch a Uwe Boll Movie marathon than watch this movie. and I hate Uwe Boll's movies.
