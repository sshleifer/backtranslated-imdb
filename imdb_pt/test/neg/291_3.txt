I've heard raver stories in the movie and that's great, but that's only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is the tacky. I never really understood the plot or because the guy was stealing girls. This does not make sense, but hey ... why they were in a club randomly was curious as well. Many parts of this movie do not make sense, but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels ... maybe I'm not indie enough for this movie, but judging by the final scene, they ran out of money, just cut a few things and forgot the plot. Its low budget and it looks like this. I like the fact that they used little special effects that were bad, but they used none of that quality. I would say that this movie is the bad script par excellence, with correct production. It's definitely not as random as many movies I've seen, but the pieces of the puzzle do not make sense together. In effects, I would give exception to the final battle when all effects were from 1950 on my butt. Sparks out of models and the like. Watch if you like an unintentional comedy of an action movie. The mystery science theater has a candidate.
