In a career of ups and downs with all sorts of movies, this is Altman's only science fiction attempt, and it clearly shows that he is not his forte. <br /> <br /> The film is almost incomprehensible. It looks like a disastrous combination of experimental theatrical pretentiousness and a big studio trying to jump in the aftermath of the Star Wars (not that this movie is modeled after any of that, but you can imagine that the studio signed with the hope of a very different Paul Newman, science fiction film). The story is non-existent, the characters remain strangers to us all the time. <br /> <br /> Altman has pack dogs feeding on corpses throughout the film, obviously struggling to make some kind of POINT. But since the film is so poorly thought, starting with the lack of plot on top, it really is not about anything. The projected output is confusing, the photograph is blurred by the smudges on the edges, and the punctuation is terrible. However, "Quintet" has a redeeming feature. Not only is the film clearly filmed in snow and ice, but the interiors are kept cold too. You see the breath of the actors in every scene. You really feel the cold.
