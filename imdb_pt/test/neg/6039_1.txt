There can be no worse criticism for a movie than for the word BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are great fun, some "fun" movies are bad, but boring means no one will like it. I never bought the DVD to watch it over and over again. It seemed to be a movie that employed the Antarctic drama class, they were all too busy running to warm up instead of acting. The lead actor, he said, is a close whisper, a hoarse voice, dammit, it seemed like he was going to seduce someone, and he did not care who. <br /> <br /> The movie can not make money if it's boring, I hope this one dies a fast, never to be seen again, death.
