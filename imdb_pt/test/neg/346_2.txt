I do not think you can imagine how these people really work ... !! Before going to the studios to see the guys working there, I really thought the same as you. But since I've seen and done the work that the guys on the TV show have to do, I have to say that they really deserve respect for what they're doing all day. This really is not an easy job. And also the actors, who in their eyes can be terribly bad, are really great people and many of them can really act! I do not think the material given to them can really show this, as I think this material is not very good. But they are really good! So I do not think you, before you see these guys working there, can judge for them! And I should not have judged them before I met them, but I did, and now I'm terribly ashamed of it. So please do not allow yourself to judge such excellent people unless you have not seen them doing work there.
