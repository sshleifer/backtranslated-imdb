The filmmakers try to paint the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker as a farce alongside the German occupation of France and the reign of fascism. But they never find a victim in this movie. We have heard winemakers, critics and distributors regret that as the wine industry grows, it becomes increasingly homogeneous. But the film never argues that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploration of any person or culture other than naive Wine Spectator readers with lots of money. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine, so be it. <br /> <br /> If this was a movie about the diamond trade, where the domination of the DeBeers corporation market results in human suffering, the muckraking style could have been appropriate. But, as it comes, it is only anti-American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. If the filmmakers were around in the 1870s, they would probably have protested against the grafting of American vines in the effort to save French wine.
