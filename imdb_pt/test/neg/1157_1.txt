The story of Ed Gein is interesting, very interesting. This film, however, interesting only in the fact that it was actually done. Kane Hodder's portrait of Ed Gein is so far away, not at all funny. Ed Gein did not behave psychotically in public, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everyone and talked to anyone who wanted to hear, this is one of the main things that this movie failed to show the public. But the biggest mistake of this film, next to a single picture that was already shot, was that Ed never killed anyone without his deceased mother telling him, whom he thought to be speaking with him beyond the grave. He killed only the people his dead mother said he needed because it was God's will, and he was very remorseful, although that did not stop him from experiencing cannibalism and using people's flesh. I officially gave this movie a rating of "1" simply because "0" was not given to me as an option. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to avoid this movie. If you want to see a film that accurately represents Ed Gein and do not try to put in a sub-plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed, I would HIGHLY advise you to see the original film, which unfortunately does not seem to be on the fly though I might be wrong but I still have to find it here. The original does not deviate from actual events and does not attempt to distort the story. I can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie just tried to change the true story itself, something that I find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on September 11, but gave a twist that Canada was by behind it. Or a World War II movie saying that Hitler was a nice guy and helped fight the Nazis.
