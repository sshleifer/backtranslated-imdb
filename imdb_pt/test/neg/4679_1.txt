The use of the term 'comedy' in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and worse still is the pain that is inflicted on viewers of this production. Almost nothing was funny. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of 'comics' standing on the road as they traveled from town to town to perform at small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that your conversations and behaviors offstage and onstage are indistinguishable, but unfortunately, equally bland. <br /> <br /> It is possible to understand the illusions of grandeur that the featured 'comedians' possess, but it is more difficult to understand the sounds of laughter heard from their audience. Paws these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms on TV are intended. <br /> <br /> This was possibly the worst movie I've ever watched in my over 50 years of movie viewing.
