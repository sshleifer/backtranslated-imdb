My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too annoying to lead an action thriller, even if it's totally tedious. <br /> <br /> Remember Steven Seagal? Not you? Do not worry, there is not much to catch up on. After starring in enjoyable films such as UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal reaches the low lands of the movie's gulf. Now he stars in low budget B-level action vehicles, some of which are made for the TV "Movie of the Week," starters that have lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among those, say, dead action movies. A loud and bad action movie, run carelessly and written lazily (and worse, misrepresented). This is one of those bad movies that I do not need to watch until the end to know it's bad. I did not dare to have all my brains killed while wasting my time on it. It's that kind of bad movie that you realize, the other movies you hate are not bad after all. <br /> <br /> The plot (and location) has been completely removed from a similar frame, THE ROCK, by Michael Bay., although similar may not be the word to describe it. Both films are summer films and should not be taken so seriously. But by comparison, even THE ROCK (which is not so much in the writing department as it is in lights and sounds) has better characters, a more engaging storyline, better action sequences and, in general, a more fun atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in MIDDLE DEAD, none of them are exciting. All times are tedious and predictable. While predictability appears to be a welcome addition to summer action movies, predictability has never proven to be more sour on those who are not fun, and HALF HALF is never really fun, it's often just a pain in the head the bad rap music over and over throughout this movie makes me crave for an aspirin every second I hear). The acting is terribly mediocre, the plot is derived, without convincing or appealing characters. The character of Seagal, an undercover agent sent to Alcatraz to prevent a criminal (Morris Chestnut), a very annoying villain, from being anything but excited. Seagal's character is also provided with a helper (played by rapper Ja Rule) and a lot of imprisoned friends, and there is no chemistry going on here. <br /> <br /> If you star in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (what were those movies again?) dead from Seagal's career for good, half past is an exaggeration. And the public be warned: you are invited to feel the pain. Advice: avoid it at all costs. <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
