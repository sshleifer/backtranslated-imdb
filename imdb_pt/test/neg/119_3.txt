Technically I'm a fan of Van Damme, or I was. This movie is so bad that I hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes. Do not let the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you, I had high hopes for this, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), dude..was I wrong?! all the action fans wanted a great return to the classic action hero, but I think we will not be able to see this soon, as our hero continues to come with those (going-to-frontier - city-far-and- -matar (The bad guys than the return movies), I mean, for God's sake, we're in 2008, and they insist on making those disappointing movies on all levels. yourself, skip it .. seriously.
