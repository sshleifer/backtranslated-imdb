I saw it on a boring Sunday morning this morning. Well, I was drawn to the fact that it is an outdoor movie .. I was hoping to find some nice scenery, but the views where only limited .. They only go back in the same place again .. I I hate it when they are using this material called high tech like the Motorola bluetooth headset they are using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie that was so funny ... they look like amateurs. And they like to advertise those ill-conceived alien laptops that could connect to a satellite to find people .. I could not tell you more about this TV movie .. The ending was bad that it seems they have reduced the use of rescue helicopters and etc. * / **********
