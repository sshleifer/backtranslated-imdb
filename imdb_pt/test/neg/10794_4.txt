Camals Are Coming is a very disappointing British comedy from 1934. I bought it because I like desert adventures and it states in the box that it's a drama. Certainly not. <br /> <br /> This is a couple who are heading to Egypt to capture some drug smugglers from the desert. <br /> <br /> This would have been so much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which greatly diminished. It's very silly in parts. Depsite this, there are some good scenes of action and location. <br /> <br /> The cast is led by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest. <br /> <br /> One view is enough for this movie. Overall a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
