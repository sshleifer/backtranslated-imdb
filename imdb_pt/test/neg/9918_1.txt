Undoubtedly, one of the worst movies ever made. Slow and without structure, tension or history, the film is based on the fine premise of "putting on a show". Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their beginning and the dialogue is random and incidental. Everything is placed on a slapdash request and often "Stepping Out" looks more like a deleted movie movie than a real movie. The film seems to exist only as a showcase for loud and totally random Liza musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the much higher octo-epic "tentacles", and REAL Liza can be found at Showtime's "Queer Duck: The Movie".
