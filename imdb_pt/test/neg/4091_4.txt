I really enjoyed Bruce Almighty, but the minute I figured out there would be a sequel WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell has gone hysterical in the first film (the babbling scene is one of my favorites) and, in my opinion, deserves an Emmy for his role in The Office, he is quite weak in this boring comedy. I'm curious to know how much work writers have written, because we could do the same without the story. But even if we discard the huge holes in the plot (why elephants and lions came to help Evan when the flood only interested in that particular area of ​​Washington), the movie is simply ... not funny. I did not laugh once and as far as I remember, a comedy should make you laugh. Or laugh at least. Not this one here. <br /> <br /> There is little hope though. Evan Almighty has "family" written everywhere and perhaps a family exhibit can be enjoyable, (kids can be entertained by variety of animals and silly jokes), but for me, Evan Almighty simply does not cut it. I give a 4/10 and I hope Carell is more careful when choosing his roles in the movie.
