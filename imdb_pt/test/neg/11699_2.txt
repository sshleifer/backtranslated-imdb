Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's wonderful book before seeing the movie, but I was terribly disappointed with this movie. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, replacing it with more common Hollywood-style elements. <br /> <br /> It's too bad, since this movie has a fantastic cast, particularly Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman, and then-unknown Alice Krige. They were not worth much. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was all out to get out of the way, but a friend convinced me to stay to the end, since he was sure I needed to. He apologized to me during the final credits.
