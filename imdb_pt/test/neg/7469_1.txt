I saw this movie at the New Festival in New York. It was by far the worst movie there. It is the use of uncircumcised frontal nudity and an undecided script and direction that neither commits to redoing Maurice's film nor decides it is a Neil LaBute film, made me feel 'Why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like that? '. It lacks irony and fills the vacuum with feeling, which causes the times when the movie comes around to make you want to wipe your face while your mind and heart look for what could be happening in the movie but it is not. I wish the director and publisher would have reissued the film because there may be more stories that could be released from an unpleasant experience.
