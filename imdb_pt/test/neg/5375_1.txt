I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited over a month to see this great show that A & E was doing. What a disappointment !!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. Their voices are exaggerated, not scary. Looks like he's talking in a can. From the second episode, which is about 30 minutes or more (if you take out the commercials), he is being chased or followed by something that he knows to be demonic. He can not say the name, anytime someone needs to convey that name, they write it down on a piece of paper and deliver it to someone else. It is not particularly informative or fun or believable to the rest of us. Why can not he say the name? ... supposed to give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought the demons wanted to hide their true identities. If you know the exact name of the devil, will not it be easier to cast him out? Now, the next episode, which airs in a short time, is titled "Exorcism." So does Ryan need an exorcism yet? Not to say it could not happen, but the show so far has given no evidence or evidence of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child, hell, if I were an adult, and someone gave me a small bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me, I would seek help elsewhere !!! Also, if you do not use holy water and blessings, etc. in the right way, do not risk further angering what is already angry at you? I'll probably watch tonight, but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time I watch!
