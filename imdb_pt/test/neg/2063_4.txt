There are those who complain that this is NOT the opera, but they do not care about the CABARET movie that was not the original show either. All musical movies / operas are and should be "adaptations" or do not work. CABARET took more liberties with the original show than the PORGY AND BESS film and still retained its original integrity, reworking the material, and is considered an artistic success. The same goes for PORGY AND BESS, who turned the opera into a dialogue / libretto of music, because the public at the time adored the musicals, but was far from the few filmed operas. It would have been economic suicide for Preminger to produce an opera movie - he would have lost a fortune to the Goldwyn Studios. <br /> <br /> That said, this is a good fit. The acting is excellent, Andre Previn's Oscar winning score is magnificent, as is choral singing, and the individual vocal achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin (father of popular musician Bobby McFerrin) dubbed Porgy and Adele Addison dubbed Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr. sang his own songs in the film, his recording contract would not allow his voice to be heard on the soundtrack album, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (spectacularly) for that release. Brock Peters's bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is his only self. Diahann Carroll, although a singer of fine note, has the small role of Clara, who demanded a high soprano, so trustworthy Marni Nixon dubbed it to sing. <br /> <br /> The Gershwin Estate hates the film and refuses to grant musical rights, although dramatic rights are in the public domain. This kind of hate rivalry kept the CAROUSEL video release for almost fifteen years (though in this case it was the dramatic rights that were in litigation) and is currently preventing PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE GET YOUR GUN from being released on video. <br /> <br /> Of all the theatrical productions given in cinematographic versions, it is these last two that are the only advantages of the video. Only one letter campaign for the Gershwin Estate in NY could loosen the reserve.
