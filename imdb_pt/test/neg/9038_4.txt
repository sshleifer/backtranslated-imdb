Although not really terrible, this movie is still a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist image of the Beach Boys story. <br/> <br/> Basically, this movie would make you believe that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psychopath. In fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a TV movie, so what do you expect? Mike Love's bad smell is everywhere in this turkey as he tries to rewrite the story to himself in the role of the band's prow figure and resident genius. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the music is great. Unlike previous Beach Boys made for bio-pic TV "Summer Dreams," this movie actually features real Beach Boys music, rather than anemic cover versions ... In addition, it features a surprising number of Beach-related rarities Boys and rarely - The Sunrays "I Live for the Sun" is just one example. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally screened in two parts on American TV. The first part is the superior of the two and documents the first days of the Young Men and reaches the top. By the time Part Two rolls, Brian Wilson's character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be laughing - but how could anyone take this crap seriously? If you're not a Beach Boys fan, you probably will not get much out of this movie, except for an extremely distorted and unilateral view of the band's history. But then again, why do you watch it if you were not a fan?
