I'm watching this movie as I write this. There are about 45 minutes left for the movie and there has been so much drama back and forth and empty, I do not quite see where it's going. There are no facts, just enough to leave you making assumptions. The main daughter's acting is painful. How has this been done? Not the best of Lifetime movies.
