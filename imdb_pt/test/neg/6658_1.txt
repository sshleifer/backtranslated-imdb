This movie, "Desperate Measures," was ... I'm not sure how to put it into words. Should this be a comedy? I could not stop laughing at how utterly ridiculous it was. I love Michael Keaton and I can not really understand that he did it. They did a good job at keeping my attention because I could not wait to see how much more ridiculous he was going to stay minute by minute. I actually just registered on this site so I could figure this out. I do not review movies. I do not have time for this, but I can not let that pass knowing that I have not fulfilled my civil duty by letting people (those with an IQ of 85 and above) know that this is not action / suspense, is honest for the funny good . You who are really touched by it startle me. Go watch a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. The performance of Clint Eastwood is not superb, but I was playing ball in the end. Exercise your brain in America!
