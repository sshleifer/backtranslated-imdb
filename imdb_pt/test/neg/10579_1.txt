Horror movie 1-4, epic movie, date film, meet the Spartans, not another teen movie and another gay film. Making "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in a series that solidly ruined the parody genre. Now I admit that I have a crush on classics like Airplane and The Naked Gun, but you know you ordered such a bad franchise when you can see the jokes a mile away. In fact, the only thing that can really get you to see this disaster is the incredibly fun but massive Leslie Neilson. <br /> <br /> You can say that he needs the money, stuff this or he intends to get off with the ship like a good Captain would. No way he's knocking down this genre, but heck he's not helping. But if I feel sorry for someone in this movie its decent actor Drake Bell, who is subjected to immense embarrassment. People who are subjected to the greatest amount of torture by far are the public forced to sit through 90 minutes of bile without laughing funnier than herpes. <br /> <br /> After spoofing disaster films on the plane !, shows the police in The Naked Gun, and the horrors of Hollywood in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker defines his satirical visions in the super genre -heroes with this anarchic comedy satirizing everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically engineered dragonfly, exile Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to undergo an amazing transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel and he has the strength of ten men. Determined to use his new powers to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and takes on the identity of The Dragonfly - a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But all The superhero needs an enemy, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) gets caught in the middle of a terribly wrong experience, he develops the power to suck out the life force of any one he knows and becomes the villainous Hourglass. With the intention of achieving immortality, Hourglass tries to gather as much vital force as possible, as the noble Dragonfly proposes to overthrow his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and directs this low-flying parody. <br /> <br /> with Tracy Morgan, Anderson Pamela, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. Hell Superhero movie can gain some merit in the fact that it is much better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst exits of 2008 until today. No laughing, but a little less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense much more forgettable than knowing the Spartans. But maybe that's a good reason. There are still some of us trying to scrape the spot that found the Spartans in our memory. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid, unless you are one of those people who like this car crash movie. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super villain.
