I have watched the Root of all evils with the declared purpose of refuting this scientific atheist call. I do not know where to start since it is such a rich source of stupidity. <br /> <br /> He is obviously not a statistician, otherwise the chances of him burning for eternity would have pushed him to belief in God. <br /> <br /> He regards science as religion and He expects us to believe in him as we do to God. Just look at the language used in your applications. <br /> <br /> In relation to faith. This commodity is used extensively in everyday behavior. Just think about it. When he enters an electrician, he believes that he will be connected properly and with confidence, turns on the switch. When he enters a plumber, he pulls the chain in his bathroom and waits for the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding Faith in Science When I was in chemistry class, I believed and learned that the atom was the smallest particle and the onion bark theory of the electrons, both now neglected. I was taught this as the "stone-written" atomic theory, so to speak. So why should we believe in any scientist, especially when he goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins claims that religion will be the downfall of civilization. Religion is civilization. Can he, or any other atheist, please tell us what civilization was founded and fueled by atheism, barbarism or savagery, please? He is now living in the last stages of a Christian civilization and taking all the benefits out of it without any admission by its source. I found Dawkins arrogant, dictatorial, critical, an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude towards young people. How dare he say what a father can teach his son? The child is theirs, not the nation, and as parents give them their genetics, they also leave their beliefs. His rejection of Adam as "he never existed," as he has no proof, was an example of this same attitude. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he may well do that. I just have not found the proof yet. This does not deny its existence. I note his argument with the Bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well, Dawkins does that, too. Where does he draw the line between it as a historical document and a religious declaration? He is also selective. I heard a lot when Dawkins came up with the ALTRUISTIC gene. What a joke! He is desperately seeking evidence of his madness and how the Piltdown Man was invented, we now have this so-called ALTRUISTIC gene that predisposes us to care for our youth and other members of our 'group'. The problem is that all animals do this. - not just monkeys, and with evolution is the survival of the fittest. not the nicest, and if he really thinks we're becoming kinder as a race, he's not reading the same papers as me, I've found his arrogance beyond belief in declaiming that since we only have this life, we should make the most of it . So how does he equate this with his obvious position as a well out of Europe for a deprived person in Africa who had his whole family decimated and probably raped and starving. Is he going to help her? I note that all their opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. Well G Chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion. B) we are against contraception, abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the sixth commandment. Funny what. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I think his rejection of Pius XII's pronouncement of the Dogma of the Assumption in 1958 was erroneous. He, Pius, never said that it was revealed to him while he was sitting somewhere alone. If Dawkins does not know, the Apocalypse ended with the last apostle. Pius would have taken years of counsel and studied documents delivered over the centuries to have this pronouncement. Also as a Catholic, I find his rejection of all religious people satisfied. what total rubbish. We struggle against the world, the flesh and the devil every day. We are the Militant Church. We are also able to boast at sunset and admire the beauties of nature, even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that he interviewed fanatics and overtook them all.
