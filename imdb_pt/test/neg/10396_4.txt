Documentaries about fans are always mishmashes, and never worth seeing through, but I found this one, made by some of the fans themselves, more than usually unheard of. As a veteran of Tolkien's original madness forty years ago, I expected more than the obvious - which is not always true. If there is someone who still does not know the nature of a fandom, any fan, having been or known a fan, he will not find it out here. Between irrelevancies, buzzwords (for which the actors in the movies are particularly prone) and scenarios (for fans who get the most - if not the best - of their one shot at fame), I could not understand anything about the special appeal. of LOTR, the special emotional responses it evokes, and the scope of the special creative forms these responses can take. In addition, the film is quite lazy: it reduces some facts that could have been obtained with little effort, for example. what was the exact legal loophole (the writing of a copyright notice) that allowed unauthorized publication of books in the United States. Speaking of which: I strongly accept the rejection of the cover film in that issue as "irrelevant" and "psychedelic." "What they were not, they were the work of Jack Gaughan, a very capable illustrator of the period, and some fans, myself included, found them more fit and attractive than the covers of the rival scenario."
