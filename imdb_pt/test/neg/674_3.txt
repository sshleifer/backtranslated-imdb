Tyra and the rest of the modeling world need to know that real women like me and my daughter do not mind seeing all the ridiculous modeling to sell something. Weird places, lots of makeup and lots of skin is not necessary. Sex is not always sold when you're selling to women. The same goes for the walk on the walkway that looks unnatural. People come in all shapes and sizes and they need to have it on show. My daughter has a 36 "seam, is tall and slender and a size 5, I am more average in a size 12. We would see both, I can not imagine how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing, will not fit the same way in me, I do not buy more magazines because they are unilateral on this subject. We really love the show to consider women of all sizes.
