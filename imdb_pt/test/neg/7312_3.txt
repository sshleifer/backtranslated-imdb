Well, I have to say that I own this movie and I just like the ending. The film is boring and slow, but the final fight is very funny. Let's just say that if the fake bird did not attack the main evil guy, that movie would be a 0 out of 10. The bird is a 3. If you're really bored or want something awful to watch, rent it and fast forward to the final battle .
