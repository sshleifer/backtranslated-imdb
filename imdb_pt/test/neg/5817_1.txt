I am a great lover of really bad B movies. And I particularly love alien / scifi movies. I say the cheapest, cheesier and campier the best. A low budget and a crooked idea are fun enough for most bad B movies, but this movie is so bad that I really felt embarrassed by the people who made the film and the improvised actors. First, there is no real plot, it's all kind of "comedy" situation (if it can be called that). The "comedy" in this movie is more about characters saying, in essence, "look at me, I'm in this crazy situation! Is not it funny?" But it's pathetic because nothing that anyone else is doing is funny. There is no comic acting ability, nor any moody plot to carry out all the non-imaginative scenarios through this boring pack. <br /> <br /> Bad comedy and the lack of anything remotely comic is only made worse by bad improvisation. acting, actors saying really stupid things over and over again (maybe trying to appeal to phrases of effect, maybe just because everyone is so bad), really uninteresting women being played like hotties, and people vomiting and fainting There was a middle- age at the end of the movie that I could say I had some acting skills and was kind of "convincing in his role". He was as out of place as a solid BM in the bathroom of a weekend detox unit. Corey Feldman was filmed for about 3 minutes in total (fortunately we did not have to stay with him any longer), and he was filmed off site - probably out of his apartment on the way to somewhere. He said some really non-funny things about aliens and having sex with aliens and that was the extent of their appearance. <br /> <br /> If you value your life and the 90 minutes (and years of pain in remembering) you will lose by observing this garbage, avoid it. If you use a lot of drugs, such as Adam Sandler's comedy styles (and therefore have no standard), and are considered mentally slow, you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> Q. I think people who loved this should work for Troma or something, b / c I can not believe people can be as thighs as really enjoy this movie. (Do drugs really spoil your judgment?)
