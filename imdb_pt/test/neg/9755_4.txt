Step Up is a fair dance movie about some kids who get a great break from their performance. The film is medium in every way, with little more for the viewer. An athlete fights against external prejudices to become a dancer with an accomplished partner and a teacher who sees something special. The acting was fine, but the dialogue and the direction had little to add to overcome a predictable story. Nevertheless, you still feel very good about the outcome of the film. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers who went a little overboard. This is a B + class film with moderate errors of continuity and setbacks. The scenery was good and the characters remained true to life. Worth watching if you like this kind of movie.
