Although I found the acting excellent and the cinematography beautiful, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the important parts of the novel is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves rather than continue. This is never presented in the film, they show it as if it were a sleigh accident. <br /> <br /> Character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent. While in the novel they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it seems that both are invalid. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mattie and Ethan consummate their relationship almost destroying the power and pungency of the end. The change of the narrator as a preacher was an effective change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette excel at their representations. Joan Allen was also wonderful, however his character was greatly diluted in Wharton's novel. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the films to faithfully portray the novels, but this was far and in the process almost destroyed the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you have read the book, since you will be confused and disappointed.
