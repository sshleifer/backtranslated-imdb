Last week I watched a production of the Royal Shakespeare Company of Macbeth. She was 25 years old, filmed without props, except swords, no furniture except chairs. It was REBORNED. The acting was super - all the actors trained British. Contrast this performance to this ... yawn yawn yawn. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy and could not lose the New York accent, despite the long ... pauses ... between ... the lines ... The whole thing was soporific, even the "comic" scenes "hardly worth a smile, leave a lonely laugh. That should be funny. They have tried to make it tragic. It was not boring at all. I give four points for costumes, scenery, and Jeremy Irons, who is good at touching a bored, depressed guy with a deep voice (can it be anything else?)
