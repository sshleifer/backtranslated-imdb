When I knew the movie would be released and the theme of the subject, I felt very curious. But when I saw it was the biggest mistake of my life. Technically speaking, the sound is bad, you can tell about man dialogues that have been redone in the studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix. Secondo of everything, the photograph is mediocre, some part of the films shows some soldiers with glasses of night vision, and the way the director of photography reaches that "dark night" is illuminating everything as if they were in a real military base with lights , there are no used moonlight references, my God! After all, most of the activities are really bad, it is not entirely credible the role of the wife of one of the soldiers, their performance is very bad. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment, shame of the jury that chose to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
