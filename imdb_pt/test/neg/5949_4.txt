Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely gorgeous in this ca. 1840 "west". That alone, however, does not help a ridiculous story, with countless historically incorrect elements. Byrl Ives is convincing as the tyrannical patriarch in his early 70s, an egomaniac who swears by his hundredth birthday. His wild dance at a party he gives to his neighbors will make anyone take notice (this guy is SEVETY SIX?). Always mumbling the verses of the Bible, he demands respect while leading his children and friends away with his arrogant speech and emotional cruelty. <br /> <br /> The love affair between Perkins and Loren at first seems absurd, but it becomes believable near the end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. Clearly written for the stage, this story was dated even when it was filmed. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in the 1840s, although the song was not composed until 1882. <br /> <br /> The critics who beat Sophia Lorens "command of the English language" are rather stingy. I found the English flawless and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a distinct dialect that often had to be dubbed "good Italian." Her "accent", however, hardly affects how she speaks English. As a first-generation German German, I can appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as a second, or even third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in the classic sense. To my satisfaction, it lacked a logical history and a general "reward" for the time invested. The fans of the stars will not want to lose, others, however, tuning at your own risk!
