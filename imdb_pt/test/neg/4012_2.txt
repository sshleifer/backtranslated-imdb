Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his films talk to each other because, he says, people do it in their lives. Well, people also cough, burp, get into entanglement, etc. The point is that just because people actually do something does not make it an attractive movie. This is an issue. The most important question is that this is not a very clever, direct, relevant or relevant satire in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the 1960s and thinks that all but a small core of Republican elected officials is a 1960s hippie liberal. I mean, the guy still trots Zonker on his strip - a character who is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still employs him as if he were a representative of a great American youth band. <br /> <br /> I'm wrong. I am a conservative, but I am not saying that this is bad because it has a liberal inclination. It could take a liberal attitude and be funny and relevant, but it is not. It's mostly a piece of vanity with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals (including the loathsome and disgusting Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes it seems improvised, and the rest of the time has a sarcastic air of self-importance and "are not we so smart?" - ness. <br /> <br /> Someone said that this show insists they have a following cult. I think your cult status is more desired than real. I'm sure there are two or three people out there who recorded all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that is the standard then every show that has aired is a cult classic to some degree. If Tanner did not have the names Altman and Trudeau, it would be another forgotten HBO production of the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as a blunt and incisive political commentary on guys at the top of their game. The reality, however, is as far as possible. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner, and he's been dead for a decade.
