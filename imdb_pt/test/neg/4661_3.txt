Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> I found in my film studies that when Michael Bay makes a movie, people hate him and hate him, but still they will see him and that does something around 100 million. dollars. . Because? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time. Alongside Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki, Michael Bay has established himself as the best director of action / adventure in Hollywood. This point is proven with his most widespread film, Armageddon. A Texas-size asteroid is racing toward the planet, and the only way NASA can think of knocking it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid, punch it to the center, and drop it a nuclear warhead inside and explodes the asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough to do it: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, a hardened, grizzled oil driller trying to keep what's left of his family. Not helping this fact is his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), having an affair with his best puncher, AJ (Ben Affleck). Hired by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), NASA boss Stamper and his team of roughneck drills train to become astronauts and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two part film. First there are the funny parts where we meet the gang and the madness is abundant. Then they enter the space and the whole comedy is sucked out the window and is replaced by mind blowing special effects, cool music and great serious acting. Murphy's law goes crazy in the second part, which means that anything that can go wrong actually goes awry, increasing the film's tension to noticeable levels. <br /> <br /> With a cool cast and crew (Michael Bay as director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the writers.), tons of special effects, great humor, incredible music, plus an introduction made by Mr. Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, Armageddon Rocks Big Moment. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Parent Warnings: This is not a children's movie. Pump F is used a few times and many other profanities are used as well as there is a strip bar scene and the second extremely intense part may be too difficult for a child.
