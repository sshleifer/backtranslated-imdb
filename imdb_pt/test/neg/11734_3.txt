The original "Psycho" (1960) is widely regarded as the best work of Alfred Hitchcock and certainly, in my opinion, is one of the best films of all time. The decision to shoot a shot by shooting remake is therefore somewhat intriguing. <br /> <br /> The cast of the original was flawless, so the cast of this remake had a lot to live on. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates was not a good choice for the leader. He is very handsome and not as convincing as Bates. I can imagine actors like Mark Wahlberg or John Turturro doing a much better job on paper. Anne Heche as Marion Crane does a credible job, but a person mentally compares her to Janet Leigh. Julianne Moore is a far better actress than she shows here and Viggio Mortenson just walks in her role. The best of this new cast is William H. Macy as the private eye. Although director Gus Van Sant does an acceptable job, he can not build suspense the way Hitchcock did. And why did he change the scene in the basement of the house? In the original, the atmosphere is dark, humid and closed, whereas in this version, it occurs in a well-lit laboratory environment. And I think black and white photography of the original has a definite edge over the color version. <br /> <br /> Perhaps another flaw could be the fact that most viewers have seen the original and know what will happen. When. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if it's not broken, do not fix it. <br /> <br />
