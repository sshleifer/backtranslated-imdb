I saw this movie at a midnight and I can say that it is worse than another horror movie about a haunted house.Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actresses but she can make the role better, the little girl get worse this is an example on a Bad actress, she has no future in the great world of movies. HOME DAMAGE SENTENCE: EVIL
