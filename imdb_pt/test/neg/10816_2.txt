"The Cave" was released more or less simultaneously with the English film "The Descent" directed by Neil Marshall. Both films share a similar premise; only "The Cave" is terribly unoriginal, uninteresting and incompetent compared to the splendid horror adventure that is "The Descent." It seems that Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was very poor and instantly added ingenious ideas, depth and a personalized style, while the director of "Cave" Bruce Hunt simply opted for the most rudimentary drafting of the script that was launched at his desk. . The result is an incredibly mediocre movie that features all the horror clich√©s you can imagine and where most of the violence happens off-screen. And we all hate it, do not we? The story introduces a group of unbearable cave divers trapped in a completely unknown Romanian underground ecosystem. Horrible winged creatures, which are also parasites, then attack them and escape seems impossible due to a landslide. The first half-hour is still slightly amused if you keep busy looking at all the cliches and listening to the cheesy textbook dialogues, but the whole thing gets pretty awful. None of the events are anything but plausible and it seems that the entire cast is competing against each other to deliver the WORST performance. I've seen better special effects on anonymous B movies, the movie locations are not being used to the fullest, and the ending sucks! Very NOT recommended!
