As his entire career was a pale representation of the Beatles, it is hardly surprising that, shortly after the Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour" fiasco, the Monkees continued with their own insulting and creative film called "Head." Both films are not so much a true story with a plot (although the MMT has tried to define a plot) as they are a miscellany of skits and snippets, interspersed with music and songs and taken. "Head" has no plot, except the pre-fab-four trying to break free of the "box" they are in (ie the Monkees type and the surrounding mercantilism) and yet, always lying back in the box. Most sketches involve "fourth wall" breaks and passage to other seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam messages from Vietnam and attempts by the group to show off their other talents, the film moves around in a random manner - also to be blamed by multiple directors. <br /> <br /> The film, like Magical Mystery Tour, is now excused by some fans as "wonderful symbolism and misrepresented artistic statements". Phooey As MMT, there are many guys with access to many drugs, all trying to do something artistic and doing bullshit. Like MMT, "Head" has some smart moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are pretty decent. He develops a bit more charm than MMT and is a bit easier to sit in, but it's not ironic, like everything the Monkees did, it was just a mimicry of something the Beatles did first ... even when try to lay an egg.
