This movie tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. He tried hard to be sexy. I'm not putting the works of actresses like Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something other than "Le Femme Nikita" on TV, worthy of her talents.) I just did not find it, not even on the call A quasi-seduction scene with mrs. Barkin any real emotion, although I know that the playwrights worked hard to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of Wilson's disturbed sex victim did not touch our heart (which even for one end did not deserve), nor the killer element of the plot. Maybe it was the script or maybe the direction, but I did not feel for anyone in this movie, and without that feeling, a movie does not work for me. If you are interested in a lesbian film, there are at least two films on each side of the show to check out: 1.) The generous pleasure of "Bound", which works well in a noir environment; and 2.) The most honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in Hell's Kitchen called "All Over Me". He is a well-defined indie of the mid-1990s who deals with the issue of adulthood with feelings, not forced sexuality. Both would be a better rental than "Mercy" that has almost nothing.
