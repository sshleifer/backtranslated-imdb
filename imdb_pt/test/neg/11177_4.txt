A gorgeous and gorgeous Charlotte Lewis stars as a woman who is terrified by a ghost that torments her on the phone. Driven into terror, Charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery to save her sanity and her life. I believe that Ruggero Deodato, the director behind "Ultimo Mondo Cannibale", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park" directed this absurd piece of crap. Admittedly the music of the frontman Goblin Claudio Simonetti is very good, but the story is painfully stupid. Franco Ferrini's script is ridiculous and does not make sense, the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense. The scene in which a possible rapist of Charlotte Lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway phone is more than laughable.Don't waste your time with this piece of crap.There are much better Italian horror movies out there!
