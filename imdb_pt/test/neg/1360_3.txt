Not much really happens in this movie. There are some crucial moments, and everything else is talking about a crucial moment that occurs before the movie starts. The main mechanism used in the story is flashback. Flashbacks can be used very well, but they are not here. There is no indication of zero when blinking forward or backward, and there are only a few weeks separating events, so the context as a scene unfolds is the only way to know when something happens. Maybe this was planned to add a sense of mystery in some places, but it was very annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in attending a 100 minute discussion on the screen about why things are a good questioning against evil, enjoy. If you watch close-ups of an almost vacant look on Ryan Gosling's face for much of the movie attracts you, you're in luck. Unfortunately, I can not find reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as another comment pointed out, Spacey really is just in a special role here, and plays with a disinterested detachment you've probably seen. The rest contain spoilers although some big points are retained. First, the murder of the so-called retarded boy happens before the movie is opened, and we never learn what exactly happened. The implication is that he was killed to stop the deep sadness that was communicated through the eyes of the boy. There are not many other unanswered questions as the characters besides the boy and the leader are very one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> As for what's with the main character ... Another comment has suggested that he is crazy. I agree that he is not "right", but I do not know if I would call him crazy. It seems that the film struggled to convey that he was autistic or retarded in some way because he seemed slow and unable to understand the obvious. Either that or they were going to a neglected young man with some distancing disorder and / or who was heavily medicated. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at broadcasting something to the public, but it looks exactly what was deliberately left in the air in this case. This movie does not provide answers, just questions, but it was a bad enough movie that I did not really care.
