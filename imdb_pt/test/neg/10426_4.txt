This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his biography 'Wired' written by Bob Woodward. Everything of the film is narrated in flashback without a chronological order, where after the death of John Belushi we see an angel accompanying Belushi during some points Michael Chicklis in John Belushi's character is quite credible but totally devoid of Belushi's devastating force, and his play remains only a pale animation. The director, in more, can not continue the story, which for those who do not know the book is very confusing. But the worst is that they introduced Bob Woodward who spoke to Belushi before he died. To this negative point, the film is just an attempt to narrate the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.
