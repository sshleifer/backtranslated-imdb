Critters 4 begins, and I quote 'Somewhere in Kansas 1992' & a repeat of the last minutes of Critters 3 (1991) as the recurring character of Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to film the last two eggs of Critter's universe which, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the entire Critter race which is against some kind of intergalactic zoological law or something like that. Charlie's bounty hunter friend, Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Tetra Advisor & is a senior official of the intergalactic council and commands Charlie not to shoot the eggs, placing them in a cocoon that will land nearby much coming soon. in fact lands nearby very quickly and Charlie actually lays eggs on him but he is also caught in the cocoon that I assume the cryogenic will freeze him, as never really explained. Critters 4 then informs us that we are "somewhere in the Quadrant of Saturn 2045" where a rescue ship comes across with the pod floating in space (the credits have barely ended and Critters 4 is already stealing whole ideas and scenes of Aliens (1986)). Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the unidentified, for them anyway, pod & try & make a little money out of it. With the help of his team, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe), the capsule is successfully recovered. They come in contact with the intergalactic council and the Tetra Counselor says to go to an abandoned space station, where a trade will be made for the pod and its contents, Tetra also specifically tells Rick not to open the pod. So in the true tradition of horror movies, Rick opens the group, knocks Charlie out and Critter eggs hatch, kill Rick and escape to the space station ... Co-produced and directed by Rupert Harvey IO Critters 4 was a very useless movie and skirted the Critter movie series with a whine instead of a bang. The script of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is predictable and clich√©, the space station with an unstable reactor that will explode in a few hours, the protagonists only means of escape being neutralized at first so they get stuck, the race against time to be saved, constant quarrels and discussions between the team, the people separating and the loser who becomes a hero and saves the day, yawn. Many plot devices appear to come straight from Aliens and rip off Star Wars (1979) with a trash compactor scene. The characters are no better and you probably will not give a damn about any of them. While the other Critter films could be described as comedy horrors, Part 4 can not, it seems to be completely serious everywhere. Critters 4 is also incredibly slow with no incidents and annoying. It's more than 30 minutes before the hatching of the Critter eggs and after this brief sequence is almost the mark of an hour before they are seen again, why make a Critter movie and barely present them? It may not be because of the expensive special effects as they look like glove dolls anyway, oh and how can a simple Critter operate an entire space station and set a course for Earth? How do they know what Earth is? Why did Capatin Rick want to open the cocoon? What is all this with the female scientist and an alien rubber thing that is mentioned only once? Why does intergalactic advice want Critters so much? Why do you just send four men? Why is this perfectly beautiful space station totally deserted again? Critters 4 seems cheap everywhere with bland, unimaginative dark and even steals footage from Android (1983) for their ships and space scenes, Critters 4 was apparently so low budget that filmmakers could not afford for any optical effects Android looks seriously dated. In most cases, only two Critters are used, although a few more start hatching, but it's very late the day this happens because most of the film is poorly seen and the effects for them are the worst of the whole series . Forget any blood or gore as the Critters only kill two people during the 90 minutes plus run time which just was not enough to keep my interest waining. The acting is pretty bad too, with Angela Bassett's melodramatic reaction to seeing some particularly confusing Critter eggs. To look at Critters 4, it's such a cheap production and nothing spectacular as you might expect (not) to see. The end of Critters 4 has the universe finally being saved from the Critter threat, and lets hope also save us and our local video stores from the threat of a 5 part ...
