Thursday June 9, 9:15 pm Egyptian Theater Saturday, June 11, 2:00 pm Uptown Theater Being loved and belonging is essential for most children. Those born to Vietnamese mothers and soldiers' parents often found neither. The Beautiful Country is the story of one of these children, Binh, rejected by her rural village, then struggling to find her American father. The film begins with a green and wild country, but descends to sweaty ugliness and boredom. The considerable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in useless and ill-conceived papers aboard the rusty freighter that transports Binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appears to be stockpile of stormy seas. New York offers slave work and character cliches. Although very uneven from the beginning, the great curiosity of this film is the final segment. Nick Nolte receives the highest revenue among the cast. I jokingly suggested that he would probably only be in the final scene and was not far from the truth. While the trip takes Binh to Texas and his father, the film assumes a serene and austere simplicity. A tenuous cohabitation unites these two men into a family of father and son. The odd ninety minutes of junk we just saw are rewarded by Nolte's deep, subtle performance as they slowly interact. Credits rolled and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas native Terrence Malick.
