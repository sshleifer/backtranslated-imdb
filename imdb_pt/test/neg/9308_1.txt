Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 wine bottle - it had no substance to start with and only gets worse with age. This film proves that it is completely toxic. We can only hope this is your final film and that your serious lack of success will lessen your chances of getting funding for future ventures. It's up there with "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saves the World" as the most abysmal example of Australian comedy imaginable. How tragic is that, with so much comic talent infinitely superior in Australia, Yahoo has these vehicles to express its brand of childish comedy. And to think - he was 7 years old to create the script. True genius!
