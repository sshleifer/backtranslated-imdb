If I could give this movie less than a 1, I would certainly do that. I had read a review of this movie in LA Times and saw myself walking through the theater and I remembered the review. My wife and I joked and thought that it can not be as bad as the critic said - you know the critics. Sure enough ... Give some time with the horrible camera work horrible, misuse of the budget (which has been mentioned over and over as an excuse). I've worked on movies with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. It's the director and the producer that makes the movies work - they choose the teams. That's it. If they do not put it together and make it work ... it just does not. So they did not - and this does not happen. I do not think they can ... I just had to take the time to write this review ... although I'm sure the film crew will not appreciate this review - I hope you're doing everyone a favor with my wish for you do well, but - in another career. Good luck.
