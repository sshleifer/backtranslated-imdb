Documentarists are proliferating so much that the approach needs an injection of new creative material each time it is used to maintain its vitality. This film delivers nothing but worn-out retreads of similar stories, an aimless script, weak improvisations, uninspired acting, and bland self-conscious humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems promising enough; the legend of the Loch Ness monster is custom made for one of those funny and ridiculous misadventures with a wide range of history and legend waiting for an outrageous satire. Filmmakers, however, totally squander this enormous potential. We have some idiot inserting a fake Nessie into the water. Wow, this is original. Another scene has an unpleasant idiot threatening another obnoxious idiot with a gun. Sidesplitting. Some free pics of a beautiful bikini girl. Annette did this 40 years ago (and much better, by the way). Throughout the film, someone seems to be always shouting: I suppose this was done to awaken the audience that waved at this point. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, though, is the relentless saving of those realities. show the type of "interview comments" made by the characters. They not only kill him with this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently the actors also improvised; this is the only explanation for how humorless the jokes are. If you say, "I've never seen anyone write a book on non-evidence" were scripted, then the writer should be shot in the eye and fed to Nessie. <br /> <br /> No wonder Nessie was violent; obviously saw this movie.
