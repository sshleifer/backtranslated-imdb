OK, about 11 years ago, the incredible and funny movie, "The Mask," came out and everyone loved it and now, 11 years later, the mask is brought back in this incredible movie, right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! This movie was the stupidest movie I've ever seen !! I mean, when I rented, I thought I'd be laughing so hard I'd almost pee in my pants like the first. but after I saw this "sequal" I barley still let out a chuckle. I do not want to offend the director or the cast of this film, but what a waste of time and money. so the plot of the whole story was about that little baby who has some of the mask on him and that bad person is after him for something because that's all I really have, I would have added a few more things to him then it would be more 2 out of 10 stars.
