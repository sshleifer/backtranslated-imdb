Okay ... she's on the boat with this guy, realizes that he's out to kill her, knocks him out, and then discovers that the reason he's out of it is that record that killed his co-worker. So what would any rational person do? Maybe conk it over your head again to make sure that it's really off? Tie it ?? Look, dear Sandra, you have the chance to escape while the guy's been away for so long. Until you know how long it will take you to get away, make sure he can not come after you. I hate those stupid female victims' roles. The rest of the film was just a series of twists that were completely complicated and unbelievable to remain interesting.
