This is the worst movie I have ever seen and what most disappoints me is that this is yash raj movie so at the beginning when you see the promos you think it is definitely another yash raj hit But when you see the movie your eyes go wet with disappoint the plot is stupid and dumb we've seen many times the boy is about to get married and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah blah. If you see this movie pathetic, do not go with your family, there are lots of exposure and kiss scene. I do not even see why you would see him alone. in general this is a disgusting doom and anything else that is bad and starts with a movie d do not go see it you will end up hating yash ji and yash raj movies
