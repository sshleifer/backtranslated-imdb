It turns out that I rented this movie with my sister hoping to watch a great entertainment movie, which was humorous, however my expectations were disappointed. This film went beyond disgusting and revolting to a PG-13 movie, this should have been rated R for the many mature references that have occurred in this film. I would not recommend allowing a 13-year-old to see this. Even though no one under 17 is watching this movie, beware of a really stupid movie, there is no humor in the film, just a lot of disgusting sex references, including a little hint of pedophilia, something that should not even be played. <br /> <br /> I wonder what happened to the PG-13 movies, which were actually safe for 13-year-olds? This is beyond a deplorable film and must be reclassified.
