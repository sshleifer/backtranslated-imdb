Lance Henriksen paid something to appear on this. I hope it was a lot. <br /> <br /> Kristie Phillips, a former United States national champion gymnast, starts out as Charlie Case, a secretive gymnast-turned agent (because it is very common for munchkin gymnasts to become government spies ...) /> <br /> There is a truly hysterical opening scene in which the routine of Charlie's jagged bars is sabotaged by a competitor of the Eastern pack. What follows is one of the most ridiculous stunt scenes I've ever seen ... and they want you to take it seriously! Do not worry ... she shoves her disassembly. <br /> <br /> Everything after that is just a messy spy movie. Watch the first fifteen minutes for the extravagant gym equipment and run to hide.
