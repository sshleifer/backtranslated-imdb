There's potential there with "Tell No-one." A curious and intriguing plot, and a French version of a very American story. But for me, opportunities have not been exercised here. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed some aspects of this movie, there were three prominent flaws that took it to four in ten. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is a silly murder mystery and clich√©. A Specifically Written Assassination or Bergerac. Being French does not eliminate this problem - it's just silly and in French at the same time. It is full of implausible coincidences. <br /> <br /> Second, the US transition to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor walking the streets of a French city with his new "manos" and his SUVs ... and then there are the car chases ... <br /> <br /> But thirdly and especially, it is very long. For me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes, and more than two hours takes a serious justification. This time he did not.
