I've never heard of this movie when it first came out. He must have sunk immediately. : o) I saw the cable while I was sick at the hospital, so I barely had enough power to watch it, let alone turn the channel. Better choice than the style channel. The plot is recycled from boat farces of the 1930s and '40s. The cast seems to have been recycled since the 1950s. Donald O'Connor, star of for the main cast, Walter Matthau is still playing the same part he did in Guys and Dolls or was it about the orphan girl? Wiseacre irresponsible and rounder player.Don't worry about a man of his age.As for Jack Lemmon, he Dyan Cannon is incredibly attractive as another con man sailing with his mother who thinks Walter is rich while he thinks she is rich Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother , another retread from the 1950s. The most entertaining is the dispute between Brent Spiner as the overbearing and arrogant cruise director who immediately sees Walter as a poor dancer and spends his time trying to get him fired, you will have to pay for your free passage. In the end, though he receives his rewards. Meanwhile, Jack Mopes, meets an attractive woman with mutual attraction, but the case is broken by Walter's lies that Jack is a doctor, when in fact he was a buyer of a retired department store. But finally, the two men go to sea on a rubber boat to intercept their seaplane and all is well. There does not appear to be any main actor under the age of fifty.
