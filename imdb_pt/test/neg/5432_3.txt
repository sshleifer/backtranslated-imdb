This was a highly sensational film before its release, but ended up being a failure. I never talked to a person who liked this movie. I agree: I did not like it either. Perhaps a big reason not to be a blockbuster was that he had nothing but nasty characters in the story. <br /> <br /> For a while - I do not know if this is still true - I did not have Any movie where Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played anything but annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This, and a stupid story, makes this movie a big disappointment, especially considering the large backlog. Did the filmmakers, with the dialogue of this idiot, really think that would be a success?
