I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of crap, I want my money back. It's an ad-level horror movie that is not so cool. <br /> <br /> There are many POINTS in this film, including acting, lack of real horror, lack of nudity (which in addition to the initial Nurse <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is perhaps the best thing, because it has some very optimistic riffs / guitar tracks. <br /> < (the athlete's wife, the nerd guy (who looks more like an athlete), the novice cop / ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth that I wanted to put some currencies into the dollar in that gap.or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the pure girl. The makeup was lamentable with dr chopper's side views showing a clear "makeup line" and natural skin tones, the cover of the DVD is clearly photoshop / enhanced to make the cover more attractive, since Dr. Chopper looks like an old "p lopper "Grumpy women who stand around Dr chopper are not explained and neither convincing Ook like the rest of this movie. <br /> <br /> The turnaround in the story was very predictable and the abundance of fake members of bad looks was laughable, what they thought, .... um throw some members around and some fake blood and you have one Horror Movie. The helicopter itself is the stupidest character I've ever seen, although original I believe the creator of this film was tense by ideas and possibly tried to use Doctor and chopper (bike) rhyme and thought the "bingo" would be a low quality movie about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse things before ... but that's just bad. all about this is bad ... lack of suspense ... lack of real horror or character development ... lack of a decent plot ... the only good thing about this movie was when it ended. This movie does not fall into the category Ã¯ts so bad it's good "for me too / General 2/10 the director / writer / editor should know better.
