The only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in New York during the year 81. As for the film itself, it has at least three major flaws. First of all, there is narration throughout the film, which is not mandatory. In the few places where some explanation is needed, just adding a little dialogue would have been a long way. Second, there was no obvious attempt to sync any audio, in fact, it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later, with no attempt to match the movie. The third flaw was at the end. I will not give an end to the brave souls who would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but commit a fundamental sin in the script. It's not worth the money or the time it takes to see it, unless you're a fan of one of the bands represented.
