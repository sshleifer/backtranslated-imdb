A girl named Isobel is possessed by a demon. The local priest (who previously dated Isobel's sister) should try to save her, but the biggest problems are with the suspicions of each other's family rather than the demon in his daughter. <br /> <br /> This movie is directed by Ethan. Wiley, the writer of "House" and the writer / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and enjoyed the second even better then you would think this would be a winner. Unfortunately, this seems to have been played together by first year film students. Dawson Leery could have done better. I thought about blaming the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially as the idea is not original (are they trying to profit from fans of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose"?), But Wiley should have been able to do her magic. <br /> <br /> In addition, you'd like to think that veteran terrorists Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russian (playing the bishop) barely shows up, and Combs has a big role as a sheriff ... for the five minutes he's on the screen (but I love the mustache). So it does not help here. After seeing "The Exorcist", all other exorcism films should be compared to the classic by default, right? And the demonic possession in this movie was not at all scary. No spinning or paranormal head activity. Just a girl with a deep voice and make-up dripping. All the "demonic" material was centered around the father accusing everyone of sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "You have a lot of Isobel jumping on the bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in your closet and jumping out of a hay loft. Yeah, Chuck E. Cheese went crazy." This, unfortunately, sums up the extent of "evil" in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who make up accusations and yell at each other while the possessed daughter sits in another room outside -camera, this is the movie for you. But if you do not mind me saying that, you have a horrible taste in the movie, if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to focus on the father accusing a cowboy of sleeping with his wife (who did not sleep with the daughter) and the vet's sleeping with the wife (who may have but denies). And then you have a gardener who attacks the possessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but when the priest arrives the gardener declares that he does not believe in God. What all the Bible quotations you were making five minutes ago? <br /> <br /> A horrible movie of exorcism. Horribler examples of what Combs and Russo are able to do. And such a sad showing of direction after the "House" series of films became classic. I'd like to pretend that Wiley had no part in making this film shamefully derivative and not original, uninspired. The power of Christ compels you to avoid this movie as if seeing it were a capital sin.
