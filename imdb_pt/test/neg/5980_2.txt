absolutely nothing about this movie is funny, interesting or relevant. plus two characters get together at the end, nothing is solved and there is no plot. And by the way, what's the deal with the DVD cover? has a female ass in daisy duke shorts ... where was that scene in the movie? No one has ever used daisy dukes in this movie! Surprisingly, almost all the acting in this film is good, and Jack Black plays a full song (could be a tenacious band d ... do not know though) ... these are the only redeeming values, however. overall, it's just a waste of time.
