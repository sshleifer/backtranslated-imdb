By Hollywood standards, this movie was filmed and edited as are the Hollywood movies and therefore looked like a movie you would take out of a major production studio within Hollywood. This is where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends. This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! I'm not kidding. The story was so incredibly stupid and unreal that I could not contain my laughter at the movies during the course of watching this movie. I know what you're saying, "It's a horror movie that should not have a good story that should scare you." Well, let me tell you something, the movie is not at all scary. It's very full of stupid bits that nullify the little suspense that may have occurred. The acting was horrible too, along with the killer's fear, which you constantly see through flashbacks trapped in a cage. Throughout the film, I kept realizing that I was watching something that was thought, written, produced and directed by a high school student who watches a lot of pornography. Please do not watch this movie, spend your $ 8.50 on other things, like a snow cone, which would be worth more.
