I kind of had a little high expectations for this movie. I always thought the lesser known films of Tom Selleck (ie Fugitive and Coma), well above the ones he had the most press for. Maybe the producers should have a little more knowledge about former Major League Baseball players who have become stars abroad. Most of them were too good for a triple of a baseball, but not exactly the best in the major league. I admire the idea of ​​putting the character of Selle in Japan, versus the cliché of playing with the minors. It's sad to say that this movie, much like the title of the post, is stranded in third place by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot. I would not mind seeing a sequel, and I hope the producers would learn from the mistakes. The premise is too original to be left alone with this uneven film
