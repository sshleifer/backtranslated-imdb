This movie is supposed to be about three young idealists, two of whom join the Naxalite movement and the bláblá. In fact, it's just another movie about beautiful and rich people trying to decide who to go to; the peasants, the Naxalites, and the political struggles of the time serve only as a picturesque backdrop. Literally, as we do not hear the villagers say a word, it does not matter to learn someone's name, so they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in the old Hollywood movies. The movie is also monotonous and the story does not get us anywhere - except several rooms. Supposedly, we should admire the art of all this, which means only good music and a dance routine, which would not save the film, of course, but could have at least relieved boredom. <br /> <br /> The friend Japna was annoyed by the immorality of the whole story, not with the part of the room, but with all the meaninglessness of the story. The message seems to be that ideals are not worth it.
