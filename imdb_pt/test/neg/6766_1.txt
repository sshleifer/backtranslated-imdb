Yes. A real stinker. I saw this movie following the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me that this is a great "psychological" movie. This film makes all efforts not understandable. I was aware that I was in shit after seeing the first 20 minutes. I've waited since I expected to see something valuable, and most important of all, I paid for this movie. The wait was unbearable. After seeing the film, I talked to my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments (which they call themselves under this title) of Turkey, this "film" had recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers. I think a movie should be self-explanatory. This movie is just the opposite. Stay away from this thing called "movie." Burn your money instead of paying for this "phenomenon." Rate: 1 out of 10
