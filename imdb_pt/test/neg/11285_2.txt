As someone who loves baseball history, especially in the early 20th century, in which Cobb was a leading figure, along with a ton of colorful characters, I was eager to see this baseball movie. Well, it was not a baseball movie, which was disappointing. No, it was only the account of a sports journalist to be with Cobb in the later years of the baseball player, while the two collaborated on a book. Even so, this could have been a more compelling film than they did. <br /> <br /> Granted Cobb was anything but a cool guy, an extremely talented but brutal player in which he would do anything to beat him. ... and he was slimy, intimidating and had many demons to fight. He was so hated that his own teammates tried to prevent his chances of winning a batting title in a year. However, this is an exaggerated portrayal of man. That makes it almost like a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Watching and listening to a reclaimed, delirious and profane old man for two hours is entertainment? No, it is not. Someday, I'd love to see a real Cobb biopic showing him in his ballplaying days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, so be it, just the way they did here with a bitter, blasphemous old man. who does a butt in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.
