A long time ago, in the early 1980s, a nightly TV program "Fridays" hit the ABC network, trying to steal the spotlight on NBC's "Saturday Night Live." He did not, but introduced some disgusting sketches and semi-talented "comedians" to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> Which, in an indirect way, leads us to "Jekyll and Hyde ... Together Again". Which is disgusting in its own ways. Blankenfield is as subtle as a bench filled with whoopee pads that leave after Communion. And as good as it is. This is just his drugged drug character that he played on the ill-fated "Fridays", with extended duration. And if you did not like it, why are you reading this review? <br /> <br /> Every time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, that's a bad sign. So when it comes to grumpy jokes that get you thrown out of every stage of improvisation in the Western Hemisphere and replace the gross-out jokes, things can only get worse. <br /> <br /> A comic commentary on Robert Louis Stevenson's story? It's as good an idea as doing a sitcom of Poe's "Fall of the House of Usher." <br /> <br /> In addition to some (JULY) jokes that give a slight smile, this whole movie is an exercise in waste - wasted actors, wasted movies, wasted opportunities. <br /> <br /> No wonder they have shown the original author Stevenson revolving in his grave. What more observant a review could you give yourself? <br /> <br /> No star. No, not even to Armstrong, who should have known better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" of this one.
