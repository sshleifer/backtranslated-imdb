It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a guy who works hard doing what he loves, there's an honesty about him that often seems lacking from other microbudget directors. Check out the crew's minuscule credits at Camp Blood, there's nothing usual thanking everyone for the pizzeria they ate at, their Brad and their friends, and that's no pretentious junk. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not her common horror movie heroine, but does well enough for you to hardly notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts. The clown is hardly a bad guy from the original horror film, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life and the image collides very well with the rural setting. Camp Blood is horror like a blue collar and basic, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just one thing.
