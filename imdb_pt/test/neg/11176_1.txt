I admit, I was taken by the provocative photos of Charlotte Lewis from this film, as well as a comment in the IMDb message forum dedicated to her, calling this photo a "great understated movie." And so I got, with great difficulty, my own copy of the "Dial Help". <br /> <br /> What a waste. <br /> <br /> Nothing but a cheap film made with blood and blood. ridiculous premise that I will not repeat, with several telegraphic sequences (for example, when we see Lewis lovingly feeding his fish, we know immediately what will happen to them later). Not even Lewis, with his beautiful black hair, big, luminous brown eyes, full and full lips, and a dazzling figure, can save this movie. Lewis fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials," "Sketch Artist," or even "Golden Child."
