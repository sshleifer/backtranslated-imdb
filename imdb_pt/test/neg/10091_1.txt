Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-Man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I do not think there could be any excuse for this movie to be as bad as it was. The cast was there to do this, but it seemed that once they met a decent cast, they had to try to fit them into the movie. The only problem was that they did not fit. I did not like any of the characters and the story was incomplete at best. I came out asking why I spent my money on this movie.
