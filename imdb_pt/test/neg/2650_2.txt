To cite a review of the film, "it started slow and stopped." The plot was pretty convincing (although some of the characters' actions seemed very, very RANDOM), the script was reasonably well written (in which the dialogue did not seem forced) but everything went very slowly. There were lots of breaks between the lines and the way the lines were delivered was not that good. This movie had potential, but exploded as a teenager turning to drugs. My advice? Wait for it to arrive on the TV before you see it.
