Now, do not get me wrong, I love a good movie and after watching The Thin Red Line (and loving it) I was eager to find Terrence Malicks in two previous films, and, having just watched Days of Heaven, my enthusiasm to see Badlands practically disappeared. <br /> <br /> I've noticed a lot about beautiful photography, but I saw this movie on a very old VHS tape that made it look awful. All I can say is that I hope the photography was superb because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film. Not since the Replacement Killers have fallen asleep during a movie. This film seemed so long (and it was not!), The editing was unstable and disjointed, the plot non-existent, the narration was an incoherent incoherence, the characters poorly developed, and the whole thing was not engaging. I know Malick did not know how to make the movie. He consequently recorded a lot of footage and spent about two years editing in an attempt to put it all together. This is very apparent on the screen. Everything seems cut off, each time a scene seems to gain some momentum (or some character development), it cuts out in an invasive way boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to put together a story of filming people farming. The few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end, but these things are not close enough to keep interest. I would normally let a bad movie go by without being too vocal, but when it's so overrated, something must be said. <br /> <br /> Maybe a farmer would like ...?
