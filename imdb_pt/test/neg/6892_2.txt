I have to admit, that of the many thriller movies I've seen, this has to be one of the worst. I was shocked to find that this work had a budget of 1,500. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was very good, fairly standardized for this kind of movie, but very good anyway. But as the movie progressed I began to feel distinctly uncomfortable with the lack of pace I was seeing, each sequence seemed to take hours. The reason for that might have been that by this time the movie had already bored me to tears, nothing was happening but endless accusations stuffed with confusing flashbacks and occasionally a fit of bad mood. Well ... after we went through what seemed to be a life of these scenes, we finally got to the grand finale ... a singing and dancing demonstration of how lack of imagination can completely ruin what could have been a good movie. Overall I found this movie predictable and tedious and I would not recommend this movie to anyone other than those people I personally do not like but if you have a couple of hours to lose and you want to watch a thriller that is not even remotely scary, this is the movie for you.
