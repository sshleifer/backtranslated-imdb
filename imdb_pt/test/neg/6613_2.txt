This movie probably seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "Let's make a movie about one of the greatest and most controversial athletic trainers of the modern era! And we're going to cast Brian Dennehey as Coach Bobby Knight!" That's where this movie was terribly wrong. Why cast an actor who bears no resemblance to the man he is portraying? And so why let this actor turn his character into non-Coach Knight, but Brian Dennehey in a red sweater? While watching this movie on ESPN, I did not find myself believing that this man was actually Knight Trainer. He did not look like him, he talked like him, he acted like him or even walked like him. I could not get over this and so I could not enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as thugs Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, we did not care if they were accurate historical models of their true characters because most of us had never heard of these men until we saw the movie. But with someone as visible in today's media as Coach Knight, you have to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was cast as Nixon, it was the same situation. But, Anthony Hopkins made us believe that he was indeed Nixon. Dennehey did not even try. What could have been a great movie was soured by it. In addition to the fact that this movie tried to make the four-letter word what "Private Ryan's Rescue" did by dismemberment, that stinks. Too little of the true Coach Knight and too much talk because of the value of shock have turned this movie into a "season to hang up in the middle of the broadcast." The only good thing about it is that it was a television movie. I did not have to waste my hard earned money on this piece of junk.
