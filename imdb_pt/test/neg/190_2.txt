Let's not fool ourselves, okay? We all know that this movie was made because of the success of the movies "Grumpy Old Men". However, this farce has no humor or heart. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven is the only bright light to be seen. I broke my heart that she finally had the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of viewers, only to end up in a piece of drug like this. There was a touching scene that counted on her being taken by someone she was falling in love with. His good performance was the only quality performing in "Out To Sea". Everyone is just going through the motions. 2/10
