Movies like this give independent films a bad name! This is simply a tedious compilation of vingettes, with no structure whatsoever. I would not be surprised if the writer was completely stoned. If you want to see a good comedy, see "Half Baked". It's not awarded, but at least it made me laugh. The film was obviously done in a micro-budget. Each scene either happens in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location. If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would have ignored the budget of the film (as in the case of the Edward Burns films), but obviously this is not the case this time around. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro from "The Bronx Tale" when I say, "There is nothing worse than the waste of talent in the world." Everyone in the cast is talented. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented artists! And they were all in much better movies. The actors give their all, but they can not go too far with such a stupid script. The only scene I found interesting was Jack Black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And of course there was the brief scene from the strip club at the beginning, which I also found attractive. <br /> <br /> The characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists. Many movies are horrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was the intention of "Bongwater"? The world will never know. My score: 2 (out of 10)
