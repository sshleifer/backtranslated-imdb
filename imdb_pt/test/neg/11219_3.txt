Although the film was just so, the closed caption was by far the best I've ever seen! Most of the time, the spelling is terrible and the caption is out of sync. I use closed captioning, although I can hear it well, but I think a lot of actors grumble. Too often the soundtrack replaces the dialogue. Thank you!
