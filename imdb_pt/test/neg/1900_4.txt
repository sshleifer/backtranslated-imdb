This was one of Christie's later stories. Throughout her long career, she was interested in the fickle narrative and the notion of conflicting agents. Both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions about who controls or creates the situation. <br /> <br /> In detective fiction, gambling is a matter of conflicting realities. The killer wants to change the reality to deceive the detective, the writer intends to do the same for the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see. That's why her stories often include a writer. <br /> <br /> In her works, she explores all the combinations of tricks she may think that deal with it. Along the way, we often have bodies that are not who they look like, and the times and intended victims and such. But the real magic of books is this notion of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here, he's a dead man. Well, sometimes it happens, but not like this. It's as if the writer was the famous mr. Rafiel. This is particularly sweet for Marple's readers who remember this same character from the "Mystery of the Caribbean", which in a way was also framed by his nephew. In this story, Rafiel was the transporter of the story to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series have a quasi-crazy commitment to using a different creative team in each of them. Sometimes it produces a bland job. The Bertram episode was brilliantly staged. This is the most luxurious of the lot and has an active camera. But unlike Bertram's work, it has nothing to do with history. The camera moves and captures just because it can. The quote from 'Citizen Kane' at the beginning was a bit literal and straightforward. This story is good, but the adapter took some very critical things, and that irrelevant camera annoys. <br /> <br /> Ted's rating - 2 out of 3: It has some interesting elements.
