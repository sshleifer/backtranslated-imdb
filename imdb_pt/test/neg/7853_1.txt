I can not see how someone who actually read the mysteries of M. Didius Falco could mock them. An Australian has no business in Ancient Rome. Nothing in the books is in this movie except the setting and the characters, and they are wasted in a plot thin enough to read the silly script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of courage showing their names on the credits.
