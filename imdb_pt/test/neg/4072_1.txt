This movie is so bad it's worth seeing. This movie will get viewers in and out of the scene in the first 10 minutes. It all started when a group of writers got the idea of ​​a plane being hijacked and a passenger who could fly on a small plane to land the beast. However, they know it has already been done many times, so to do differently, we will do very badly! Major Masters has his name pirated from the movie "Living and Dying in Los Angeles" of the 80's. Character played by Willem Dafoe. This saved 10 minutes in writing and production time. The plane is supposed to be a Boieng 747. This plane has a unique silhouette, even in the dark, with its characteristic front bulge at the top. Just ask the late Ronald Reagan who lamented that point when the Ruskies overthrew the KAL 007 in the 1980s. However, when the plane takes off, it clearly is not a 747 it looks more like a 767. This well researched movie also forgets to include the seat of the engineer in the cockpit and replace it with two comfortable rumble seats. No need for a flight engineer in this complex airplane! The heroine is played perpetually pouting Gloria Lynn Berg. After tying the kidnapper, despite several bus-loads of people in this jumbo jet, no one bothers to see this guy who almost killed them all. He's just forced to have fun. <br /> <br /> The crippled airplane, leaking fuel from all abduction pranks, will not return to Hawaii, so the Masters will try to land at an Air Force base on an island. Only the lane is 300 feet too short! Four Army guys with little Bobcats (the kind you rent to carry all day carrying a load of horse manure to the back of your barn) will clear an area of ​​60 meters in length and 300 feet through the jungle in 20 minutes! No need for a tractor here! Where can you find guys like that? These guys could make a highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in 3 hours equipped only with tablespoons, a compass and a duck! <br /> <br /> After the infernal obstacle is solved, Masters will attempt to land the plane as a heroine pout. Hijacker laughs to himself and without supervision is free to cause more problems. He is finally subjugated in the most retarded way I can not tell him. But, you can say Moby Dick? <br /> <br /> There are so many delayed scenes in this movie. The wounded captain is parked in the plane's bar, while Masters, who is supposedly barely able to fly, puts the plane in 60-degree seats and drops at 20,000 feet per minute. The pilot must be French kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts, but does not move even an inch. <br /> <br /> I think if they had chosen different actors to interpret the parts, this move could have been much better. If we need a heroine pouting in the film, why not choose the best known actress Bernadette Peters, who seems to be perpetually pouting too? In addition, she can sing and the busty, well-aged Peters could present some free cleavage scenes. Now, with the corner angle, this can be a Hijacking, let's land on the movie MUSICAL plane! Cast Luciano Pavarotti as the pilot. They can sing a duet in the cockpit before the abduction and there's no way the dark tenor can fly up to the ceiling while Masters work their magic on that great bird. According to the musical theme, Masters could then be played by Andrei Bocelli, with whom Peters Can can sing while landing on the plane. Not only is he totally blind, but he only knows a few words in English. Now this is a plot! Think about the limit of your conversation between Masters (Bocelli) and the Air Traffic Controller: ATC: "Sir, please accelerate back to 180, with flaps adjusted to 25 degrees. Hold 230 positions "<br /> <br /> Bocelli:" What? " <br /> <br /> ATC: "Sir, arm spoilers now, confirm the brake pressure at 250 psi. Keep the descent at 500 fpm." <br /> <br /> Bocelli: "What?" <br /> <br /> The kidnapper could have been played by the late Rodney Dangerfield, who can vomit a multitude of his linings while he is tied up and unprotected: "I have no respect.My wife is of group sex. screwed me in front of the judge and the jury! "Get the idea? <br /> <br /> LOST OPPORTUNITIES The movie has its standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed. Woody Allen could have been in the back, offering one of her neurotic monologues: "She said I was great in bed. I told her that I practice a lot ..." Now this is a movie! <br /> <br /> In addition, according to a similar film, "Executive Decision," in which Steven Segal, with lazy eyes, is mercifully dead at first, the 747 has a gigantic attic at the top. The plane was introduced in 1969, so who knows what accumulated in almost 40 years up there? My uncle has old clothes, a sleigh, magazines, and all sorts of things. Would not it have been nice if Masters had opened the trapdoor and seen the watery-eyed Chevy Chase in a woman's dressing gown watching the Super 8 movies of her childhood? Only one recommendation. So take a chance, and as you walk in and out of consciousness, imagine how great this movie could be if I had my hand on it ...
