This is not a good movie. Clear and simple. Take the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot, average acting (at best), slow direction and monotonous dialogue. Add the grot and you have mediocre plot, medium acting, slow direction, dull dialogue, with hardcore porn whipping. The problem is that porn is also nothing special. So it's not a good movie, nor is it a good porn movie. It fails on both accounts. They can say that the women made this movie and were intending to do it with it, and with that, etc. But talking is cheap, the end result is what counts, and what we have here is a mediocre movie with a bit of sex to shock value to try to convince you to waste your time watching. One of those movies where you'd rather have the time you watched back.
