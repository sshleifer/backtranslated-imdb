As a serious horror fan, I understand that certain marketing tricks are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. So I would not say it's naïve that I assumed this was a softcore terror that was wiping out the Canibal / Zombie / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong as this is very hardcore. I should have realized that when I saw the odd "No real or identifiable minor was used" notice. Notice the identifiable part as if it were challenging us to pick it up? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a tendency to have fun on the beach in search of a mutant native killer of villagers. Due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island, the radiation turned the latter man into a rapist / murderer. <br /> <br /> Writer / actor George Eastman is the one to try here and manages to keep his clothes. The sex scenes are destroyed. The women walk naked exuding an excess of confidence and even ask for a rape when the husband rejects it. Well, two girls hitting each other naturally turn into an lesbo scene because women are horndogs. I saw the girl toss another salad of girls and finger. <br /> <br /> If there is something you should know about this movie, that's it. Because the rest of this insane movie is the same. Oh, who am I kidding? There's another ton to tell here. Like the white "Duchess" who pays for 2 blacks to score her team in a hall. Or the "Duchess" taking off the top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts. When he refuses his advances, she begins to cry. So being the good gentleman he is, he reluctantly lets her give him pleasure in front of the other crew members. I was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the "Duchess" asked if there was any other way to pay it. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they leave for the island to conduct their activities. search. Wait, I thought this was a zombie movie? But the zombie does not enter the 73min mark, but by now everyone has already "gotten in" enough. I found myself advancing some or several scenes. This is my first porn movie splatter and I do not think it does any subgenre any justice. I think it's the woman in me talking when I say I'd like more plot and less sweaty, lanky and hairy sex. The funny thing is that this could have worked as a decent horror film, since the idea of ​​atomic bombing, which transformed a bitter man and killed his family, was good. Even Eastman's character shakes his head and walks away from a couple copulating. It makes me wonder if it was the character or the writer himself who got angry. <br /> <br /> I do not feel like getting into the sound quality or the movie because you should have guessed it was bad. This production was recorded back to back with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Dead Living, which boasts more of the same cast. Eastman said this was done because everyone wanted vacations and a salary. Nevermind, I feel like talking about the sound all of a sudden. The sound was strange during the sex scenes, because while the cast is speaking Italian, it seems they recorded dubbing in English and played the dialogue. So while two people are boned, I can clearly hear someone in the background say, "No, yes! There was a slightly amusing Italian score that failed to save this movie. The SFX was minimal at best and consisted of some blood in only a few scenes. And I'd like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes like the shiny warning label said on the cover of the DVD (ahem, another marketing move), so there's no fear there. Just be afraid of the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in Widescreen aspect ratio 1.85: 1. I watched Region 1 Not Rated version running at 113min released in 2005 by Digital Exploitation. Apparently there is a XXX version of Alfa Digital, which is the same runtime, so I doubt anything is different. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25 for a copy. Or, as I would recommend, pay nothing and pretend it does not exist. Favorite phrase: Shipmate, "Civilians are unlucky, women are unlucky, they are also scientists, they must be really monsters." DVD Extras: Original trailer with hardcore shots and killings to make it look more interesting than it is, Trailers to SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle and ENOTLD, and a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Lick porn, but still weaker as a horror movie. Or get real porn or watch real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
