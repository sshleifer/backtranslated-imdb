Light spoilers below. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when the TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of the European refugees to the final prediction that Nazism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much entertainment value here, although filming the bowl of dust is interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember. The rest of the plot is quite forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - in a very bad accent - and the daughter assimilating in America with the help of Wayne. In addition to the dusty scenes, the only memorable aspect of the film is one of the best seen in retrospect. Coburn's speech comparing Nazism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as a momentary burst of energy from a patient before death were strangely accurate, and Dr. Scherer de Varno accurately reproduced the images post-war news reports from unrepentant Nazis When viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at entertainment outside the perspective of World War II, you would have to say that this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
