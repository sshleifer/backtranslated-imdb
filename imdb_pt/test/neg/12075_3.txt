Wow, this episode started on a premise STOOOOOPID! The Enterprise is advancing when, suddenly, Abraham Lincoln is floating in space and receives the Enterprise !!!!!!! Is it just me, or is this a stupid idea?! Lincoln comes on board and they welcome them. Abe suggests that they descend to a barren planet where they meet other famous dead people - good and bad. It seems that an extravagant-looking rock monster brought together a team of GOOD and EVIL people to battle for supremacy. The whole thing seems really silly and intrinsically unfair, since the GOOD side is sealed with Surak - a Vulcan that makes Gandhi look like Rambo !! Despite a totally AWFUL premise, the action is very good and it's great to see shots on the ceiling of obvious doubles fighting in this game of bitterness. But do not confuse this with high art or deep science fiction. The bottom line is that the series was in its last stages as a first run series and it really looked like it dusted off this turkey and filmed regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
