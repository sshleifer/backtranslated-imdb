Compared with the later ARAB AVENUE of director Kevin Connor, this is a masterpiece. However, this is not saying much. In fact, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is a silly fantasy adventure in which Peter Cushing - who appears to be in a strong suit - and another actor (whom I do not know) use a giant digging machine called "Iron Mole". to the core of the Earth - only to discover that the Earth's interior is pink and populated by ape-like creatures that enslave humans. There is also a giant bird that controls the monkeys through telepathy, and we get to see him blink in close-up throughout the movie. More importantly, Cushing and her name also find the lovely Caroline Munro in the underground caverns. And here's what I really have against this little movie: why, oh, why is it that whenever Munro is in a movie, she only has approx. 5 minutes of screen time? In the spy who loved me, Maniac, Dracula, in 1972, GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD - she's always in the background! How could Kevin Connor think we'd rather hear Peter Cushing's false accent and look at some ridiculous ape-man whose voice sounds like a scratched disk than look at the handsome Munro? I dont understand. Please, someone directs a movie where this English brunette is on the screen all the time!
