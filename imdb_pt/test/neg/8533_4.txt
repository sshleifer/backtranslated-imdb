This movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses in the last semester. Few movies can really give me goosebumps. This did. Few horror movies give me a sense of fear. This did. That kept me guessing. I cared about the story. I cared about the characters. The performance was decent. Unfortunately, in the middle of the movie, the story simply does not have many good directions. It becomes evident that whatever is legal about the plot will self-destruct. That happens. What he constructs in the first half as a concept of great horror departs from the horror and the absurd. A plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions of the characters. The story ends with disappointment. While this movie looks complete, there is a loose end that could set it up for a sequel. The movie is not good enough for a sequel. This movie is worth seeing in the theater, just do not expect to be stunned. This is more suitable as a movie to rent. It's probably not a movie you'd like to own.
