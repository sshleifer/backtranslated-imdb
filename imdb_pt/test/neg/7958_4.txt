Deepa tried once more to boldly bring up a subject that no one wants to talk about. The story is good, the cinematography is excellent, the script and acting are well below average. I think it's the fault of the citizens of Uttar Pradesh, India, from where their original set was destroyed in 2000. This resulted in an entirely different cast, I just wanted to know what spectacular movie would have been had it had the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. Current actors Lisa Ray (good to squirm in Bombay Dyeing sheets) and John Abraham are pathetic, need basic acting lessons. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda saved the film as much as they could. The boy had done a great job. Also, editing and streaming the movie is not something you would expect from Deepa. Great subject, sends a strong message about a practice that is still quite rampant in rural India, but falls short of the standards set by Deepa in Fire and Earth. Watch it once ... when it's on DVD, do not bother paying $ 10 to see it .... well your hit the average Hindi movie any day
