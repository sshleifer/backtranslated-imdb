With a humor that would attract a small and exclusive audience, the average viewer will find it useless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network announced this show, it was made to look like a big drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the Ram. <br /> <br /> When it came out in the air, I was disappointed by how all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally bland animation. The only thing that put him close to humor were the names of the characters as Public Private and General Specific, some vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington struck Carneiro with his steel wig. <BR> Slightly off topic, but I do not see why Sheep falls for that ball of dirty cotton balls called "Swanky." It was horrible!
