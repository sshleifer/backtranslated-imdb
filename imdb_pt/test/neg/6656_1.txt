I did not see Ishtar, but I had the misfortune to see Kevin Costner's Postman. This is worse. Maybe the absolute worst piece of crap I've ever seen, and what if you look at my review for the Moulin Rouge? that's saying something. The bad plot, the acting was below standard and even wasted (although, yes, Michael Keaton has taken part in some of the worst movies I've ever seen), and this movie has no redemptive value for anyone with more than half a brain. DO NOT SEE IF YOU HAVE GRADED THE 4TH GRADE, as you will find this an insult to your intelligence.
