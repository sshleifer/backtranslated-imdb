Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to see her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is the captain of a boat and she stays to travel with him. During this time, she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris do not see eye to eye and Anna has a secret to confess ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story ... ... starts badly with George F Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunks in a bar. The scene goes on forever and both are terrible. It is also difficult to understand them. In fact, it's hard to understand the whole cast. I have missed entire sections of dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Garbo is obviously something special as you are drawn to her every time she is on the screen and your presence gives this movie the 4 stars that I gave it to. But nothing really happens - it's a boring story with atrocious accents. You'll do well to stay awake.
