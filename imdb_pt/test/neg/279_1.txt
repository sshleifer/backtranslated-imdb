I had read the newspaper reviews of this movie and I must say that my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really liked the first movie, but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate the top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all, there is such a fine story that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be attributed to the term "story" are loosely held together sometimes, but most of the time the movie only moves without purpose or drive. The whole story seems forced and the script around the story is even more forced to become farce sometimes. <br /> <br /> The actors appear, but do nothing to deserve any credit or evaluation. The most embarrassing thing is to lead women (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who exaggerate or are extremely simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are not brilliant either. To be honest, I really do not understand how they would like to be associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contain spoilers ==== Camera and editing, I sigh where I should start. There are many unnecessary camera moves that just make the experience painful. Combine this with an extremely outdated edition and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart. Especially the scene where the whole gang is taken out of prison to be transported by car. The zoom of the camera for each person only gets annoying and when you are at number 3 of 12 you have the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NO. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts must be funny, but it gets extremely embarrassing and you turn around to avoid the mess. Bruce Willis. Because? Please explain to me! BECAUSE ??? <br /> <br /> In short ... if you have to choose between working the root canal and watching Ocean's 12, I recommend the first one. Make sure they make all the teeth while you're at it ...
