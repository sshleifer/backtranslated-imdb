This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. Scruffy, technically good and the usual internal jokes for adults. Maybe it's because this is the first cartoon I've seen after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is planned and forgettable, but involves Asterix and Obelix going into Viking territory. rescue a spoiled teenager who learns humility and also finds love. Oh, and initially they do not get along, but after facing adversity, everyone shares a deep bond of friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> It's best to take care of the little jokes. The Vikings get all the best. Such as Vikea (wife of the boss of the Viking) giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next attack. Or the Vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf, the dumbest Viking, is really hilarious (both for voice and for dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, aboard the Viking ship: (After a speech by Abba, the captain's daughter) Olaf: Who is this new guy? Captain: That's my daughter, cod brain! Olaf: Your ... daughter is ... a man?
