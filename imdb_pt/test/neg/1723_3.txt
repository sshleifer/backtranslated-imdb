Not only that, the coverage on VHS and DVD (at least in Europe) shows a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the film, the acting is so bad, that the film is claiming to be ridiculed. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to have some laughs about a movie, which should be serious, watch Tycus and Peter Onorati, a man who will teach you how to defeat the bad guys with cardboard boxes empty It's a shame for Dennis Hopper, following the example of Travoltas, starring in his own "battlefield land." For those who want to watch a good movie about Earth being destroyed by a terrible force, please do not choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and watch "Armageddon" for your 20th time!
