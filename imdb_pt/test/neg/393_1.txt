I have one word: focus. <br /> <br /> well. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. OK. Let's discuss the points of focus. I do not know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us lots of useless crap like "you all will be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday" - but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was fantastic! you give it a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. The person who filmed what Alice discovered needs to learn some things about the finer points of focus. lighting too. This film is not only completely out of focus, it is also lit up like the corner of someone else's basement. <br /> <br /> Do not even make me start walking or tracing. they could have trimmed about ten seconds from the beginning and end of each shot. <br /> <br /> But who cares? There is not enough sensationalism in this movie to compensate for the total lack of consideration for the film's best friends - FOCUS and ILLUMINATION. <br /> <br /> Words to the wise.
