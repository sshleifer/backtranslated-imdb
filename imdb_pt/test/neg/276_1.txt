Man, I loved Ocean's 11. <br /> <br /> Intelligent movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the assault, as each had their own specialized skill that was needed to win the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What the hell was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I suppose it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones, but was not she really a part of 11 as she was trying to trip them up and work against them all over the movie? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones's annoying relationship with some excerpts from the original film, played only for a few homeless on the seats watching the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the gang was always one step ahead of Bento (Garcia). They have always been able to be smarter than him. What happened here? Does he catch up with them after a whistleblower and all of a sudden are they all pissed off? The whole movie is so they can raise the money they stole more interest to return Benedict for the assault they did on him three years earlier. So in the next movie, will they develop courage and intelligence again and get you back to get them to pay you back for the first round? Puh-lease ... <br /> <br /> This movie could have been performed with just Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Film in slow motion, not the energy of the first. I've tried a lot and I'm usually very easy to please, but I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The turnaround - the whole movie did not have to be done because the real steal was done before everything you just saw in the last two hours. <br /> <br /> Wait until you get on the TV or if you're a fan of the original 2001, please do not watch this.
