This is not a movie. This is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, dubbed with some random text. Filming is not so good and the text is not great either. The end product is terribly annoying. <br /> <br /> In DVD, turning the commentary can provide some entertainment value, since the director makes an argument that this is a science fiction movie. It is also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and difficulties that the team faced to collect these images. Too bad it is rubbish. But I think "The Making of Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating movie, like "Ed Wood".
