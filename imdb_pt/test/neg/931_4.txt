Zu Warriors (2001) by Tsui Hark, which is visually innovative, but lacking much in the acting and writing departments, now this film, which is visually almost as good as Zu (although not more innovative), but it is still worse in the acting and writing departments. It really is sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing in the HK film industry. I think you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues in the movie really are. It's like some delinquent kids talking on the street, it's so bad. To make matters worse, the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent children, and can not act even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HK, but the young people of HK really become so bankrupt that they can not appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acts? If that's the case, I'm ashamed to be from HK. <br /> <br /> I would like HK filmmakers to learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a film that is visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments . And stop using young singers / idols / heartthrobs as actors because they can not act as many fans might have in HK!
