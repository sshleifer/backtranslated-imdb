This movie as the first KSA movie should be active for its people and show the good thing in them. Otherwise, we see in this as the cast of Rotana wants to show the people of religion in Saudi Arabia as terrorist and stupid, in fact it is not that they are very peaceful and clever. About the director is not even less good. The grandfather in the movies is much younger than his father, everyone notes that. And the girls who are not Saudi by the way, show our girls like shots that seek the man to satisfy their needs. Hasham was just another piece of furniture he did nothing to imagine when he told his lover that I love you and yelled at his friend, do not talk to strange girls >>>>>>> really funny or really stupid. The father was so moving not just set his and he watch this movie as not a cast and only word he said "A5zo Al Shai6an". The strange thing in this movie is when the girls were set in the restaurant by the family, there is voice behind the young man talk to his girlfriends "kiss me" many times >>>>> This happened in Saudi Arabia when the girls and boys grow well and be neither whore nor adulterer. Any Saudi has patriot in his heart will not allow this stupid movie to see
