I like to think I've seen it all. DOOMTROOPER SS. The one about a family of saber-tooth tigers. The one about a family of pteranodonts. ROOM OF GOAT. DEMON CHILD (Rubber doll of a non-ananimated child with horns glued to the head.) Several SASQUATCH films, none of them good. end of JASON 'EM, which is actually about an urban street parade taped into someone's $ 199 camcorder, and so on.I watched part of an STV the other night about people stranded on a deserted island that killed kickboxing to death with a bunch of cheesy totems.I've been through the DREAMCATCHER more recently, like last night - well, I should say I went through parts of it, having seen in all its terrible glory years ago, but nothing compares to Predator Island, about a group of young people stuck on an island during a storm, forced to fight aliens that arrive in a meteorite. The meteorite seems to have come out of a cartoon SUPERMAN of the 1940s. the aliens, by the way, the photography, acting and direction. and writing are equally bad. I hung up halfway. Good luck.
