The tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's best films after Stagecoach. It's good at points, it has some action sequences right in the cave and also in the flood at the climax. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have in Tycoon are two men who do not like each other and who do not like to work as a team. Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the funds needed to get the job done right. <br /> <br /> Things get really complicated when Wayne falls in love with Hardwicke's daughter, Laraine Day. <br /> <br /> After a night when they have to spend time alone in an Inca ruin, by convention in South America, Wayne and Day make a wedding without anything happening. <br /> <br /> What should have happened is that these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to settle their differences in one way or another. His little spirits cause some deaths among Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But what Tycoon is best known for is another petty sting. Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher, the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, when it was being filmed. He was a constant presence on the set, insanely jealous of John Wayne, who thought he could have an affair with his wife. Nothing, but he made his wife's life miserable. <br /> <br /> None of the Duke's best efforts.
