I've only seen most of the series since I left the TV as background noise in my dorm. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Mencia, but this show does not really do much for me. Occasionally he says or does something to make a laugh, but he has that aura of presumption that spoils her completely. <br /> <br /> I always thought he was funny because of his furious routine of a brave man. this is not terribly prevalent in this TV series. Instead, it is just presumptuous. I think this just reflects how funny your comedy is: obsolete and uninteresting when it's not in proper delivery mode. I've seen him get into it sometimes at his show, but for the most part, he just stands there smiling and looking presumptuous, and does not fit well with him. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion, though.
