Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his colleague Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall in the UK by their rich childhood friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha has a crush on Daniel, who is a man ambiguous about his sentimental life. While alone in the house, strange things happen and Laura is frightened and scared. When Laura meets old insane priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the road, she is advised to leave immediately from home, since the evil lived there. But the couple stay and have to face tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> What a messy script and horrible movie that tackles this "Harvest of the Devil" is! Cinematography and camera work are not all bad, but the amateur performances of Chris John and Carol Kentish and direction of James Shanks along with the terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this movie one of the worst I have ever seen in the movies . genre. I've occasionally seen on YouTube a pair of college movie shorts that are better and better than the useless and terrible "Devil's Harvest". In the end, it's not a horror movie, but a horror movie. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Harvest of the Devil"
