This is one of the most non-original films and cliches I've ever seen. Even if you did not like the background to this movie, "The Bad News Bears" and "The Mighty Ducks," they must have done a better job than this. From the moment the new teacher greets her class and tells her, "Do not worry about us, we're all losers," you can see everything that's coming 30 miles away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to the brave teacher, we have a group of children who are supposedly spoiled (they are brats, yes, but not so affectionate), a small town sheriff who loves to storm, an arrogant trainer of the winning team, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo, like the new teacher, has any kind of interest. I've never cared much about Steve Guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff does not change things. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, the rival coach, does not leave him anything to work on. Let's hope writer / director Holly Goldberg Sloan will come up with something better next time.
