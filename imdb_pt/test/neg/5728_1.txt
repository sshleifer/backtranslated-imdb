I watched this movie, or part of it, in the hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was simply nonsense. On one hand you have the worst performance ever! The lead actress Birgitte Nielsen is lousy, uninspired and hardly attractive. And she certainly does not look like the warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings, but she does. And what happens to the feminist attitude is pure hypocrisy. On the one hand, her family was killed by a woman, so she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn to fight men. She then joins a fat servant and her son king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. These two characters are simply stupid and destroy the little atmosphere that the movie has created. After that, I could not stand Nielsen's painful acting anymore, and the stupid cliches and the lack of any real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this movie that really made it remotely watchable. <br /> <br /> I liked the Conan movie, but this sucks!
