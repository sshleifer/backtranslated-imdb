The idea behind this movie was great. The story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. What makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and tacky dialogue. Actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. In addition, there is a very tedious, almost entertaining, use of metaphors in the narratives. The highlight is the girl's performance. Nice try, but this one is stinky.
