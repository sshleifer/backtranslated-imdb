Being a big fan of horror movies and always able to find something good about a photo, but this movie simply did not hold my interest or attention. This story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend since his wife died a few years ago. These people face a horrible situation in a city where they stop and visit and all the elderly people of this city join against these people and almost kill them. This movie reminded me of a movie called "Sons of Corn" because it involves children being introduced to Satan and their instruments of terror. There are plenty of corners, jumble mambo and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in your pickup truck as well as dolls that kill a husband and wife.
