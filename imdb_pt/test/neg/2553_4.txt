I must say I was disappointed with this movie. Although well represented and directed, the underlying story simply moves slowly. <br /> <br /> Granted, in another state of mind, I would have liked it more. I laughed a lot, but rarely laughed; and there was really a sense of suspense to find out who won. But in contrast to another movie that my wife got on the same day (one of us had never heard of it before) this one paled in comparison. <br /> <br /> If you see too many movies, then by all means see this - it is clearly better than the average fare. But if you (like me) have limited time and want to watch only the best and the most fun, save it for later. <br /> <br /> [Rate: 7/10]
