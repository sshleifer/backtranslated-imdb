I admit this is not a great movie. He practically shouts "low budget," but strangely I still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality, it was abundant in energy. It was like Little Engine That Could and a movie merged into one! <br /> <br /> The film takes place on a radio station and concerns some of its low-level employees - two page boys (one very aggressive and daring and the other a coward), plus a new receptionist. All three have visions of radio stardom, but must, for the time being, be content with their humble works. <br /> <br /> In this story appears a murder that seems somewhat unexpected. I did not know this was a mystery movie and was taken by surprise. However, like most mysteries B, the cops are lamebrains and it's up to our aggressive hero (Moran) to try to save the day. Throughout all this, I had difficulty deciding whether Moran was unpleasant or lovable. Still not sure !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the movie that is at the top of the "fear factor" and it is when the two pages try the roles of the radio comedians. They appear in black-face and make an imitation of 3rd or 4th rate of Amos n 'Andy. Besides being very insensitive, it was not funny either. Fortunately, the program producer they were experimenting seemed to feel the same. <br /> <br /> Overall. It's easy to skip this movie and I do not blame you if you do. However, the strange and frenetic pace of the film seemed to compensate for the artistic shortcomings of the film and I am glad to have seen it. A good movie? No. But one that's worth taking a peek at for fans of old Bs. By the way, maybe I just do not taste great, but I thought both divas really had bad voices . despite how everyone in the movie is captivated by their warblings. Listen for yourself and let me know what you think. I just could not believe that neither was allowed to sing in the film - even if it was only for the modest Monogram Studios.
