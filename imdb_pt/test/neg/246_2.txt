2/3 of this film are recycled images from previous films, a fact that is obviously obvious even to someone like me who has not seen the original films. And somehow, it seems like a robbery even though I have not seen things before. It's like that episode from every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you see only recycled images from other episodes. I have seen some producers make prolonged assemblies of recycled material, but never anything more than 5 minutes or more. This film is mostly material that had already been seen by the public, so you could set up a case that is one of the biggest scams ever imposed on movie audiences. I have to see this in the theater, in a 16mm print, which is good enough, I suppose, considering how rare this kind of material should be in the movies nowadays. I give the film some credit for the semi-convincing gothic atmosphere and unintentional humor, but that's about it. The monster of the Aztec mummy seems to be good, even has some mobility on its face, which is better than most of the monsters of the period. But the robot is unfortunate, although it is interesting that they have made the human face fully visible. It's a "human robot" or something similar to what they explain in the film. I think it's considered an android. So, technically, in terms of science fiction, this movie should be called "Android versus the Aztec mummy," but I doubt anyone is overly concerned with technical details here than with quality. In fact, the film is so improbable that it makes the television look good. Even dubbing from Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example, at one point the hero says, "I might as well start at the beginning ...". What kind of translation is this? Could not they at least have him say "start at the beginning" so it does not look repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have fixed the script for this movie. It's the epitome of utilitarian cinema, there's absolutely nothing in this movie that does not have to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the movie. They did not go the extra mile to do what they needed, and considering the extensive recycled images, I doubt they actually spent more than a week making this film. <br /> <br /> Now I will stop posting about it on the principle that I do not want to spend more energy on the commenting process than the creators of the film actually spent while doing it.
