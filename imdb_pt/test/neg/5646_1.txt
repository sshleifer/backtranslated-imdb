Have you noticed how many really bad movies attract 10/10 votes? Not much of a riddle like that happens, but this is not much of a movie. There are two ways to see this being distributed in Mail On Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can not complain about it too much. 2. It's free, so it can not be very good. <br /> <br /> My vote is number 2. The free DVD in the Sunday papers is a recent trend and some great old movies have been distributed. They are those who have been out for a long time and have made the most of the money they have already earned, so it is a case of anything else that is a bonus. It is the last stop for old movies, not the first for the new ones, so you can guess just how bad this should be to skip TV and DVD rentals. <br /> <br /> The good points are that Vinnie Jones goes the extra mile and Derek Jacobi is good as Dickens. Negatives are a longer list. Trying is not the same as succeeding for poor Vinnie and another Jacobi vagabond character is talking ham that is gone. The story is very weak. Dickens's story has nothing to do with the murders of the film and it looks like another film was cast in the screenplay to make people think it's a British Dan Brown without the religion. The supporting cast is there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave must be very difficult) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. It is also very, very long for what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie taking his invaluable Dickens story with him in the pocket of his jacket everywhere is good for a few laughs, but that's it. It's not funny and it's not very good, even for free.
