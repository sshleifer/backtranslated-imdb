If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have enjoyed this series more. Although the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts, I concentrated on comparing the episodes to the original series. There was an expectation of Steed participating more in fight scenes, and continuity seemed that the writers were struggling to accompany the actors. To be honest, I can not blame them for trying to resurrect fans of the original series, but this simply did not work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted a season. Watching the work of the lambs through this series, I remembered General Macarthur when he said, "Old soldiers never die, they just disappear!"
