This movie must have done well at the box office in order to give Gator the budget he deserves. This movie had no budget, needed a rewrite of the script and a better ending. There are flashes of brightness in this film. The scene of the boat ride, Burt driving the evil machine and his conversation with the parents. You can say that Burt is a Southerner and not an actor. This film shows how Gator would be, the best film of Burt. Also, bad, this movie did not have the same funding and was made in Rush. 4/10
