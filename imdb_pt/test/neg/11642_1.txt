If you are into bad movies for the entertainment of watching bad movies, bad acting, poor production etc. Myaka Science Theater 3000 quality .... you will love the Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players ever to play the game ... as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players of all time in the game ... I'm not sure who Rolf Bayer was ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 when he directed this, maybe he could have been the next Spielberg in training ... because if he was an adult man driving it ... a 15 or 16 years old could have done better .... The basis or plot for the film probably had some historical merit and maybe even true ... but the actual movie may be one of the worst movies ever made in the history of American cinema. I hoped that Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson would appear to somehow save any "face" that remained of that film. I would have loved to have been on the red carpet, black-tie gala for the Hollywood opening when this anticipated movie ... as this movie had to have many spectators laughing and shrinking under their breath ... it's in the DVD dime racks now .... look for entertainment value ... this movie is so bad that it's too good to miss ...
