And the title says it all: a tacky title that is a tacky joke from a movie known as "Alien from L.A." Why not call it "Alien from South Africa" ​​because this is where this movie was filmed? My advice to watch movies that were featured in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" does not watch the original movie version! Period! Always watch the movie with the shadow of the theater at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two fun and wise robot friends who are in the lower right corner of the screen. It looks better this way. <br /> <br /> Movie as it was originally seen: horrible! Movie as seen on MST3K: Genius!
