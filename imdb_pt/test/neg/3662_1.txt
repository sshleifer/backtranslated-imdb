This movie seemed to have been filmed with a video phone, had very little plot and unnecessary nudity. The film never really joined or made so much sense and for a film like this, of course, there have been some unnecessary shots. The director was obviously trying to make the film subjective and different, but he never gave enough information about what was really going on, even in the end I was left with a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion of the lack of plot and anger because I wanted my two dollars of blockbuster and a 1.5 hour of my life back. They must have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
