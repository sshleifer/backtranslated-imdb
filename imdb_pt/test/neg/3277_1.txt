Although I agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made, I'm proud to say that I own a copy simply because I and a lot of my friends were extras (especially in dance club scenes, but a few others too). had potential with Bolo and the Enter the Dragon director signed, but as someone who was on the set most every day I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused guy, at least during the making of this movie. I wondered if this could have been a better movie if it had not been destroyed in a fire at the Morning Calm studios. I can not say that it would be I'm sure, but it would be nice to think so, I was really surprised at the fact that it was ever released, and that someone like Bolo would attach his name to it without fighting. Oh well. See also the extras for the professional fighter. Scott Levy, AKA Raven He was a wrestler in Portland at the time ... cool guy, very clever.
