This should be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The year 1983, in the middle of the rural city (or senior? - they seemed to get sick at first) with strange hair and good-looking "Lion" has a big plate full of trouble. Her stepfather announces definite plans to carry out a sex-change operation, in which her mother calls the marriage to quit; Sebastian is called an "f" by everyone and his mother, all the time "kissing" with several girls, gorging on a grocery store, and saving a strawberry hooker from the clutches of her relentless prostitute. pimp. <br /> <br /> Sebastian's "friends" make Eddie Haskal look like a chorus boy; bad association does not get much worse. Sebastian seems to want Harold's record of suicide attempts (though he does not admit suicidal tendencies). For no apparent reason, Sebastian's SAT genius level should graduate a year earlier, though he has no clue about the future, nor does he want to attend college (what does that absurd?). <br /> <br /> Film is a look at some weeks in the life of someone who is PREFTY MESSED UP. The final scene suggests that things will work out, even though HOW is left entirely to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film seem to bet only on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male leader. The "history" leaves much to be desired. Looking for "what will that gorgeous boy do next ...?" not exactly satisfying. Dull production values ​​simply do not match other, independent films or not. A low budget and a weak history need more than a handsome face to accomplish it. The "results" of this project are unforgettable and an insult to fans of intelligent cinema.
