It was so annoying! No plot whatsoever! Basically, a diluted version of the Lion King mixed with Animal Farm. Again, no plot at all. Horrible! Worst hour and a half of my life! Oh my gosh! I had to leave the theater for a few minutes just to get some relief! I might laugh twice. All the semi-funny parts are in the previews. I hate movies like that. Yeah, the movie is really bad. I do not know how this has good ratings and reviews. THERE IS NO LOT OR HISTORY! If you go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend / boyfriend to keep you busy on the outside. Horrible. I think I've never been to a movie and I did not like it that much. It was a good thing that tickets cost only five bucks because I'd go crazy if I paid $ 7.50 to see that crap.
