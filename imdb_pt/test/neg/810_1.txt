If I could give this film a negative rating, I would. Humor is the cruelest thing I've ever seen in a movie. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have suffered horribly without guilt of their own. There are 2 parcels, none of which supports half a movie. Where is the "depth" that others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film starts well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and convincing, which makes cruel humor even more horrifying. If you think the 3 Stooges are too good for each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnapping victim with a Bowie knife is a real blow to the thigh, if you think the "Schindler List" is hilarious, this movie and to you.
