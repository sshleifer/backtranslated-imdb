From acting, direction, screenplay and art direction, this film is entirely ill-conceived and money would have been better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When we get so sad that they have to fill a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the attention of parents. <br /> <br /> Dr. Suess is rolling in his grave right now, with the "dirty shit." "And scenes of fake erection, etc. etc. etc. It is shameful as they change the name of Suess to take the parents to bring their children, play the profanities to try the teenagers and some sad parents who do not watch a movie with their child, if there is no T & A. Greed Greed and more greed <br /> <br /> Compare this with the classic children's movies and we can get a disturbing view of the world is turning out.These guys should be making MTV videos. film got over 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless it's the family of directors)
