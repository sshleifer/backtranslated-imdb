When a movie called Hell Ride comes out, you expect a certain amount of motorcycle clich√©. With character names like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "The Gent" I prepared for the worst and I was punched in the face for just that. Dialogue, soundtrack and film-style are standard for motorcycle movies. The dusty desert blurred from the heat like bikes coming down the road while "CC Rider" plays and they talk about sex and violence. To yawn! The three clues were simply ridiculous and unbelievable. Seeing old men like Bishop and Madsen (in a ruffled shirt) walking on a dusty stretch of deserted road reminded me of two men desperately trying to revive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best, but with such poor material he got lost. Even an appearance of Dennis Hopper in the full swing of Easy Rider, could not save him. And let's talk about the store bought so let's go? Many have compared this to Tarantino's work. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is that he knows it is exaggerated, so he simply goes out and takes as much as possible to the top. Bishop took this movie so seriously that it became nothing more than a poor copy of the exploit genre.
