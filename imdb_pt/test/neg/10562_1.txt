I have been an avid fan of Jane Austen for many years. I had never seen this adaptation, so when I had heard it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. Based on this, I eagerly asked for Netflix. What a cruel deception! They took one of the more subtle and brilliant comic novels and made it monotonous. Each character seems to have received a single facial expression, a single tone on which to base their flat characters. Although this adaptation seems to have used all the words Jane Austen wrote, they seem to have been passed on to the characters in a random way. Even if it was made as a miniseries, this adaptation can confuse and seem as rushed as if it had been made as a movie of the week. Mr. Bennett was very hard, Mrs. Bennet was just a chatty squirrel, Mr. Darcy lifeless as a nutcracker, Bennett's girls almost indistinguishable, and mr. Wickham a man no one would look twice - hardly the caprice attractive! I'm good out!
