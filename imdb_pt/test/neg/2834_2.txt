I love Brian Yuzna's other work, even more crude things like 'Necronomicon', but 'Progeny' was too much for me. My main complaint is that it is unnecessarily exploitative of Jillian McWhirter's nudity, I am not a prude, but these nudity scenes just creep and continue ... and only culminate (virtually every time) in a blinking * wink * sexual violence. The scene in which she tries a hanger abortion after several minutes of naked screaming is a prime example. The "performance" of Arnold Vosloo is totally turgid, but even Jeffrey Coombs failed to save that pile of movies. Aliens are boring, uniformly opaque lighting absorbs their interest and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were a very brief glimpse of the true form of the aliens (very cool model) and the scene where Vosloo meets his wife in the closet was also OK. But you were warned.
