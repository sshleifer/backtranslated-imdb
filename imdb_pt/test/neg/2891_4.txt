In addition, titled BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for its various releases, this Australian film, filmed in New South Wales, has been problematic for its producers since its inception due to various personality conflicts and filming time that prematurely uses its allocated budget and , although the plot is sometimes well detailed, below the standard post-production finishing and excessive cutting of the subject. Tom Skerritt plays Howard Anderson, an American businessman with a "passion for construction" who is in the process of erecting a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region, at the same time unaware that his business partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman), has assured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, much more than its real value, and plans its destruction as a corollary of the normal summer fires in order to collect a considerable amount through fraud. According to this illicit scheme, Fane organizes an arsonist to carry out the incendiary deed, a young man who is also the daughter of Anderson's daughter, and because of the future resort being in the middle of a critical fire risk sector (one of the many elements inexplicable in the script) Julian has every expectation that his vile design is not a serious obstacle. As the crime-insured local insurance company is mostly owned by Fane, the policy's naturally skeptical underwriters, Lloyd's of London, deploys senior investigator George Engels (James Mason) to investigate the nature of the crime, made more ominous by death. , possibly a homicide, from an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who, following the clues, was apparently approaching the cause of the fire. The setting for the film is the week before Christmas, the cornerstone of summer in the Antipodes, a dramatic backdrop, but the links in the story are not gently combined, resulting in the presentation of events that are difficult for the viewer to follow, problem aggravated by irregular editing, heavy cut mentioned, and poor sound and image quality. Skerritt's semi-comatose and monotonous style is fatally invalidated by this dazzling sound processing, but Mason is very effective as ever, and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes, impressive as the very early researcher writing; Doleman wins laurels acting with his malicious performance as Julian Fane.
