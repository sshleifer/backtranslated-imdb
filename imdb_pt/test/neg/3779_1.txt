I have heard that this movement was organized by a group of high school students. As an art project or high school theater, it is not so bad. Unless you lived close to milpitas in the seventies or met someone involved in the production of the movie, that's pretty awful. Most actors are clearly not actors, but the places that volunteered. Bob Wilkins (the original Creature Features presenter at KTVU in Oakland appears, but only for about a minute). Some of the monsters effects are made with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster outfit and each one works well on their own, but there is no continuity between the two. Watching without dialogue, you would assume that the movie had 2 monsters. I think the most unbearable aspect is that even the main characters, who I presume are the boys behind the movie, can not even pretend they're acting. These children must have engaged in the theater in some way to want to do this project, but they exhibit a believable zero emotion in front of the camera.
