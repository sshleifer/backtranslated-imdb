Where do I start? The plot of the movie, which is about a love between two high school students during the war, while one is a living weapon, and their struggle to maintain this love is a very good plot. It is based on a manga by Shin Takahashi, which was also turned into an anime in 2002, both of which I still have to read or see. <br /> <br /> This review is about this live adaptation. Unfortunately, this honest for good was a terrible movie. It is not as if someone could locate certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is to blame or that the action is to blame. It is, unfortunately, a series of uninteresting and ineffective elements that bring down this film. <br /> <br /> The acting is poor. It does not mean that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they did not have much to work with and they looked like miscellaneous. Neither seemed to have the physical reach to draw the viewer into the story, as well as being too old for their parts to a degree of distraction. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the leaders acted unrealistically and behaved irrationally. The movie also touches the heart, but ends up being predictable, all the while not being convincing and underdeveloping the characters. There are also rhythm problems. <br /> <br /> Visually, it is not worth noting. The film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in many scenes. The other special effects also have a cheap look for them, especially where minimalist practical special effects could have been used. There is also no visual talent, as if there were no cameraman or art designer to make the scenes seem consistent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> The music and sound effects were good, but they were not worthy of note. /> Overall, the film is not devoid of pleasure, and fans of the series should not be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completeness. People not familiar with Saikano, probably this is not the place to go, as it is not a very good movie or melodrama. It's not the movie or the cast and crew, it just is not inspired, and that's what kills it.
