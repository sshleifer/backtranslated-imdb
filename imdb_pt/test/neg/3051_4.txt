One of the many silent comedies presented by Stan Laurel before he joined Oliver Hardy, 'Mud and Sand' is a ho-hum hokum. The story is seriously disconnected - though this may be because of the modern edition - and the humor itself is not at all inventive. <br /> <br /> Potential plots are initiated and ignored; for example, Stan's promise to make Fillet de Sole pay for what she did with him never materializes. Stan's character also does not seem very focused, but this is a common criticism of his work before developing Laurel & Hardy's 'Stanley' fame, so I may just be expecting to see that gap. <br /> <br /> I strongly believe that all silent films should be preserved and seen, and I am happy that this is still available. It's not just a great movie.
