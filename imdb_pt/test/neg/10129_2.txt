I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. This is so boring. The jokes do not even come close to what we usually say funny. It's as if Alex said something that is neither funny nor interesting, and suddenly there is a laughing background sound. My friend and I just looked at each other with an empty look, as if asking each other, "What's so funny? !!". Seriously, every time we watched this show, you did not hear laughs or coughs. Just an empty look. So we stopped watching. I personally am a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But the show disappointed us. This show may be one of the worst comedy comedies of all time ...
