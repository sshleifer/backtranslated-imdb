This obviously was a very low budget production, but the cast was pretty decent, the basic premise was promising, and something else could have been done with it, but the script was not so good - the plot is incoherent and it seems almost random times and the dialogue is blighted and terrible. <br/> <br/> Basically, a girl's father is beaten by other gangsters, and then she becomes a thief, and wants to avenge his death, and then goes into a protection against the mob. racket involving corrupt politicians. <br /> <br /> Alan Ladd gets the highest billing, but he really has a much smaller role. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I found this a little fun in his archaic B-grade. Hokiness but really is of poor quality and pathetic.
