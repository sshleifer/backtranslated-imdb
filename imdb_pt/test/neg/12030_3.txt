This homemade horror movie tells the story of a guy who kills people using the Edgar Allan Poe stories. Local police ruined the case for a few years, so now the FBI has taken over. They know exactly who the guy is but apparently no one thought of going through his house because that's where he's walking, running in his vintage clothes and torturing the random spots. Then the FBI-chick is kidnapped, which involves his father, the former chief investigator of the local police. To top it all, a group of crazy college kids decided to camp in the house and smoke a bunch of marijuana. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, the FBI agent ends up screaming and running like a little girl. , and not a single big-time college kid thinks about stopping and jumping on poor boy Poe. Primarily exaggerated and sometimes misinterpreted, Dead End Road smacks of a low-budget production, pitched with friends who have too many silly points to cover.
