"The Patriot," starring Steven Segal, is a thriller / action movie from the late '90s that is not really a thriller and is not really an action movie; instead, it's Steven Segal playing Steven Segal by another name, but this time he's a Native American doctor who kicks ass every now and then. Discovering the obvious limits of the plot line, the film itself is absolutely incredible in terms of blatant disrespect for the denouement of characters. From a marketing point of view, I kept asking myself, "Who in the world were they targeting?" The bio-thriller plot is far from the target for the middle American public and Segal as a silk cowboy would never sell to anyone, even if you deep fry it and put it between a kripsy-cream donut. The whole movie is out there, even for Segal fans, because it simply does not deliver on any level.
