I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his acting is made of wood, he portrays a difficult "leader" character. The same here. This film was about a group of young scientists and divers exploring a cave in Romania that we need to dive to see. The initial scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of booty. We have advanced 30 years, and we have a team of divers called by some scientist and his team to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of clich√© and useless talk. Women are too hot for work, let's face it. I hate to watch these women's lips talk about the guys while drinking beer at the pre-cave exploration party. I mean, it was like we were in some pub with the sorts of fraternities and brotherhoods talking about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had ZERO personality, perhaps with the exception of the scientist, who at least was not one of the young and beautiful people. So the performance, though professional, was not inspiring. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was very bad. At one point in the film, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the main diver - his irises become the Cingular wireless symbol, and so remain. We are led to believe that since he has been scratched by one of these monsters, he is becoming one of them. Fair. But first of all, no one says the obvious thing to him: "What's happening to your eyes, man?" No. Everyone just talked about how he "changed" and that he should no longer be the leader of the group. And then this guy says, "you see how he's not HUMAN." There is? If they really believed he was a damn monster, then why not act like that? Instead, the group splits in two - those who go with Jack and those who go their separate ways, I think he's a monster. Does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie was this blonde blonde woman crawling through the wall of the cave, and is attacked by that goblin. Her scream really sucked - but she fought like hell to dispatch the goblin. <br /> <br /> The photograph was good when the camera was STILL. But any action sequences, the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flaming bubbles, lanterns, dark space, god knows what. I wish they would show us a scene from time to time. Just because you move the camera all over the place does not make the movie any SCARIER, guys. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if the following changes had been made: 1. Each actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the leader, it's okay to let him be the handsome one. I'm getting tired of seeing supermodel scientists in their twenties. Give me some time, everybody! <br /> <br /> 2. The director of photography was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and stood still. This may be the director's fault, I do not know. Strident camera (as in Constant Gardener) is getting old, folks. <br /> <br /> 3. We have to see the elves devouring people. How about some blood? There is not much else in this movie. We could barely see the creatures - I felt a little cheated about it. <br /> <br /> 4. The ending was pretty lame. During the breakthrough, the sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what? It's a bit canned. The ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions. All the other actors had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 out of 10, because after all, the acting was without notable errors, and the concept was quite unique. I'd like to see Cole doing more military roles - he's good at it.
