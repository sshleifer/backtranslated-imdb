before watching this movie, the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story. I did not like this film very much, but this adaptation of 1974 develops in a particularly tiring way. <br /> <br /> The actors do not shine, the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially cases of wood. the only character of real interest to me were the intelligent jaggers of anthony quayle. <br /> <br /> The so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is great. is a real lesson in how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and do not care what other people say, you are what you are, if others can not, take them. Pip said it at first, but he did not listen. The girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story, not on that same awful level, but on the way she shaped the child to create the executor of her personal revenge against everything the opposite sex she thought had deceived her. Pip's childhood did not look much better. the end did not seem to fit the rest of the style of the story. the scenarios seemed cheap, and coming to me I'm not surprised to see that this was in fact a TV movie (I had no idea when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> Learn. so many good movies, so little time. that's why the comments are here. so you would not have to waste your time with that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
