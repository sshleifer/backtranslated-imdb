This distinction has to go to the Dungeon of Harrow. At least Ed Wood's misguided attempt to make a quality science fiction film had the dubious star power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell, and Lyle Talbot. The Dungeon of Harrow does not have redemptive qualities. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about an abandoned aristocrat in a colony of lepers, perhaps in the style of DR. MOREAU or MISTERIOSA ISLAND is destroyed by the heavy dialogue and mono-tonal action of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights in a sea of ​​stupidity. The "special effects," which occurred in someone's bathtub, further condemn this film to the dung heap. Even the treatment of leprosy is something taken from a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its later stages belies the plot that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra, contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of Castle De Sade, condemned to insanity and cruelty inhumane . It's interesting to note that no cast member made another movie. No wonder, talent breeds talent; the lack of talent generates oblivion, which is where this film must find its end deplorable.
