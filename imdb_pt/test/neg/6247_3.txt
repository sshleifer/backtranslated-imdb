Hmmmmmmm - massacre of cheerleader. Let me think - high school girls are sliced, except the cute little one survives. I got it. Next movie. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that this movie was made in 2003. I actually thought they stopped making these films in the 80s. This was actually their movie run slasher mill with teenage eye drops, horn dogs dumb ass, even the most stupid adult male and hot teacher. He remains on the dark and stormy night list and abandoned cabin in the woods. We've seen it all before. <br /> <br /> However, this has had some interesting twists that put you above normal slashers, so if you have some brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill - you could do worse.
