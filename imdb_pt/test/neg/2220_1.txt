There I am sitting at home in the morning, suddenly my brother switches on what seems to be the most stupid movie I have ever seen. Considering it was the '70s and the special effects were not for sharpe, this movie almost equaled the definition of crap. The stupid monsters, the stupid plot and the stupid scenery made this the worst movie I've ever seen. So bad that I actually did not even finish it, I did it to a certain extent then continued to see how long I could go without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself. (I'm just joking haha) AMAZING MOVIE
