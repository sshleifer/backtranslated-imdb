I've seen this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how it could be on the list of Oscar nominees. The saddest things are: 1. It's too slow. <br /> <br /> 2. As Ghengis-khan, cruel and powerful emperor of Asia can be interpreted by a good actor with warm and kind eyes - throughout the film except a scene? <br /> <br /> 3. Many holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spent 20 years between his infancy and middle age. We see a former slave without money, power, friends or home. Click! "In the next second he's leading the huge army, with no reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Ghengis-khan comes out gently explained only by the help of a wolf / god / whoever it was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man make love to his wife like that after not seeing her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the sword fight if you just ride your horse through the enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everyone around you die? Does Ridley Scott know this way? <br /> <br /> 7. Why after 20-30 years does not Khan's mother look older? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (No. Literally.) <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Same. The filmmakers' work is good; nature is excellent - but the film can not be made without a director and screenplay. The real Ghengis-khan would execute the director in a second. <br /> <br /> Regards.
