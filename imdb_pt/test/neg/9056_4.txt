Personally, I really did not gain much from the act of seeing with my own eyes. I have noticed many highly rated ratings here for the movie, and I'm kind of surprised. Maybe I've missed something that other critics have felt "has changed," but I found the film rather tedious and basically meaningless. <br /> <br /> The "action" of the film is a lot of autopsy scenes that are filmed in a movie. art house style - many extreme close-ups, strange editing, etc ... and without sound or dialogue. I think THE ACT OF SEEING WITH OWN EYES could be considered a study of human anatomy, or perhaps (if you really want to dig a little) some kind of commentary on the fragility of mankind or the whatever it is - but I personally found it to be a lot of semi-interesting but boring autopsy scenes. If that is your thing, then this will be a winner for you. As for me - I saw a more interesting recording of ER. It's not a "bad" movie, as it's not really a "movie" in any traditional sense - I just did not find anything really remarkable about it - 4/10.
