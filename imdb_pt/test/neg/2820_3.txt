I'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies, when you put them together, that's my optimum: the awful sleaze. You will not get him in this movie, though. <br /> <br /> There is certainly sleaze, in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, tied naked to various things. The sleaze is not very sleazy, however. It did not register very loudly on my meter, especially since none of the girls were the least attractive, nor did they try to act as if they were threatened. They seemed to be thinking more about what it was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some crack. <br /> <br /> Forget the effects, they were lame to the extreme. Claudication was contributed by poor performance; the effects are harder to believe, even when the actors and actresses are not believing in them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was very bad, they could have hired some cameramen from a porn movie and done better. In fact, this could have increased the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable. As it is, there are many dark shots where you can not see very clearly, and what you can see is not looking very good. <br /> <br /> The horror factor is nil. Null. Zero. Anything. Zip lock. Zilch I saw children's films that were more frightening. There is no camp here either. It's just a movie that tries to be shockingly despicable, but it does not even come close.
