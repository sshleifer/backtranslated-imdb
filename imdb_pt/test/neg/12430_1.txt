** Possible spoilers ahead ** Whenever bad moviegoers gather for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably appears is Larry Buchanan's. This incredible director gave us back-ups of other turkeys, cheap crime dramas such as A BALA PARA O BONITO, and conspiracy films like DOWN ON USA and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. The LOCH NESS HORROR is crazy to say the least. Neglecting the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howler monkey in a California lake. Early on, the film bears a dazzling (for budget) underwater photograph and creates some atmosphere, in spite of itself. He then degenerates into windy dialogues uttered by nameless actors with Scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the so-called bagpipe. At one point, campers sing "You take the highest road, I'll hit the road lower," just to play in yet another Scottish clich√©. If the Scottish people decide to jump on the political correctness movement, they will sue Larry Buchanan because of this film, despite his last name. The monster looks like a giant paper mache puppet and makes the dragon in Beanie & Cecil seem terrifying in comparison. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie takes the land and, to escape some soldiers patrolling, the fifteen-meter-long creature tries to hide behind a tree - and the soldiers do not see it! The LOCH NESS HORROR is a real nutcase that must be seen - several times - to be believed.
