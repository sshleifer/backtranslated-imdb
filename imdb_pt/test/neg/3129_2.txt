The sometimes memorable dialogue of set designer Frederick Fox and a cast of veteran scholars can not save this lukewarm western against white people trapped in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty Cheyenne Indians. In addition to his occasionally captivating dialogue, you will find no surprise in Fox's script about this confrontation between whites and Indians. The characters in "Dakota Incident" generate only a minor interest, certainly not enough to make them stand out as much as some of the dialogues chosen by Fox. Unfortunately, good dialogue is Fox's only contribution because this small, conventional sagebrusher ends with a dull finish that contradicts his previous 80 minutes. The end is as planned as they come and lacks credibility. Most characters are nice, but some just do not have good sense. <br /> <br /> Dale Robertson is aptly strong and brave as outlaw John Banner, one of the three bank robbers who has to shoot out with his down, non-account partners. John Doucette (Rick Largo), a veteran western actor, risked the best of bad guys, while Skip Homeier, wasted in an inconsequential role as Banner's brother Frank Banner, dies after an Indian arrow. Doucette tries to knock Banner off at the beginning of the action, but our southpaw hero pretends his own death, drops off later and beats leather with him in a town called Christian Flats. Of course, Largo bites the dust this time, but Banner makes an interesting discovery. One of the passengers from a diligence of Christian Flats to Laramie ends up being none other than the cashier of the bank of whom he stole the money. John Carter (John Lund) is not only on a mission to find Banner, but also wants to clear his good name with the bank that issued the desired posters for his arrest. Of course, the authorities confused and amplified Carter's role in the assault. Carter is prepared to take Banner to Laramie and hand him over to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change when he meets Amy Clarke (the ex-beauty of Twentieth Century Fox, Linda Darnell), who wears a bright red dress and still has a big chest. As everyone else has mentioned in their reviews, Truecolor from Republic Studio brings RED on everything from Darnell's outfit to the blood spilled on the floor. The problem with the handling of director Lewis Foster of this common mill is that everything is delayed after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes fill up in a dry-clean to defend themselves against the Cheyenne. The good guys and the Cheyenne run out of ammo, but the "Dakota Incident" is never without its cliches. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of red skin. By the time this 88-minute dust lifter finishes, you will feel as if you have been trapped in a throat and threatened to loot the Cheyenne.
