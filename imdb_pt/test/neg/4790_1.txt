Unlike police rock and show where the kid dies of eating a spoiled hamburger, he found under the bed, this has been consistently the worst and most idiotic show to survive in prime time. If it were not for Jason Lee's unwarranted success in the movies, this program would never have gone out of his mind if he had a relatively unknown lead. <br /> <br /> The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron Caipira spends his lottery prizes to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. This is funny? periodically, but not consistently. This is stupid? Each and every episode. <br /> <br /> I've seen many big shows ahead of time, but that mistake survived more than I could ever imagine. The dialog box is incredibly bland as well as the themes of the episodes. Each episode of someone with an IQ over 100 is an absolute fight. And the icing on the cake? The annoying voice of Jason Lee narrating each episode. If it were not for the southern culture of the state and the southern rednecks, this show would have no audience. <br /> <br /> If you are an idiot and need a show completely without humor but overflowing with bad taste, bad dialogue and idiot characters failing in life ... well then you are probably an actor in this program .
