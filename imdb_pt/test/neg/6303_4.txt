Shaggy, friendly and frustrating movie has the same old message: if you want to do this in this world, being creative is not enough, you have to live in your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us . Australia's Drag Queens comedy is a very optimistic journey of three male friends traveling through the Outback on their pink bus, named Priscilla. Although not a formula movie in itself, there are the obligatory "road movie" sequences (collage by the fire, facing the rednecks, etc.). Screenwriter-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially malicious moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are intriguing gaps in his narrative, a terrible subversive about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and pre-teen son . who is comfortable - and the wise child - with their lifestyle), and a third act without any energy. It has a bit of a perverse transvestite humor and quite a game cast, but a script that seems to have been diluted along the way. ** in ***
