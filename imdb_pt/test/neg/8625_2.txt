There are so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Strange accent from Jeff Bridges. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to decipher the password code <br /> <br /> The entire script <br /> <br /> The final - especially the last scene in which two coffees are brought at the table for Jeff and Rita and the editor. J & R laughs and says "We do not drink any more coffee." Well, why did they ask then ??? They obviously did. If they did not and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default, there would have been three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
