No, no, no. This is my advice to you, if you are wanting to see this movie. Anthony Perkins is the only and only Norman Bates, as is Janet Leigh in her role as Marion Crane. This looks just like a colorful version of Psycho, with a few slightly different touches thrown for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is as weak as Norman, and Viggo Mortenson's Sam Loomis looks much more like the cowboy than the original. Please, guys, do some justice. Do not bother with that. One can only imagine what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins would be thinking now .......
