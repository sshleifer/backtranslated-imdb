I'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes to go. If it gets better, I'll come back here and let you know, but I doubt that will happen. Solomon Kane looks like it's based on the Dark Watch video game, and it looks like it's based on the Legacy of Kane video game, but unfortunately it's not true. I've heard it's based on some comics, graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else I've never heard of, but on whatever basis, there's nothing original about this extremely annoying movie. The atmosphere is stolen from the 300 movie, which was not very good at first. The tedious exaggeration takes itself so seriously that it's almost hypnotic, and to be clear, I mean it in a bad way. The plot is practically non-existent: the violent subject trying to be nonviolent finds the family friendly, the friendly family is murdered, the violent subject becomes violent again. All characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes, or whatever, just pick another apocalyptic movie that you've seen and there it is. Someone, somewhere, said, is like making a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add several slow-motion photos of horse hooves splashing into dark puddles, add snowflakes around while two boring characters are talking to each other. another, and oh yes rain falling drastically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening, and do not forget the black silhouettes walking toward us with burning fire behind them, and many torches burning, and of course blurry fight scenes during which not it's clear what's really happening because we do not have the budget for bloody special effects, so just play the sound of the metal making noise, and oh, by the way, do not let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them, and cross your fingers, I hope sword and witchcraft fans consume this, even if it's full doo doo, and go straight to the video, do not pass GO. . .
