I could barely see the whole movie ... Only after about 85 minutes out of the 110 minutes of the movie, the journey to Mars began, and then it was 5 minutes to close. Those 85 long minutes were VERY annoying and did not contribute anything to the movie. When it finally hit Mars, it was not much better to plot. Everything could have been adjusted in a much shorter runtime and nothing would have been overlooked. <br /> <br /> What I can not understand is the passage that says that the newborn babies in the movie were called "Aelita." ... Why would anyone want to name their baby after a villain, who despite having only one eyebrow, apparently has 3 breasts ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the Mars scenes. They are an interesting experience in Constructivism, as well as "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" went to Expressionism five years earlier. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 for the great design ...
