The best part of this movie is the first, located in Sicily, I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the beginning of the film is delightfully surprising. The rest of the story is very annoying. Crialese uselessly insists on stereotyped situations and characters, trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique, Fellinian's surrealistic memories and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack, taking the whole thing to an end that gives it the feeling of a exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly. Frankly, this is an overrated movie and Crialese is an overrated director.
