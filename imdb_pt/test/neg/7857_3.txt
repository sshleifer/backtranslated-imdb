For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, adored by his underlying macabre and ironic comic touches, was quite wet when it came to choosing the material. It is not that Lubitsch is overestimated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative - yet the projects he has attached to (or to which he has been assigned) are not exactly the milestones of comedy . fans like to label them. With "Heaven Can Wait," a cinematic adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's "Birthday" play, Lubitsch faces the sleepy Don Ameche in the lead - and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and a moldy flashback structure frustrates the director . A perverse man at the turn of the century "falls asleep unnoticed," presenting the facts of his life in front of the entrance to Hell. Ameche ... wicked? That was problem number one. The promising opening sequence (defined in the Hades lobby) quickly gives way to a lugubrious whim, and the support cast is of little help. * 1/2 of ****
