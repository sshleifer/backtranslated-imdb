I can not believe I sat through this total waste of time. I was too fascinated by how indescribably bad it was that I could not move. It reminded me of the feeling when you can not take your eyes off a horrible car accident or the rotten carcass of a cow. You can not stop looking, but you feel sick and nauseated afterwards. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate: "Plan 9 from outer space", for example, is not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. Both are terrible to watch for sure, but both have some qualities and at least leave you the strength to reach the "off" button. This "remake" of the science fiction classic left me crying on my couch, trying desperately to understand why such scripts are filmed, why would someone mess up the memory of the original classic, and whether or not I could resume my normal life without mine. Suddenly, I acquired the yearning for silence and the peace of death. <br /> <br /> Though death, I realized, did not offer rest from the horrible memories of this pile of garbage, how poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch again and again for all eternity ...
