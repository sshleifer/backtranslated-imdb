Are you kidding me? This is possibly the worst amateur movie I've ever seen. The cast was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and I'm sorry the guy at picnic speed carrying his plate full of food was somewhere near useless and the demonic and potty jerk chasing Drew was nothing more than comical . When I drove over the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature about it and thought it seemed like a plausible story was possible. But this movie just destroyed that. Ric White (Director, Screenwriter, Actor Leader, etc.) takes a little too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves .... Do yourself a favor ... skip that one.
