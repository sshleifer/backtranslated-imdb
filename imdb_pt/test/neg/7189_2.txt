The creators of this film must have sat down one day and said "let's make fun of the Russians and at the same time show people how we Americans are advanced." The film portrays the Russians as an inferior people who can not understand the brilliant ideas presented by Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than in the campaigns of other countries. However, this film goes far and exaggerates the differences between the East and the West. To me, it looked like a propaganda movie made during the Cold War.
