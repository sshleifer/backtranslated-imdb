You earn an hour and a half of braindead I have to save the action of the world all the way, a liners and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a guy who helps people in the witness protection program. to name the cover of the film. He erases his past to save his future. Woppi, this has to be cool :) I'll bet younger people will like it, but it's a little over the top for my liking. And the liners are really something else, and I do not mean it in a good way. After killing a crocodile he can say. "You're Baggage" If you're in good mood you can enjoy the movie. And as for the braindead action, this is not too bad. But almost before the movie starts you know exactly what will happen. But if you like that kind of movie, you'll probably like it. I rate this movie 4
