A monotonous walk through the banalities of Mormon proselytization. Totally not funny. A testament to the widely held theory that, for bathroom humor to be funny, it must necessarily be vulgar; also reinforces the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you funny. More propaganda than film, do not worry about delicate social issues that pop up on the dinner table after this. The saving grace of this film is the accurate portrayal of young Mormons as particularly attractive. Oh well, it's your $ 7.50.
