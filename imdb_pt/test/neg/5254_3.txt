We show this film in a club as an example of how classic literature can turn into some of the most terrible films of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be set in the future "techno-futile" should have been a good tip. I think that word describes the movie itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie, the effort was completely futile. Not to mention that our club advisor told us that he was not supposed to get a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This cinematic failure is full of clich√©d and tacky dialogue that is worse than anguished teenage poetry. Beowulf's character changes midway in a way that is not credible, and whenever he's in an action scene, he's constantly changing like a hyper gymnast. There is even, as they say, a "symbolic black subject" whose attempts at humor are completely out of place. And, of course, the daughter of the outpost leader Grendel is terrorizing is a total bitch. A bitch whose breasts are exposed throughout the movie. A vixen who wants to fight the creature, but she never puts on armor. And your weapon of choice is a small knife. And despite her terrible situation, she still dresses up for dinner, in a dress with a transparent skirt that exposes her panties of short shorts. There are some scenes that could pass through soft core pornography, and in the second scene they even reuse images from the first. I thought Grendel's interpretation was bad enough, but then came the end of the movie, which featured a CGI display that might be decent for the 1980s, but it's totally ridiculous for a venture in the late 1990s. could go on, but you guys should all watch this movie for the totally laughable effect. <br /> <br /> The other members of the club and I were able to have fun watching this by taking a hint of the MST 3K and making fun of it all the way. I'm still recovering from an extra weapon: a pizza cutter perpetually spinning on a pole.
