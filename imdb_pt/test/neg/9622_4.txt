I'm trying to understand what people liked about MirrorMask. I am an avid movie viewer and amateur filmmaker. As I was telling friends during my lunch hour, MirrorMask may very well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. Like the short Moongirl, the film lost its mark. Several times during the film, he made attempts at humor. This prepares you for the laughter. Instead of making you laugh, it makes you feel empty. The jokes reminded one of the recent Star Wars movies. They were not funny unless you were five. And the acting seemed equally terrible. I've seen actors act in front of a blue screen. And I believed that. But not in this movie. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> This movie uses a formula and tries to apply it with beautiful works of art ?? And although the script is totally viable and the special effects very beautiful, it has no heart and fails miserably. I left the film shaking my head and thought about leaving the theater. I felt sanctified and miserable and still could not get the bitter taste out of my mouth. I love independent movies. I encourage people to watch independent films to support them. But not this movie. This movie should not have been made. At least, not like this. Why did the director lose the marks so clearly? Were they clearly prepared? Not just the humor. But the emotions. The drama. Even the lines were poorly timed and delivered. It was as if the movie had three legs instead of four. Your footsteps are clumsy and lack of time. And could it fall with the slightest push ?? I do not see this movie. I do not care who you are. Not worth your time.
