Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who this idea was and what soup kitchen they're eating right now. To say that this was bad is an insult to the bad movies that we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name on the TV guide, I imagined it would be a parody ... maybe it should have been. I could have made a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene where they are in a plane in flight with the door open and there is no wind what ever. They could have sprung up for a fan at least. Look for several Canadian actors and c-list in the film. This is the kind of movie that knocks out the b-rate cable stations you never see except on a rainy Sunday.
