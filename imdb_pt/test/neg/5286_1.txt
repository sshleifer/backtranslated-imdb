This movie is by far one of the worst B movies I have ever seen. There is no twist in history. Although the performance is decent, the plot is terrible. There are too many mistakes in the movie, and it was uncomfortable to watch. For any of you who like horror movies, horror movies, or even B movies, I would not recommend this to anyone. Most of the film is focused on meaningless murders, in ways that are not even worth discussing. This movie may well be likened to a fucking remake of Jeepers Creepers, which, too, was not as good as a movie. For those who want to spend a day at home, watching badly made movies, this one takes the cake.
