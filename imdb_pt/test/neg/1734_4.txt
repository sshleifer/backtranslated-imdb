I rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. We actually got ridiculed by the seller in the store because of our tastes of questionable movies. Unfortunately, I do not remember the first half of the movie because all I did was look at the giant metal suspenders Jane wore. and I also heard nothing from the incomprehensible laughter. The other thing that managed to catch my attention beyond the metal mouth was his questionable sense of fashion. This movie was made in 2005, but it looks like wardrobe folks jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "popstar" and likes high-waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee-high skirts, then this little memory road trip is perfect for you.
