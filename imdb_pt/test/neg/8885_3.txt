This movie had very little good points, special effects and acting was horrible for sure. But it was a movie made with a low budget so you do not expect too much of it, it has some laughs (I doubt they are intended though :)). The scene where the old woman crouches down and touches the excrement that was on the floor, then puts it on her nose and goes CHUPACABRA! in a really stupid hoarse voice was invaluable. All in all, if you have nothing left to watch and just want to laugh at a really low quality movie trying to profit from the success of the Blair Witch Project, then get another one that does not bother you.
