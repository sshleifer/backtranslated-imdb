Anatomie was a film made in German and subtitled. It was also too long and annoying. If it was to be a horror movie, it failed miserably for me. The actors took their steps looking more like they were somewhere else. film work was ok but more attention should have been applied to the awful banal script. I paid nothing to see the video and I still feel cheated. Read a book and save your money.
