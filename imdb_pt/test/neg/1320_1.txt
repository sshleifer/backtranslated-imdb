As bad as they get. This movie makes the fatal mistake of making the viewer not care what happens to the characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that you start cheering on the bad guys for this thing to end. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few that was so bad that I had to resort to another channel. <br /> <br /> Placed in intellectual language, this film has no verisimilitude. People, not even Ohio people, just do not act like that. Well, maybe the writers will. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
