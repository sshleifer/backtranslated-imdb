Sit in your basement with the light off for an hour and a half. It is almost the same as observing this subterranean search for the devil's door. An American researcher Owen (Vincent Gallo) travels to Moscow and gathers a rescue team to search for his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzia), an archaeologist who disappeared in the catacombs under the Russian capital. They will be shocked to discover underground dwellers thriving in the complex and damp complex system of caves and tunnels. The seekers will come to the doorman of Hell, Andrey (Val Kilmer), and make an agreement to continue their enterprise; only to succeed in being scared when they realize they are among the undead. Also in the cast: Joaquin de Almedia, Oksana Akinshina, Sage Stallone, Joss Ackland and Julio Perillan.
