Bad script? Checks. Terrible effects? Checks. Horrible actors? Checks. Lame steering? Check. <br /> <br /> After seeing the box DVD in a box office success and fan of the horror genre, I put my $ 4.28 on the line and I rented this "movie". My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored so on a Tuesday night, I decided that this would be a perfect time for me to watch, what seemed to be (based on the cover artwork) a horror movie. What I won was the worst movie ever made. Until that moment I had always declared the "Slumber Party Massacre 3" the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> If you're the type that wants to watch a movie because you've heard how bad it is, this is for you. If you do not want to lose $ 4.00 and irreplaceable 80 minutes of your life, avoid that junk. <br /> <br /> One more note: I noticed that some of the "actors" appear here and post comments. on the bulletin board. How can you brag about being in this movie? You were all horrible. I mean very badly. If there were an American Idol for the actors, you would all be ridiculed in the first few episodes. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> Sutter Cain
