I felt the movie was rushed and the performance was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the lead girl was an idiot, and the guy who represented the devil was horrible. The story was confusing and stupid. The movie made no sense and was unbelievable. The film is not the worst movie, but it is not far from it. Overall, I was very disappointed it could have been so much better. My rating is 3 out of 10
