As stated by others, this is a ridiculously horrible movie (NOT A MOVIE!). Not bad in a funny way, just painful to try to endure. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is very hot but there is a scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles. Besides, she's getting fat. <br /> <br /> Fight scenes are as bad as being unattainable, whether you know or care about martial arts, or even decent choreography, and the editing / effects are awful. <br /> There's no reward, it's not going anywhere and it sucks to get there.
