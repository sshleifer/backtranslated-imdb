Full disclosure: I was born in 1967. At first, the premise made me tickle - after all, if you were a teenager growing up in Reagan's time, a trip down memory lane would be worth a laugh or three. Pop Rocks, Atari and Rock 'in Sock' in Robots? He loved them, not in spite of the fact that they were fools, but because they were silly, silly and funny. But when VH1 decided to do the series "I Love Last Tuesday", I knew it was enough. Will Hal Sparks have nothing better to do than read from a teleprompter how idiotic the Slinkys are? (Wait, let me check ... hmmm, no. No, it does not look like he does.) Snarky, super-morbid hip posture has its place, but enough!
