I really like Harrison Ford, so I eagerly rented this movie just to be disappointed minute after minute. Mr. Ford seemed to be walking through very hot waters looking for a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had the best lines. The story intrigued me, but the mistake - BIG MISTAKE - since everyone is identified by driver's license or passport before boarding any American commercial plane, left countless issues in my mind. <br /> <br /> I could have cared less about these people. In fact, the sub-plot of the internal investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed during the first-class flight to Miami. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the director, Sydney Pollack, who gave us the classic Tootsie. and other movies. This is a waste of time and energy.
