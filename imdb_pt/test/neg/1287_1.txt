This is a very bad waste of your time. I'd probably rather go and watch some documentary than that; it's really that bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is really terrible, and you can say that the producers had a low budget because of the poor quality of the image. It is by far at the lower end of the scale; Do not waste your money on this. <br /> <br /> I have a hard time believing that the person who made this movie would do well. I had to watch with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids. Even the children (3, 4, 6, and 8) thought it was very annoying. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other commentator, SpongeBob would be much better to watch than that. <br /> <br /> General: Just do not watch. No, no.
