Why is it impossible to write in French? Very Kitch! This journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities, however, current in 1976. These great "Casimir" monsters is completely ridiculous! The film deserves, however, a remake, as was "KING KONG" (the latter), with a scenario a little more comprehensive. The teacher has similarities with Professor Calculus and is quite funny. David (the character) is quite inconsistent, but crosses (spends) with people below a good message "you get together and it will beat you!". All in all, we'd say a movie made in the 1940s. Now that I've said all (or almost) the evil that I thought of it, we can say that if we have the brain tired or anything has to do with the other, then the thing matter) is still quite amusing. Hugh! That's my opinion! (translating French to English with "Reverso": sorry for possible mistakes!)
