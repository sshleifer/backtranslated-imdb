The Robot Against the Aztec Mummy was one of the silly and less credible movies I've ever seen. O.K, I can buy that woman in the movie is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an Aztec god. What I can not buy is that the mummy is incredibly fake and the robot even worse. When you want to watch a movie like this, you want to see a lot of fighting action. But the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute! Probably the worst of all was the art of the day of the dead that they had in the credits. It's the worst I've ever seen. Avoid this if possible.
