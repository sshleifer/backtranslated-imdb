The main flaw in this Spanish slasher / shocker is within the script. For the first half hour is a good effort, building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread. We even have some cool killings too! Then it descends completely and turns into an entire catalog of "your basic slasher cliches". I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised much more. The final thirty minutes consist of a few murders and a lot of rushing into an abandoned convent. It should have been much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room are completely fine)! <br /> <br /> First of all, we have dialogue. It's horrible most of the time (there was some laughter in the audience here and there when I saw it) and just adequate elsewhere. It is also almost inaudible during many scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and soundtrack (however, this may not be so bad, considering all the idiot speech we have to hear!). There's a line throughout the film that references the movie "I Know What You Did Last Summer," indicating that the filmmakers wrote it all as a big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> /> And the end ... well, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me, it was mostly a matter of the first because the final twist comes from nowhere! If the public had given some clues about the girls' mental state, I might have thought otherwise. He also throws all the logic out the window, because the killer could never have been in place for some of the killings! But as an avid fan of terror, I learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But not everything is bad. The film has a big budget appeal, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes of times past really shine here), tight edition and an atmospheric soundtrack. Even though most of the actors are very bad, Anita Briem is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with. Presence on the real screen! <br /> <br /> And, as I mentioned before, killings are bloody enough for fans of these things and are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving water images (but the "water theme" "tends to stay <br /> <br /> So, to conclude this review, it's a movie that is really fun in a "so bad is good" way and also pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> But do not expect too much because it does not work as you probably think it will, judging by the descriptions of the trailers and the tangles.
