Yes, it is true that it was Jessica Alba who led me to this movie, because without her, I should never have chosen. <br /> <br /> But, I think it's long, boring and above all, unoriginal. All the time, I thought the story was full of clich√©s and the direction was very boring. So it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the same person. I take note to remember to avoid all your upcoming movies. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because all good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the British Empire and the cast is wonderful: Jessica knows how to open her soul and for a while she found a film suitable for this. Bob Hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won a prize for that role. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that this makes me open a map of the world to locate this island because if you think this happens South Asia, you do not know exactly where! Ah, the little plane flight with red lines in the Indiana Jones movie !!!
