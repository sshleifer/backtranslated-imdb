Coen Brothers-wannabe's screenwriter and director Paul Chart relies heavily on ideas drawn from other (better) movies, but manages to create a scary atmosphere that keeps a person watching. Robert Forster is loosed like never before before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who makes a killing in the desert. The film is unusual, but in its attempt to stay one step ahead of the public, it becomes alienating and discouraging (with a role for Amanda Plummer that is absolutely humiliating). An end to bravery admittedly, many quirky pieces of business - and Forster with a great naked look - make it an item of curiosity, nothing more. Veteran film director Irvin Kershner produced, and maybe should also drive (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 of ****
