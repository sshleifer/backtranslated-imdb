=========== BIG SPOILER ================================= This is a Terrible movie without friendly characters. So many clichés and senseless scenes. He needs a good editor, but there may not be any more films. Please save your two hours. The only decent and unpredictable scene in the film was when the younger brother refused to stop his brother from killing himself. The description said "moments of dark comedy." Maybe I missed those when I blinked. The horrible characters start right at the funeral. Are funeral goers laughing and complaining about food while they're at the funeral of a very young man who committed suicide? So the father digs the only son left? Right at the funeral? How does the neighbor on the side, whose husband betrayed her to the character of Sigourney Weaver, is the bad guy to tell her husband? The father does not even know that his son can play the piano, although everyone else around him seems to know that he is a great pianist. The film tries to push every dramatic cliché possible in a movie: father directing athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family losing a child chosen for suicide, son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, child conceived via case more raised as a husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illness, etc., etc., etc. DO NOT LOSE YOUR 2 HOURS.
