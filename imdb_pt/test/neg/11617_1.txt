Wow!! I really regret seeing this photo ... Funny, I agreed to see only for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing her half an hour before retiring, while I stayed in front of the TV, but only to feed the masochist in me and I because I wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some aspects that could alleviate the feeling that I had to be an idiot for watching that dick called Two Girls and a Guy ... < Everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong ... from the initial, absurd premise of two women stupid enough to stay with the common boyfriend, even the horrible, but merciful, order, not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors ... Do not believe the rumors, the addict's acting is bad and I do not see how Graham became a household name within the film industry ... <br /> <br /> I wonder why , after the producers saved a few dollars m only three actors and a single location, they did not hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his butt ... <br /> <br /> At least I felt a little well when I destroyed the DVD and threw it in the trash ... Anyway, I kind of liked somehow (and only a little) of the brunette actress, Natasha, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of Face-off (change of faces), then Two Girls and a Guy in the background will .... <br /> <br /> Stay away from that shit!
