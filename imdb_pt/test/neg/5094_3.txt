A good example of inverted, politically correct racism in which white men are portrayed as meaningless brutes, who are only there to be massacred and their Aboriginal opponents as noble heroes, superior both in appearance and skills. In addition to making the story excessively dull, this also prevents the neutral viewer from identifying with one or the other side - it's simply too simplistic. The repetitive punctuation is incredibly annoying (as well as the narration), the characters have no depth and the viewer soon gets lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell does that mean." However, the photography is wonderful, and overall there is a lot of atmosphere, but nice scenes of hazy landscapes do not save this movie. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an attractive. In fact, your character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters), and disappears anyway in the middle of the movie. But if you're eager to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, this is your kind of movie ...
