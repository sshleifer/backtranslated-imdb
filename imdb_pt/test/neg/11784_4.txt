Irwin Allen put all his talents behind this: he is co-scriptwriter, producer and director of this "epic" cartoon about an atomic submarine and his efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circulating on Earth. The potentially exciting story does not take off despite an eclectic cast. Assorted players from Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine to Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interesting and blend and provide a dash of color, but this soggy science fiction is quite extravagant. Good for a few lost laughs, but Allen did not seem to know the difference between a strong and solid adventure and extravagant nonsense. Later, a popular TV series. ** in ****
