As I am required to write a minimum of 10 lines, and this junk deserves not just a single one, I will start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this terrible "movie". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys that Mr. David Varod produces are filmed mainly in my beautiful homeland, Bulgaria (only on BTW, for the illiterate people around - this country is IN EUROPE, based in northern Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image invaded our country and started to make general video releases. Because here? Because here they pay low excuses for the Bulgarian crew and for the Bulgarian actors (most of them distinct) who are in many respects better than most of their American counterparts. Personally I'm ashamed of this fact. The reason is, of course, the eagerness of the Americans involved and their desire to get the most if not all of the profit. In fact, it would not be so bad if the production were not so filthy and pale. There has not been a good photo here for years. At the moment, the UN image is being prosecuted here for the very questionable purchase of our national film production center called Boyana Films. No doubt about this there was corruption, there was deception, there has been a lie in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema!
