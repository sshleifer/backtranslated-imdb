Schoolies is a useless exercise ... Go to the Gold Coast, get drunk and have sex. Ambitions worthwhile perhaps, but not highly intellectual. The plot is a simple as some sentences assigned to each character and no one is helped by the cliches distributed here. <br /> <br /> Something that would help is the cast. Everyone seems too old. These characters are supposedly innocent who are venturing alone into adulthood, but they all seem too old to be credible on paper. <br /> <br />
