Reading the book, I was once again attracted to Castle Rock (Needful Things being the final part of the Rock trilogy), and the plot was a variant of the "devil comes to the little country village" story that King likes to tell. The characters were all described in loving detail, and both created a good psychological and bloody horror. The movie, on the other hand, is horrible. Gone are the character interactions and the clever plot, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting, but loses by a mile. If you have not read the book, then you may like this, otherwise avoid at all costs, as with most of King's books.
