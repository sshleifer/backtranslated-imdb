*** SPOILERS! *** I sometimes wonder what makes the kidnappers think they need to explain (and therefore destroy) the mysteries behind the iconic Horror movies. The original "Hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made. The 1988 sequel "Hellbound" was also a terrific horror movie, although I personally did not like how the viewer got information about the Cenobites, some of the film's most horrific villains. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992) was already a mess, whose creators obviously felt it necessary to add a dose of humor to the incomparably chilling cenobite lead chick (a typical stupidity of the 1990s) and thus destroyed most of time. its scary. This fourth part "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is slightly more atmospheric than the third, but reduces that quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary "basic information" on the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell. Seriously - do we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made? I do not think so, and that's not the only mystery about the cenobites that are stupidly destroyed in this movie. The "Bloodline" setting goes back and forth in three different periods. The film begins in a space station of the 22nd century, when scientist Dr. Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) tries to close the gates to hell forever. When the government soldiers interrupt their mission, he needs to explain his reasons. In eighteenth-century Paris, Merchant's ancestor was a toy maker designed to build a jigsaw puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult. An evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Since the only person capable of destroying the doorway to hell is the one who built it, the toy maker's lineage would be cursed and its ancestors infested by cenobites over time ... The movie, which takes place in the century XVIII, present, and in the 22nd century, really is a mess. I admit that the part set in the 18th century has a scary atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but it's also its smallest part. The parts defined in the present and the future are quite weak and full of stupid and unworthy elements. The strengths of the film are undoubtedly the fantastic makeup and bloody effects, the absolutely breathtaking Valentina Varagas as the devil, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who despite having lost some of her shiver, is still threatening. villain. It's an almost offensive idea for fans of "Hellraiser", however, that Pinhead must be defeated by a ridiculous show of lights. Overall, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it certainly is an unworthy sequence of a series that started so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed by this, since he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, this is only recommended for Pinhead fanatic fanatics, and most of them will probably be angry with another diminution of the shiver of their favorite demon. All others are well advised to stick with the first brilliant and excellent second part of the franchise "Hellraiser" and skip all the others. The makeup effects on "Bloodline" are scary as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. My Rating: 3.5 / 10
