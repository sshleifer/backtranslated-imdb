This film is so daring that it does not try to hide its similarities with The Enlightened One. You do not have the originality to do it. And when that happens, near the end, try to cover up your story that "father becomes psychotic under the influence of a haunted house in a foreign place," this happens by leaning toward many other conventions and ideas already established. In other words, it is reduced to mere cliche. But hell, even I like a good predictable suspense or thriller, as long as there is an interesting story, full of violence and violence, somewhere before the movie make the terrible change to the predictable and banal. Well, this movie does not have a good story and I was very disappointed with that. What 'Darkness' has for it is remarkable direction and cinematography. It is a well-made and carefully constructed film full of fun scary angles and shots. What 'Darkness' does not have to do is pretty much everything else. To start off with a little argument - the editing of this movie is unpleasant. He jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes meaningless. For example, the old man in the movie (who practically carries the background story, later filled by another character) is underlined by a hamster running circles. I mean, it looks cool for the first time, but why keep using the same image? I think you would have to see for yourself, to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin who laments throughout the film, crying and caring much about everything - she is the film's failed attempt at a character-driven horror film. The film has scenes of exaggerated sentimentality and the family drama it describes is not simply believable. In the end, 'Darkness' is a messy melodrama, with a non-involving mystery provided with a very simple ending. And it's hardly scary.
