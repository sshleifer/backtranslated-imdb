The premise of Bottom Crossed with Fawlty Towers looks great! However, Ade Edmonson and Rik Mayall have managed to create a movie that creates only a laugh. Ten years ago, Rik Mayall's crazy look and Ade's idiocy were funny, now they're just annoying. <br /> <br /> The film promised - although Britain's most horrendous hotel is not a new idea - but failed. The saving graces were competing performances by Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu, and the film is only 90 minutes long. Sorry guys, but you really hit the bottom.
