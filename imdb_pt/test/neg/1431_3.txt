What starts off reasonably well (and quite upsetting) quickly sinks into a boring mess. Dee Snider (of the infamous Twisted Sister) apparently wrote the script for his own idea, and while the idea of ​​a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really explode here at irregular pace, bad dialogues, and one of the greatest non-endings you've ever seen. Despite some lifeless performances, the director runs a truly sinister first carousel. This really looks like it's going to be a good low budget effort. <br /> <br /> You're not that lucky. The plot runs all over the map, and Snider's character relentlessly spun lines of adulterous psychotic cookie that should pass through meaningful dialogues. Worst, the support cast barely registers, and the only possible dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there's a new sister song, if you mind.
