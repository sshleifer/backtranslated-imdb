(This review will have some very obvious spoilers, so beware). <br /> <br /> A friend brought this, and we did it for 45 minutes before we decided that Fast Forward 8x Speed ​​was the only way this movie was supposed to be watched. There were points where we were watching the movie at normal speed, where I would go out, prepare some lunch and come back, to discover that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened in the background, no important facial gestures were made, nothing more than embarrassing and numbing silence. <br /> <br /> That's not how you make a thoughtful film, especially when the plot of the movie follows the same basic Hollywood movie. tropes If I told you that Disney was making a movie about 4 girls starting a band, and the singer was a French interchange, what would you expect to be the "conflicts" that have arisen? <br /> <br /> Does the singer have to overcome the fear of the stage? Does anyone have an unsaid fall? Is the band late for their performance, and does a secondary character have to buy time for them? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All these things happen in this movie. <br /> At no point in this movie do you have the slightest concern that these girls will not achieve their goal. <br /> <br /> THAT ENDES THE SPOILERS SECTION. <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Heck, I even know all the bands mentioned in the record collections and MDs that they are going through, and I have sung along with the title track with friends in karaoke. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie in Japan that I have ever seen. Do not be confused. Although the characters have points in the movie in which they do things typical of Japanese high school, this is not a typical "day in the life" movie. This is "a day in the life of 4 extremely random, heavily conflicted and awkward Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also notable problems with the DVD. Viz decided that a great extra would be a producer reading aloud the Wikipedia entry on the Blue Hearts. What a value! In addition, they care very little about the legend that the band name in the captions, "Paran Maum" is different from what is in the chapter selection menu, "Paran Marum". In the final scene of the auditorium, there is a ghost reflex / effect VERY visible at all, but this seems to be the fault of the original movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DO NOT see if you absolutely do not love embarrassing silences.
