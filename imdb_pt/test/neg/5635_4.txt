The fact that this movie was distributed for free with a certain national newspaper that I do not care to a certain extent prevented me from watching it but as I found a copy that a local charity shop was giving out for nothing I felt I could watch it with a clear conscience. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, the evocation of Thameside's location is well made, but suffers, I feel, from a few flaws too. First, Vinnie Jones simply is not convincing as the journalist. While Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the ability to act to play such a role. <br /> <br /> Secondly, who would carry a lost manuscript with them that they were told is "invaluable"? It seemed that everywhere Mr. Jones was this manuscript went with him! Thirdly, the whole aspect of Dickens's story, although it seems important, hinders what might have been an interesting film of corruption in high places. Maybe I'm a bit thick, but I really could not see the Dickens-style sense of history within a story. That added nothing to the film, and only served to confuse things when things started to become interesting within modern history. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I will give the filmmakers is that at least they have tried something a little different. I'm all for independent British films that try to be "off the left field", but this is not a "Red Road" or "This is England". What is is a mess, and an over-long on that. Yes, it is partly amusing, but in the end it seemed that two films were merged to form a whole, and would fail to do so. (Also, I can not help thinking that I saw something like this recently made on TV by Ian Banks, set in Edinburgh with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes.)
