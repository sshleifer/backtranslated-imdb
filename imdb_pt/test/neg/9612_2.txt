I will not be too hard on this show because I enjoyed the first season, but then things got worse. The concept is nothing special, just about a girl named Casey who is trying to deal with a new stepbrother, Derek, and her noisy and coarse family as she gradually enforces her princess standards on each one of them. <br /> In Season 1, the story was really interesting. I liked Casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. She was well-educated and profound. I felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new stepbrother. She was a perfectionist, but not as irritating as the later episodes. Oh, and she dated a nice guy, who is currently portrayed as one of Derek's dumb friends. The season understood the real tension the show's title was trying to capture. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not say that the show really fell, because the story is sometimes interesting, but I'm wrestling for Derek now instead of Casey. Now there is little or no interaction between the two brothers. If they interact, it's only briefly. Oh, and I do not want any Dasey fans in my face. People, this is called INCESTA, even if they are half-brothers. My tolerance can only go so far, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> It's weird. Derek, as the antagonist, has become more sensitive over time, while Casey, the alleged protagonist, is more neurotic and despicable than before. I like how younger kids get more air time, but parents are even more ignorant than before. But that's not the biggest problem ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we're forced to see everything from Casey's point of view, with lame and nauseating background music. She got dumber and shallower over time. In one episode, she became tearful and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous, so she purposely threw food on herself and blamed Derek. Now, what happened to being a strong, independent feminist? I did not watch much of season four, but I heard she's dating a guy named Truman, who's an idiot and is arrogant. I remember this episode of fencing. She constantly remembers that she does not like him, goes mad for being "goosed" by a sword, and in the end, connects with him because she can "manipulate" him? What the hell? Why go with a guy like that in the first place. The first season Casey would have just punched him ... it does not matter. Or maybe that was my reaction. Oh, and she's a cheerleader. Not that this is a bad thing, but I think she fell into her head in one of her practices. And in a graduation episode, she cried because she could not find the "dress in her dreams" and was not completely satisfied until she became the prom queen. One thing I've noticed is that no matter how bad Casey tries to tell us what her life is, she almost always goes to the end (she gets the guy she wants, Derek gets some kind of revenge, people love her, I do not see why a lot of people hate Sally. She looks cool, and it's nice to see Derek in a serious relationship with someone he likes instead of "playing on the field." He's also treating Edwin a little better, and he's a good brother to Marti. <br/> <br/> Actually, the show is more or less, and I rated it low because despite the development of some characters, the character who I once admired now become like any "teenage fashion queen" you can see anywhere on the TV.But it was good while it lasted.
