This film is of interest to fans of the famous rock band "The Band", in which singer / keyboardist Richard Manuel appears in several scenes. It seems to me that the film could have been filmed a few years before 75, judging by Richard's appearance. Interestingly, Jones would later act with Levon's band in a considerably better film, "Coal Miner's Daughter". Either way, you really need a special reason to survive this difficult to watch the art film. Unfortunately, the famous and sensitive Manuel would commit suicide. I never heard how he ended up in a movie. Four of the five band members would appear in another bad movie, "Man Outside".
