Other critics seem to have taken this film into high regard. For something done by an eighteen-year-old film student, I'd say brave, but that's not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffitti, stay with the documentaries. It is shot with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dark actors and, again, it would be okay if it was a student film. The plot follows a solitary artist who skates around Portland writing graffitti. He is accompanied by another and they walk together creating art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the dispute between them that is never really discussed because this film has as much dialogue as an image of Charlie Chaplin. This movie shows well that the artists of the street of gravity give their form well, and the music is good, but overall I would not say it's a movie.
