From time to time I come across a movie that is so embarrassingly bad that I wonder why there are movies. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody The Godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogs. Eddie Deezen is simply boring as Tony, an annoying idiot who, upon his father, asks Don (William Hickey), takes care of the family business. Tony, like I said, is a boring idiot. This makes the whole movie a complete mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's very caricatured. The main point I'm trying to make is that you can not do a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so much caricature. It does not work like that. Believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you do not take it seriously, it will look a lot like a parody. The thing about making a parody is that you may not look very much like you're doing a parody. You have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little seriously. It also seems like they're just mocking Woody Allen, and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible.
