I seem to be in the minority in this case, but I found that A True Thing was schmaltzy, artificial and generally unpleasant. Not that acting was that bad, but the characters seemed little more than archetypes (the bad dad, oh, but wait, maybe he's not hopelessly bad-maybe there might be a resolution at the end ...). I admit that the woman I was with loved the movie, so maybe you like it. But I did not.
