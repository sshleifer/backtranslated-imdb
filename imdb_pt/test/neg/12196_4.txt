I watched this movie with no idea what it was before. I was intrigued for the first whole hour. It was shaping up to be a big suspense. A very talented cast and a good dialogue. Then it all fell apart for me when I saw the first vampire. I could not believe my eyes. A great suspense was thrown into the toilet. The rest of the movie from that point was totally awful. <br /> <br /> I gave 4 stars to the brilliant start alone. I think it's kind of generous, but I was entertained for a while. I'm not a fan of vampire movies or zombies. If you are, then you may disagree with my opinion.
