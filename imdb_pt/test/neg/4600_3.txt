does not mean that this movie is good. I was very frustrated with this on many levels. is kind of the tip of the hat to bukowski. Hey, I read this guy in college - let's see what Matt Dillon does to him. and I like Matt Dillon. I thought he came close to looking a bit like Hank, but mostly just flushed cheeks. I have to worry about a character, and there's not much here to worry about. I think time may be cruel to the bukowski, and this bothers me a lot, because writing was solid in a kind of post-culture. difficult to sit, scenes that did not work, and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit. I ask very little, I have less.
