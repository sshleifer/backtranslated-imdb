Yes, it's your typical straight-to-video action movie. And of course they do their best to change a little, but fail miraculously. Snipes delivers its perfectly smooth performance that it always does. Colloca proves that you do not need any talent to star in a movie, but only sex appeal. The worst part is that it did not cover my basics of bad movies which are: 1? Cheap looking villains. 2 ?? Perfectly timed one-liners. 3 ??? Persecution of intense cars with massive explosions. 4 ??? The hero got the hot one. 5 ??? Crowds of naked or semi-naked women for no reason. Okay, so I lied, that covers everything, but it's horrible.
