I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when it came on A & E a few years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I took a chance because I liked these actresses. This has to be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I would not watch again and certainly would not spend money buying the video. The plot of this TV version is ridiculous and just plain stupid! The "kicker" comes when Ruth does surgery on the bones of the leg. This kind of nonsense belongs to the James Bond and Sci-Fi movies. If this version is true for the book then I will not be checking the book in my local library! The American version came out a few years after I saw this original. To my surprise, the Americans got it right this time, as their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is played for laughs and it's pretty funny. When played to laugh, the plot works.
