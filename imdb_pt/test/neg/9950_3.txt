The mad monster begins in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) as he perfects his discovery of how to turn a human into a vicious wolf as a monster, injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his idiot servant Petro (Glenn Strange), apparently he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department that will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! However, first things first, like Dr. Cameron, is aimed at a sweet revenge against people who rejected his experiments, forced him to renounce and subject him to public ridicule. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his monstrous creation to assassinate Professor Blaine (Robert Strange) in an unfortunate turnaround, Dr. Cameron is unable to control the beast and is seen by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden ) who spreads the news like a fire, in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) learns of the story and begins to investigate, he begins to suspect Dr. Cameron and since Gregory is dating his daughter Lenora Ann Nagel) He has many opportunities to sniff ... Directed by Sam Newfield, this is a low-budget material from the 1940s, and worse yet, it's a low-budget dull material. Fred Myton's script takes the extremely lean premise to almost 77 minutes, which is too long, there is no variety in the story and it's basically the same thing over and over. The character is a monotonous cliché, the mad scientist who conducts useless experiments that create a monster, the beautiful and fragile daughter, the reporter who interprets the hero and by pure coincidence both investigate the mysterious deaths, according to which the mad scientist is responsible. involved with his daughter, the idiot servant, stupid idiot cops and stereotypical shotguns wielding farmers who are always accused of being drunk. This was probably cliché even in 1942! The film is striding slowly and director Newfield can never maintain or generate much in terms of excitement or atmosphere, which is a bad thing. Technically, the movie is not great, obviously the budget was tiny and the crazy monster itself looks lame, remembering a homeless old man who has not shaved a few weeks ago and has a couple of plastic store fangs placed in his mouth. Black-and-white cinematography is as basic and static as most films of that period, while Dr. Cameron's lab consists of a sofa and a desk with a few heavy pieces of scientific equipment at the top. The acting is hard and wooden with Petro looking like he is hooked on the whole movie, Zucco as the mad scientist does not convince and is forgettable. The Mad Monster is a very lame horror movie, there is very little here to entertain, although at least I have managed to come to an end in a single session that, when I think about it, is an achievement in itself!
