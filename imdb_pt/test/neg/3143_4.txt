What should have been a dramatic tale about Murray River life turns out to be a silly and insipid novel about an English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Australian accent) who falls in love with first mate (John Waters) on a steamship. <br /> <br /> The first half of this four-and-a-half-hour mini-series is promising, but soon falls out of ideas when it becomes predictable and tenuous. Some real verve and spark was needed in the plot to give the movie some life. The premature departure of Gus Mercury did not help, since his character seemed to be the only interesting one. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longer version of the TV has more depth, because surely this translation in video. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
