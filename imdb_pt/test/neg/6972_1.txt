Let me tell you this about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work that I wish more people had. If we all had the optimism and hope of Ed Wood, the world would probably be a much better place. Knowing the story of Ed Wood and having seen the most wonderful biopic "Ed Wood" (1994) several times, I admire his daring and his efforts for the work he loved; I still admire his attitude of never saying "die." He had a love of driving that I wish more people in modern Hollywood had. <br /> <br /> But that does not make your movies more fun to watch. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most confessional film, is probably the worst. Glen or Glenda is a mortal cult film about a transvestite named Glen (played by director / writer Ed Wood himself) who, despite his love for his fiance Barbara (Dolores Fuller) seems to be unable to conquer his desire for transvestism, in which he dresses up as a woman and a wig and thus becomes ... Glenda! The story of Glen / Glenda is narrated by a doctor and he is also spoken and watched over by a mysterious character named "The Scientist", played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there's also a sub-story about a character from Alan / Anne who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, about whom this movie originally titled "I Changed My Sex!" was previously to be based. <br /> <br /> Have I lowered your jaw yet? Well, as much as I want to warn you of this photo if you have never seen it, I would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not a word of falsehood in the plot synopsis I just gave you. Everything is true. This is a movie about transvestites and transsexuals, a topic that does not look very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very attractive way. I'm sure that with a good script, and a good director (had neither) that "Glen or Glenda", despite the subject, could have been a very touching image. It is a confessional film from Wood, since he was a transvestite in real life and also on the screen. But again, that does not make it a good movie ... or an assiduous movie. "Glen or Glenda" is a disorderly and disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It makes no more sense than the notoriously silly scene in which Bela Lugosi shouts "Pull the rope!" most inexplicable footage of bison stampeding. Most of the film is narrated in a monotone voice, reminding me of a few informative short films I've seen before. It's as if one of those really bad short films has expanded in a long seventy minute and twice as bland. We sat there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to build energy with the camera being locked in a position for many tiresome minutes and long periods of time when nothing happens. The only worthwhile moments are those of Bela Lugosi, who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. I think Lugosi should be like the movie's deity, but personally, I could not care less about who or what he should be. I'll tell you what he was: a talented actor who ended up making trash. But he and Wood were very good friends and liked to work with each other, so good for him. <br /> <br /> I've always admired Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for cinema, but I never go. While alive, I admire his films. A film critic once called Ed Wood's films "innocent fun," but I think even this is questionable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is the Mount Everest of the film world, then "Glen or Glenda" is probably the Marian Trench.
