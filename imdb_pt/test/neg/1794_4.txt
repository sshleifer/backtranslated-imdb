Heart of Darkness was terrible. The novel was difficult enough to be understood, but when a producer decides to release a movie based on it, it spoils everyone. Not only did those responsible decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others, but the acting was horrible and the overall impression I had of the movie was that it was a total failure. I watched the movie hoping to understand the novel a little better, but it simply played me and my classmates completely out. I think the film was a waste of time, and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing movie, especially when he has such incredible films as Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs on his resume. Even with the very cool John Malkovich.
