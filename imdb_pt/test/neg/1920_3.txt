Rico vs. poor. Big City Vs. small town. White Collar Vs. blue collar These things are not original themes in movies. So when you choose to engage those themes, it's best if the story line is either very original or very good. This was neither. I never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie. Neither convincing nor convincing, he just fell on his face. Do not bother even with a video rental.
