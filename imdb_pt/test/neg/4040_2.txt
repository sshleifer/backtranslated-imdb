That's the same old crap that's spewed out by amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - maybe that's why it's a movie that wants to be straight into the video! <br /> <br /> I think it's my fault for spending money to see this (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What a waste. I usually like B movies, some of them are actually very good - but this is ridiculous and too stupid to even be funny. <br /> <br /> The losers who made this crap deserve to be put out of business by wasting everyone's time and money by making a movie that obviously does not even deserve to be in the movie! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely no talent! Stupid plot, horrible acting (especially the drag queens - what would the patient really find sexy ?!), Coxus (if there was even a script - it seems like the kind of beast someone just invented on the spot ) <br /> <br /> What is impressive about this movie is its complete lack of anything well made at all. <br /> <br /> How much attention to detail would be needed to ensure that every frame in a movie was so below any reasonable standard? I do not think it would be possible to make such a bad film intentionally, and it is inconceivable that bad luck can produce such consistently terrible results. <br /> <br /> Anyway, avoid this stink bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
