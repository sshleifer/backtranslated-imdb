George and Mildred are a really bland movie. This attempt to translate the hit TV series to the big screen was a bleak failure, as so often happens. <br /> <br /> The intelligence and clever phrases of TV shows have disappeared. The plot is a typical English farce of confusing characters and wrong identities, which is neither funny nor freaky enough to elicit a lot of decent laughs. <br /> <br /> George and Mildred's tough fans may want to see this final episode of the couple's departure (Mildred died of hepatitis before the movie was released), but others should invest their time wiser.
