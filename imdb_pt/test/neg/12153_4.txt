This movie did not excite me. While on holiday in Turkey, I noticed that I was playing in the local cinema and decided to take the opportunity to go see. The action sequences in the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags on during the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> One thing I did not follow is how Borte got the money to bribe the movie. The other thing I particularly did not like was the missing segment in Khan's life. It did not go into detail about how the thugs were able to find him and re-imprison him after he disappeared for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rate this movie as (4) because I liked the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating because the dialogue left me less than impressed ...
