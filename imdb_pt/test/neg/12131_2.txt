The usual things about JW: comic dialogues, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, bubblegum pop, overacting etc. Waters knows that he is capable of making a quality film, so he hides behind the mask of the "intentionally extravagant movie". -maker "-which supposedly makes him a special kind of" anti-artist. "But in the movie world, being an anti-talent is often confused with talent, which is exactly what Waters had hoped for - and eventually succeeded. <br /> <br /> We may have John Waters to blame for inspiring Baz Luhrman to make all those horrible, stupid turkeys. <br /> <br /> It's like a virus : a Waters creates five bad new directors, and then those five create more, and so on.Where will this end? With "Dancer In The Dark", can this bomb actually be overcome?
