I happened to see this movie this morning at TCM. Too bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the movie. The only highlight of the movie was watching young contest Rita Moreno, (23 years old) playing an Indian teenager love for an older man in his 50s. She reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), just a more innocent Lolita. She swings up and down like a tiny 1950s bopper, almost as if she expected it to be chewing gum, falling on that old man, willing to give her anything, while he pretends she's an obstacle to him . Any 50-year-old man who had a beautiful, virgin teenager ready to do anything for him and be his bride, it would be insane not to take advantage of her. It's a pity that the censorship when this movie was released would not allow the expansion of a character like Rita Moreno's. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is the appearance of Rita Moreno in the movie.
