This film clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: Never, never cross the border (whether physical or metaphorical). Let's avoid everything on the other side with a wall or a fence or anything else, let's pretend that all the "gringos" are evil, satanic or drug traffickers. Anything that is off the border of a country (and especially the US borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or anything else. The "fact-based" is just a perverse tag that can be fixed on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just help push the ideology of the film down into some naive throats. The perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people, and everything else into stereotyped black and white categories: Mexicans on filthy people, Mexican police on a bunch of corrupt cops, Republicans on right-wing imbeciles, Democrats on humanists almost hippies and so on. Is there anything good in the movie? I hardly think so, but it might be that you think differently.
