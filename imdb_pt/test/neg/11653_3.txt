Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie, it has its interesting moments. For one thing, it was filmed on location in Colorado (Breckinridge or Telluride? I do not remember, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely breathtaking and spectacular. It's beautiful, even to me, who lived in Colorado for several years. <br /> <br /> Next, it has Disney's penchant for wonderful character actors. Harry Morgan has never been in better shape than when he plays in a Disney movie. He is literally hysterical. Also, remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a "small part" in this movie, she is great as always. If you do not know who she is, think of the Disney animated version of Hunchback of Notre Dame (she was one of the gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun in "Sister Act" as well as the best nun in "The Trouble With Angels ". She has always been a great character actress and most of the character actors never get the recognition they deserve. <br /> <br /> In addition to the character actors and cast of stars, in the years 1960-70 Disney may not have had the "biggest" movies, but if you actually watch some of them from beginning to end, you you will notice that every movie has a very funny or hysterical moment in it.The whole movie may not be funny but there is always a comic (at least 1 or 2) in all the live-action movies that Disney has ever done Whether Harry Morgan in one of his high-pitched voices, or Tim Conway struggling, or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror, is all right.the whole movie may not be good but there are always hysterical moments in all the Disney films of that period that I have seen. Disney in that period has always managed to make a person smile, despite the stupidity of the film. Based on these comments, I do not agree with the viewers who say that all Disney movies in that time frame are terrible. But it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and ignore the weaknesses of the plots. <br /> <br /> Some Disney movies are true classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins). , but for those who are not, I am able to enjoy them for what they were - good clean family fun at a time when movies have become vulgar, coarse and offensive.
