Considering that the film was beautifully filmed and reasonably well represented, the script was monotonous. toiling and nothing we have not seen before. Not once in this movie did I get the feeling that these people were really in danger. No perceptible climax and a very normal resolution. I believe that this type of film was exaggerated and should be given a rest. After all, did not everyone on the planet see the "Schindler List"?
