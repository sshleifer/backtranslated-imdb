It is important to keep in mind the true meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a true story" when watching Pride. It's like "You can save up to 50%", which can literally be translated as "You can not save more than 50%". It all looks great until you realize that the bottom of "up to" is "zero." Likewise, "inspired by a true story" means that someone heard a story and that made them think of it. The only certainty is that the real story and the one you are about to see are not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There is a real Jim Ellis who started training the Philadelphia Recreation Department swimming team in the early 1970s, but I get the feeling that the real Jim Ellis should not have been able to hide some feelings of disappointment with how the movie ended. Clearly, he takes wild liberties with his life story, and I just imagine him responding to the strange looks of his friends who wonder why the movie is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, one thing he will certainly be proud of is that he is played by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who starred alongside Bernie Mac, who despite the lack of a story original and powerful, still gives a sincere and moving feeling. performance. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in Philadelphia in the 1970s, a time and place where racism was the norm, not the exception, and the educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also an excellent swimmer, is having trouble finding a worth teaching position, until finally relegated to a crumbling recreational center, which he is assigned the task of cleaning up before his demolition. We can certainly understand your sense of depreciation. <br /> <br /> When we meet for the first time Elston, the maintenance man (Bernie Mac), he is a disillusioned idiot who sits in his office surrounded by piles of trash that touch the ceiling and watching daytime TV in an old dusty television set. Needless to say, when Jim appears to begin cleaning the spot and cleaning it, Elston is not exactly friendly with it. He knew that his recreation center was being closed down and all his anger about it was transferred to Jim. Given his past as a college swimmer, Jim takes a special interest in the pool, which he cleans, fills and brings to perfection. A group of black teenagers who play basketball outside the recreation center are interested in the pool when the basketball hoop is removed and the heat continues to stifle, and soon the group has a swimming team under development as they enter the whole city swim meet Calling them underdogs, of course, would be a kind of euphemism. They are disorganized, unprofessional, under-trained and have no idea how to behave in a swimming encounter. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, of course. The film is your sports history pattern, so the first sports presentation is totally unimportant, plus a learning experience, a catalyst to conduct your training much harder and more focused that will lead to the final athletic ride, what subjects. So far, the only thing a sports movie has to do is that the protagonist (s) do not have to win at the climax of the movie, we just have to understand the meaning and meaning of their effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has all the character development of an old Seagal movie. The good guys are the good guys, 'cause they should be, and the bad guys are the ugly white swimmers who laugh, sneer, and make racist jokes on our team. Oh, and there's a scene where one of the white guys kicks one of the black guys underwater while in the middle of a run. I did not know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like that, but you have the idea of ​​how deep the character's development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is the group of boys that Jim Ellis has become. of kids going out on the streets doing nothing with their lives and in an organized and competitive team of swimmers, but other than that we really do not know anything about who they are. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real statements the film makes is that effort and organization lead to success and racism. Both are so obvious that when a movie is made with them, it ends up feeling empty and unnecessary. Racism was much more powerful in the United States in the 1970s, and it seems like a huge loss that the film dealt directly with that, but said nothing about it. It's a kind of feel-good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much you should have said is much bigger than what was said, the feeling of well-being turns into a sad disappointment.
