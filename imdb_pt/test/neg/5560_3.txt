This is a stupid movie. Like many of these karate movies, it's poorly written, awkward, and sometimes stupid. The action is not really there and the movie leaves a lot to be desired. Everyone here is talking, doing bad karate and doing a very bad acting job. Watch out for Scatman Crothers in a small role, he's too good for this movie overall. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he is a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is very bad. All of them are, there are so many parts to this movie that they make absolutely no sense. The supposed love / fleeing scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? They destroyed that man's guitar for no reason! <br /> <br /> And then there were the obligatory girls on trampolines !!! Now what was that? They were in the movie for five seconds, so you never heard of them again !!! Then there is the whole racially charged element of the movie, which is cool and all, but in this movie there is absolutely no place at all. Like I said, this is good for a laugh once, but I do not watch it again.
