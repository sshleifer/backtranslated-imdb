Fear and Desire is especially of interest to Kubrick's obsessive, who can capture this pretentious trap by signs of his greatness yet to come. Kubrick was right in trying to make sure the movie was not being shown or available on legitimate video. He considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his assessment. This is a weak and tedious film - at 68 minutes it still looks more like "Barry Lyndon"! - however, it is of historical interest, and has its genuine moments of absorption. It's a hard-to-find movie (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), although perhaps this could change if Kubrick's property is compromised and released on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.
