THE MAN SKELETON was OK for the first 5 minutes but as soon as the so-called "Special Force Agents" hit the screen, he descended faster than a fat kid on a sleigh. <br /> <br /> The opening makes we think we can have a playful and fun horror movie in our hands, but no ... the filmmakers ruin any hope when the "Special Force Agents" show up. I wish the writer would go a different way and make the "Skeleton Man" chase after some stupid teenagers until one of them finally wins. Instead, the "Skeleton Man" pursues some "special agents of the Force" and expels them until his Captain finally has the upper hand. <br /> <br /> I know all the "persecution of stupid teenagers for a killer." "something like it was done before, but would be more suitable for a movie like this." When the "skeleton man" finally finds his "dead" end, in a building that explodes, the captain of the "Special Force Agents" is questioned by a police officer outside the building: "What the hell happened there?" My answer to that question: "Who cares?"
