This movie is about a mysterious love letter that turned the love life of 4 people upside down. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is interesting, and the film could have been funny. However, this movie is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. Characters are introduced improperly in the beginning, so it gets very confusing. Support characters come and go without proper reasons, as if they existed only for one particular scene and then disappeared into thin air. The pace is terribly slow, makes 90 minutes look more than 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It could have been romantic and funny, but this movie did not make it either.
