If you, dear readers, have never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy, The Man. This comedy action comedy from the 80s combines pairs of stubble Billy Crystal and the late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines, together as spirited city cops who do not follow the rules. This is basically the extension of the film. Interest is somewhat affected by the delivery of the Hines line, which is frighteningly similar to Will Smith's and by appearances from now-famous actors such as Joe Pantoliano of Memento and Jimmy Smits of NYPD Blue. My favorite scene is, I do not know, the pursuit of cars on the rails, I guess. Basically, I just see this movie as a great help in demolishing action movies. Well, that's the lethal weapon 4 ... and the rush hour 2 ... and the man ...
