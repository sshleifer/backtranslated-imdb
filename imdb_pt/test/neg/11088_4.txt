It's hard to write 10 lines of copy on this movie noir. There is simply not much to say about it. It is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and I have a considerable amount of noirs. <br /> <br /> Paul Henreid plays a tough guy here. He's not one I'd think to play that kind of role in, but he's okay with it. He's a great actor, anyway. <br /> <br /> Everything, including cinematography, is good, but not memorable. One thing that stood out: the abrupt end. That was a surprise. It was also a surprise to see this under the title "Hollow Triumph". I've never seen the movie called that. It has always been called "Scar". <br /> <br /> If you read about a "tense film noir", etc., do not believe it. "Tense" is not an accurate adjective for this movie.
