Although a fan of shock and gore, I found this movie disappointing to say the least. The effects and work of puppets were impressive, yes, and the mood was timely, but ... something was missing. You see, the first act of the film is spent sketching the character of Jack Brooks, despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggressiveness is delivered within minutes of the first title cards. As for the narration and many of the flashbacks: unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The rhythm during the second act was tedious. Most are focused on Freddy Krueger eating, then vomiting, then eating some more, then waving his arms and saying something grumpy or rude. All the while, the schlock is punctuated with brief scenes of Jack discussing his fury problems with a therapist. (Definitely the fun scenes in the movie - great dialogue that are worth a lot of laughs.) Then, without warning, Jack decides to kill some monsters. And then it was over. <br /> <br /> Altogether, like a return to the horror films of the 1980s, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has a lot of potential but is purposeless and moves on without conflict or resolution. <br /> <br /> I hope these questions are addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack Vs. Ash to go into production.
