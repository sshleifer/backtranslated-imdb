I lived next door to the author in 1980 when he moved to Portland from Downer Grove, Illinois, with two of his high school classmates. He looked normal enough, though he had many artistic pretensions. In a few years, he jumped on the Portland post-punk scene with his friend Phil and a few others, and a band that definitely was not going anywhere, although it did get a lot of action, including an affair with Courtney Love on it. Portland groupie days. He seemed to think his musical outlook was good enough to move to San Francisco, then N.Y.C. I was surprised to learn that he got a publishing deal in '95 after the band crashed and burned. Courtney Love's name seemed to be the decisive argument. I have no idea how the film came about, especially with this cast, but I doubt that Gus Van Sant was involved. Anyway, the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so I would just say that this is the work of a pretty smart guy who wants to be a writer, or artist or something, but not I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without benzedrine.
