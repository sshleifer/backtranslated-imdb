This may contain *** SPOILERS *** Where to start in this empty vacant lot? Well, it would have been nice if they had a plan. Talent acting, decent dialogue, suspense, humor, and even free sex would have helped this movie. Unfortunately, there was just too much blood, (even if it was not well done), firing automatic weapons and missing. <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no reason to attach the basic premise, a cursed Native American Protect the bodies of the tribe he murdered, with him being tracked down by a Federal Special Ops team who dressed in civility (?) . Most of the time it involved breaking one of the basic rules of conduct in a horror movie, separating yourself from the group so you could get caught one by one. You think this team would know better, especially since they are actually the third team sent to investigate, the other two teams disappearing without a trace. When they finally realize they are being caught, they make one of several bleachers and fire their weapons just to hit the trees. Tree shooting scene repeats indefinitely in this movie to save money. <br /> <br /> When they are not photographing trees, they are following this spirit that leaves no trace (who knows how they are tracking). very gushing BS male. By the way, did I mention that most of this team is women? Interesting to hear them speak harshly. Not much fun, but interesting. <br /> <br /> In all, you can find better movies in the Kmart bin.
