This movie was terrible. It's not something people should pay to see. It seems that some Christian group has managed to convert people. I do not understand why it was released in theaters and not on TV. It started out as a science fiction movie from the 1950s, but it quickly changed. About 30 minutes after the movie, the characters begin talking about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" He quickly moves into the territory of pure religion. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to a science fiction movie. The film has bad acting; bad camera angles and are amateurs. <br /> <br /> AVOID!
