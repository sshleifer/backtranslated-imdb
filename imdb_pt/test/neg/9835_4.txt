The Girl in Lovers Lane is a weird low budget movie. On the surface, the film tells the story of a tough guy named Bix (Brett Halsey), who spends his time looking at a young man named Danny (Lowell Brown) and the girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows) look at it. Nothing very interesting happens (Bix goes out with Carrie, Bix leaves Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go to the movie when Carrie is murdered. His father blames Bix, pulls him out of a cell and almost beats him to death. Now his roles are reversed and Danny has to save Bix. Until I read the reviews on IMDb, I thought maybe it was just me reading more about Bix and Danny's relationship than it really was there, but I see now that I'm not alone. It was obvious to me from the start that Bix and Danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a 1959 movie. The homosexual nature of their relationship, though never overtly expressed, is still quite obvious. His arrangements of life and sleep, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to commit to Carrie, and the phone call at the end when Danny tells his parents that he is "bringing home a friend "are some examples of moments until the inevitable conclusion that there is more to your relationship than you initially see: I'm sure they do exist, but I can not think of any movies I've seen from the 50's and scream so high homosexual How much. <br /> As for the movie, I do not know any other way to put it ?? it's boring. As I wrote earlier, nothing happens in 90% of the runtime. and the actors are not good enough to give a big spark to The Girl in Lovers Lane. The only exception is Jack Elam. Your crazy Jesse is the only character interesting enough to be worth watching. Elam was creepy! The biggest problem I had with the movie was with the character's motivation and logic. d and Bix is ​​immediately guilty? And what about the crazy Jesse who's been chasing Carrie most likely all his life? Anyone think about asking Jesse where he was that night? His father saw him bother Carrie in the restaurant, but does he ever think the malicious Jesse might have something to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic there. What about Jesse's confession? Danny grabs Jesse by the lapel and that's all it takes to force a confession out of Jesse? True tough guy, right? Why would he confess so easily? And after he confesses, no one thinks about grabbing him? It's very good of Jesse to stand still and not run away. In any other reality, he would never have poured out his courage and would have run like a rabbit had he been accused of murder. The fact that The Girl in Lovers Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions by the characters is something I'm not willing to do. Overall, I'm giving The Girl in Lovers Lane a 4/10.
