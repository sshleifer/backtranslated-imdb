It's been a long time since I've been in such a boring and boring movie like this. It's one thing to have a slow pace where the characters are being developed progressively, or some aspect of the movie is clearly enhanced by that pace (like "Lost in Translation"). However, there is a difference between slow progression and total stagnation, as it happened in this one. I think from the look on Helen Mirren's face she must have been disturbed by the disappearance of her husband !! Surprise, surprise! What a wonderfully creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was (sarcasm) And what a great way that the whole story was undone in the end, truly a masterpiece.
