Once again, Woody Allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than to recycle himself. Here we have a fictional documentary (like Zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 1930s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) about a low life (Deconstructing Harry) who believes that being a genius exempts him from being an idiot (idem). Given this movie and deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his own actions with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; Yes, I was an idiot, but I'm a genius, so you gotta love me. <br /> <br /> Allen has only produced two good movies in the last ten years; the good but overvalued Bullets Over Broadway, and the excellent but widely overlooked Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from trifles (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite) to bold but experimental (Husbands and Wives) to pure drek (Alice, Mall Scenes, Shadows and Mist, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry). His films do not even try to have a narrative arc, and his humor seems to be ironically fun, not funny. After deconstructing Harry, I stopped seeing his movies in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I can stop renting them too.
