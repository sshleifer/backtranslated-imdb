Horrible acting with the worst f / x special I've ever witnessed too. It's bad enough to waste $ 3 to watch this crap, but it's the hour and a half I lost, I could be doing something else, like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty. Getting drunk could not even help in this video. <br /> <br /> To be blunt, I honestly believe that I really missed some IQ points during the course of watching this stupid work of numbing "work"! Maybe I should have taken my own advice this time. Never expect a decent movie if it's written, directed and produced by the same person, and never expects anything of value from Jeff Fahey.
