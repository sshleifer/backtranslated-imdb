"Atoll K" aka "Utopia" is one of Hollywood's saddest swan songs. Filmed in France, "The Land That Loves Lewis (Jerry)" in 1950, and released the following year, after a five-year layoff, the boys are in a truly physically terrible situation. However, they are not as bad as the script. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the funniest "comedies" ever filmed. <br /> <br /> It is painful to see this legendary team, the funniest duo in movie history, the couple who made "The Brother of the Devil" (1933), "The Music Box" (1932), " His troubles "(also 1932)," Babes In Toyland "(1934)," Bonnie Scotland "(1935)," Flying Deuces "(1939) and many other classic comedies, as in a movie like this. <Br /> <br /> But fighters and ball players do this all the time. They get in the game a season or a fight too. In this case, while it is morbidly fascinating to see Laurel & Hardy at this late stage of their legendary careers, they too have stayed there too.
