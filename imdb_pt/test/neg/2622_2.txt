I watched the first episodes a while ago and felt I could not take it anymore. The horrible fight scenes are the worst I've ever seen in my life. About a third of each episode is dedicated to Flash Gordon and his "powerful" fighting moves. I know the fight choreography of that era is not exactly like today's standards, but that's ridiculous. They do not even try to make it look realistic. Flash Gordon, who hardly looks like a fighter, uses his slow drunken movements and bare fist to knock down four or five guys with knives, weapons and other weapons. Give me some time! There is also a scene in which he does a similar act while standing in the water. Basically, each episode has scenes similar to that. As for the rest of the episode, there is not much else I can remember. I basically saw this out of curiosity about what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
