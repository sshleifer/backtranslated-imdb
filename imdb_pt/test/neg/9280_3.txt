The third and final giant screen of the very popular sitcom of the early '70s, HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is as resilient and rude as the two previous efforts, and watching from a point of view three and a half decades later, it is really incomprehensible that even one film has been produced in this franchise. What constitutes the plot involves the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and his confused and autocratic Inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) after their regular job bus terminal. They all find work in similar positions at a camping holiday with Stan's family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen and Michael Robbins) after the same. British cinema had a well-deserved and considerable reputation of high quality in the 1960s, but much of it was due to American financial support and guidance that sadly came to an end when the 1970s dawned. followed by notable local titles (GET CARTER being the very few exc eptions) became as rare as Mick Jagger in a stable marriage, and British cinema got in the way of low budgets, bland and bland sexual comedies and versions of various types of TV, mainly sitcoms (this being one of many heinous examples). Only DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE were reasonably respectable in this respect, the peculiar success of the first film ON THE BUSES (it was the biggest box office success of its year in 1971, To be fair, the TV series itself had a vulgarity gay, mature, non-PC, which was reasonably tolerable in the sitcoms half-serial format. But it is so difficult for HAMMER FILMS to produce this effort, since it almost resembles a horror film in the literal sense, with <br /> <br /> A chance to send the cheesine <br /> <br /> The British holiday camp is totally wasted here in favor of the above elements, and it is more bizarre , if not horrible, to see the obvious Varney in his mid-fifties, and Grant with long nose and long teeth can instantly enthrall young women in their early twenties while constantly laughing of their own bravado and jokes. The presence of Wilfrid Brambell (from STEPTOE AND SON) dating old Miss Hare does not help either, and even if the film lasts about 1 1/2 hours, it creeps to an endlessly depressing degree. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this was the last film in this movie trilogy, and the TV series came to an end at the same time, with a sequel (DO NOT DRINK WATER, which was brutally attacked by critics and ignored by the public ) after 1975. Most of the key actors involved were not seen much later, but the most affected was Bob Grant. other mental problems for many years, he suicide in 2003. A sad coda for a sitcom that was the most popular of his era (she did not age very well as well), and should have stayed that way, instead of the three big screen hybrids with financial success, but artistically hopeless, that diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of his TV counterpart. <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION: 2 and a half in 10.
