This movie did not even deserve a 1/10 This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear at least 30 minutes of the movie were DELIBERETLY copied from Carnosaur 1, 2, and 3. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole "Raptor" movie was based on the movie and this was actually a pathetic attempt to be a copy " Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur ". I loved this series of movies and watching it being put into a movie that I can not even pay COPIE without doing there own models is what America is coming up with. I recommend you watch the movie Carnosaur FIRST (all of them) and then watch this and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
