no way out 2007 was a bad situation and if it is the way to wrestlemania they choose the wrong way. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit and the sturdy boys defend MVP & Minn: in my opinion, this was the best combination of the night some good wrestling here but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Heavyweight championship open (which chavo Guerrero won): lousy, no flying high, very fast and annoying. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Little bastard & Finlay play the bogeyman and the bogeyman: this was more comedy than wrestling, a few laughs. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Kane def booker king: a decent effort by these two, but they could do better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> wwe tag team championship Paul London and Brian Kendrick defend the draw and dominate: another boring game with no big wins for the champions. 4 / world title ecw Mr. Kennedy def bobby lashley (disqualification): in my head the worst match of the night. Really horrible.I thought ecw was no rules, I was wrong 2/10 <br /> <br /> John Cena & Shawn Michaels def Batista and the undertaker: an okay game but could have been a lot better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Overall, this was bulls * It gives a 3/10
