What a terrible movie! It perfectly represents the degenerating state of French society, where the most elementary respect for healthy values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The plot is nonsensical, the film is not funny at all and the characters are completely superficial and uninteresting. To say the least, the direction and cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is as bad an actress as she ever was, even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the normally good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity, superficiality and restlessness. I can not help but draw a parallel with James Ivory's wonderful "Le Divorce", with its thoughtful portrayal of French and American customs, its superlative cinematography, and its star cast. Having watched "Le Divorce" you can feel a kind of empathy with the French, regardless of their weaknesses. "Belle-Maman" leaves you with only a contempt nauseated by its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists.
