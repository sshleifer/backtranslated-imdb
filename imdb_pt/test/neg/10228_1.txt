HOW MANY MOVIES ARE GOING TO BE WHAT AGAINST ALL ODDS, A RAGTAG BEATS TEAM THE GREAT GUYS WITH ALL THE MONEY? !!!!!!!! There's nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want them to lose. Steve Guttenberg used to have such a good resume ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, oh why, did he have to do this kind of movie during the 90s and beyond? So, avoid this movie. There are a lot of good movies out there so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this crap. Obviously, the "green" in their minds was money because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some clever movies with Pixar.
