The clever marketeer is him, Jess Franco of course also profited from the huge temporary success of psychedelic espionage films like the sensational "Danger: Diabolik!" By Mario Bava. Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he could freely insert both sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque twists as he wished. And he got it partially understood as well, since "The Girl from Rio" revolves around a man-hating organization led by a lesbo dressed in funk clothes that turns all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (at least for them), diabolical plans conflict with the daily affairs of a feared crime syndicate chief, played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well presented, but this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure film. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, as the action is rather meek. The film is also very colorful ... but not very bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There is a bit of nudity, of course, but very few according to the normal standards of Franco. All the characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or expected) were more perverted tones or frenetic themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and I must say that he spends that money well on more compelling and talented cast members. Particularly veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psicomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Too bad he can not save "The Girl from Rio" to be a big disappointment. A legendary Euro-smut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
