First I have to say that I really love Udo Kier and always had respect for Armand Assante, but nothing could save this disaster from a movie. Udo does not appear until much later in the movie and the acting of all is simply terrible. The script is everywhere, the dialogue is wooden, the "action" is laughable and the plot can be summed up in a dirty cocktail napkin. I really wanted to find something redeemer in this movie, but I found myself holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating to myself more and more: "Oh Udo ..... why ??? .... Because ?? ??? .. ". If you are a fan of Udo or Armand, please do not watch this movie. This will only make you sad for them.
