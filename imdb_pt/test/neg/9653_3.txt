First of all, let me say that I do not deny in any way the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. I am Polish and I am aware of the Katyn massacre for a long time (actually, two of my relatives died there), so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is the script, which includes many subframes and characters, none of which is developed properly. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack general meaning. In my opinion, the cast has no chance to show their ability. The exception is Andrzej Chyra, portraying Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wanted the story to be more focused on him. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film has no emotion. Before I saw it, I thought I would be moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but actually I was watching with a strange sense of detachment, except for the final scene of execution. It is well done and its placement is interesting and provides a climactic end, although the idea of ​​the Lord's Prayer is recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit forced. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I suppose. the film may have some educational value to those who are not familiar with the historical events portrayed, but in my opinion it fails as a movie.
