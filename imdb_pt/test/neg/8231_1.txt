This movie was so horrible that I can not even describe it. I was amazed to have even sat on this pile of garbage. I could not believe a movie like this was even thought of. It was about a serial killer who cluck like a chicken. He did not just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through the whole movie. He even beats his arms like a chicken that is even more stupid than anything I've ever seen. I could not believe this came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early 80's or something. So the daughter is not very smart because she was protecting the nerd or the chicken man. The end just gets worse and it's the worst final I've ever seen. This movie is just chicken s ** t. I was laughing more than I was scared and I strongly suggest going out and grabbing a bucket of fried chicken instead of watching this movie.
