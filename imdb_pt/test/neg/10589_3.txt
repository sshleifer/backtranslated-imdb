This is a bad attempt to spin the old wire "cons turns well", which we have seen so many times before. This really reminded me of the American series 'The Players', though not nearly as good. Omar Epps is totally unconvincing as the tough man of the group, as is Ribisi, who is the attempt to be the funny guy gets lost along the way. The performance of the Danes was decent, and you can see from this performance, why it was escalated to Terminator 4. <br /> <br /> The MOD Squad is a movie that sits in a gray area amid suspense and comedy. Sometimes he takes himself seriously, but at other times tries to be humorous, but fails miserably. The film has a half-finished feel - as if stretched up to 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed.
