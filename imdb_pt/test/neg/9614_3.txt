Not even 'minor' Hitch, but simply a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in every way: unimaginative script, static point of view, putrid clothes, horrible hair, unpleasant actors and a truly gratuitous scene of rape and rape. The director's perverse sense of humor is present, but not consistently applied; the film comes to life only in its cruelty. Women do especially badly; 'Frenesi' could be used as proof that the director was a misogynist, although a better explanation to me is that perhaps beginning with his TV series and 'Psycho' - which he himself described as an exercise in economics, an experience to see The crew could launch an acceptable resource - Alfred Hitchcock had practically abandoned art and settled down to commerce. In "Frenzy", the great master seems to be bowing to conventions, trying to keep up with the times and giving the audience what he thinks they want - in the form of nasty nudity, nudging winks and general nastiness. I do not envy an old man his rest, but I do not want to remember him tired, lazy and favored - time to watch 'Vertigo' again!
