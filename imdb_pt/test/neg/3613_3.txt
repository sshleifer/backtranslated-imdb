I'm not going to vote for this movie as a horrible movie, mainly because I like it, I was one of those summer days I was so lame to do anything and decided to rent a movie in the stupid section of the videostore. Also, I did not sleep the night before and the movie woke me up ... Let's start the autopsy, OK, the movie has a weird plot, first it's isolation, there's an expedition, they get isolated on an island. because there is no gas in the boat, something like this, there is not a single convincing performance on the part of the actors (so far), the main problem begins after the idea of ​​isolation, the POV of a snake, then another, so false phantoms, many of them, and when we believe that the movie is going in a good way for an abc keep the suspense it fails, because after ten or eleven ghosts we are not taken The only scene that unmistifies everything is the scene when we watch a drunken lesbian show watched by snakes who seem to dance, after that it is becoming not a horror adventure, but a comedy-driven film, the adventure part is discarded as well. For me, the problem in a movie is the third act, it's the only section that just directs the movie to a foregone conclusion, or if it succeeds, we do not notice it, like a ninja smoke in our eyes, well ... The snake island has a bad conclusion, everything comes to a "by the book" ending, with a sequence of pursuit, pursuit and escape, was predictable at the time I rented the copy of the dam. The other real problem is concept, concept is very important, is the reason you believe in dinosaurs gaining life or a corpse full of points that just want to live, the main concept about snakes who want revenge after decades of torture by the human being civilization, well ... hmmm, just do not glue on the wall. One thing you will like (if you watch with an open mind) is the most bz sequences, naked lesbian girls, some amateur camera angles, braindead homage to the lawn mower, the black guy does not die first, and this is everything ... if you want to see snakes, black guys and comedies and prefer to see bigger budgets, see "snakes on a plane". <br /> <br /> Viewers Up
