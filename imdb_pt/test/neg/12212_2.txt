The King of James Marsh is a movie that mystifies me. I can not think what it meant to be. It is a story about a young man named Elvis played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who receives an honorable discharge after 3 years of service in the Navy and then goes out to meet his biological father and behaves dishonorably with him and his family. It's all very sick really. Elvis infiltrates the family seducing his 16-year-old sister, Malerie (Pell James). It's quite impossible to identify with anyone in this movie from the middle of England. Father Preacher and Joyful Christian Congregation; I could not figure out if the movie is meant to ridicule them for their irrational beliefs. Or the target is the happy family and we should think that this is unfeasible. Or it is just to say that some people are lost and only devote themselves to destruction. It is superficial. We all know that bad things happen; the interesting thing is why, but this film portrays violence gratuitously without ever unraveling the thought that led to it. "The King" is a missed opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; the warrior's code; the changeable concepts of value; homicides of honor in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this film adds nothing to the notion. However, Paul the Projectionist did more than his meager paper suggests. The DVD projector showed all the movies in a green tint and the only way to fix it was to send it to Belgium. He did it at Christmas. I think the post workers and repairers and Paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this grim movie. But can you see it differently?
