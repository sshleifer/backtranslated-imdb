Following a friend's recommendation and my admiration for Philip Baker Hall, I rented the first season's Loop record. It's a typical TV comedy with all the cliches that the genre employs with the sulky sulky brother, "ditzy." (Lizzy), token unrequited love interest (Piper), Asian sarcastic helper (Darcy, who reminded me of Arliss, as if someone needed to be reminded of that show). The plot deals with several bad luck (usually by Sully) that falls on Sam, who puts his work on the plane in danger, just so he saves the day, with "hilarious jokes" that follow in the middle. I did not describe a certain episode. I have described all of them for a T. There lies the problem as what seems to be passable entertainment at the beginning only gets uselessly spent watching episodes in a row and growing bored beyond belief in endless repetition. Sully will do something "crazy", Mimi Rogers will say something downright sexual, Russ will say about her gay son, Darcy will do her imitation of Sandra Oh on Arliss blah blah blah blah. The only plus point is the lack of an annoying hint of laughter. But do not let that fool you into thinking it's good. Go attend a much better comedy. Arrested Development, Always Sunny at Phillidelphia, two names on top of my head. Surprised that this is still in the air. Oh, it's true Fox just cancels the good shows, I forgot. Needless to say, I no longer trust my friend's taste at shows. <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
