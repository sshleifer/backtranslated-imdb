There are many reasons why I'm not a fan of fact-based movies, but more than any other is how filmmakers give themselves creative permission over history. If they have great imaginations, why not use that talent to do something original? Otherwise, keep the facts. This could have been a good movie if they had done just that. Ed Gein was an insanely scary human being. It was said that if you took Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface, you'd get them involved in one person, Ed Gein would still be sicker. So why can not someone make a movie about it that can convey that? When will they find out that reality is more frightening than fiction? <br /> <br /> I read books and watched news programs on it and now I'm not a screenwriter or something but I believe there is enough documentation about Gein that it does not take much to write a story about all these atrocities committed without creating murders that had never been documented. I am aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders, but with all the evidence found in his house and barn, there should have been many other ways to put together this film instead of using the vice's relationship with his mother, and girlfriend as I think what I'm wondering is this ... because at the end of the movie I know more about the supporting characters than about Ed Gein? ? Why did not we know his mother, father and brother and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath he was ... what abuse did he suffer as a child that may have contributed to the man he became? Instead, the only thing we had from his childhood was flashes of him as a little boy ... running. <br /> <br /> In the end, I give 4/10 stars. That's 2 for blood and 2 for Kane Hodder. Even though it was a bad cast in my opinion, considering that Gein was a small, and possibly effeminate man, and Hodder is anything but small and not at all what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.
