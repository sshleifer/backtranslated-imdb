I think I watched a highly edited version because it was not as graphic as I'd hoped - based on the other comments I heard. In addition to 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. the main character being a sexually free spirit, and 3. being set in the exotic place of Asia, "Laure" does not have the same talent as its predecessor. I've just found this movie very full of philosophical themes that I'm not really interested in, namely the open, voyeuristic relationship between Laure and Nick, "I'm happy with what brings you pleasure" ... something like that. I can not relate to this mentality and the film / characters really do not shed any light. <br /> <br /> The second half about finding the Mara tribe seemed to be a completely separate movie. One that I did not like. At that time, I was just hoping that this would turn into pornography, so that at least it would keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just did not understand. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it like this.
