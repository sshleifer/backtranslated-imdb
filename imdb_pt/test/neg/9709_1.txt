This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen was alive she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's romance is just superficially a development story of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It's also a commentary on Regency Britain's class structure. This film focuses only on the love story, thus disappointing viewers who hoped to do justice to the novel. <br /> <br /> There are numerous problems with the historical precision of the film. In the film, the dance in which Darcy Elizabeth is not the refined dance made by the nobility, to which belong the families Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy, but the dance of the lower classes. The nobility would not be dancing as if in a peasant dance. There are also problems with clothes and hair. The custom of the period required married women to wear white cloth hats to cover their hair and women wear hoods outdoors. The women of the Regency period were not so liberated as to renounce the demands of the hood in public. The worst historical inaccuracy is the morning meeting of Elizabeth (in her nightgown and coat) and Mr. Darcy (sans cravat and waistcoat) in which they admit their love for each other. This is an unforgivable freedom with romance. No respectable young man or gentleman would venture out in such a state of nakedness or seek to meet someone of the opposite sex so soon. <br /> <br /> But the worst of all with this movie is the confusion of Austen's dialogue and the atrocious modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue needs no assistance from a writer who thinks he can write like Austen. The writer of the non-Austen dialogue not only lacks the talents of Austen, but also does not feel the style of Austen. The juxtaposition of the two styles is shocking. <br /> <br /> As for acting, the best is done by Judi Dench, who clearly understands the imperiousness of the aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties in making Mrs. Bennet less horrible than Austen's portrait. Your picture is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland is miscast. His Affected British accent is terrible and he portrays Bennet as the father of the 20th century and not as father of the late eighteenth century. Darcy's portrait of Matthew MacFadeyn is flat. I can not imagine anyone falling in love with your Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightly is a beautiful Elizabeth, but her portrait of Elizabeth Bennet is too modern. Knightly focuses on Elizabeth's frankness, but her portrait does not have a full understanding of the customs and social conventions of the time. She would have done well in actually reading the novel before attempting to portray Elizabeth and doing research on the behavior of women of the period. <br /> <br /> If someone is making a period film, one must be faithful to the film. period. This film needed a historical consultant who really knew something about the Regency period. I also needed a writer who had a better appreciation and understanding of Austen's text. I can only hope that Emma Thompson decides to make a Pride and Prejudice movie in the near future to erase this abomination from our minds. <br /> <br /> The best thing that can be said about this movie is that it contains many beautiful scenes from the English countryside. Chatsworth is well used as Pemberly (as it was in the 1995 BBC adaptation). But beautiful scenes and beautiful actors can not save this movie. True Austen fans will run home to watch their 1995 BBC production DVDs with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth or to read Austen's text in order to erase that version of their minds.
