Ken Russell directed this strange (not very) erotic thriller and if I did not know I would have bet on my life that the director was Brian DePalma. Absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams DePalma, from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too much, to the domestic story that turns into a stalk and slash plot, even the title this screams "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" , since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor man, Hitchcock, over the years, Russell should have tried to imitate a style of his own. Of course an erotic suspense in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been bizarre with a capital B, but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience. Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being chased by a religious maniac were a very common sight in the 1980s video market. Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he did in the '80s. Yawning <br /> <br /> The only thing about any real note for CRIMES OF PASSION is the controversy it caused. I think the studio was the happiest person to hear this, since advertising is not bad publicity, but as for the controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes? There is none, and the only controversy I can think of is China Blue dominating a police officer on duty with a baton. Needless to say, he did not come in peace HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
