As a physicist, talking about blackholes and cosmology makes my heart soar. However, I found this presentation very slow and did not have enough information for the concerned layperson (who is more likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of thing, go to the library and check out some books. You will discover that they explain the current scientific cosmologies in much more detail, while at the same time you feel more amazed than this movie does. Also to clarify things: Hawking is NOT considered the "biggest mind" or the "most intelligent person" in the world, as commonly stated, even among the user reviews here on IMDb. Hawking himself commented that "it's bullshit, it's just a media advertisement, they needed someone to fill the model of the disabled genius, at least I'm deficient." To be fair, he is probably a genius, but among the greatest scientists in history, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many others are easily more respected. This is not to disrespect Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but rather does not disrespect others who have done more than he. Anyway, watch the movie if you're really connected to science. But if not, I think it would be annoying for you.
