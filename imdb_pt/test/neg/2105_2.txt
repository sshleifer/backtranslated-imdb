I'd probably like to give this movie a zero if it were not for the climax, which involves not really Snakes on a Train, but Train IN to Snake. The premise was prepared far more than likely over a night of beer after hearing about Snakes on a Plane in production (this was actually released to coincide with the release of the movie). The joke is probably not lost on those who will seek it; I do not believe there is a soul out there who regards it as a serious effort of action and suspense (unless it is on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought). It is about a Mayan curse placed on a woman who is cursed by her family for having gone away with another man, and is soon seen disgusted and coughing with green mud tied, of course, snakes. She and her boyfriend travel by train to Los Angeles, and soon after the characters more than cliches are abreast of snakes taking the train - with the originating woman becoming a snake. <br /> <br /> It would be worth to list more about the movie than I would, but there is not enough time during the day. All that can be said for the quality factor is that it is almost existent; There are short films for students with larger budgets. Perhaps this was a wise calculation at the end of the filmmakers, that there would be so many copies sold, just for the joke factor, that they reprized their budget on the first weekend. Because by looking at the scenarios (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene!), The actors (if you can call them that, with just another actor - the one with the very fine hair that hits the woman). in the entire film - which benefited from the film being produced), the FX (also alongside nonexistent, making the effects on Snakes on a Plane look like Star Wars), and CGI itself charges, with the huge and huge giant snake something to be seen in terms of the science fiction movie channel. <br /> <br /> This basically means that it is a tumult of laughter at every step of the way (especially, as cruel as it may seem, when a little girl becomes involved in the "attention" of a snake), with the very disrespect for good taste working well in their favor. Having said that, it is also 100% disposable, like a sour lollipop from B-movie.
