Once again, I seem to be the only person on planet Earth who is able to criticize Japanese films made before 1970. "Fires on the Plain" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of "classics" that receive every kind of praise . for no apparent reason. As much as I like to generalize and psychoanalyze all those moviegoers who have such a horrible taste in the cinema, it is still almost impossible to rationalize why anyone would think that such a badly done day should be proclaimed as a sort of "masterpiece." What I find truly ironic is that fans of "classics" like "Fires on the Plain" focus so much on "inside the box" movies (orthodox standards such as script, acting, camera work, etc.) classics "are the most deficient in these same patterns. For example, one of the laziest copays for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposure, where the characters basically explain everything to the viewer, even when the scenario built is totally artificial. More surprisingly, the first scene in "Fires on the Plain" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme. After a slap in the head, the useless dialogue next assaults the viewer, "Why can not you?" We reached the west under heavy fire to reinforce the units in Tacloban. We lost two-thirds of our men. Our artillery was sunk in transit. We tried to reach the Burauen landing field across the central mountains, but no impossible artillery. The counterattack of the enemy forced a fanout across the valley. You know it. "So, why exactly is a character telling another character something he already knows?" Oh, yes, it's true, the creators of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways of communicating this information. quality film would actually show these events going on, or at worst would involve dialogue involving a character who is unaware of those events.Heck, even a paragraph opening opening summary directed at the viewer would have been better than what happened here . Such cases of shoddy film production are scattered all over the "Fires on the Plain" to the point where this movie seems to have been written by imbeciles for imbeciles. he comes across some skeletons wrapped in Japanese costumes.Instead of doing the natural thing as "ah I do not know" giving a depressed mannerism, the character lets out "Japanese soldiers." Obligate friend, but I could have realized it for myself. <br /> <br /> Even worse, this movie is saturated with overly dramatic stratagems. The most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots. Imagine that. A soldier walks and finds a pair of worn boots. One would think that such a find is totally useless, but it turns out that the soldier's boots are in even worse condition, so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his boots worn SUPER back. All right, I got it. Are the soldiers in the raw state ?? a fact that is already clearly emphasized with his worn boots to start with. The scene is ridiculous, but I was ready to let it pass, until the SECOND soldier arrives! You see, he finds worn soldier SUPER boots and warnings ?? Get ready, why are you here? that your boots are worn boots SUPER DUPER! Man of luck, he takes the SUPER boots and leaves his boots worn SUPER DUPER behind. But you see, is not that all? because the THIRD soldier then arrives! He meets the previous SUPER DUPER soldiers wearing boots and inspecting them, along with their own used SUPER DUPER boots. As the two pairs are bad, he throws them aside and smiles while still barefoot. At this point I was ready to play my television by the window of my living room. The heavy hand, the excessive drama, and the supreme absurdity of this sequence are beyond bad filmmaking. It is the production of bad films of SUPER DUPER. <br /> <br /> There are a number of similar, completely stupid moments. Like the moment the lead character asks someone, "Hey, are you dead?" As the guy will answer "Yes" if he really kicked the bucket. I will also be the first to condemn the inferior performance of the lead actor, who is the perfect example of artificial reaction. I laughed hard during the slap on the opening head, where his head was in place with that stupid, goofy expression on his face. The fact that this trivial fluffy piece gets an average rating of 8.4 while a certifiable Masterpiece like "A Tale of Two Sisters" (2003) only receives a 7.5 is the height of mass stupidity. And to think that some people really delude themselves by thinking that "ATOTS" does not make sense. Well, not every movie can have completely scandalous SUPER DUPER boots at your side.
