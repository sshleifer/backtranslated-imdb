Eric Roberts "star" in this prison film by Tommy Lee Thomas. He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. Though barely by most people's standards, your character is the kind of guy that is good enough to give you wires while you're stuck to the ceiling while he tortures you with "Deadly Weapon" electric batons. <br /> <br /> The film has an intricate plot about corruption in prison that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood's stunned eyes, Dolph Lundgren's verses, JCVD's acting skills, and the body of the youngest guy you knew at the school that took steroids after graduation. Martin's "Cobra Kai" career Kove shares that low point with Roberts, in the film it's hard to tell if the character of Kove must be drunk for the whole movie or if Kove ended up coming this way. I could not blame him if he did. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for all involved, this movie has a "so bad it's good" quality that can be fun IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER.
