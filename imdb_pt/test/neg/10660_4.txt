I do not like Himesh Reshamiya. I do not like singing either. But his songs are a craze in India, especially among commoners. Now, when did he venture to become an actor? that was a big joke! What courage he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing has changed. The movie becoming a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, did Aap Ka Saroor collect a collection of 14 box office credits? compared to Apne who collected 7 crores in the same 2 weeks. If I can sit with the absurd Apne Sivaji and Rajnikant ?? Should I give this film also an attempt to understand what this movie has done that made such a big success? The story is about real-life singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who went to Germany for a concert and fell in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). A German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Himesh is arrested for murder. Himesh's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after he escaped from prison is to prove he is innocent and find the real killer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Himesh has nothing in it to become a hero. He struggles but fails miserably. He's pathetic. I was wondering what could have made the movie click so much? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First, the film's saving grace is the script to the point where Himeh flees from prison. (But after that the nose of the movie plunges into unbearable stupid limits.) Second, the songs in the movie are good, catchy, public-handle numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat? she looks beautiful and acts well too, like the second lady. I can imagine Mallika fans coming to see the movie just for her. Fourth, is the film's cinematography enjoyable ?? especially the German locals, it is a pleasure to watch the eyes. Fifth, most of the story is a love story between Himesh and Riya ?? with dialogues clich√©s that would probably connect to young audiences. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha did a decent job covering the pathetic acting skills of Himesh as much as possible with shots that do not need Himesh to act much. <br /> <br /> Heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a small budget movie heroine. Raj Babbar is wasted on a small paper. Overall the film is below average. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about the whole movie ?? What if the same movie script was made with Salmaan as the main track? I think it would have been a much better case. It could be that I would have given the film 6 out of 10. But now? (Stars 4.5 out of 5)
