Firstly, this movie works on the fact that it is disturbing. I really did not enjoy seeing all those scenes where people are cut alive, etc. The strangely erotic introduction gives a sense of necrophilic wonder. It's a little ... nasty for me personally. But the movie really works out in this respect, and it's supposed to be scary, so I credit that. Yes, a few points there for those scalpels and .... well, damn disturbing idea of ​​being infected alive. <br /> <br /> But what's missing in this movie is an interesting plot, characterization or real surprises. The entire teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple and predictable way. Many "tense" moments, scary guys who are insane and the big question of all: is the boyfriend the killer? This movie fits in the category of "Scream" and countless others that cropped up in the 90s. Well, I will not ruin everything for you, but it's not exactly interesting who the killer is. We find out who's in the middle of the road ... and from then on, the movie goes on, trying to fill in some time ... a little boring to say the least. I was looking at the clock a little bit in this movie. The lead actress is great as usual, but the cardboard box in which she is placed makes a groan of pain ... the college girl who is a detective that everyone thinks she is insane, but she's the one who really knows what's going on. What about the cops? Ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, disturbing at times, and above all, boring and monotonous ... It's as if an American film company had traveled to Germany to film a movie to make it foreign ..... hmmm ... .. or did they? <br /> <br />
