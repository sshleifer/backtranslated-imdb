I can not believe I even tried to watch this crap. As an avid fan of Horror B movies, I was more than impressed by the prospect of this movie by popular horror filmmaker Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, since the opening of the film, I could not, for my life, think of a movie worse than this. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe that Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A horrible plot that moves incredibly slow, the film creeps with no real horror of talking. However, I will admit the sheer joy of some scenes when Dr. Gore is mesmerizing his future victims. The camera zooms in on its overly bulky eyes, while all the time there is this purely putrid soundtrack to enhance the fun. I laughed for the better part of 10 minutes. After he raises his "miraculous woman," the movie loses almost 20 minutes just showing him and his "girlfriend" as he teaches her to talk, then they talk, play with marigolds, make picnics, etc. music playing throughout this fandango without any speech. This part of the movie will leave you wishing you had cut your wrists with the opaque edge of a butter knife. I almost want to vomit at the very thought of this movie. If you like bad movies, watch this.
