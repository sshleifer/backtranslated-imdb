In the last years of Ron Miller's reign (Walt Disney's son-in-law cum Producer) he produced live action crap on a stick, often starring in the very annoying Dean Jones, whose entire career was based on such light, empty head food . Other horrible films from this same period include Pete's Dragon, Noah's Last Flight, Unidentified Indian Flight, and the dreaded Condorman. I will not mention Tron because I found it ambitious and Miller was just the executive producer, so he had little to do with actual production. However, it was in full force when this piece of human garbage was expelled from the bowels of creativity. Herbie is going to Monte Carlo. The second sequel to the much loved tale Love Bug finds Herbie in love with another car that also has brain and heart. There's a race, some bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. Filmed in France, the film is well photographed and the landscape is lovely. But the idea is that the film was made so that everyone involved could spend three months in France. The rest of the movie is a disaster. Prat Falls, clumsy thieves, evil German competitors, and a pretty bouncy feminist all fall into the category of stock supply. The biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop Herbie's personality through shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen-year-old, Disney writers do an injustice with our cute VW. Then again, I would think it would be difficult for anyone to overcome Helen Hayes by driving Herbie around a skyscraper on the second ride.
