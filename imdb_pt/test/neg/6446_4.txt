My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on cable. As someone who saw Revenge of The Nerds in a movie theater, I found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake. The nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I drove her crazy to be able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes. Writer Chad Creasey should be ashamed to write such an obvious remake of a movie from the early 1980s. The title should simply be "The Revenge of the Dorks." Maybe the sequel is Revenge of the Dorks 2.
