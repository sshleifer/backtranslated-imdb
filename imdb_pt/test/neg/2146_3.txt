After just over 50 years watching movies, I've created some simple rules for making good movies. <br /> <br /> 1. Introduce your main characters in advance, certainly in the first half hour. 2. Keep your characters to a minimum. If you adapt a novel, combine features and actions of secondary characters in a person. 3. Make sure your character actions have credibility; if necessary, create additional scenes to establish motivation. 4. Keep the action clear. Violence does not have to be explicit, but it should not be confused either. 5. Get the best music that money can buy. Often it matters more than acting, photographing, etc. 6. Normally, if a movie is not very good in the first 10 minutes, it will not get any better. <br /> <br /> `Cannon to Cordoba 'is a textbook example of what happens when these simple rules are not followed. Elmer Bernstein's score is rinkydink, one of the worst I've heard in a modestly budgeted movie. This is totally surprising considering Bernstein's credentials ("The Golden Arm Man", "The Magnificent Seven", "The Great Escape", "Children of Katie Elder"). The direction of Paul Wendkos is dull and confusing. The performances range from very good (Don Gordon, Peter Duel) to Terrible (Raf Vallone, Giovanna Ralli, Gabriele Tinti) with the normally dependable George Peppard falling somewhere in between. This should not be surprising, considering the mediocre direction and amateur writing, which breaks rules 1, 2 and 3. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I give 'Cannon for Cordoba' to '3'.
