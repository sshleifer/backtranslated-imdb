This movie would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral and intense movie that many others in its genre have been successfully but it is not. It is, at best, confusing and absurd. When the twists and turns finally revealed, instead of saying "Ahh, I get it!" I muttered something along the lines of "Ok ... whatever." In my opinion, when a movie reveals a major twist in the plot, it should not have to use a flashback sequence to prove that it gave some clues that would allow the viewer to discern the truth itself. But this movie has a flashback; and here's the kicker: he blinks back at scenes that were not even in the movie! <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped, unfriendly and totally ridiculous. I feel that the "smoldering" love scenes among the romantic protagonists were the most tireless and uninteresting I've ever seen in a non-porn movie. It seems that the director was going to shocking and bizarre with the love scenes, but they were really just silly. <br /> <br /> And do not even get me started with bad accents and second-rate sets. I think the movie was set in New Orleans, but beyond the aforementioned accents and some bland city scenes the movie could have been in Anytown, USA. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: do not bother!
