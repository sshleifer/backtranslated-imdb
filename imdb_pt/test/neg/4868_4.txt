My Take: routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. A rarely seen political suspense, which made a very bad response at the box office, I managed to get THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV now, and while I was happy to have satisfied my curiosity in seeing this rare movie, I did not exactly feel that this movie was special. Considering the box office response, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as the critics and the public reacted, but it's still not very good to begin with and everything from the script to the direction is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential aide who finds himself embroiled in assassins and persecutions (many of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy that lurks among White House officials. After a teacher is murdered, Sheen helps former reporter Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton) discover the traitor and release the title conspiracy. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, is pedestrian as they come, not unlike other thrillers of the White House conspiracy as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some considerable talents (Donald Sutherland, Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) do their best on a routine script, but rarely save it from the predictability of the script. Not to mention a ridiculous scene involving a toy helicopter that looks very foolish and out of place in this "serious" political thriller. THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments, I'm sure, some of which are very underrated (director George Pan Cosmatos serves some decent chase scenes), but none of them raises this routine thriller of which there is not much reward or surprises. Rating: ** out of 5.
