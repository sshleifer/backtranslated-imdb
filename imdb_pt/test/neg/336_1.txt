I am proud to be able to sit through it all. We think "if we paid the rental fee, then we are going to at least watch". I found the exception to this rule - The Planet. I do not know what the exchange rate is, but reading the other reviews, I can only assume that Â£ 8000 should be around $ 150. I'll date myself, but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the years 50. He was a bodybuilder who became an actor. He was in these really horrible Italians, dubbed films that starred Reeves as Hercules or some other muscle-bound hero. As a kid, watching them, you could not articulate why these movies were bad - you knew they did. Mike Mitchell is the new Steve Reeves. That's it ... that's what it really was - a new account of an old Italian film "Spaghetti Sand and Sandals". And I do not play with you, where was Reeves born? Glasgow, Montana. This movie is not so bad that it's fun to watch - it's just bad.
