Truly a breakthrough in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is bad. Acting (if so called), lighting, sound, script (if any), editing, directing, camera work, everything is atrocious. There is not a single element that is well done. If I thought that was intentional, then I could give some credit to the film, but I can not believe people would prepare to make such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and displaying for your worst enemies. .
