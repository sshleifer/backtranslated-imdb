Dark Harvest 3: Scarecrow: 1 out of 10: In Einstein's theory of relativity, time is from the perspective of the one who sees time. (Or so I heard) In other words, this movie seems much more than an hour and change. Even in fast forward (And you'll be reaching for that fast-forward button) it's approaching somewhere for all eternity. <br /> <br /> If you are familiar with the Lionsgate version of Project Greenlight (This is where they buy a movie at home but a flamboyant cover on it and sneak into the horror section of their Wal- Mart local) you will not be surprised at the complete and absolute lack of entertainment value contained within. <br /> <br /> Reading the line (I refuse to call it acting) is uniformly horrible. This is a collection of fussy parents and strippers pretending to be in a movie between Schlitz cans. The camera job is drunk father shooting holiday movie quality and while the special effects are well the most scary effect is the breast enhancement scars on the naked scene. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible, the sets are a haunted Halloween Put into practice by high school students with ADHD and, once again, reading the line (remember this is no longer acting than sinking into the bottom of the pool) is a distraction beyond mere words. Avoid.
