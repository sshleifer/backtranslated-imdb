The photograph is performed, the acting is very good, but in virtually every other department, The Greek Tycoon is a pain in the ass. Inspired by the real love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, the film is a brilliant but absolutely empty novel of the type that can be found on TV throughout the day. Viewers who embrace the entire "culture of celebrity magazines" (paparazzi photos and gossip stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here. But those who prefer movies with a little more substance, skill and strangeness will find that the time of 107 minutes is a monotonous task. <br /> <br /> American President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline Bisset) are in Greece on official business. A ridiculously wealthy Greek shipbuilding magnate, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), sees Liz at a party in her elegant mansion. Despite the fact that both are married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his yacht, Tomasis reveals his wishes to Liz. Some time later, President Cassidy is murdered while strolling on a beach. Liz is shocked and sad at his death, but it does not take long for her to seek comfort in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasis. Eventually the two are married and their love affair becomes a favorite hangout of newspapers, magazines, photographers and fans of the world. <br /> <br /> It's kind of fun to note the force with which the producers in this movie denied that it was a dramatization of the Kennedy-Onassis story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story, rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the movie is inspiring. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that The Greek tycoon was tantamount to his love life receiving Hollywood treatment (if rumors are to be believed, he actually took a stake in Anthony Quinn's approval for the role Tomasis!) J. Lee-Thompson did not Is it really the right kind of director for this kind of movie? it is more suitable for fodder action like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex ?? but he directs the process with an uninspired professional fit. Quinn is very watchable as Tomasis; Bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires; Franciscus uses his smile and a facade of integrity to create a credible politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but there is little for the actors to do on a deeper level. Likewise, Tony Richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface that moves from one exotic location to another, but the simplest of scratches proves that there is nothing behind the bright exterior of the film.
