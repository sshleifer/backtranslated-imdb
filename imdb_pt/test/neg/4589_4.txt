Another horrible movie about hockey. I never watched hockey and saw the Hollywood version, I would hate the game. This movie also does not make Canada so beautiful. I can laugh at this and not take it too seriously. Even so, this movie is horrible, with everything you can put in a movie from the 80's. In the end we did not even watch it on TV. 4/10
