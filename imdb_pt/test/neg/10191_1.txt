I just stumbled across this movie and checked IMDb for more info: Score 6.7, well ... not so bad. Genre: science fiction ... well I like science fiction. So I got the movie and was looking forward to having a relaxing Sunday evening watching. But, but ... NO. <br /> <br /> As in summary, this is not a movie. It is a religious advertisement, including: preceching about Jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. The film begins with an epic sequestration story: Driving at Night, Car Stops, Bright Light and so on ... Well, actually that was the movie. Last of this ... ummm ... frankly I do not know how to call it ... it was a dialogue about the end of the world and the last judgment. Same thing these TV preachers tell you, but they're "good" at it. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if you do not want to see a science fiction movie or something like that with UFOs, please stay away from this "thing". It has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear the opinion of some cuckoo heads, what the bible has to say and what you should do. So go ahead and look at this "thing", but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. <br /> <br /> This is a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other reviewers have said = Well ... I should have had other comments from red users before I had the film. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters rated this "thing" as 10 ) Yes, please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)
