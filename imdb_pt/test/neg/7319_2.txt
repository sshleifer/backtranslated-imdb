Roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patronize and sell. Immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates to help pay the rent and gets a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these plot details are explored in detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the movie will be. When her uncle dies, there are some breasts on the screen, one of the possible roommates he interviews is very funny for about 40 seconds. The ending is literally the worst I've ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life back! <br /> <br /> I had not thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit: Surely there are rules against this kind of thing reaching the public? The script can not be more than twenty pages long, and the budget must have been tiny because the entire movie has about three locations and one car. The only conceivable use for Roomies, in my opinion, is if you are holding someone hostage and want to frustrate you beyond human thought. If so, have it repeated and you will have a gibbering wreck ready within the day. <br /> <br /> one-and-a-half of 10
