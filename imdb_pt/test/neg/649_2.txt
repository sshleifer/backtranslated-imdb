If you like bad movies, this is a real treat. Kaufman & Peters stagger in robot fantasies, escape slavery just to wander aimlessly and find the true love of robots. I believe this is the first movie that made me think about leaving. I should have noticed that I was 12 and could be entertained with bright objects.
