From the second the song swelled (second in the movie) and was a movie hack gut, I knew I was on a long journey. Horridly clich√© - (I laughed a lot and knew the story ended well before the end) - they did not use Louisbourg particularly well and the costumes and hair were kind of awful. (My favorite makeup moment is that the only way to age Depardieu as far as I could see was to put a straight hair wig on it instead of wavy). I could go on talking about the ridiculous inadequacy of music for a long time - the film could be massively improved by an eighteenth-century soundtrack. <br /> <br /> (ETA: AH, it's that horrible moviemusic guy Patrick Doyle who is responsible for the score - say no more! He SHOULD NOT be allowed to close to historical films - he must stick to 20th century settings .)

He absolutely stole the show for all the 30 seconds he was on the screen. Tragically, it made you see what the movie could have been. <br /> <br /> The love scenes had some warmth - the two clues were impressive together. <br /> <br /> The most terrible scene for historians is where they are at the great farewell dinner in Britain before Wolfe sails and he lifts the glass and says the first two lines of "How does the glass stand? around "also known as" Why soldiers why "as if it were a toast. Absolutely excruciating flaw in historicity, much better left out.
