What a mess! Usually when criticizing a historical film, it is always fun to point out the inaccuracies that appear, usually added by writers to create more "dramatic" situations. However, "Imperium: Nerone" is a type of whole nuther animal. In this film you strive to find ANYTHING that is confirmed by the historical record amid the farce of the absurd and the fiction presented as the life of the emperor-artist bad boy of Rome. <br /> <br /> And it's a pity, because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all Roman emperors. His life was full of tumultuous events and interesting people to make a really good movie. The producers of this mess have chosen another path, which leads only to scratches on the part of any informed viewer. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: 1. Nero is portrayed as a 6-8 year old boy when Caligula has her father killed for treason, exiled her mother Agripina and sends the boy be created by slaves in the field. "Ten years later," the story resumes shortly before the assassination of Caligula. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his reign of four years and was only three years old when he was assassinated; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was soon exiled for bad behavior, not for treason; and Nero was not raised among the slaves, but had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. <br /> <br /> 2. Okay, according to the writers, Nero is now 16 years old when his great-uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); Agrippina engineers the fall of Empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero. He then leaves to conquer Britain, and is poisoned by Agrippina shortly after his victorious return. Nero is declared emperor, although he is still only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 AD, two years after the beginning of his reign. He lived until AD 54. Nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology, but actually succeeded to the throne at age 16. <br /> <br /> History tells us that it then followed the "Five Good Years" where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus. This is shown - in a way - except that portraying the Roman Senate as opposing good measures of Nero is false. Senatorial opposition to Nero only began when he began to show signs of insanity and began to kill senators for royal or imaginary betrayal. <br /> <br /> 3. Nero Agrippina's mother is the type of control, who murdered her uncle-husband to make her son emperor. After a while, Nero tires of his meddling and decides to kill her. In the film, he sends his Tigellinus henchman to stab her to death. Alright, but the reality was much better! Agrippina was a survivor and it was not easy. Nero tried three times to poison her, but as an old poisoner herself she was more experienced at all this, and he failed. Then he tried to crush her to death by collapsing the ceiling of her bedroom, but that also failed. Then he sent her on a voyage on a ship that was deliberately built to crumble and sink; When she got off, she jumped into the sea and swam to the beach. Finally he stabbed her to death. Now showing all this would have definitely improved this movie! Other errors abound: Nero's lover, Acte, was not a slave friend of her childhood, she never repudiated him, and there is no evidence that she has become a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by cutting his wrists as he sat by a lake. Etc. etc. etc. The sources for Nero's life are mainly the Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom were of the senatorial class hostile to him and his memory. But the evidence indicates that he remained very popular with ordinary people, unlike one of the final scenes where he is shot through the crowd with vegetables as he leaves the city to commit suicide. Why do writers and producers have an inherently interesting history with many good things for any movie, and make this piece of shit? Oh, and did I mention just how cheesy the sets and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> A star, because there is no way to classify it lower.
