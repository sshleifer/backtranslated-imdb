Normally, I would say that I loved this movie. Not for acting, though it was okay. Not for the script, which was so. The reason I would normally have loved this movie is by the intense action that starts from the beginning go and it does not end until the final credits roll. But the problem with this movie, and I felt it was a big problem, was the horrible CGI. it seems that they ran out of money and failed to complete the shooting effects. many of the effects seem lime, they are in their most rude form. Obviously they did not have enough money to finish the movie, they should not have released it. I really found the effects insulting. It seems obvious that I do not mind making a decent end product for the consumer. If it were not for this, I would give this movie a much higher rating. My vote for Air Panic is a 3/10
