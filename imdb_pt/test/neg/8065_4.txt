This movie is very much like the Cannibal Holocaust. If it were not for the unnecessary killing of animals in the name of 'shock' ('Ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we add real death to our movies') these movies would end up on my classic dusty shelf - I'm a big fan of cannibal movies and zombies But as it stands, it's another example of shock horror in the last moments of the pile in a desperate effort to make a bad movie generate more hype. In short, a dirty blood film with limited appeal. A 70's blood fan should try, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should choose something a little better for their popcorn party.
