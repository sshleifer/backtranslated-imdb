When I think of Bollywood. I think lite feels good numbers of musical dance, with beautiful clothes for men and women. And captivating melodies. Horror, Thrillers, Mystery and Suspense, does not come to mind. And that, to my Western eyes, is like an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been a better movie, shorter even if the writer and director had made a definite choice. Or whether it was for Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance instead of a clumsy mix of them all. <br /> <br /> I will have to say more than once that I thought the director must have seen "I know what you did last summer" and tried to give it a touch of Bollywood. My first movie was Bride & Prejudice. Which I thought was good. <br /> <br /> This looked like what a western audience would consider a direct video cheese festival. <br /> <br /> The acting was exaggerated, it sometimes seemed that they were intentionally trying to parody Western thrillers, but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying, screaming or fear, it seemed out of place. <br /> <br /> The viewer wondered when one of the actors winked at the camera. More than a few times, when the public should be horrified, we could only laugh at the absurd. <br /> <br /> I watch a lot of foreign films, and even though I do not know Hindi, I have to say that they did a bad job subtitling the movie. Sometimes it was difficult to read the white letters against the bright background. <br /> <br /> The villain was particularly amusing, at least to me, because he came up with his own humorous music. The supposedly startling turnaround actually seemed like a way out. <br /> <br /> The main couples were cute / pretty enough, and the musical numbers made my rental rate count. I would suggest to someone as a musical comedy, but I would tell them to advance the rest of the movie because it was not worth the reading effort. If you are determined to read an entire Hindi-captioned movie, then check out the romantic drama 'Namasteay, London'. <br /> <br /> But I was not afraid ... unless this is really what they think awful in India. 1 out of 10 for what is being presented as. 6 out of 10 because of their unplanned speed and ability to give lots of laughs, and are musical / dance numbers. Appreciate :)
