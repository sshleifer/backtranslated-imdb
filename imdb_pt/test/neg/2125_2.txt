The worst of all the bad Jaws features was woefully made by one of my favorite directors of all time; Lamberto Bava (here under his pseudonym John Old Jr.). You know how it works on those cheap European imitations, right? They just want their monster be bigger, sicker and more menacing, but this often results in the opposite effect. The creature of Bava is a huge sea demon and is more than just a shark! We're dealing with a prehistoric monster here, with the jaws and appetite of a Great White, but it also has tentacles like an octopus! It's up to a couple of dolphin-loving oceanologists to find out how this monster was able to survive all those thousands of years and why exactly it started its killing now. The script for "Monster Shark" makes little or no sense and most of the action takes place on the continent. The shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision by Lambert Bava to only show it loosely and in quick flashes. Performance performances are above average and underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well managed. The plot twists are predictable and you'll probably have the most fun discovering detailed facts about the characters. For example: count all the beer cans Dr. Hogan drinks throughout the movie!
