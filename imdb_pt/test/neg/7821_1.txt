This movie is perfect for any aspiring screenwriter, actor or director. By watching this movie, you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today. There are so many clichés that it hurt to sit in this movie. Nothing about it is original and every spoken line was wrenched from those clichéd movies we all saw in the 90s. Although it has some cheap laughs, overall, it is wrong to err wrong. I was so immensely bored and the film was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup was stuck on Tara Reid's face to hide those huge purses and wrinkles from her endless parties. Seriously, she was using so much groundwork that you could literally scrape and fill an entire bottle of it. <br /> <br /> What struck me was that so many of the talented and popular cast would sign with this piece. of trash. And I do not know how I sat through that horrible scream Ashton Kutcher does, do you know when he's angry or something and he screams his words in that annoying way? Ashton's gruesome "talk", Tara's face being ten shades darker than her neck, a drugged owl, a script that looked like the work of a three-year-old child ... <br /> <br /> Seriously , in my entire life there has not been a movie I've seen that I did not enjoy in any way, no matter how bad it was. That deserves a prize for being the first. BAD BAD BAD ... I do not think there is a single word in the English dictionary that could describe this useless movie. Today I was trying to watch again, but I had to turn it off like ten minutes because I was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clichés. <br /> <br /> Do not even worry about renting this in your blockbuster, it's not worth a dime, in fact I'm willing to pay someone out there considering watching this movie so they can do something decent with their lives .
