Okay, I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I watched your show. <br /> <br /> It's not funny to me. All I remember was a lot of "strange" noises and screams. I do not think I even gave a smile. The only thing that reminded her of a bit of humor was her bit of Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can get dumber every minute watching though. <br /> <br /> In addition, what's with the "Ask Whitey?" section? This is an imitation of "Ask a gay guy / black man?" of Chappelle's show? Is not that obvious? But when Chappelle did this, he was exposing the ignorance of the subject. Like Borat. But what about picking random white people and yelling things at them? This is not funny, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure I've heard some of his "jokes" somewhere else ... it looks a bit like he's 'packing' chunks, throwing some "loud" shouts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not funny. Seriously. Do not waste your time.
