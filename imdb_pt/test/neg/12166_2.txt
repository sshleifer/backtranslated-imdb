Okay, I really like King's stuff, but this is awful. the whole movie, I'm waiting for the main character to do something deep with his new youth and power. I can tolerate the worst of the movies, since anything is better than watching a movie with commercials. but that takes the cake. I gave it a 2, and I would never recommend it to anyone.
