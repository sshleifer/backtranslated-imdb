Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and for putting your mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: she is so talented, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates, which lends credence to the often misapplied term "star". The film loses its mark for several reasons, but perhaps most notably by the apparent lack of adaptability of the story on the screen, making it a convincing narrative ... more on that later. The cast at first glance is excellent, but thinking about it, Jessica Lang as the Jewish mother is very Protestant and not exactly right, Ann Hetch does not come close to showing the psychiatrist's compassion and dedication to the book, and when you're making a movie, how can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in building the film: first in the failure to get any kind of enduring sympathy for the character of Elizabeth Wurtzle, and secondly to say something significant about the very ordinary and horrible situation in which this poor girl finds herself. Unfortunately for the flashback construction, Lizzy simply emerges as a teenager certainly more affected than most, but not as devastatingly ill as she appears in the book. That is the main problem. This story had to be told from the beginning to the end and from the couch of the therapist. She is only eight or nine years old when depression begins due to devastating social factors in both society and the home, and this is a crucial point not only provoking sympathy for her but also the gravity of her case. She is so talented and a spirit so vulnerable and discontent so early that one's heart can not fail to attain it because of its victimization. This is forgotten in the movie. Ultimately, one must come to terms with what the film is trying to say: it is a cinematic of a severely affected girl, but it is also a film about a nation. who can not act together; this is very clear in the book, but curiously not in the film in which the ones chosen at Harvard are even more confusing than those enrolled in college. The movie finally is not able to get any of these messages convincingly, and this is very bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or an apparent need in a country where so many people can not function without a chemical crutch? These are difficult and challenging concepts to work with and writing does not really try to approach any of them in a more or less engaging way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America, but this does not have the effect that must be had due to the transverse and insufficient development of controlled subjects. <br /> <br /> Ricci's performance is tight and sincere, and one of the best of her acting career. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also excellent in his role.
