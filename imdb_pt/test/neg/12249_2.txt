There are times when, less than halfway through the film, I begin to wonder what the creators were thinking that made them decide not to record each roll of film and instead cast a movie that has no real merit of any kind . And I mean any kind. This movie does not hold up as cable porn. In fact, Heaven's Tears is completely and utterly boring and sometimes a little disturbing in its naivety. The girl, who reminds me of eighteen, masturbates as she thinks of an older Nazi who hit her with a car - the syndrome of "bumping into her in the hall as a way of presenting us" of Robert Zemekis' films and films. So in his second or third meeting - you see - he's the shy, the one who is resilient to the girl's sexual advances, and yet all she has to say is, "I'm old enough. "and he takes her to bed.Then after sleeping with this girl he barely knows, he feels complete, as if he could die right there in bed with her and have lived a full life.It's like" Lolita " without a hint of social and personal commentary. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the most boring part of the film. <br /> <br /> No interesting angle or originality, not even for the sex scenes, which should be the main attraction for these guys The masturbation scene is just a camera circling the girl's bed (looking very fake, as if it were on a stage), and is entwined with the fantasy that the man bathes in a waterfall. complete "is just a close-up on the right side of the girl (upside down until I know ) with the guy on top of her, and it's the same photo all the time, although there are repetitive cuts a rather disconnected scene from the Nazi's older sister, who has some sort of incestuous passion for him (she's ridiculous and silly, so does not matter). I think the whole thing lasts five to ten minutes, and it's neither enlightening nor exciting.
