The original Road House was a classic movie of the 80's, which despite having no award worthy of writing or acting, was a very nice and popular film, largely due to the presence of the star Patrick Swayze and the great supporting cast. with excellent fight scenes and visual eye drops. <br /> <br /> 16 years later, and MGM / Sony tries to recreate the magic that has left us citing a poster and reciting the three rules of the jump ... with a movie that cites all the best linings of the original and recites the three rules. <br /> <br /> If it were a movie of amateur fans, it would be seen as a loving tribute to one of Swayze's most popular films. As a professionally made film, it falls straight into the Bargin Bin DVD, with the continued reuse of lines and plot of the original film, making it more of an annoying sign of lack of originality than of legal references to the original. That said, with new lines like "I'm going to kill you like I killed your father" it's no wonder that the writers decided to redo a lot of the original script. <br /> I knew this would never be anything special, being a Straight to DVD Sequel, but I had at least hoped that there might be some new ideas and new things included to live by the name of the Road House, but what you get is simply just a remake of 2006 from the same movie, with a bit of narcotics added. <br /> <br /> If I were the director, I would have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and are characters. As it is, we have the character of Patrick Swayze now supposedly dead (killed badly by Jake Busey) and his brother and son now the main characters, who strangely have completely different surnames. My favorite part was that Dalton's "son" drove the same car as his father, a genuinely cool tribute, though later on he was ruined by having the car exactly the same EXCELLENT than his predecessor did. This is a good example of how this film goes too far, including sequences and ideas from the 1989 movie. Of course, who can forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane? killed his father "and then goes on to try to dispatch it in a completely different way.Increasingly writing there.I see Schaech is listed as a co-writer.Be careful to act, or preferably, > <br /> Overall this is an OK movie if there is nothing else to watch and you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half or if you have already seen the first Road House but the hardcore fans of the classic Swayze will be utterly disappointed to the point of being insulted by how much this film is one of the first. "As someone once suggested as an alternate subtitle for this film," Even Jeff Healy is glad he is not seeing this! " to the original Road House and relive the good old days Swayze!
