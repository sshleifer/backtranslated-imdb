Like another user, I bought this cheap - I thought. 85 crowns (8 pounds). Although not worth that amount of money, it is a total classic that I - like other users - saw for the first time as a child and was anxious to see again about 20 years later. The story is incredibly thin (and that's why it may have worked for kids), but all the radio language and the truckers' stuff make up for it. It will look good on my DVD shelf for years to come. First exhibition (1980): 10/10. Second exhibition (2002): 4/10
