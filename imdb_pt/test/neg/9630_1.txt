There is no saving grace in this drowsy, monotonous and monotonous festival that brings to mind "The Rescue of the Red Chief"! <br /> <br /> Although there are some big stars in this movie, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford, usually a laid-back kind of guy, has a forced emotion. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed is so exaggerated that it can be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. <br /> <br /> The son is such a repulsive brat that I caught myself rooting for the kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The only decent performance in this mix is ​​the relatively minor role of the butler. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm being too hard on the actors, after all, all they did was read the lines in the script. Oh, the script, that turgid piece of artificial dreck that would like to pull the strings of your heart, but simply turn your stomach.
