Well, if you put aside the fact that this film presents an abysmal performance; and if you let go of the fact that the story is confusing and veers in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go; and if you put aside the fact that I did not find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting; well, if you put all that aside, this is still a REALLY terrible movie! <br /> <br /> I presume this is a love story about a rich guy / a poor girl. I never really understood for a moment how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) began. The inexplicable romance is aggravated by a complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The script (by Michael Seitzman) is monotonous to the point of numbing. As Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; that he would think someone would want to pay to see this is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is a REALLY, really terrible movie? <br /> <br /> I would give a ZERO, but the IMDb does not provide ZERO votes. So I give it a while I'm holding my nose.
