This movie is watchable, but nothing special. Four girls on a trip to Vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he's cute). Everyone ends up staying at a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the hitchhiker's psychotic problems with women become apparent. <br /> <br /> The characters are clich√©s - there is a married and responsible woman; a fussy party; an insecure bride; and a hater of men who has just been dumped. The hitchhiker is genuinely cool until he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not enough blood and rape too. I really like terror of terror / suspense, and this did not do anything for me. The ending was as bad as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the actors did a great job with which they had to work. The dialogue is not horrible, and overall I was impressed with the cast, having never seen or heard of any of them before. And the plot was not out of the realm of possibility (although I really doubt that any woman in this day and age would pick up a hitchhiker - no matter how attractive he is), so I was not moaning that things did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Hitchhiker" was well done and made sense, but it was not very interesting. There are many better movies in the same genre that I would recommend about this one ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Saw Massacre", even the remake "The Hitcher"). Do yourself a favor and skip unless you have no other options.
