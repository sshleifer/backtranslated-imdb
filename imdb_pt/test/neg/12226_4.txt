In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence did The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If The Comebcaks had been released in March (as planned) around the same time that TMNT was released, TMNT would have won by default! <br /> <br /> Granted, Matthew Lawrence did a good job portraying a quarterback. He did not have to resort to using dirty words, which is an advantage. But when he started playing with his private parts, as well as with other American football players and touching a girl's bosom, those were the downsides. <br /> <br /> But the biggest disadvantage was that all football players participated. in the simulated music video except Matthew Lawrence (insert the losing horns of Price Is Right)! Another musical opportunity blown at him, just because he is shy in making music. <br /> <br /> In the past, Matt has disappointed me many times (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad) where he came so close to having a musical moment. <br /> <br /> Of course, Joey had a singing career with two albums and Andrew started his musical career. But it's very rare to find a musical moment Matt. The two that stood out were Brotherly Love, where he played guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote, and that romantic moment of Boy Meets World when he sang "This Dame" <br /> <br /> Matt, you've played jocks for a long time. <br /> <br /> Why not make a comeback? <br /> <br /> You have a good voice and I miss your musical side.
