This was just a horrible movie. I watched it once when I was about 12 years old, I'm now 19 and I do not think I'll forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I still feel bad whenever I think about it, it was just all awful that could fit in a movie. I really do not understand what kind of person would like this total junk. It's not enough to simply turn off the mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy stupid movies made for Disney as much as the next person, but that's something completely different. <br /> <br /> I usually do not like to judge a movie until I've seen it myself, but trust me, I'm doing you a favor. Do not watch this movie.
