Coming into the movie with the right expectations, I enjoyed this movie a little. Like most critics who watched this movie, I fully agree that the plot was very thin, clich√©, and I could predict every plot turnaround from the beginning of the movie. But, the dance sequences were very well done, and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical dance and hip-hop (both of which I like to watch). The music / soundtrack of the film was also very good, which made the "dramatic" scenes more bearable. The protagonists (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) were very much like actors, but their dances throughout the film were impressive and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> In all, a movie worth watching if you enjoy watching good dance sequences, and this movie is MUCH MUCH better than "You Got Served" in terms of plot and drama. So again, that does not say much, does it? = P
