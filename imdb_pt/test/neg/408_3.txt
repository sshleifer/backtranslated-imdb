Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad happened to Ron Howard. I do not know exactly what, but something went wrong. <br /> <br /> Howard has always been a decent director. While he will never be mistaken for an artistic sage, Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent movies, Parenthood was very good and even Angels and Demons prequel / sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun joke. Besides, none of his movies were absolutely horrible. (Note that I have not seen either how the Grinch robbed Christmas nor his latest movie Heidi Montag says no to plastic.) What else Howard has managed to hold this quality is such kind of caption as A Beautiful Mind, drama directed (Far and Away), a fantasy of revenge (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is the center of a misdirected and filmed movie. The scenes are very dark, the camera angles are all wrong, the actors block each other's photos and the whole subject is always out of focus. This makes the story of an already confused story even more confusing. <br /> <br /> Dan Brown is much chosen, but I find the Da Vinci Code a fun and readable joke (so sue me). The film version of Da Vinci's code kept the same place where they are going to the next book's vibe and added a compelling and attractive filming location. <br /> <br /> Angels and demons, however, occurs in the claustrophobic confines of Vatican City and since Howard was not allowed to shoot in many of the actual locations, we ended up running around a lot of CGI back. The whole movie is as if Rick Steves made a special in Vatican City and instead of visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a secondhand art book with all his breasts erased. While the Da Vinci Code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (once again prosecute me), the story of Demons and Angels consists of an Illuminati conspiracy (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. His idea was to take positions in deaf schools around the world and repeatedly rape all students. Oops my bad; apparently, the Vatican does not need any help. <br /> <br /> In any case, their plan is to infiltrate the Great Hadron Collider of Europe, kill the leader, and steal three Anti-matter jars. This calls for more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture antimatter after being raised? Why is the EU collecting this? (Maybe they're afraid of a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-matter meeting a priest of the Vatican? Now, once they pick up the anti matter, will they use their incredible destructive power to rule the world? It's no joke; unfortunately, the Illuminati have not yet understood the level of sophistication of Pinky and the brain. Instead, the current pope has just died and it is the final moment. The top cardinals seeded for the last tournament of four popes are kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing one by one. They being good sports, however, are leaving clues in all the murders as a Riddler with Latin theme. Oh, and the last kidnapped cardinal has anti-matter, and if it's not found in time, Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there were some Latin themed Batman to save the day ??? Okay, the story is really horrible and it's badly told, but maybe this is one of those movies saved by great acting. A true character study? (Ok, you know where this is going). Tom Hanks makes an incredibly handsome presentation of wood and just looks awful (he's also old enough to play the character for about twenty years). His love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant / hut as an Irishman who seems to be about to enter a musical number at any time, as long as no one steals his Lucky Charms. On the plus side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd makes a good appearance as head of Vatican Security and, as far as we know, no deaf children have been raped during the making of this film, which places it ahead of its critics. Vatican in at least one area.
