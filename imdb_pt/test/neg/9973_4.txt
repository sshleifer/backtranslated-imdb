I was looking forward to watching this movie and therefore was extremely disappointed when I found it to be complete and absolute rubbish. Akerman's direction is heavy and cliché (how much more cliché do you get than Paris at night?). The male cast seems to have been entirely chosen for its resignification to the self-portraits of Egon Schiele. However, the themes of envy and betrayal, which should have been the main focus of such a film, were virtually unexplored. What remains is a lush melodrama that takes an age to get started and even more to finish. The only advantage with this kind of movie is that it makes you realize just how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.
