"Death Machines" has a pretty decent premise for an action movie (machines that kill martial arts that can not be released to eliminate opponents of a crime boss) and turns it into an unshakable mess. I've rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget, poor performance and incoherent script released as a so-called "movie". It's easily the worst martial arts / action movie I've seen in years, eclipsing even the "Ninja Holocaust" (which at least had good scenes of energetic fighting). <br /> <br /> The true "star" of the film is the white "Death Machine" (basically his vehicle), so he appears prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. He's in good shape, and he's not ugly, but as an actor he's barely there - think Chuck Norris in "The Octagon," just without energy or emotion. This is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director. ..but you have to be Arnold to get that sort of thing, and this guy is not Arnold. <br /> <br /> The film (and the director) can not find the time (or budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that originally posed, like: Who was the dark figure that gave the Asian women his lips marbled his orders? How did the "gang war" end? Why did the sodden-mouth Asian lady decide to kill her zombie killers? And what the hell happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick? <br /> <br /> However, he finds time to film a completely strange bar fight in which a sailor (well, he looked like Popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box did not work. It is related only to the rest of the film, because in the process he also KO is the "hero" of the film, a bartender / karate student who was the victim of the first great task of "Death Machines" (he had his hand severed while they were killing his teacher). It follows this with one of the most unnamed "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend I've ever seen. The following does not make sense - at the end of the bar brawl, she grimaces over her soft body, and the next thing they're in a "taste-good" assemblage of sex and love looks like it came from a Hallmark card. BTW, we never see the sailor again. <br /> <br /> And wait until you see the confrontation between the homicide detective and his captain - this is as if the director and the screenwriter had never seen a movie scene inside a police station, but had heard of them second-hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. <br /> <br /> The film is a classic case of poor cast actors and community theater actors struggling with no decent direction. The three "Machines of Death" appear as clods; the "hero" knows his lines, but can not carry the film, since his character is an ineffectual coward; his girlfriend is a vacuum of charisma; and all other smaller parts are only assistive. All of this contributes to a rather poor movie - but the "dragon lady" does more to drag the film into an underground territory than anyone or anything else. She looks ridiculous; her tiny, expressionless face is dominated by her skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe and speaks with a terrible delivery of profanity that screams "I needed time with a dialogue coach." Poor lady - she was obviously out of her element and, as far as I know, has never appeared in a movie again. <br /> <br /> Add to this a soundtrack of a low-budget synthesizer that never quits and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; low quality film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly hungry; and a general around dizziness and lack of energy in the blockade and the stage business ... and you have a lame movie. <br /> <br /> I got this as part of a compilation of 50 movies on DVD, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. Not worth it. Feh!
