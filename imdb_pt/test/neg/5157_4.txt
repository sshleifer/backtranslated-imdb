The Nest is actually just another "nature-of-the-run" horror movie that fails because of the low budget. The acting is good, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole movie seemed a little annoying to me. The bloody effects are not the best I've seen, but they're fun in a tacky way. Cockroaches are just ordinary cockroaches that sting people. The nest reminded me of a much better movie called Slugs. If you liked The Nest, then Slugs is a must-see as it is ten times better. Also noteworthy is that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another type of nature film called Deadly Eyes (aka The Rats), which is about murderous rats, as you may have guessed. <br /> <br /> If you like these types of horror movies, then you might want to give this one a watch, but you would be much better off seeing Slugs, which is much more interesting and bloody.
