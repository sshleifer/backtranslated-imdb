A few words to people here at the germ movie club: The worst crap ever seen in this honorable movie. A very bad script, a very bad actor and a really bad movie. Do not waste your time looking at this movie, see the very good "fried green anarchy radioactive mutants", or any movie that has been well commented on by me. Do not say more.
