This movie goes to my file "Worst Films Ever Made". I have a copy of this movie that I watch when I want a good laugh, and that's not even a comedy. I'm disappointed that these great actors agreed to be on such a piece of crap. This film is inaccurate (in his hockey picture), offensive (for the Canadians), and I was not even so impressed with the acting. Even the story was a little weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're lucky. If you have, I'm sorry.
