I believe the production value is OK .. probably deserves a 4/10 or 5/10. It is traditionally filmed with beautiful people with model quality and a bit of class .. <br /> <br /> the premise makes me angry .. Would a decent woman make such a mess? I mean, is she going to marry a man who would have sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> and what is more serious, she is also active in behavior ...... only in the mind of Laclos .... the film also has many aspects that make Eastern Europeans look immoral < <br /> <br /> After all, it's just film, if you do not want to downgrade women in general, I'll give one more point ... but obviously, it arrives <br /> <br /> conclusion: a nasty piece of crap with a little taste
