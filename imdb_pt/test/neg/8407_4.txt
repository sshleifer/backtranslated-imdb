Hmmm ... all right, this is really bad even compared to the first movie, the acclaimed Rosemary's Baby. In fact, it's a really bad movie overall. Yes, there are some redeeming qualities, but I'll get to that later. <br /> <br /> Well, it's been a long time since the last movie happened ... in fact, it's been practically eight years I believe. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her son and influence him in a good way, instead of letting him succumb to the evil future that the coven (or "tribe", as referred to here) has planned for him. When she runs away with him and an empty bus comes to pick her up, leaving her son with a prostitute, the prostitute raises him until he reaches the age of majority, when Satan tries to possess him, since he seems to be rejecting his evil inheritance in each Obviously , things do not go as planned, and then there's the end I would have felt seriously embarrassed if I had not seen it coming since I heard there was a sequel to "Rosemary's Baby"! Okay, when I was 11, I witnessed the masterpiece Rosemary's Baby and then I read the continuation of the book. Thinking that this movie was an adaptation of this, I crawled this movie and I managed ... I was right to do that? Well, somehow, yeah ... I'm a true fan of this "franchise" and I can say that I've seen the sequel, and I have an idea of ​​what happens after the events in the first movie (talking about both this movie and " Son of Rosemary ", sequel to Ira Levin's own book, not yet adapted to the film). Ruth Gordon, who played Minnie in the first film, is shown a few times in this movie, but why, why is the coven so different? The knife that Rosemary dropped on the first movie is shown coming off the floor, but Minnie pulled it out! The coven is now called a tribe (as I said earlier). They now walk in hooded hoods chanting "Satanic Bird ... Adrian's Bird ... Satan's Bird ... Adrian's Bird ..." and so on. The Gothic building is now like a two-story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, looks like a nice little suburb or something! And the child itself looks quite normal, with the eyes only getting "sulky" when it gets angry and kills someone or something in vain. <br /> <br /> With regard to acting, it's pretty bad everywhere, except for Stephen McHattie, who plays a very adult Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, replacing Mia Farrow as Rosemary, has to have one of the best ever performances to get caught up in the movies! It's so bad that it's neither funny ... when she screams "OH MY GOD!" and cries like the fifteenth time in the movie, you're like "Ok, no more funny," and after she's gone and the movie lasted only twenty minutes, you're like THANK THE LORD I do not have to hear her say "OH MY GOD" MORE! SHEESH! In the end, this movie has very, very few redemptive qualities, enough to get at least four stars. But, if you look at this as a serious sequel to the first film, it's virtually non-existent.
