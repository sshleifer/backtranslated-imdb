To roll! To roll! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Not necessary! Decent performance? Not necessary! Respect shown to your powerful parent? Not necessary! Yes, it's another turkey offensively stuffed into the Butch Bruce canon. <br /> <br /> I mean, where do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the unfortunate lack of understanding that people may have that this was somehow related to the book or the original film, The Day of the Jackal. It is not. In fact, it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to get his name. Now I'm not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can not hack Hollywood by redoing British films. Well, okay, maybe I'm a bit like this, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the premise. A Russian gangster is murdered in a Moscow police attack (somehow involving the FBI, though no one bothered to explain why). In revenge, the gangster's brother decides to avenge himself by killing the wife of the president of the United States (although once again no one bothered to explain why this is a good move? Although, to be fair, it was pre-September 11 , so it was not knowing that this would have resulted in the bombing of the US Air Force in Eastern Europe). Gangster hires "nasty" killer (Willis). The police hired the "cute" killer (Gere), the "cute" killer traces the "nasty" killer. Police walks around and is killed periodically. Killer "Cuddly" kills the "nasty" killer. The First Lady is saved and we all realize that the IRA is just a bunch of really cool guys who happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice <br /> <br /> Let's leave aside the unpleasant Hollywood habit of playing around with Northern Ireland's problems, as if it were a sandbox at a theme park (I read this point more broadly in the pictures of messages). If Hollywood directors want to scale the butchers of Belfast as prostitutes with hearts of gold, that's up to them. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for this. It's a free country. <br /> <br /> More shocking, though, is the fact that the film manages to patronize and insult the Irish while trying to support them. This is not politically unpleasant, it is much worse: it is incompetent. No wonder, for example, that Gere still looks so good, since he slept for the entire six months needed to make this piece of cra * p. The fact that Gere's accent is not just South Irish, but a scary parody of southern Ireland shows that the filmmakers were not far beyond the United States to make money from this film. Then there's that beautiful scene at the end, where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this movie) says he's off for coffee, offers to pick up our "affectionate" IRA man, and casually says "Ah, but there You Drink Guinness, you do not. " Yes, Sidney is right; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While we are on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original movie, the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, it just sticks around and looks like a * tw * clear. He has absolutely nothing to do besides calling the Marines at the end, and he only does this because the cool IRA man tells him to. <br /> <br /> While we are on the subject of Gere: why? I suppose it's just a matter of time before Hollywood redo Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing former Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through the 1940s and 50s in India (he's, after all, a bit gloomy and therefore a lot probably a fundamentalist Muslim). Let's not forget that Gere's character is a murderer and therefore an unpleasant job. And if he is not, why does he know the Jackal? If he is not, why does he know all his moves? And if he is, why is he such a soft cookie and such a "lovely" person? <br /> <br /> All this serves to show that the creators of this film could not bother to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters make decisions that are in accordance with their character (c) avoid stereotypes extravagant how to have the bad guy boss kill your own friend? I honestly thought this had turned into a James Bond movie, giving the "core" characters something to do (and) crediting the audience with a little intelligence. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the British. and Irish dead at the hands of terrorists, is an insult to the Irish people, is an insult to not great, but very good ripping film and an insult to intelligence. But most ?? and more unforgivable ?? is an insult to my life by having to go through the two hours of time it took to finish. Honestly, you would think that without plot, without characters and without dialogue, would end soon. But they did not even have the decency to leave early.
