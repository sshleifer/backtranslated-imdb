I've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years (not consecutively, of course). I saw the local dollar theater when I was 11, and it was so atrocious that I almost got out; I guess I did not realize that someone was allowed out before the end of the movie. Anyway, it was in my head like the worst movie I've seen growing up. I can finally give it the rating it deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (which was strangely satisfying)
