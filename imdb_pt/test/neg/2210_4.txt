This movie is the total stupidity embodied. However, I've seen this movie several times and plan to watch it several more times because, despite its sheer stupidity, it's a lot of fun. And there's one of my favorite movie actors, Casper van Dien, who's here in all his movie glory. Here, Casper van Dien is totally Casper van Dien, and you have to love him for it. If he had not participated in this film, it would have been totally worthless, or at least much more drugged than it already is. <br /> <br /> The "science" used here makes absolutely no sense. at all. No one else in the world realized that the great asteroid was approaching Earth beyond that small group? Not even thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching for the heavens for such a thing? Such a large asteroid would have become completely obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes still vaguely able to see. And a piece of the asteroid ricocheted in the atmosphere and no one noticed it? Such a rock reaching into the atmosphere would have caused huge shock waves which in turn would have caused an enormous amount of damage to the surface of the planet. Certainly, someone would have noticed something like that. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this film is so completely ridiculous that it somehow works to make this movie as fun as it is. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed is that despite the heat, all the characters were not dripping with sweat and their clothes were completely soaked. At most, the characters appeared to have been lightly sprayed on occasion by someone off camera with a water bottle to give a "sweat glow". Authenticity was not a goal that this film constantly and constantly sought. That, in a strange and hilarious way, gives this movie its entertainment charm. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Definitely! Assuming, of course, you have absolutely no expectation of anything that remotely comes close to reality. And it is your desire to wallow and revel in total weakness at the moment.
