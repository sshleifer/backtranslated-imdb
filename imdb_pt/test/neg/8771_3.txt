I'm a Christian and I've been watching a lot of Christian movies, but this one is really bad. They try to do this well, but it's very difficult for them, I guess. <br /> <br /> You can see that the movie is poorly called in many places. - You can almost think that the protagonists of this film were the only ones left behind. I think there will be many more of them. <br /> <br /> - Quality is poor, and acting could have been better as well. The story is not so bad, but it could have been better. The only thing I give is the story of this movie, but I can not rate it more than 3/10. Watch "Left Behind" instead!
