"Red Sonja" is flawed, weak and needy. Even the camp is not good. <br /> <br /> There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; It is ironic that a girl who even fears being touched by men because she has been raped still prefers to wear so little clothing even when it rains.) And the music by Ennio Morricone . Still, the film is somewhat watchable, but it's certainly not recommended. <br /> <br /> The story is extremely simple and they did not even bother to make it interesting. The story might have been forgotten if there were some good action sequences and some humor, both are present, but are seriously defective in many ways. The film takes itself very seriously and tries to impress, but fails completely. <br /> <br /> Brigitte Nielsen is a terrible protagonist. I do not know who the accent is worse; Her or Arnie and on top of that; She can not act. Also there is absolutely no chemistry between the two characters, which makes the love story totally unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who acts more evil than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was a bit good in his role, but my God, he looked awful, he has changed a lot since his (only known) role in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Maybe it has something to do with his illness that took his life in 1991? And by the way, what happened to all those "Lost Ark Hunters" actors in this movie? Alongside Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards, and Tutte Lemkow appeared on a piece of paper, it looked like some sort of reunion of "Lost Ark Chasers." <br /> <br /> The only times the film gets a little interesting is during (sword) fights, even though some of them are unnecessary and weak. <br /> <br /> Just really watchable for fans of the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> 4/10
