I really wanted to love this movie, and not only because it had Aaron Eckhart in it, but I thought the premise would be cool because I like movies and shows that revolves around chefs. The cinematography was good but, besides turning around chefs, everything else is very clich√©. Oh and Little Miss Sunshine was very annoying in this movie, although Abigail Breslin seems to be a bit annoying in every movie she is because she plays a lot of roles where she's whinny. It has some decent flashes of cooking, but the food did not really play a major role in the movie than I expected it was a big disappointment to me. This movie had good potential, the cast was great, but they only had very little to work on. I like a good lighthearted romantic comedy, but that was just bland. And more than it should be because it seemed much longer than it is. It's not a terrible movie, you just will not miss anything by not watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
