Dir-Mark Dindal: Fast-paced and frantic animation effort by Ted Turner's animation group looks a lot like TV cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of ​​sympathy characters, but definitely has extremely unpleasant villains. I do not even know why kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about it. Mediocre effort at best, despite the raves in the box, comparing it to Disney's efforts like Aladdin and Lion King. Do not let this fool you - there is no comparison in history or quality.
