This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen, and that the plot he has is very scattered. The plot is lacking in content, suspense and subtitles, as what appears to be plot is in Russian. The set seems to be just a room with various lighting effects and the moment you think something good is about to happen, you are disappointed by the total lack of acting, drama, suspense, horror, blood, plot and mythology. The steering style was made to death (the fisheye camera). It seems that the only action in this movie is in the last 10-15 minutes and the action is aggravated by the inability of the actors to portray the suspense correctly. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog ​​barking at the surround sound.
