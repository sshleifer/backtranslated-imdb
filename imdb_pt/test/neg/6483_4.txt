With Al Jolson at the height of its popularity and Warner Brothers' Jazz Singer being the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would produce some vehicles for their own Jolson-esquire characters. But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation for being the first half-talkie, Matinée Idol does not have the voice of its star (the now obscure Johnnie Walker), and has to be content with only his visual antics. <br /> <br /> Matinée Idol was one of the first driving duties of the renowned Frank Capra. Capra's first feature films for Harry Langdon reveal an overly showy and excessive style, which made Langdon's already mediocre antics almost impossible to see. A couple of photos later and Capra learned to relax a little, with a fairly regular and decent camera job. However, he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy. The longest comedic routine - the performance on stage - seems to have some good jokes, but it's cut at several different camera angles, and there's no chance the comedy will naturally flow from the performances. Theoretically, a lot of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are many of them and none of them is especially funny. <br /> <br /> Of course Capra would eventually mature into a dramatic and romantic drama. director, and you can see him starting to develop in this regard. He cuts the line, approaching the love of Walker and Bessie in the scene as she sets eyes on him for the first time in her Don Wilson standing up, neatly establishing the speechless connection between them. Then there is a handsome and handsome framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is very reminiscent of the love scenes at Capra's departure in the early 1930s. Johnnie Walker, Columbia's response to Al Jolson, did not is an exceptional talent. His comic timing is good, but there's nothing to detach him. Bessie Love, on the other hand, is a great actress too, with a very expressive face. Congratulations to her for getting involved with physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, that resounding and cheerful actor who seems to be in absolutely everything in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Matinée Idol is one of those photos he has won. more than his fair share of attention thanks to his director after having made a handful of masterpieces. By itself, it is a very uninteresting work and, like most of Capra's work, before meeting Robert Riskin, a disappointment.
