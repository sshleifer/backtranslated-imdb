Producers of this film must be sued for misrepresentation of copyrighted materials, ie the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Players Handbook. Fear and ignorance generate the kind of irrational propaganda that inspires the crap like this movie. If any of you have any doubts about the innocence of Dungeons & Dragons, why do not you go to your local hobby shop and sit in a group of games then you can see for yourself that D & D is nothing to to be feared
