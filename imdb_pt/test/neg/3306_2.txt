Warning: This may contain SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> First of all, I watch a lot of Lifetime movies and realize that they are just that ... Films of life. Some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately this movie falls into the last category. It actually started with some potential ... single mom and divorcee (who leaves work at 2 am) cuts a guy while driving home from work and let's just say he does not do very well. The chase immediately begins with phone calls and turns into your house being invaded and completely destroyed. Then she goes to her mother's house at night and the next morning her mother's car explodes. This seems to be just a pain in the ass for our heroine who handles this by going underwear and jewelry shopping! So the police put her and her son at a local motel to stay safe and what Mommy does? She leaves to work leaving the child alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza !!! I could not believe it! Then it gets really stupid! And the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.
