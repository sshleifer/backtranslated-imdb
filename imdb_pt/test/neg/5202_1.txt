This is a horrible movie from almost every point of view. Since much has already been pointed out in previous reviews, let me focus only on "Serbs" and "Delta Force" in this film. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniforms that the "Serbs" use are not Serbian. And the helmets are wrong, too. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors who interpret "Serbs" are not speaking Serbian, not even a language close to Serbian, unlike "Behind the enemy lines", where the Czech actors made their presentations. better speak the language and add at least a little credibility to the film. <br /> <br /> 3) The Serbian "gray-bearded general" looks and acts like an idiot, firing his gun whenever US soldiers call his name: - US soldier : "Gravic! Give up!" <br /> <br /> - gray-bearded general: (shoots his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Get out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (shoot your AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! You're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: AK47) Propaganda: "Excuse me, sir, you idiot general with gray beards, look, we're out of space and I've sent the boy to buy some more, but he's not back yet ..." < (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when does the Army issue AK47 to the Delta Force? I think they could not find enough M4s in Bulgaria, but there were lots of old AK47s and they practiced blanks;) Maybe they should have gone to some airsofts, they are cheaper and would not have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway. .. 5) In the scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time. No sane person with any weapons training or just common sense would do that. I think the actor noticed that his level of freshness increases the more he holds the gun that way. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to common sense.
