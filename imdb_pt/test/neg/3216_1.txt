Not long ago, I came across this DVD while browsing Netflix, and with such an impressive cast, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> Never before have I seen a movie try to be a new version of a great existing film (Scarface) and failing so spectacularly. <br /> <br /> The main question seems to be a complete misunderstanding about what history should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "bad guy". His spectacular rise and eventual fall were not sad, it was a great (and the only logical end) for someone who lived such a life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as director, writer and lead actor, sees Kilo as a kind of hero, or at least a complicated guy. However, he does not want to do the hard work of creating a realistic and likable character. He was raised by a white mother, except for six months of his childhood, where his father, a gangster, showed him his life. For reasons never fully explained or even mentioned, he decides to be a drug dealer and actually heads for the bad part of town, tackles two drug dealers and says, "Hey, I'd like to buy some drugs." He drops his father's name, and apparently in no time they are not just rich, the two guys who are providing him are acting subserviently to him for reasons once again never explained. Chapa wants you to feel bad when your character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. However, since he has dealt with large amounts of drugs, why should anyone feel sympathy for him going to jail this time? The most obvious case of Chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his execution in the prison of a White Supremacist / Rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in prison because he practically has to rise, it's done, he moves on. But in this case, they have to make Busey not just a rapist / pedophile, but also a white supremacist. Slightly exaggerated, do not you think? I will not go into detail on this much more, but his desperate message of "PLEASE LIKE ME! I AM A GANGSTER COMPLICATED!" failure at all levels. As much as they tried, I did not feel bad, in conflict or sympathetic when their friends are killed (after a firefight), his wife is also dead (soon after she called him a bad father and during an escape attempt) when he decided that it would be OK to walk next to a car full of gunmen while his wife is in the car), and his eventual death. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that your performance can be summed up so badly, its only achievement bringing the term "wood" to new heights. Busey should be credited for actually putting effort into her ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach is playing her director in the role of Prison Break. Robert Wagner is looking for a salary. Faye Dunaway, while a dramatic twist, still transforms into a better performance than this movie deserved. Brad Dourif is in the movie for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give credit to the film, he makes a single Scarface in a way - Jennifer Tilly now holds the title of "More Ridiculous Attempt of a Hispanic Accent". (Sorry, Robert Loggia.) In short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a poor story arc, unsympathetic characters and successful performances. I would advise Mr. Chapa to relieve the forced sympathy next time - in fact, we do not need to like your character, we just need to be interested. Better luck next time.
