Of course, Raw Feed Video is smarter than all of us who waste our money renting this movie! They will make millions of video rentals and their low budget investment will be rewarded, which will fund "Rest Stop II" (sadly). I think they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand American dollars to hire the actors, rent the rest place from the rest and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle behind the truck for a little more to pay for the technical stuff. That's it. We should all be as smart as these guys, I'm not going to beat them by having the genius to promote a stink in good monetary returns. The premise of the film was good, and it could have been a really appropriate horror film, but failed to deliver a clear story. I'm always looking for a beginner's jewelry, but I did not find it here and neither did you. I'm just sorry I wasted $ 3.99 plus tax to find out.
