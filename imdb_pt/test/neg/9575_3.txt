Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a formula for rejuvenation, Marnie sees the opportunity to become beautiful. When she is denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and it becomes beautiful. But the formula underscores her worst and it does not take long for her to leave a series of bodies behind her. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the phrase "as exciting as seeing paint dry"? This practically sums up Satanik. During the film, one of the characters utters the phrase: "Something so horrible, it is inconceivable". I was not sure if he was talking about something in the movie or in the movie itself. I am very disappointed because I had high hopes for this. Satanik had possibilities, but they are never realized. At every opportunity, the plot has Marnie doing the dullest things imaginable. The writing is horrible. And part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so attractive and can not carry the movie on her own. <br /> <br /> Another big problem with Satanik is the direction and editing. It's a mess. We see things and places that have nothing to do with the movie. The camera takes a long time after the scene ends. I can not think of a single shot that I can call anything but not original. This group of filmmakers exhibits little in terms of imagination or talent. <br /> <br /> I may not be familiar with the Italian comic book in which Satanik is supposedly based, but I'm sure it has to be better than that.
