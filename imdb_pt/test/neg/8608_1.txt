.... then why on earth would I see "Sexual Lives of Potato Men"? Answer: Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook. Vegas I saw live and I really enjoyed it. I think he's a clever and unique intellectual comedian who manages to maintain extreme disdain. Crook I know only the best comedy of the last 10 years along with "Alan Partridge", "The Office". Like Gareth, he was simply hilarious and I was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen. <br /> <br /> OK. So me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the movie was really funny just because the mediocre absurd dialogue and jokes of Ferris and Dave was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of Vegas and Crook. They're meant for better things (they've done better than ever) and I even believe Vegas would make a decent and straight actor. The trivial scenes in which he says he misses his wife almost come close to touching, although the ** SPOILER ** stuck in the scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife, needed to be stretched, simply was not believable . And throughout the movie, Las Vegas only seems to miss his wife 2 or 3 times. <br /> <br /> The film was grotesquely bland and bland, well, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. No, I add, when it was shown on the screen. Tolly's free explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why it was not at all funny, and just made me feel a little sick. Also totally unnecessary was the inclusion of Jeremy's character nudging his nose before showing a close-up of the bogey on his finger. Only him nudging his nose would have lifted a smile, he was a pathetic character and would have just made it seem as low as possible, but showing the snot up close was no longer needed and rancid. <br /> <br /> One scene that I found hilarious involving sex was Vegas in the trio. His monotonous conversation with the second man only highlighted the fact that the trios are not always infinite with ecstasy. Not that I know ..... <br /> <br /> That's all I can really say. I'll end it, and that's actually my main criticism of the film. This should revive the British film industry. It's no 'Trainspotting' that's right ... it's not even a 'Love Actually' (you would have to have a heart of stone not to vomit on that), and 3 million pounds could really have been put into a better project. 'Mike Basset England Manager' was a little-known and wonderful British comedy, and was made by less than 3 million people. I just hope the BFC learns from 'Sex Lives of the Potato Men' and does not get so free in the future. Although the terrible reviews that this movie is receiving are just improving the box office hits. (I.e.
