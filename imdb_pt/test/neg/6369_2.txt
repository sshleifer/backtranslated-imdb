I recently went to theaters to see the new version (2007) of Bridge to Teribithia. Then I went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. I must say I was extremely disappointed! I found the older version to have a horrible performance, as well as lines like Jessie saying, "I know Dad, but I hurt myself too much in" after Leslie dies. It was horribly done and the cast was not much better in my opinion. I watched in amazement all the time saying that it is no wonder they have redone. The story is great, but trust me, spend the money and see the new version, if you see the old one, you may never experience the true magic of Teribithia.
