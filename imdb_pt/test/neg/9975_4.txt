I was hoping that "Born to Kill" was an exciting, high-tension noir movie. Instead, it has two good action scenarios (one at the beginning and one at the end) and a wonderfully atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamorous" cameraman and an astounding credit for a noir), but the rest of the film is very boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psychotic kick but it's a strictly numbers presentation, mechanically shaking what the audience expected of him after "Dillinger" (an overrated movie, but at least better than that). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have any public appeal, and the action (as it is) remains so resolutely inside that damn San Francisco house that the movie becomes claustrophobic rather than genuinely exciting. It is one of those films in which supporting players - notably Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose homoerotic character itch for Tierney is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise quite obvious script) and Isabel Jewell - out-act links. Nor does it help that nearly half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the portrayal of psychopathic murderers on the screen of "Psycho," Tierney is so coarse and obvious that he might as well have "PSYCHO" tattooed on his forehead. . In addition, there is no indication in the film as to why the novel source was called "Deadlier than the Male" - but perhaps James Gunn has made the female characters stronger and more interesting than in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a true disappointment of Robert Wise, who already had some quality films and would go to a stellar career.
