It may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want Just like watching the TV news, everything has already happened, a big tsunami hangs over a city bay and CUT, there is more to see, Tokay suffers a great earthquake, someone else has seen more than the 5 seconds I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use a disaster film title, please be kind enough to show me THE DISASTER, pd after watching this movie watch JISHIN RETTO or any GODZILLA film to satisfy the movie part who was willing to see screaming people and collapsing buildings they had not had a chance to make in this movie. Do not get me wrong I love catastrophe movies and I love the original Nihon Chimbotsu and Jishin Retto, I even like the last Poseidon, not much of a story there, but a very good and graphic disaster sequence, New Nihon Chimbotsu loses point as often as pearl harbor or the day after tomorrow, but at least these two movies show good sequences of disasters, and also enough with expensive FX that shows nothing, give me false constructions if you want as long as you destroy properly, I know I should sound like a sadistic freak, however I went to see love, actually when I felt like going to see a romantic movie, grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn: t. there are also a series of TV called snoozing chimbotsu made in 1975, I have on DVD and it is much better
