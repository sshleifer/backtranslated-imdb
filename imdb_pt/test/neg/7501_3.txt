The main premise for this film is the fantasy of every woman: a vagina that kills and eats men. Well, at least it's a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man. What is it, 99.9999% of women? But do not worry, it's not a bloody kind of man-eating. It's more like a comic that sucks like a drain plug. There is no blood or parts left behind. So for fans of blood, guts and gore, forget this movie, there is not much here. <br /> <br /> The two main characters in the film are somewhat unrealistic. Helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. Meanwhile, Dennis is a cool guy who chases Helen. <br /> <br /> The story is a bit silly at the moment, but then they release two more equally silly sub-stories that just send that movie to the bad. Territory of the movie B. The first new sub-story is about Dennis finding a new love with a pair of Siamese twins; and then eventually kill one of them and become a fugitive bank robber. The second new sub-story is about Helen finding a new love with a legal cop who rescued her from a bad date related to prostitution, and decided she wanted to marry her. Dennis and Helen finally meet again at the end of the movie in totally unbelievable circumstances, and magically Helen's killer vagina is healed!
