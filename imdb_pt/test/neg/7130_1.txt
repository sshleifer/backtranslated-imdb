This "remake" is a complete misfortune: so mediocre, cheap, and prosaic, that it deserves no more than a pair of spiteful lines. <br /> <br /> It is also a fraud, with a laughable script served by such a device. and amateur "acting", you are always aware that there is a scenario, a camera, a farce, no direction, no suspended reality to allow you to immerse yourself in the story. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic and suffocating tension of history. the little spaces and rooms of the original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 and 2) are almost lost here in exaggerated settings and spaces. But worst of all, the moral enormity and the unbearable suffering, that both gave a ruthless logic to the original mother and the child victims turned into relentless and vindictive ghouls, are completely ruined by absurd absurdities and haunts of boogie-hollow man style. <br /> <br /> If the American public is not willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow this kind of paternalistic nonsense instead, they merely deserve this pathetic curse: the movie itself.
