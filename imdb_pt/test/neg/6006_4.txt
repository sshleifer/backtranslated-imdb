This movie was really poor. I went to the theater expecting something exciting and instead I had the opportunity to hone my abilities to "guess the next twist in the plot before it happened." Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon for all to see. Nothing was truly shocking. In fact, even the gore was received with such a complete suspension of the belief that it really did not contribute much. <br /> <br /> Over-thinking and police officers talking about crime scenes made it seem like everyone else fake. And the scene in which Lambert's character is struggling with the clues and attaining his "investigative epiphany" goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected of the public - little. Probably the most irritating aspect of cinematography was the "X-File" treatment: every building in the film, whether the police station building, a house at noon, or a hospital, suffered lack of noticeable illumination (not to mention the lack of patients) 'in the case of the hospital). I can not remember a single scene when someone turned on a light switch. Surely it would have been good. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert really is not an Oscar-level actor, so I suppose you have to take this movie for what it's worth. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this movie seem more fun is watch it after watching "The Warriors". Otherwise, you are left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal, and not even close to the equivalent of such films as "Silence of the Innocents."
