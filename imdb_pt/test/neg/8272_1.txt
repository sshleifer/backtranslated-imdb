This movie tries to give the impression that the classic bad Canadian movie: "quirky" and obnoxious (some) characters; "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; a "peculiar" cafeteria or restaurant (cafeteria here); many shots of Canadian material for postcards (ocean material here); much mention of "I have to leave this city"; absolutely booooring. <br /> <br /> And it succeeds in every way. <br /> <br /> Something to note, though. I could not figure out if this movie was just trying to be a "quirky" post-Northern Exposure comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. The editing of this film jumped absurdly from one thing unrelated to another with zero pace or motivation. Not to mention the fact that in half the time we did not even know where we were jumping. Take for example, the opening shots, of screaming teenagers in a car. Who are they and what do they have to do with anything? And this sub - uh - plot (use this word loosely) in children who seem to extend for generations. I do not think they actually do, but the edit does seem like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to the current time. There is? What I lose? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Except for laughter. Or you want to try quitting in the inept edit.
