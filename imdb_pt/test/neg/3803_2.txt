I accidentally picked it up on the intermediate channels. I immediately recognized almost everyone in the cast, with "groovy" haircuts aside, and I wondered what kind of movie could attract such a cast of stars past and future? Not having seen the original, I figured it might be the Poseidon Adventure, since it was obviously on a ship in distress. I was wrong! I can not imagine why any of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with this garbage. There is no story, the performances seemed forced, the characters a parody of the usual roles of the catastrophe film that are suddenly gathered by an event, and begin to pontificate on the real meaning of life at the level of the philosophy of stickers. <BR> It's only worth seeing the unusually terrible performances of big names like Sally Field, Michael Caine and others. They must have needed the money badly. Can we blame the director?
