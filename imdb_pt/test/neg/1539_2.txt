So, I'm wondering as you watch this movie, did the producers in this movie save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging her "before" Miss Congeniality outfits? Could Mrs. Bullock also get through the role of channeling "before" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very stereotyped. Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a slightly darker Gracie Hart with more story back and quickly become a snooze party. <br /> <br /> The two bad boy serial killers were made before (and better) in other movies. Just like the character "good guy trying to protect the partner despite the evidence" has been seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the movie can surpass two dimensions or try to be anything but banal stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last thing - using the term serial killer is misleading advertising. Murdering a person - even premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you're not a serial killer or even a bender killer.
