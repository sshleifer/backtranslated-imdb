Maybe this has been * An important movie * and that's why people rate it so well, but honestly it's not very good. In hindsight, it's easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the magnitude of what was really going on in the ghettos, so you can not blame him too much for the disconnect that affects a modern viewer, but the disconnect remains. <br /> <br /> More disappointingly, the film is just clumsy; It's as if Chaplin had no idea that movies had progressed in sophistication since the age of silence. The ensembles, those involving both the Jewish barber and the dictator, do not flow to each other; they just sit there like discrete pieces of plot that progress in leaps and bounds, changing SOMEWHERE but never coming to resolution. Some are funny, some less. <br /> <br /> What a charm the film has strictly in Chaplin's own person. His parodies of Hitler's speeches were the best part of the whole thing, and there is no denying that he had a physical grace that was pleasant to watch. But pretty much everything he got around to was IRRITATE. Hannah was very American. The Storm Troopers were very American. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I do not know what purpose was served by having Garbage being the source of evil behind the throne. It almost seems like the movie is saying that if it were not for evil influences like Garbage, Hynckle would not have been so bad.
