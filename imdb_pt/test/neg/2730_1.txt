I was subjected to this pile one Wednesday afternoon when my mother-in-law was watching. I can not overcome someone basically doing a remake of a high-budget Hollywood failure ("the CORE" with fallen actors like Luke Perry). If the high budget failed, what makes people think that making the same movie two years later with no budget would go anywhere? I was laughing for most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was (actually I'm shocked that it's not stuck in Legal instead of being broadcast on TV), and since it was basically the CORE screenplay just remade badly, the that if you saw "the Core", you know why doing it worse is funny, since the NUCLEUS was already so bad that it was funny. <br /> <br /> If you like to laugh at REALLY bad movies, this is going to be your alley. The only thing I can say is that I would like Luke Perry to be able to have a career because he is not a horrible actor ... he just plays hideous roles. Crap made for TV movies that only work on television during the day is almost one step closer to the end for him, if it were not for 90210 he would have a career.
