How many monstrous tree movies can you see in a lifetime? Well, I'm going out on a limb and say one. This movie is best watched late at night with a pack of 12 beers, the sound off and you and your friends doing. On a Pacific Island, a young man is sentenced to death by consorting with the "evil Americans" (it seems that your loving wife has slept with the sorcerer and they put him to So he promises to come back and take revenge. <br /> <br /> Before you can shake a stick, the goofy natives rush to the American scientists' house screaming "Tobanga comes!" <br /> <br /> It seems the young corpse did just that like Tobanga, the walking tree monster. <br /> <br /> Yes, your revenge is terrible (and so on) it is this movie.) It seems that these natives can not escape from a heavy tree to throw them into quicksand, to throw them into mounds etc. Soon the new king wants to change his wife or kingdom by an ax or a chainsaw. /> <br /> General problems with this movie are numerous. Relief from comedy is a woman. er with a cockney accent (as this movie needs comedy). You want her to die on her first appearance. The protagonist is weeping. The protagonist is a bastard. The acting is made of wood (pun intended). The dialogue is hard and heavy. The natives have Brooklyn accents. The monstrous suit is pure laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this is a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. He gets a 3 in unintentional laughter alone. Your dog may rank it a little higher, but only if the tree is not mobile.
