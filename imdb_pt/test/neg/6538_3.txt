I saw this in the independent cinema of my town - no surprise, because no mainstream cinema would want their fingerprints in this train crash. <br /> <br /> Camera work is very disturbing. The constant displacement, refocus and zooms can induce a sensitive person to be sick. It looks more like a movie student project than a serious movie. <br /> <br /> Although well-played, the characters are immovable. Josh is dishonest, always trying to manipulate situations and people in his favor. Without any context for Emily and Josh's relationship, she appears as an insecure and insecure girl who is desperate to get married. Rhett is an emotional baby, unable to understand the complexities of human interaction. Without any redeeming qualities, I did not care what happened to any of them. <br /> <br /> Obviously, some people liked this movie, as the couple sitting behind me was laughing hysterically. Of course, they might just have made fun of it. I could hardly blame them for this.
