I can not remember the last time a movie was so annoying that I left. The Weatherman and The Island were both so bad that I thought about it, but I still stayed to the end in those. This movie was incomprehensible, not funny and just continued and continued. Like some other commentators, I wondered if parts were just French humor that I did not understand or if the characters were serious. I finally gave up and tried to doze off because I did not want to bother my husband if he was enjoying it, but he noticed and let me know that it was okay if I wanted out and out the door. He would like to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died etc ... (I do not even care).
