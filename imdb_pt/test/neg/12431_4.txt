Choose a stereotype, any stereotype (be it racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and I bet you'll find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Hispanic teens are stupid, hairy, inarticulate, and dirty troublemakers? Are the Hispanic girls crazy about sex, easy, hot sluts? Do all blacks want to start fights and carry guns? Do all homosexuals play themed parties with pink drinks and ask the boys to model them? Are all white teens rich princesses who are bored with white boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to any of the above questions, you, my friend, are a fanatic and will LOVE Wassup Rockers. Director Larry Clark likes to shock his audience (I was 15 years old the first time I saw Kids and I think that's why I'm still a virgin) but Wassup Rockers is not shocking? it's just bad. He tries to be bold and realistic with his minimal dialogue and hair-body close-ups, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a teenager's fantasy. That 14-year-old boy does not want to be a skateboarder who gets into trouble, hits parties, drinks 40s, and the hot, rich white girl says his uncircumcised penis "looks dangerous?" In addition to this demographics, I really do not know who's going to enjoy this movie.
