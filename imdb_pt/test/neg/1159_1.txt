Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, was the inspiration for famous movie killers like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the sickest and most disturbing murderers of all time, I watched a documentary about him, so I know his story very well. When I saw this, I was curious because I thought it should be like a documentary reenactment, but I must say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. First, the facts are completely wrong, with a few minor exceptions, and secondly, this was just a stupid Hollywood story, when those terrible murders really happened and they ended up becoming a cheap buck. Not to mention that if they were to make a horror movie, that would be badly executed! Ed Gein, he lives in a small Wisconsin town called Plainfield, but he has a little secret by which the whole city is being affected, he has unearthed corpses as well as brutally murdered people. Bobby, a deputy, is in the case to get Ed Gein, just, no one knows who the killer is in the first place, just finding the crime scene after the crime scene. But things get "personal" when Ed starts messing with family and friends of the cops. <br /> <br /> Of course this film was simply ridiculous and completely insulting to the real story. I've always found that misinterpretation is a necessary tool for a horror movie, but for that story, it should have been a better movie, not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid horror movie and clich√©. Please stay away from this movie, it's completely pathetic and false to the story of Ed Gein. <br /> 1/10
