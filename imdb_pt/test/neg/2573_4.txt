Since I'm not a big fan of Steven Seagal, I thought this was a very good movie. It is evident that his fans are very unhappy with this drama that lacks an abundance of martial arts and brute force. <br /> Gailard Sartain plays a self-proclaimed patriot leader of a militia in an impasse with the ATF for gun violations. He surrenders with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who has become a field doctor, who is pressing to find the antidote to the lethal virus that has crippled a small town. Her grandfather's native herbal remedy is in salvation. <br /> <br /> Remarkable appearances of L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My personal favorite in this movie is Whitney Yellow Robe. She is impressive and seems to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role. Despite the improvised ending, this was a decent movie that could have used much more action.
