My roommate and I foolishly bought the 'The Roller Blade Seven' video from our local second-hand video store in the hope of finding a bad movie to laugh at. This movie is neither laughable, pathetically poor, worse than Jack Frost 2 - and that's something. The script, acting, production, acrobatics, sounds, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts, the actors did not even learn their lines and are blatantly improvised or, in one case, have the lines read out of the set and simply repeat them. Set in the post-apocalyptic 'Wheel Zone', the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film, many of which are edited poorly or repeated ad nauseum from several different camera angles to make the film longer. This gets tedious very quickly. The plot does not make any sense (it's apparently an amalgam of two books written by Scott Shaw), there's not even seven of them, most of them are not on blades, they're wearing roller boots, and it seems to me that mostly the movie was completely sold in the fact that there are about 3 minutes of semi-nude female in it. Writer and star Scott Shaw obviously imagines himself a bit like a Samurai and throughout the film performs some very bad stunts and made sword fighting moves that seem massively amateurish. Despite all this, his website claims that the film should never be compared to a traditional movie, because it really pushes the boundaries of modern cinema. My roommate and I were speechless with all the ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the video, she decided it might be some kind of ring-esquire video curse that needs to be passed on. If you see the video in the stores, take it from me! Leave it alone!
