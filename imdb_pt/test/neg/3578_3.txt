Good actors, good director, well represented, well directed, but ... Where's the movie? Did they have a script or did they just improvise everything? At least it's a short film (only 80 minutes, including credits). Nothing seems to happen in this movie, absolutely nothing. A couple of small drug dealers caught on small time issues, but you'll never have a clue what's going on, not even what they're talking about in some movie sequences. Tons of "f ***" and "motherf ***** 's", but nothing more ... <br /> <br /> For people who love the films of Abel Ferrara, such as The Funeral, R Xmas is going to be a big disappointment, as it has been for me.What was he thinking? Did he really think this was a good movie? And if he did not, then why did he do it?
