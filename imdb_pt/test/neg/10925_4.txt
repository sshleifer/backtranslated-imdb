I mean really, really, REALLY high and this movie has a chance of entertainment. I do not want to say loud regular, I mean the loud, where reading the phone book would have you in points. otherwise save your time in life and do something more constructive with it, like banging your head against a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny and the master of the Shatner hams) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve (the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies). Not without the laughter (again the chemical aid is crucial) and certainly not without offending the politically super sensitive (which I am always in favor of), but in the end not worth the time out of your life.
