I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel to the movie that did not need a sequel. <br /> <br /> Chili is back, but Rene Russo is gone without a peal. Unfortunately, the Chili game was played in the first movie and instead of finding an interesting personal bow for him, they just keep him repeating the lines of the first movie. It is very warm. Travolta looks old here. It's like they move people around him because their bones are getting squeaked. Her pink lip gloss and the blue-eyed contacts are very strange. The second bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a musical producer, a role that requires her to be just the woman Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey, these kids have a great new sound.") In any scene, it hits the wrong pitch, either motivational or emotional, or both. It is painful to watch. Although they are a lot of problems, Be Cool gets better after a not very promising start. <br /> <br /> I certainly had fun with that (Vince Vaughan running around, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, -shirt that says "widow" about him), but does not offer great memories after it's over. It is a festival of love with helium light from the first frame. There's no one so ruthlessly stupid as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's just about doing good in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first one was not a plague. <br /> <br /> Working on (repeatedly) jokes and phrases from the first movie is annoying, as is the stupid concession to rock wrestling fans (he raises his eyebrow twice), as well as Drugs Inside Jokes: Steven Tyler saying, "I'm not the type of singer who makes appearances in movies" air. <br /> <br /> The spectacular all-star line-up is part of the problem. The first movie was not overwhelmed by "stars". <br /> <br /> For a dollar rent, let's call it yourself.
