Staten Island filmmaker Andy Milligan is well known in the horror community for being a director even worse than Ed Wood. And with that as an obscure example of their departure, I am able to agree with them. In "The Ghastly Ones" we basically have three fighting couples traveling to their childhood home (located on a conveniently isolated island) to collect an inheritance. There they are killed one by one and events unfold in the form of murder / mystery with a healed retarded humpback butler added to play it through a loop. The film is in such a bad state that it looks like someone just went through a dishwasher, the sound is terrible, the dialogue is out of this world, there are some primitive mannequins (plus some dismemberments and guts) and is technically inept in all possible ways it may be inept. But is it fun in a bad movie? Kind of. It is excruciating to watch but strangely entertaining in a train disaster fashion. Approach with caution. If you're not a fan of horrible movies, it's better than that.
