To be honest, I've never been to the Congo or Africa, and after watching the TV movie Heart of Darkness, I do not think I want to. The film completely shames the book to the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best I read, after watching the movie, it seemed to enjoy the book a hundred times over. Nicolas Roeg, the movie's director, did a horrible job portraying Joseph Conrad's novel in a movie. I give Roeg some credit for trying to try the impossible by making the book in a movie, but that may not have been the job for him. The film could not express any part of the novel beyond the basics of the plot. The scenery and scenery also lacked the beauty that Conrad portrayed from Africa in the book. In the book, Marlow had seen so many great wonders, but in the movie you did not have the same experience. No, I'm not blaming everything for the director; the acting in the film was simply terrible. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the movie, I felt as if the actors were not emitting emotions, as if they were reading the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not portray Marlow's sense of adventure on his journey to the Congo. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz should be risky, but I did not feel it in the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you've already read the book. He does not come close to doing justice to Joseph Conrad's novel. Conrad's words capture the reader and take him on the journey with Marlow, in his quest to find Mr. Kurtz, where the film did not happen. A great novel, but a very poor film. Heart of Darkness, the film, is based on the book written by Joseph Conrad also called Heart of Darkness.
