That's how I left when I left the movie. I could not leave because it was at a film festival and the movie theater was full of people. I was stuck in the middle. Stuck. <br /> <br /> The tiny fragment of the original footage that attempted to unite this film presents some of the worst performances ever to grace the big screen. The daughter had a remarkable performance - stood out in the bad sense. <br /> <br /> Thess's cinematography was horrible, consisting of a disjointed framing and some of the strangest lights I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... well on the first ... <br /> <br /> Wait. <br /> <br /> Why am I reviewing this movie? Why do I recognize their existence? Please do not watch. Do something useful with two hours of your life and go see some paint dry.
