This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! I waste my time on this. I watched this movie completely as I took a punishment for myself. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? has no continuity. It looks like he just shot scenes and then joined them in some editing software !!! The music is good, but the movie does not need as many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what the role of Celina Jaietly in the movie? Bobby Deol is good. at least he can take action! Upen Patel needs to have some acting classes instead of taking off his shirts in almost every scene! The end was the most pathetic! <br /> <br /> I watched Shakalaka Boom Boom after watching "300" (the movie), you can really imagine what I felt about this bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect bollywood, but please directors and producers, real, not everything is fancy!
