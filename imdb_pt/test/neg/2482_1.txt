Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can not believe people dig this crap. Most shows on television are pretty bad, and this has been a race trend for a while now - they keep getting worse, but Las Vegas definitely takes it home. What a terrible show ... <br /> <br /> The actors are a bunch of C + losers that never got anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows what he was thinking when he signed that position?) so it's not their fault that this show sucks. They just can not help it. Blame the producers and the writers. I can not believe they filmed this and were really proud enough of their work to convey it.
