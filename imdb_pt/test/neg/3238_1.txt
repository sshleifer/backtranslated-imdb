Every time I think about this movie I feel physically sick. To read such a good book and then find out that there is a movie of it was a great feeling. Years later and I imagine my joy in connecting the science fiction channel and discover that it starts in just 5 minutes !!! Until the titles go and then uggg. If only a few things had changed OK. Everything is changed. Numerous characters are removed entirely new ones are added. The main hero is shrunken and aged for about 30 years, and hilariously his girlfriend / wife is now his mother! Even the dog is reduced to sub-lassie abilities. This is a truly shocking movie at its absolute worst. I would be very happy to remove my own nails with a pair of pliers instead of sitting through another horrible sight, and I ask everyone to think about watching it - please do not. If you have a copy, burn it now, and think about how much better your life would have been if this celluloid insult had never occurred.
