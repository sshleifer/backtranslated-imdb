... with a budget of $ 500 and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of C movies without talented actors, a ridiculous storyline, cheap effects and lousy camera work, this movie delivers. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is warned. You could probably make a similar movie with some friends in your backyard and on a home video camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is good for a few laughs. Watch with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie. <br /> 2/10 for unintentional comedy. <br /> <br /> Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I've seen comments with fewer rows and writing this is just a lame fill.
