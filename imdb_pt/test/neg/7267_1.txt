Honest to God, the Outline pretty much says it all. The planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by a strip-bar of L.A. cheap. There are no strippers, so the latest male visitors go out to recruit strippers. <br /> <br /> Men are confused with kings or imprisoned for spying on women (despite being a planet of women, we only have two women participating in any sex scene of girls and women) and eventually, as always happen in science fiction clich√© movies everywhere, women are convinced that men are good for something. Well, not the men who made this movie, anyway! <br /> <br /> But, boy, we get to see a lot of that, in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity. This has less plot than usual for these movies, so change the channel if you do not like that kind of movie, and grit your teeth if you're into that sort of thing.
