A sadly predictable and clich√©d story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. Unfortunately, too, the script is from the once great experimental novelist John Dos Passos, from an original by the Frenchman Pierre Louys. This time, Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a Spanish beauty manipulating and cold-hearted. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) raised her from the cigarette factory, but she abandoned him. He warns his tall, young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but without success. A duel follows, Concha censures Pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she has ever cared for, so he does not: he points his pistol to the sky, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with the young winner, she returns to the man who would have died for her. With an unexpected part of Edward Everett Horton as Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the role of a Spanish woman, constantly moving, twisting at her waist and posing, then writhing, shaking, shaking her head, and so on. And she grimaces and has a bunch in the middle of her forehead. The photograph is strangely crowded: no external scene can be filmed except for a tangle of bare trees, no internal scene can be filmed without such busy details that it is almost impossible to keep people moving around the room, no consecutive Dietrich scene can be shot without a big change of wardrobe. The carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers that it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
