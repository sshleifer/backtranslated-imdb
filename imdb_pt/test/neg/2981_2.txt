I saw that this movie was coming out and could not wait to see it. I have to say that I was very disappointed with that. This would have been better as a mini-series. The whole show seemed very rushed. They did not explain things very clearly. In the end, they showed John Paul II alive and well and the next scene he was dead. Never any explanation of what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC dropped the big ball into something that could have been great. All in all I think this movie was a blur. It looked like a drunken monkey jumping from one spot in John Paul's life to another point, never explaining how or why things happened. Like when his older brother leaves, it has never been explained that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home. Besides, when your father dies, all we see is the father lying on the ground and that's it. I was very disappointed with the movie about everyone.
