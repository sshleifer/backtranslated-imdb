This is the worst Italian movie of all time, possibly the worst movie of all time! Joe D'Amato of course is not a cinematic genius, but many of his films are interesting and watched. Unfortunately this is not one of them. It's boring and boring .... waaaaay boring. If you want a movie for MST3k, get Troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone in a coma, get deep blood!
