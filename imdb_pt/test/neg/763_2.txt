For a scientifically engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to the little crime, the CHOMPS was an idiot. <br /> <br /> All I saw in Chomps was sit, walk or run. Or run, then walk, then sit down ... and then go up again and stretch out, and then walk, and then run to K-Tel's dance hits. And sometimes he had all the answers to the daily Jumbo. But, most of the time, just sat quite a bit. <br /> <br /> All I'm saying is: In a Celebrity Death Match, Chomps could not get Mr. Bigglesworth out.
