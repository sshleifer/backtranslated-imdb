Bruno of Daniel Auteuil in Petites Couperes is a middle-aged model of his Pierre in La Separation 10 years ago of Christian Vincent. In both films, youthful trust in the ideology of the left and love (mutual metaphors) disintegrates in paranoia - manifesting as aggression trapped in Pierre and desperately comical womanizer in the latest Bruno. Unfortunately for Auteuil fans, the actor has become dependent on a uniform world fatigue (not unlike compatriot Johnny Hallyday in Leconte's l'Homme du Train). Acting is not, and it becomes quite frustrating as the movie progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as writer / project director. His sequencing of episodes superimposed on connection symbolism can not mask the film's lack of rhythm. I was particularly enraged that Grenoble's impressively dramatic / romantic scenarios were made almost redundant by a cameraman who was obviously shaking with the cold. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas almost rescues the show with his female counterpart Bruno, Beatrice. She dramatizes the intended stunning contradictions like Bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal. Bonitzer, however, can not support this, and the signaling plot requires Beatrice to straighten out on another bourgeois mannequin. In doing so Bonitzer shows then denies Scott Thomas the Oscar cabinet. The submergence of all the characters in the bourgeoisie can be a viable and tragic result, but in this case it is an output of a cadence. (as opposed to the brutal and painful outcome of La Separation). A serious disappointment, 4/10.
