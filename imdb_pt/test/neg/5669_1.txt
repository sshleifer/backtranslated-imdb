If you think Hannah Montana or Suite Life are at the bottom of the comedies, then obviously you've never watched iCarly. ICarly is undoubtedly the worst show I've ever seen. From the lifeless performance to the low budget, the show smells low-priced, as last week's Chinese food left to boil in its overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a beautiful, cheerful and "supposed to be". A funny girl named Carly, as she and her friends do a live show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who seriously needs some counseling or something, because he has few cells that have no brain. <br /> <br /> The tangles of the shows are highly ridiculous and unbearably annoying. But having to watch Carly and her friend, Sam, doing their little iCarly show inside a show is even worse. They basically show strange pictures and stuff things in the nose while laughter plays over and over again. I mean seriously, every two seconds the laughter seems to come for no reason. <br /> <br /> So, what is the purpose of this review? you can ask. Just to ridicule iCarly? Well, yes, but I'm also telling you to be careful with this show. Why seriously, if I had to choose between watching iCarly and Barney? Without questions, I would choose Barney.
