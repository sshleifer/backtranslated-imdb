tale of monotonous morality about a high school kid who is practically the nerd now stereotyped. He is clever but has no friends, social skills, and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from him. A pretty girl hits him (he should know she wanted something - he should be smart, right?). She manipulates the poor desperate fool to write her course work on Shakespeare, which the teacher immediately knows she could not have written. He loses the girl (not that he actually had her) the confidence of his teacher, and his scholarship, all in one go. <br /> <br /> Marv is so silly and desperate for love that he decides to steal some heroin dealers who are running the stuff through the warehouse in which he works. Then maybe the trashy little bitch will be impressed and wants to marry him. Sad very sad. Marv is such a pathetic drug (and well without a brain, for a supposedly intelligent guy, I mean, trying to steal drug dealers? Does that kid have a screw loose?) That you stop feeling sorry for him and have the terrible urge to kick him, it. <br /> <br /> The girl, of course, tells her boyfriend about the theft that Marv boasted of her, and talks to him and his companions to steal Marv's money and company. They try to do it and in the process manage to shoot several people. The cops appear at the same time, and the idiot Marv is dragged away, a total misery forever. I know this thing was meant to make teens behave showing the consequences of bad behavior, but all they really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior. What is the premature ending of your film career, of course. Goodbye, Marv, we've never met. And thank God for that.
