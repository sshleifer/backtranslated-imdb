What a pity. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests had arrived ... and then ... well, nothing really. Just pretentious nonsense. It could have been great, OK maybe not great, but it could have been really good. All elements were there, but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: NO LIGHTNING! How this happened is a mystery with everything at the disposal of the director ... <br /> <br /> ... the story was quite brave, although it certainly needed considerable work, with possibly several rewrites of finalization to fix the story and reinforce the characters a lot (the only thing that was consistently and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but I'll get to that). But the direction was terrible, the acting was just that: _a-CTin-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and a lot of ham, and then the cinematography ... well, that was something contemplate! But only if you are in "Cinematography 101 of film school, like never using a professional camera under any circumstances". Obviously, the student had fallen asleep during part of the presentation of the lecture and only heard "... use a professional film camera ..." and then, fortunately, back to la la land when the sentence was over. <br /> <br /> I can say; amateur and pretentious to the end! I can only see this movie to appeal as a Chick Flick because it's supposed to be sad, but then it falls flat and ends up being "sad" (as an excuse for a movie) ... so even those 'Chicks' would not be deceived by this schlockenspiel! <br /> <br /> PS. I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She is much better at her craft than what this movie allowed her to be, even though she was TOTALLY Wrong. In fact, I'm sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and (you guessed it) the director of photography! I say "first against the wall for them when the revolution arrives!" OK, not really, after all "it was just a movie" but maybe a good "tar and pity and running out of town" could be more satisfying or at the very least much more fun !!! <br /> /> TTFN :-(
