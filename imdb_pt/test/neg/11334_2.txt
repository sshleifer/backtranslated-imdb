!!! Spoiler Alert !!! <br /> <br /> The important thing is that I did not think that this movie had an end to ruin ... I just started watching it in the middle after Matt entered Sarah's but I was fascinated by the bizarre plot, even for a Channel 5 movie ... and could not see how Matt would end up happy. And his fiancee? At one stage it seemed like he was going to stick with his best friend, certainly icky and wrong ... and then the whole thing 'oggi oggi oggi' does not work like a buddy buddy buddy-buddy, that's ridiculous ... so was going 'surely he can not just get back to life? and yet, how can he live as a woman? and then the movie just finished, ending and not explaining anything !!!!! What is it about ??? I was so angry, I lost an entire hour of my life for no reason !!! :) but it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, so swings and roundabouts
