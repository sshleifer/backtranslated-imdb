Cujo is a giant, kind, gentle and affectionate St. Bernard owned by the Camber family, during the opening sequence Whose chasing a rabbit over fields and through a local forest somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears into a burrow and Cujo sticks his head into the entrance hole. The rabbit disappears from the sight of Cujo, whose annoyed cujo begins to bark and in so doing inadvertently awakens and irritates a colony of bats, one of which bites him in the nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) is having an affair with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real life husband) who her publicity husband discovers. Obviously, their relationship is tense. Fortunately alien to all this is his son Tad (Danny Pintauro). Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) repairs cars to live from the barn on his farm. Joe is planning a weekend with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson) when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 in the lottery and decides to take his young Brett (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) with her on a trip to see your parents.

Whose attack the car to try to reach Donna and Tad, fortunately for them the windows stay firm, at least for now. Donna tries to start the car, but it is completely broken, both are stuck with nothing but hope that someone will come and rescue them. Whose is lurking, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses its path. Directed by Lewis Teague I thought the film was a bit slow for my liking. The first half crawled, the second half accumulated a steam head, but I still felt it was a little below expected and uninteresting. The performance is good for all involved, no complaints. Technically the film is good, photography, music, special effects, editing and is usually well done. The big problem is the script by Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier and in particular is the first half, most of which seems to be filling to stretch the run time. Making it 90 minutes into the match, it looked to be on the wings. It's also a bit predictable too. Cujo as a monster never really scared me, I just do not think I'm drooling over St Bernard's weight scary, I guess. I suppose there is nothing really wrong with this, but I do not think I would be in a hurry to see it again. Average, not too bad if you can find a copy that goes cheap or get it on TV. free.
