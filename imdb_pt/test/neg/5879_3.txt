I got this movie because it caught my attention as a movie with a Jewish comedic focus - something I had not seen before. <br /> <br /> I took this film with an open mind and became interested in how it started. The opening is well crafted, and the first half of the movie gave me lots of reasons to laugh, and that's good. <br /> <br /> However, the humor soon became repetitive, the plot was confused and tense, and I realized that I did not like the movie anymore. I tried to avoid saying that, but the film became quite "cheap" - not a bad thing for a comedy if the mood holds up, but it did not. I confess I may have lost a bit of humor, not being Jewish and having little experience with Jewish culture. However, considering how heavily cabled most of the mood was in this movie, it is unlikely that I lost much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, and maybe if a little more thought was put into it the movie would have been watchable all the time. I wish I could give a better rating to the film, but strictly speaking, it would have been better as a TV series or as a series of sketches. There simply was not enough material for a complete film. One thing to say about the cast - the lead role seemed to have been drawn with Ben Stiller in mind but I do not think the movie would have paid off if it was there.
