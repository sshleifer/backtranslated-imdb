Please, if you are planning on renting this movie, do not. If you are thinking of watching some downloaded clips, do not. If I had my way, no one would have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> The acting, despite being one of the highlights of the film, was still pathetic. The principal was probably a sadist. The spirited liners were something you would expect from a highly paid 7-year antisocial children's room eating breakfast fries. The problem with this movie is that it tries to be a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (it does not associate these two films) in which it is so bad that it is funny. But he also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so much in doing so, that his sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything other than stimulate his choking reflex in an attempt to save himself. <br /> <I could go on for a lot more, detailing how horrible this really was, but I think it would get me out of my will to live just to keep thinking about it. If you need me, I'll leave trying to boil so I can feel clean again ...
