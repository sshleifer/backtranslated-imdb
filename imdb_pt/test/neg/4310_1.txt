Of course, you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it science fiction, and that's enough to interest me, so if you are like that, Black Horizon will at least interest you before watching it. The best part of the movie is when they go through some real scenes from a space shuttle launch. <br /> <br /> The film plays like the Naked Gun series, making spools of cops with bad cliches and bad performances. Unfortunately, I do not think they wanted to be funny, the actors really are made of cardboard, the dialogue really is bad, so just laugh at them, not at them. A side note, it is rare to see a movie that occurs half in outer space, half on Earth, and does not mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. I really suffer from a more realistic drama based on our space efforts.
