A pre-nerd Robert Carradine, a pre-autonomist Desi Arnaz Jr., and a near-pre-teen Melanie Griffith take the road and head to Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon fishermen. Well, their dream is as exciting as this lumpy youth road movie. They are not particularly interesting, and the film does not exactly have a point of view, other than "We have brought together the generation of some famous people and made a low-budget movie about their misadventures." Out of the cannon of the 60s and 70s street movies and rebellious juvenile films, this is a mediocre character, underdeveloped, uninviting, not very perceptive, not very fresh in history, which is as insipid as the muddy landscape of the movies . But for those who care - They go to Alaska, and apparently Alaska was like the Wild West in the 1970s because everyone carries a gun and it's violent. Robert Carradine says charming things like, "I hope we can find a shower, my follies will certainly scratch." (And he's the only one with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly stolen and forced to take up the job, and the big local boss, his employer, puts the moves on Melanie and eventually dismisses Desi for not being corrupt. That's when they are not smart and do not leave town, choosing to eat dog food or go hungry, be beaten by the henchmen, and then take a ride in the big car. The final half of the movie leaves the big bad guy while the trio commits an assault, runs and creates a sequestration scheme, and so on. The movie ends up kind of annoying and ambiguous, but seeing as they did not bother to have too much character development and story in the first place, it is quite appropriate. It's worth a look if you're really on a low budget 70's rate, but finally quite forgettable.
