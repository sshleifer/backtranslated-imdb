Opening with some blatantly reused 'Kit for Cat' scenes, 'Tweety's S.O.S' does not live up to the classic design. Instead, we have an example of the Tweety and Sylvester series of Friz Freleng, in its most generic form. Unlike Chuck Jones's Road Runner series, which tried to introduce new jokes in the same scenario, the Freleng series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'Tweety's S.O.S', then basically equals 'this time we'll put them on a boat'. It is not a totally weak design. There are some good jokes, mostly involving Grandma's glasses, but they are offset by jokes that you can see coming a mile away (the seasickness routine), and everything accumulates in another of those finals where someone other than Tweety says "I taw tat putty tat", a joke that worked well once, but has diminishing returns. 'Tweety's S.O.S' will probably tickle kids who like just about any cartoon, but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired jokes, it's definitely one to avoid.
