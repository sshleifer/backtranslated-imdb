A truly flatulent script, and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to attend. <br /> <br /> In fact, I left the theater about 15 to 20 minutes and asked for my money back. I actually got out of a movie only 3 times in my life (I'm 43 years old) and this is the one that drove me crazy enough to demand the price of my ticket back. If I could, I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn as well. This was a really bad movie, and there's no excuse. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, as someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learns DRIVE A CAR? In California !!!? (Driving a car is a rather complicated skill, and in California, even more complicated ... I should know, I live there.)
