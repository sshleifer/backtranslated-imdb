I was pulled into this movie at the beginning, to my surprise, because I did not intend to watch it. Now I wish I had not. The suspense begins well, with the hit and run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be discovered, or (doable now, despite a no-no in the old days of movie-making) run away with that. The plot has been made before - what the plot does not have - but the tensions inherent to it, with the additional complications and motivations arising from the case of illicit love, contribute to an absorbing first half. Then the film abandons the run-over and flight to embark on a cloudy display of two unrequited and suffered loves. The two plot lines - trampling and irrational love - simply do not have enough of each other, and involving the same characters do not bind them enough to justify leaving the original story. line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or another. At the end of the movie, in the middle of the second funeral of the movie, I found myself thinking, "Now, what does this have to do with that run-down and flight?" The filmmakers may find the answer obvious, but I think the film was plotted and executed with flaccidity.
