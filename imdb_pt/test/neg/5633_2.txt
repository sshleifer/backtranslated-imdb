This movie must have looked like when it was released at the development stage and getting a Redgrave and a Jacobi on board must have excited the money men. All I can say is that they clearly had nothing that week. Jacobi camped in the way that only Jacobi could do and I thought he looked more like the actor he parodied in his special guest role in Frasier a few years ago. Vinnie Jones is not exactly bad, he's clearly out of his depth as a leader. He is really very kind throughout and if this was a pilot for a TV series, he may have just got caught. However, the scipt and camera work were terrible. Why this jounalist and a Met press officer would never work together is never explained. It certainly could not have been because of the sexual chemistry, of which there is none. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and improbable storyline that you may pass as original, but the whole thing is so artificial that the two stories just do not make any sense. It was as if two stories had been edited in a confusing way for only two hours. Go and see some paint dry for a few hours. Your life will be more complete than watching this garbage
