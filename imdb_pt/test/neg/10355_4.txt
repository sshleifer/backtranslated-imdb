There's something about this show that keeps me watching and waiting for his future. In writing, the jokes are few and far between, and the story lines are boring, so I think it should be physical comedy and visual comedy. <br /> <br /> I like the camera movement, dressing game. and wardrobe. It is amusingly highly contrasted with the stupidity that reigns. And I'm sure every time I laugh, it's because of John or Molly's physical comedy. The two make a cute and sickly couple that makes me laugh and want to vomit at the same time. <br /> <br /> So, here I go to prepare for Kath & Kim one more time tonight to see which way this production will decrease (or, as the case may be, looking positively forward).
