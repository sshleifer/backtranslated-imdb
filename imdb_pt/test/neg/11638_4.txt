Made with film remake of Nana's production, the Charleston Air Sur, 1927, is described as a festive film for all concerned, and that's the best way to visualize it. Jean Renoir seems to have never thought enough to edit the pictures together. Is the plot a simple reversal of racial stereotypes? in 2028 a black explorer travels to a post-holocaust Paris where a white native girl teaches him Charleston (naturally he assumes she is a savage whose dance is a prelude to her eating it before giving in to the seductive beat of the song "White Aborigine ")). There are many surreal touches, whether the pet gorilla eating the flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, the angels the girl calls (Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger among them) or the black artist Johnny Huggins playing his role on the meniscus while Hessling's ability to dance is almost completely non-existent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but there really is not enough to sustain it by two rollers. An additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score on the new Lions Gate DVD?
