This show started well, but then it turned into a nightmare. The worst part of it was the competitors. Most of them were weird. They did stupid things to make a living and they also did strange hobbies. In season two, a guy said he spoke with his pants. This is sick and repulsive. Besides, no one cared about making money. All they wanted to do was make alliances like "Survivor" or something. Men always feared that women would unite. The women were also the same. I just could not take it anymore. I had to stop watching. It was really one of the worst shows ever.
