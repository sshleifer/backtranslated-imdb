I saw this movie with very low expectations. I did not know much about it so I was not sure it would be worth it. <br /> <br /> History did a good job at making you curious about these ruins they travel. The suspense continues when the Mayas appear and force them to remain in the ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the film changes from suspense to useless. The amount of blood found in this film was not balanced as to whether it was really needed or used more for the shock value. <br /> <br /> The fact that they made no attempt to fight against the vines of hell. They had a fire and did not try to burn it or try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly stepped into a victim role and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of the old horror movies where people just scream and scream and do not have half a brain to try to fight back.
