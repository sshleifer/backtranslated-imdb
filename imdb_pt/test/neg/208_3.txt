The movie had moments, but it was disappointing in my eyes anyway. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and thus The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, with less tension, bite and human emotion. There was some legal acting, but the story was flaccid and had no real depth. I watched the movie for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, nor were they inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for. This movie was made to death in the past and did not have to be done, consumes money that could be used in better movies. For an action movie was meager action and how a thriller did not thrill. Better than seeing the snow fall, but not for me.
