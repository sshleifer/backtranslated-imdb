The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is good - the kid is taken by a thug and raised to behave like a vicious pit bull , mainly controlled by the fact that his collar is in or out of his neck. <br /> <br /> However, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the limits of credibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny's encounter with a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who has to be the most foolish and confident a man ever was - along with his boundless stepdaughter, an endless little girl and unattractive, Victoria (Kerry Condon). I was amazed, by the way, when I learned that Victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked like 25 or 30 years to me. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly there is no romance between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny appears again, injured, what Sam does is take him straight home. Danny's out for two days, but are these idiots taking him to a hospital? Do not. I do not know if they even called a doctor. Now, Danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the start, but Sam takes him to his home, where both he and his stepdaughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange young man. <br /> <br /> Why did Morgan Freeman have such an insipid role in this film that I can not even begin to imagine. Certainly mr. Freeman is not so desperate for a paycheck. <br /> <br /> So we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who "owns" Danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that is hard to kill. The car in which Bart is is hit by bullets that would have rivaled the disappearance of Bonnie and Clyde. We think he's dead but not. <br /> <br /> So we have another car accident - and again, old Bart escapes unharmed. <br /> <br /> In addition, we also have Danny. fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where Danny decided he no longer wants to fight. I do not care how much a person does not want to fight, when it's for the wire you fight or die, I think someone would fight. <br /> <br /> As I said in the heading topic - this movie is about 40 miles out of the reality limit as we came to know it. It is not just a case of suspension of belief - it is completely beyond that. <br /> <br /> Besides, I never understood why Danny's mother, who turns out to be a good lady, instead of the whore Bart claimed to be, became mongrel. with Bart and his gang and got shot. Maybe it was my fault, I got distracted by the time the scene started-but it seemed highly unlikely she and Bart had crossed. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10 - and that's generous.
