This is another one of those movies that I remember as a kid and recently got to get it on ebay - 20 years later, it's not nearly as good as I remember. <br /> <br /> The story is 'loosely' kick-started by a 'cosmic event' (there is another extra crew member on the 'weak-history-building' credits) that causes collective ants to become super smart. The species of ants that used to war with each other have left their rivalries and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know was: DO WHAT EXACTLY? You never find out what they want. Nigel Davenport and his helper travel to the desert where the bizarre activity of the ants has been noticed, and begin to study the ants of an impregnable igloo-shaped laboratory. Probably the most frightening scene, in my opinion, was when the two scientists visited the giant plaza on the plantations (as a square version of a crop circle), a result of the chewing ants. <br /> <br /> This movie was not too scary, simply because you do not know if you are afraid of ants or like them. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can continue with their jokes - but you do not find out if they're really evil. It is not a science fiction because the explanation of the "cosmic event" is too vague to be properly taken into account. It's more of a chiller. TBH the flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with large collars and Nigel Davenports's strangely large facial hair scared me more than the ants! Did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? Yeah, right - SIX, and you will not see any other human being in this movie. Not far away! This is a clearly low budget movie that is a bit watchable because you probably will not have seen one like it. I can not think of anything anyway. The shooting of the ants is very good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the footage they needed to continue in the film. Can you very well tell yourself how Hell can make the ants do it? more and more, but it's all very simple. You will also notice that the filmmakers sacrificed millions of innocent ants to make the film as well, so the animal rights peeps STAY AWAY! Good for novelty value, but you might not watch more than once.
