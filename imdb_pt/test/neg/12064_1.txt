I'm a fan of horror movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this is just one murder after another. To my amazement: Part II is so much better and you will have the whole story of the first part summarized! So do not waste time on this and go straight to Part II, you will not regret it because Part 2 really has a PLOT and is quite self-ironic. First part: 1 of 10 Second part: 4 of 10
