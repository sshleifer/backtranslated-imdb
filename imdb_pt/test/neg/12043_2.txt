This movie really shows its age. The impression I saw was terrible due to age, but it is possible that there are better impressions out there. However, this was not the biggest problem with the movie. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film, with only the most vague dialogue scattered (just a few sentences) in the film in the most amateurish way. Sometimes the backs of the characters were turned or they were talking with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and "cleaverly" (?) Hide the fact that the movie was dubbed. Well, it's true that this Czech movie would need to be dubbed in many languages, but to do it in that way was really stupid and obvious. It just seemed cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film seemed low budget and silly. It's really a shame because there was a good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to face this archaic mess. Even with some glimpses of the nude (and somewhat sturdy) Hedy Lamarr, it's not worth all the fuss that accompanied the movie when it debuted. Even in 1933, this film was a badly done failure. About the only interesting thing about the movie is seeing how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared to the glamorous image that Hollywood created when it came to America - it looks like 2 completely different people. <br /> <br /> With an incomplete look and a technically inferior film, I do not see how he got great reviews. Just for technical problems, the movie can not rate 10 or something close to it.
