This movie describes a truly horrible event, for sure. But everything falls out of bad performances from the entire cast. It is impossible to feel the emotion of almost any character, since all emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the movie, and you get the desperate cliché, "Will I do it, Sergeant?", "Yes, it's nothing", but it works like a sketch from a Wayans Brothers movie I know if they made the war movie yet) or something starring Leslie Nielsen. The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy of Married With Children, while the fox is the biggest self-deprecating cliché of good looks you can imagine ... Thank God it curses and smokes during it. <br /> <br /> His emotional "NOOOO !!!" is definitely better suited for comedies like Back To The Future than so-called serious movies like this. <br /> <br /> To their credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without giving much, where they actually perform some pretty horrible acts) ... are well made and make us take the subject seriously . But that's though not, thanks to acting.
