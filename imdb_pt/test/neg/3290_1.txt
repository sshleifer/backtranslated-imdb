How is it that in this day and age, people are still dumb enough to think other stupid things are smart? Maybe idiot people like to see things that make them feel intelligent. Such as 'The war at home'. Cuss is even dumber than the idiot people who watch. There are no jokes, just half-jokes and little jokes that hardly justify a small inner smile. The acting is his typical, subtle, idiot and standard performance of the flute players. And why, why did this crap replace deployed development? Well, you have to hand it over to Fox. They know they need stupid programs to lure all stupid viewers. You see, the reason Arrested Development was not very popular was because it was so smart. He was so smart that he made foolish people feel bad for being such idiots. And of course, if a dumb person meets a smart person, the dumb person will hate the smart person. Most of the time, anyway. Either that, or try to steal the smart person. If you like this show, and are one of the dumb people, I really can not understand what it should be like to not have your eyes open and an open mind. I can not understand how it must be to be irrational, laughing drones, influenced by every little thing. Basically, people who laugh with a laugh are parrots. Trained, obedient, and irrational parrots. Maybe I should not insult parrots by comparing them to you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastard * in this review, it's because I'm so annoyed with the AD being canceled.)
