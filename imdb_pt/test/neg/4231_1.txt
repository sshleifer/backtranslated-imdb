The main character, Pharaon, suffered a loss of his wife and son in the pre-film past. It deals with just turning off emotionally. A very long movie, a lot of time spent on Pharaon's blank face, a lot of "road time" (one of the TV baddies: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.). Long scenes of him doing trivially - sometimes totally inexplicable , absurdly trivial - actions without reason or emotion. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this movie may give new meaning to the phrase "free sex"); Domino and Pharaon's mother are the two characters who exhibit some emotion, but not much. It's hard to say with all the characters in this film: it's an indifferent performance, indifferent writing or just indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. Characters in this movie speak very little to anyone; No wonder they are emotionally isolated, which is even more bizarre because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friends and get to know each other.
