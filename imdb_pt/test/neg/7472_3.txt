This is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater. Look at the end of the picture, totally theatrical. With the reminiscence of Les liaisons dangereuses, the last speech without steam tries to make us think that the whole (and deep) theme of this question was masculinity. Who cares about this point? It was about handling. And so the audience feels after this movie is over. <br /> <br /> Young directors: A play is told with words rather than actions. One movie is the opposite most of the time. <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about the gay topic, over exploited without a point (because there is no explanation of this topic considering the so-called "philosophical" or presumptuous) to the level that this movie should have been called Great Gay
