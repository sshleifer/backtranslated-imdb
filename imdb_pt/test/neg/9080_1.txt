This is one of the few films - perhaps the only one - that really haunted me for years. It was the first time I saw people being tortured, so much so that the blood dripped from their mouths, gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. It was brutal; the worst thing I've ever seen in the movies. <br /> <br /> Dr. Clement Molloch, played by Joseph Mayer, is still one of the meanest characters I've ever seen in movies, and I've seen thousands. He was so sadistic that I never watched this movie again, nor would I recommend it. He makes Hannibal Lecter look like Mr. Rogers. If you see tortured people is not your idea of ​​fun, then stay away from that movie. <br /> <br /> I know there are a lot of patients out there, many of them professional movie critics, who probably liked this sordid. sick history. It's a "B" movie, anyway, with stupid dialogues and some woodwork by Charles Bronson. This is not one of your best efforts. Even if it was, there are so many horrendous scenes here that you would not want to watch. Trust me.
