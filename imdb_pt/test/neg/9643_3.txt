The story is not very strong. Do not expect a kind of movie "Bourne Identity". It started strong, Tara spoke Russian and even sounded credible. (Not that I'm the Russian-speaking expert.) Moscow had that somber, depressing look that gave that potential to the movies, I still believed in it. For the poor it only took about half an hour to see that they really missed the spot with this one. Acting was poor, perhaps because the story itself was not very strong. There's this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) is having a conversation on the phone with C.I.A., as if listening to a Chinese sync. W.T.F. Too bad, the writer did not even try to give depth to the main characters. Plus, an inexpensive and easy end. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are almost all the scenes that Tara Reid is in. Not that she's acting so well, in fact, she's not. But she really looks great in this movie. Overall, it was a little disappointing. Rental material, maybe.
