This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the beautiful Lydie Denier in some of the scenes. she is an amazing woman in every way, her nudity scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante is as hot as hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway about the film, well, nothing really interesting to say, a Neonazi and a Turkish gang fight for Berlin in scenes that include people setting fire on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people shoot each other with machine guns at a place no bigger than my home and surprisingly after a few hours of shots only three die and ten are injured LOL. <br /> <br /> As gangs fight for the territories of Berlin, a serial killer is killing children and then plays them in white in various parts of the city. <br /> <br /> Armand Assante appears as the Turkish detective who, while now working for the police, was a former Turkish gang leader and is now ready to solve the crimes of the serial killer. <br /> <br /> The film is obviously a bad blow from the classic movie M. The death of children, the involvement of the underworld, the character of the serial killer. and the final scene with the "judgment" of the serial killer are more than influenced by this classic film. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the script is simply stupid, producing the lowest standards possible and in general This was a big waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother renting this.
