What I liked the most about this film was the chance to see Joan Woodbury, who impressed me as one of the many beauties of Charles Boyer's classic "Algiers" in a leading role. She does as well as Rita, an orphan who rises to do good as a lady crime boss. Its climb to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford's characters, for example. Mildred Pierce, who realizes his ambitions for determination and willpower. If you are looking for a classic film noir, better look elsewhere. At various points, it is difficult to know where this story is going. At first I had the impression that this would encompass Rita's plan of revenge against her father and son who cheated her to bring rap by a drunk driving death by her playboy son. But the turnaround turned out to be only a minor point, and a stepping stone to the confusing second part of the film, in which Rita becomes more and more involved with corruption in the cities. Anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so a second preview should clear up any questions. My copy is from a platinum box set called "Mobster Movies". The quality of the image is good, but the soundtrack is a drug, constantly ignoring fragments of dialogue. There are eight movies in the $ 5.50 box, making each movie a 69-cent fair. Look for Anne Archer's father, John Archer, as Rita's childhood friend, Bob. Alan Ladd does not get much time on the screen. It's definitely Joan Woodbury's photo.
