The Fear of the Dark left me with the impression that several different scripts were written, very short for a feature film, then snapped awkwardly in this Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> At its best, the protagonist, Lucas is scary. As difficult as it is to draw an account of the secondary characters, they are much more understanding. The Fear of Darkness could have reached mediocrity if it had taken only one approach and seen it pass-and made Lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of macabre and discouraging. I wanted to see him packaged in an asylum so that the rest of the characters could have a normal life.
