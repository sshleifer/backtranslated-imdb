Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. I'm usually proud of being able to enjoy any movie, no matter how bad, but that was too much. I would just suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get through the terrible plot and dialogue by watching him in the dumb, camera work even more terrible and the poor quality special effects make this movie a real horror. If you are thinking of watching this because you are a fan of Sandra Bullock, do not bother because she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced by baboons who would do a better job, at least we would not have to hear the terrible dialogue.
