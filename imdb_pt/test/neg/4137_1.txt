A holiday on a boat, a couple, an angry waiter and a wreck is the reason for this movie to begin. <br /> <br /> I like breasts. No question about that. But when the main character joins anyone who has more fish at the moment, especially having sex with them and playing the role of constant victim, my anger only rises to a new level. Take two guys (a husband and another man), put a female bomb in the middle of them, open a deserted island, subtract all your moral problems, ad a lot of moral issues for men and mingle in a large bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you'll get to a piece of junk movie like this. <br /> <br /> The acting is, I would say, good. There are some mistakes, but not many, as far as I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to their lack of moral values. The man with the most fish gets his attention. Even though one of them is her husband, she sees no problem in being unfaithful to (another man) the other man because "I must do it to survive." How can you justify having sex with another man to fish when your husband is 30 yards away? And he's not even going to benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no problem justifying anything she does. If she can not get approval for her actions, she is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is the kind of film that will make almost everything you see this year be a nice movie experience.
