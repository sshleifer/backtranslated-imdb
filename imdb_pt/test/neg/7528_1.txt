PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its messy plot and horrible action. <br /> <br /> First, let's face the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues with outrageous rage throughout the film, which is due to her enormous passion in becoming queen of the dance. However, it becomes completely unknown to the public why Cherry wants to become the first dance queen. Even before the directions are read, it spreads through the school with a constant lack of interest in being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. Why does she care so much about being the prom queen? Apparently, Brooke Balderson performs "acclaimed", but in reality just spends the whole time with a face of rage, trampling, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you give any young actor / actress a script that only requires him / her to act insanely annoyed, you're not asking too much. You also are not allowing the character to perform very well. <br /> <br /> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection with his character. When harassed by her director, she knocks him down (after several seconds) without feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing. Her lines are read as if she were reading trivia on the back of a cereal box. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of their kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal sitting in their basement. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry is killing several female candidates from the prom queen, and no one notices or cares. (Yes, I understand, I understand, the whole town is worried about the ball, very realistic, at least you could play some funny scenes with the cops, but that may be asking too much.) For example, right after Cherry drives around the school and slaughtering a handful of students, Beth is found being interviewed by local media. The reporter mentions "the shooter" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but a second later asks, "What do you think of guns in the hands of minors?" or something to that effect. Where did the reporter come to such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the queen of the winning prom and the ball is dismissed, with the media appearing again, Beth simply adds that "she understands that (Cherry) needs to be heard "and goes away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm and unchanged way. No one bothers to the fact that they just witnessed a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention students constantly stationed in a yellow zone, and no one seems to care that there is a sudden surge in violence in the city, Julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at (Maybe I'm a little off the scene, but the last time I knew, high school parties did not involve naked women dancing artistically in a pool of water while men bob marshmallows and everyone warms up in their attitudes "I am so indie and mod "), the horrible acting of her parents with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply waving with everything the mother has to say (and not in a fun way too) along with stupid scenes like the new black director chasing after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give to this film is that the photograph is wonderful. The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and sharp at every shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the acting and the script are not.
