This movie is beyond Horrible AVOID AT ALL COSTS !! I want my time and 20 minutes back !!! <br /> <br /> Nothing funny, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. Jura pours out the speakers like a waterfall, each getting more boring as the last, and not contributing to the comedy or plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a lame $ 5, thin film - "Out Cold" - but tremendously horrible. The film centers around two groups of a city, Poories and Richies (how obviously dumb?), Where the two opposites have snowboard battles between each other. (story is much like the bedtime story of a 4-year-old without all the swearing and stupid jokes) <br /> <br /> MOVIE - 1/10 - because you can not give lower grades
