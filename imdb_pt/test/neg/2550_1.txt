First, the title of Mexican Werewolf in Texas is misleading, as many others have pointed out. In fact, it is El Chupacabra, which is a creature resembling a werewolf, but it is by no means the same. <br /> <br /> Production and editing are simply a drug. When it was over, I probably would not be able to give a very precise description of what exactly the Chupacabra looked like, since whenever I was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions) the camera was all shaken and you could only see the face of the monster clearly. The special effects were ridiculously bad, but this should be expected from a low-budget horror film. <br /> <br /> Along with the terrible production comes the bad actors. Now a couple gives very plausible performances (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors (all others) who seemed to have no emotion when people died. Then there's the absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson), who does one of the 2 worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I mean, my god, she was indescribably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texan town killing locals and a group of teenagers are looking to stop it. However, even with the plot being so simple, some holes have been able to leak. <br /> <br /> Anyway, horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie to have fun and laugh with your friends one night, this would be very good. My friends and I had fun watching it. Probably the second worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Horrible.
