Slow and weird movie that creeps and flows (I mean really PLODS) along with its disappointing climax. You can expect some kind of punchline at the end, but there are none. Both Milland and Snodgress make awkward performances; in fact, the strangeness of the film may actually be the only thing he has for it. The generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music it plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving ... a gorilla. (**)
