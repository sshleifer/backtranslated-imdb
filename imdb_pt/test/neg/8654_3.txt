I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. It actually makes sex seem so annoying and makes me wonder why bothering. I do not really think about all this remotely speaks of how the second generations of Indian Canadians feel about sex. Anyway, did you know that the first drunken hotel / idea was copied from a Korean movie, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or so? This Korean film was really brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time it forces the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and the difference between man and woman in experience and thought. I mean, most of the hotel / drunk segment Neal N Nikki was emulated, take by take. Can not Bollywood filmmakers try to make just originals, please? Seriously, I've never liked a Hindi movie that is an imitator. The ones I like have always spoken Indian sentiments through Indian cultural media.
