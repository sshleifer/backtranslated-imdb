If you want a horrible rendition of "MacBeth," then this is your answer. Filled with archaic Shakespearian English language in a 21st century Australian setting, this movie lives to disappoint and leave you scratching your head. But that is not all. <br /> <br /> There are not only second level action sequences, but there are many scenes in which the female body is displayed. Witches, played by actresses who resemble schoolgirls more than witches, exhibit a soft pornographic display with MacBeth in a show of affection nothing remarkable. Welcome to stupidity and depravity - all at the same time. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder why this project received a green light. So much for modern cheesy movies. "D-"
