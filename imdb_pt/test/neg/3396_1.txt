This is my opinion on this film, expressed in their dialogues. <br /> <br /> To be more serious, I can not say that this movie is a bad time, but I also did not like it. <br /> <br /> First, I was simply indifferent and could not focus on the monkey world. Even if the makeup was very realistic, the constant screams were annoying. That the film has changed the monkeys to cats and that it is a cult film for me in relation to my liking for the second. <br /> <br /> The second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of the newcomers (Macdowell & Lambert), but I felt alienated: the whole story is located in a large British mansion: it does not matter how luxurious it was, it was like a prison to me. <br /> <br /> Finally, it might be a good idea. adaptation of Tarzan's story of the Burroughs? I do not know, never having read the book (or seen at Disney). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not have good moments to remember, so a visualization would be enough for me. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "Overture" in the beginning ... What is the meaning? Only the director knows that.
