History of a former Marine who is now a medical combat officer assigned to a state-of-the-art Russian submarine with a nurse. This is to respond to a request for help from a dying member of the original crew. The submarine was overtaken by terrorists who are engaged in destruction. Then we see the pair try to regain control. And this happens with the fear of the US Naval Forces is about to unleash everything it has on the terrorist submarine to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Be careful about the explicit sexual scene early in the first quarter of the movie. A couple of unexplained scenes at the end. Watch when you have time. Nothing to lose, even if you let the show run while you have a cup of coffee: slow moving.
