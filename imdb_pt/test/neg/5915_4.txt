Produced at a point in his career, where he had the power to do whatever he wanted, Eddie Murphy took on the task of producing, directing, co-writing and starring in HARLEM NIGHTS, an expensive but finally empty-looking gangster saga a group of black night club owners / gangsters who ran an upscale club during the 1930s, led by a cunning sniper (Eddie Murphy) and his adoptive father (Richard Pryor) and his attempts to avoid being invaded by white crooks who think they are taking that, it seems, they think it is theirs by right, simply by virtue of their color. That was an idea that probably looked great on paper, but it definitely missed something in the translation. This was a vanity piece for Eddie and I think he spreads a little thin here trying to be the whole show here. Of course, it was a pleasure to see Murphy and Pryor together onscreen, but the rest of the great support cast, including Arsenio Hall, Redd Foxx, Della Reese, Michael Lerner, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, Thomas Mikal Ford, Stan Shaw and The Brother of Eddie, in fact, has very little to do (though I admit that Murphy's fight scene with Della Reese is hysterically funny and probably the best scene in the film). Murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it appears on screen. The art and direction of the set are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an Oscar, but this was a big miss for Eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats.
