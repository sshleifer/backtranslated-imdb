Riggs and Murtough are back, but the magic of the first movie has disintegrated. The story is just awful! I mean, South African diplomats smuggling the mystic Krugerrands to the United States. It's painful! And the accents are absolutely lousy! Nobody gets a South African African accent, right? Or do we always hear the English or Americans making them sound like drunk Dutch? The only guy who got the Afrikaans accent was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that I did not like was when Danny Glover describes an Afrikaans accent as being bullshit! I mean a slap in the face of Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this movie to make me vomit. I mean, Mel Gibson's character is like that against the diplomats, but then he sleeps with his fellow A type! Do not waste time watching this unseen movie. If you want to see a movie that does not completely insult a cultural group, rent Die Hard 2.
