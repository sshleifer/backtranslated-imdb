I discovered "The Patriot" in a DVD store and thought it could be a real action thriller. No, it's a low-budget movie with a ridiculous story. It is undoubtedly a cable movie and not one for the theater. Fortunately, after 90 minutes, the movie stops, otherwise the public must have taken an anti-virus against sleep. One thing came up: it was the good country in which the film was shot. You can really feel the American air, but that's all. I hope for Steven Seagal that he will finally achieve a great success. No need to see why my wife and I voted average of 4/10.
