You know, I really have a problem with the movie listings. I was reading Maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 Greatest B Movies of all time, and knowing me, I naturally have to go through them and watch all of them and write reviews of them all. That's why you see reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. Then I noticed H.O.T.S. in the video store the other day and I recognized from Maxim's list of the 50 biggest B movies, and I decided to rent and check. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B movies, so I already knew I was going to suck. <br /> <br /> Given the type of movie that is, I can not say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure, since it's nothing more than a T & A movie from the late '70s, and never fakes anything. The only place where he distances himself far from his goal is in an irregular subplot involving some ex-offenders who hid a lot of stolen money in the house that the self-styled H.O.T.S. switch to, because this subframe has absolutely no place in the movie. Despite the rest of the film, this subframe is completely superfluous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a pair of rival brotherhoods in the beloved FU, which exists as one of those universities that contains a total of one brotherhood until the rejected ones form their own in order to return the snobs in the other. This new brotherhood, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is a sisterhood supposedly based on helping seals (the seal subframe is another one that does not really belong to the film, and little attention is given to the meaning of that name apart from having a seal running through it. here and there throughout the movie). <br /> <br /> This will sound strange, but in fact there was a scene that I was quite impressed with this movie. A shot that I was impressed, I must say. Halfway through the movie, one of Pi's rival sisterhood girls is pouring alcohol on the punch, and she serves a glass for her and drinks. Strangely, what she does when she drinks this alcohol reminds me of something Charlie Chaplin would do, which really brightened the movie. Obviously, nothing in this movie comes close to anything Chaplin has done, but that shot alone increased my score for the movie from 2 to 4. As a whole, however, the film is exactly what you'd expect it to be, a lot of people running after looking for excuses to take off my clothes (I liked how the piece of a piece of clothing for each score in football game at the end was one of the ideas GIRLS. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii There are, for example, a scene early in the film , when some Pi girls put hot sauce on the refreshments of a local restaurant. party, accidentally get caught in an incriminating photograph (the girl who took the photo did not realize she photographed them at the time), although the photography will never appear for any reason later in the film. <br /> <br /> I've seen movies like this before, it's like Gator Bait, but without the violence and the rednecks and Coffy was not far behind. Even Barb Wire is the same thing, only with a bigger budget and more silicon. Fortunately, Maxim's 50-year-old B movie list contains just a few more comedies, because while these T & A teen movies are fun from time to time like bad movies with the occasional semi-nude scene, after watching H.O.T.S. I think I've decided that I like the bad horror films more than the more comedies. I'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretending to be afraid of pretending to be funny.
