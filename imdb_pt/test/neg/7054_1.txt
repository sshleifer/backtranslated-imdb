My brother was working at a movie theater when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and I still left. I saw a lot of movies in my time, but that was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I mentioned this movie in less than a second. This movie is bad because it goes from one set-up to the next, it encourages stereotypes about blacks who are falling ill and the flow is horrible. If you want to see how to make kids cry and vomit at the same time, study this movie. Ok, this movie is not good "bad", but lousy. If you are like one of those people who watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you will not get through this very short film. Please, for God's sake, destroy all copies of this movie.
