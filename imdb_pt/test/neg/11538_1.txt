It's not enough conspiracy for a real movie, but too much for a porn movie. <br /> <br /> In a galaxy far away, a good princess (we know she's good because she has long blond hair, wears a white toga, is educated and is dreaming wistfully with her dying mother when we see her (and we know this because she has dark hair and uses a lot of makeup, abuses her male sex slaves, mocks and wraps her lip all the time, and speaks imperiously about the The princess of evil gets upset and tries to stage a coup, but the good sister walks away to Earth. Of course, she materializes naked in a bar during a wet T-shirt contest. the action seems ridiculous, the dialogue looks like it was written for a pornographic movie, and the overall plot is ridiculous.There is not even enough skin to make the kind of person who watches the skin happy.I love bad movies "good", and this it's neither pleasant on a "bad movie" level.
