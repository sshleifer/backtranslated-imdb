I rented this movie when my girlfriend was away, hoping to see some serious military action / expert. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes watching this "movie" I was so terrified and horrified and sick of the quality of everything in this movie I was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flamethrower. Luckily I could not find one. I've seen a lot of bad movies. But that's not even bad, it's total rubbish and it does not even deserve to be counted as a movie here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the people who were involved in drafting this total misery. I hope you win some Oscars though: D.
