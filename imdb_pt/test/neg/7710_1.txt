oh man where to even begin ..... <br /> <br /> Dropping his weapon to engage melee with a zombie while holding a bitten soldier debating to shoot him b4 he turns, then he turns and bites the person who holds him, turning his back on a "fallen" zombie, continuously shooting his chest and seeing that it does not work, so they shoot the chest a little more, having the idea that a boy fell on a table with blood coming out of his mouth is still fine, walking down a football pitch as if nothing was wrong, then suddenly noticing the zombie football team doing whatever was in the middle of the field as if they could not be seen until that point .... <br /> <br /> I could go one for a few more hours, but you get the point ..... childish writing and dialogue, bad directing, horrible special effects, truly sad and undeveloped plot (campus infested with zombies, it must catch the viral host and then erde it .... twice), the only more I can find is that this does not include real game clips du touch the "action scenes" .... I will not spend your money, but I would be more upset with the loss of time, I saw in the cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back
