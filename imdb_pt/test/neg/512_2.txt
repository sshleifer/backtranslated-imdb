I think vampire movies (usually) are bad. Even though the movie itself is not so good, I still like it because there are vampires in it. But that stinks. This really gives a bad name to vampire movies. <br /> <br /> For starters, cheap price really shows. I do not usually bother with low budget movies - one of my favorite movies is El Mariachi, which costs only $ 7,000 - but I hate it. The stock also carries a crap, resorting to an elegant camera that gives headache. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say besides not watching it. I bought for Â£ 1.50 as it was an ex-rental and I feel cheated out of my money even for this low price.
