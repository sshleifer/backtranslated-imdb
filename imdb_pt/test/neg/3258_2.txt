Caddyshack II is one of those photos that makes you ask "Why?" As in; 'Why was it funded?': 'Why was it done?' and 'Why was it released into the public domain?'. <br /> <br /> To say the least, it's a bad movie. It serves no purpose but to underscore the superiority of its prequel by establishing an almost identical set of characters against each other in a plot similar to that of a "New Money" land developer attempting to purchase the sanctuary of the golf establishment. <br /> <br /> Face soon making the follow up a total of 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre. I mean, if you're going to profit from a great success image like the first one, then you have a window for a few years to do it. But leaving 8 years means that the formula is not recent enough to simply follow up, or a poor imitation like this, then its kind of forced to reward the fans of the original giving them at least reference to actual contributions by the actors who made the first so memorable. But there is little or nothing of that. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get cheap imitations. Okay, Ted Knight's passing in the intervening years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable Judge Smails, but the inclusion of Robert Stack as "Chandler Young" (a WASP elitist fellow similar to the Smails character) is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the kind of anarchic frustration that made Knight's turn so watchable. Jackie Mason's "Jack Hartounian" is a faint attempt to recreate the non-stop jokes of Al Czervik's character Rodney Dangerfield. Although Dangerfield's role was infinitely quabble, Mason's is completely forgettable. eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu <br /> <br /> Tom Everett, whose shrill voice simply splits its sides with frustration as opposed to intended laughter. <br /> <br /> Randy Quaid, brilliant as Cousin Ed in the National Lampoon's Vacation series, is just the opposite here playing the unstable Hartounian. lawyer. The stares of disbelief demonstrated by the fact that the actor saw the hilarious characters of Quaid's character inappropriate violence echo those of the audience. You're not laughing. You're just asking 'What the hell is he doing?' <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase appears, be it occasionally and wisely rather than fleetingly considering the disaster that is going on around them, as the professional 'Tye Webb' club in the movies only make direct reference to the original, notwithstanding the golf course itself. With his deeply tanned skin and high Hawaiian shirts Chase looks like he just came back from a long summer vacation and needs a salary. He distances himself from the events of the real image enough that he takes away the guilt and leaves with some, everything is little, credibility still intact. <br /> <br /> Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter, 'Kate' takes on the role of 'Danny Noonan' from the original as a teenager battling against the class divisions. Sounds ridiculous, does not it? At least in the first Danny (an Irish Catholic of a blue-collar family) and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the world dominated by Protestant White-Anglo-Saxon motorists and golf club shakers were thrown out for some memorable pieces As being fired by the resident Lutheran bishop, as well as being ridiculed by the sons of the local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment about his father's inability to fit in is suggested by his Jewish roots. That aside it may also have to do with being a classless idiot, but that complexity is set aside, though I stopped caring a lot before being resolved. By the end of the day, Noonan was trying to make progress in life. Miss's biggest problem. Hartounian is to make hobbies of the local golf club like their multimillionaire father to get a meeting with the prodigal white son of the club. Or I did. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in short, it's badly written, badly scripted with fake parts and wastes a lot of talent. Really compliments if you were able to go through this to completion. It's really a penance. There is this question mark, however, why so many original actors did not return, instead of being replaced by artists who, on paper, at least seemed to be the same. Maybe they just have not been asked. Or maybe I suspect they actually read the script. Stick to the original !!!
