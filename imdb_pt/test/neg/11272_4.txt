In this film, there is a loose plot of a man (Bardem) who wants to get financing for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love (Maria de Medieros with wide-eyed eyes) in the process. He keeps his relationship in love with his first and true love, and finally gets entangled in his own romantic web. He never gives up his juggling, until the three main characters face each other. The film is boring, with a lot of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, incoherent and, of course, very stupid. None of the characters is believable, which makes the movie a bit annoying. Anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a poor directed film, which makes it a bit interesting, but if you can, watch another movie, please!
