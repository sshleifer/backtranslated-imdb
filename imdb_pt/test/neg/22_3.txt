When you make a movie with a child-murderer premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can make it as realistic as possible by creating characters and plausible situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing for laughs (something the creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" did, for example, matter as well controversial: a holy killer). People who did "Bloody Birthday", however, do not do any of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of a child's image with a gun (or a knife, or a bow, or an arrow) in their hand. The result is offensive and stupid. The whole movie seems like a bad idea that was rushed through the production (and then left out for several years). It is redeemed a little by good performances of the children, but it is very badly done. (* 1/2)
