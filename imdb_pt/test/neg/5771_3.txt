Certainly expected more after seeing the cast list, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think a director for the first time could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler did it intrigues me without end. Somehow, the budget allowed them to guarantee a group of List D actors whom they managed to embarrass for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were just terrible, except Steve Wastell, who does a decent job like Axl. The story is so bad it does not need to be mentioned. The overall value of production seems standard, with some above-average camera work if you can get through the slo-mo scenes and the painful "burning person" sequences. I knew I would be dumb, I had no idea how dumb and, unfortunately, is the time spent that can never be returned to me. I suppose if you enjoy very bad "B" movies, this might work for you, but if you value some story, this is just terrible ... A complete waste of time.
