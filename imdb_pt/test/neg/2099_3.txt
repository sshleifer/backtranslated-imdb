Looking back on the year 2006, one of the things I remember most is the "Snakeamania" on the internet for a movie called Snakes on a plane.But, unknown to me, there was a direct-to-DVD movie called Snakes After see this, I feel it is, at best, a B movie below par. <br /> <br /> The plot: <br /> <br /> A husband and wife take a train to go Los Angles, to get help to form the uncle's husband who is a shaman. This is because the family wife does not approve of her ruining him, so they put a curse on her that snakes will "become her". I thought about a sixteen hour drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers includes a former police officer Narc and some drug dealers. Will they be there in time before the snakes take it? <br /> <br /> Watch in the movie: First the effects: I have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a bloody way, the main effect takes you to wait eighty minutes to see! Unfortunately, it's bad that they completely kill any good memories of the movie (the movie makes videogames of the 1980s look like T2 next to it!). One of the things I noticed is that there is no script credit in the movie! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic that it spoils the whole movie. Final view of the movie: A B-Movie below the expected, with an incredibly bad end.
