I know everyone said that this movie was absolute crap and I agree with them. I spent a few years after seeing other people telling me it was crap. I advised them not to see it. But when it came on TV, we saw the ad. I turned to the family and said, "I know this is sad, but I plan on watching it." My sister turned to me and said, "Yes, me too." And you know what? It was funny. <br /> <br /> No way this is a good movie. It is absolutely a waste of time. But it's a good waste of time. You may still think it sucks and fair enough, but I thought it was a funny comedy. I did not like a few pieces, like when the fish was hit by the car, but other than that I thought it was good. I loved sitting there and choosing all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald etc. <br /> <br /> So if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. Otherwise, watch a drama or something.
