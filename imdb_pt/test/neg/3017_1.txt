This is what the station statement says after the commercials for this show "some scenes can be disturbing for some viewers". <br /> <br /> It is beyond disturbing. The validation of this whole exhibition of ego and chauvinism framing lies in the fact that it is in the channel of COMEDY. Yes ... a true and true comedy. A JOKE. Seeing these 'playas' go through their rigid charade really explains what's wrong in society. Especially the meat market scene. Both sides, male and female, are equally weak and desperate to mingle in this superficial atmosphere. The club is obviously one of those cigarette corporations sponsored plastic coking scenes. These people have a choice, and that's what makes it even more of a joke. <br /> <br /> These idiots try too hard. They shine with their own groove grease. This is OK. It is a lesson about video tape for the new generation of how NOT to focus on a potential heart interest. I hope this facade collapses along with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is who is aligned after these characters disappear? The bastard sons of the one night?
