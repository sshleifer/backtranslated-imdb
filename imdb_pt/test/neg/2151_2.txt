I'm not sure if this is just a bad movie or if it was meant to be a mockery of a Western "B". The plot was like that, but the filming, editing and acting were just plain bad. Also, the music in the background was annoying to the end, too loud and just non-stop. Many times you could not see the dialogue about the background music. I'm at SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and I do some Wild West scenes with them, and a lot of the actors are members of that group, which is why I bought it. If you have no interest in this group of people, or in that sport, you certainly would not have that interest in helping with the film. The performance of even the veteran actors (particularly Stella Stevens) left a lot to be desired as well.
