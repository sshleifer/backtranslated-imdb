Ok, I can sit in almost every movie, and I usually have fun with Sci Fi Originals, but there was a big flaw in this movie that made me have to shut down half an hour for that. Having served in the US Army, there are certain expectations in a movie, including the military. At least some similarity of attention to military rank, uniformity, and terminology is needed if you expect the viewer to really enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction in the lapel, and later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 am, but it was dark out there. Even if the script was done perfectly, and the dialogue spectacular, and the performance worthy of the Oscars, if the people who make the film do not care enough about the film to bother looking for the correct way to display military time Why did someone bother trying to watch?
