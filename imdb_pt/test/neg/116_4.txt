Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934), was a decent movie, but I have some issues with this movie. First of all, I do not blame the actors in this movie, but more or less, I have a problem with the script. Also, I understand that this movie was made in the 1930s and people were wanting to get away from reality, but the script made the character of Ann Sothern look weak. She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as if she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He really cared about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did, giving her in the end the fickle Neil Hamilton, which in my opinion was only out for a long time. The character of Paul Kelly, despite being a workaholic was a righteous man and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton, while he was very fond of her, I did not see the depth of the love he had for her character. The production values ​​were great, but the script could have used a bit of work.
