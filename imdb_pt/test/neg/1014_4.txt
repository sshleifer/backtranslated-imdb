The third in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) becoming a vigilante to take revenge on the thugs who murdered his old friend. I do not know why this movie pushed me into this, but somehow it did. I found myself rooting for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them I felt good. This movie is not taken seriously, but what if it was? There is a good build up to the end of fireworks in which Bronson goes in a tumult. But with regard to acting and plot, it just does not measure. If I lived in that neighborhood, I'd leave as fast as I could, but it seems like people are asking for trouble. I know there is this mindset that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. I had to give a grade 4. Of course there are good scenes of "exploding", but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64 years old. I'm sure if those thugs really wanted to, they could do the same with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This film gives you a sense of joy. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. In short, this is far from the original Death Wish, but it is very good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shooting.
