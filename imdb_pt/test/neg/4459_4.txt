Although I had enjoyed Dracula's SATAN RATS (1974), I knew I should not expect too much from his predecessor even more slandered! Certainly the smallest of the Hammer Draculas (Marcus Hearn in THE CREEPING FLESH's Audio Commentary [1973] goes so far as to call it the studio nadir!), The film really fails because of its lack of firmness - and now embarrassingly dated - to (the modern scenario really suited SATANIC RITES) ... even if, truth be told, it is still much preferable to choose Dracula 2000 (2000) or VAN HELSING (2004)! <br /> <br /> Despite the vociferous attack on Christopher Lee's film, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire (even though he seems too small and inexplicably confined to a scenario); Similarly, Peter Cushing offers his usual compromised performance. The only other outstanding work noteworthy in the film is given by Christopher Neame (son of director Ronald) as Johnny Alucard (!) - even if it's only because of how incredibly Hammy is! Unfortunately, the two female cast members (both regular terrorists) - Stephanie Beacham and Caroline Munro - can not outgrow their physical attributes. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is Dick's. Bush (who had shot BLOOD IN SATAN CLAW [1971] and, for Hammer, When DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH [1970] and TWINS OF EVIL [1971] - but perhaps best known for his former association with Ken Russell) who manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage fight at the beginning (appropriately Gothic); the hysterical sequence of the Black Mass, followed by the resurrection of Dracula; and the final confrontation between Lee and Van Helsing of Cushing.
