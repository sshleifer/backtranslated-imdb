I've been watching a lot of Asian horror movies lately, but this has to be the worst so far. It started interestingly, but lost strength after the first 15 minutes of the film. The added "drama" scenes, flashback sequences and serious plot holes left me hanging. What really happened in the tunnel? Just "something terrible" ??? Who started all the kill if it was not the ghost? What did she want me to come back to her ????? No answer, whatever! Overall, it's not scary at all, and the filmmakers need to have far better ideas than that ... <br /> <br /> One plus point was the cute actress, but that's all. <br /> Not recommended.
