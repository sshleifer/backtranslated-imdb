If I wanted to if Jack Black were the lead actor, I would have walked away from that movie immediately. In fact, some of his films look good compared to this movie. This movie must have been filmed as a cartoon for ages 3 to 8 and would be much better. It's nothing but a bunch of stupid sketches from other movies together to make a big mess. The movie looks like it was filmed in about a day with no thought behind it. There are times when it seems that maybe there will be a turning point and the movie will actually have a plot for the movie or at least one plot would unfold, but the stupid sketches inserted would have spoiled the whole movie.
