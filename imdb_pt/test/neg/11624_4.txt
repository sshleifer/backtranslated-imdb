I was disappointed with the Swan Princess sequel. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married life was going to Odette and Derek, but the story was not interesting enough to catch my attention and it seemed to cover the same foundations as the original. <BR> It's not funny. The only thing I found funny was when Jean-Bob was turned into a prince and then back to a frog and no one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it actually happened. <br /> <br /> villain is bullshit and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The Queen is a very annoying character and instead of clapping with Derek to rescue his mother, you expect the villain to put him. a spell in her voice box to stop her from speaking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I really liked the first movie, but it did not live up to my expectations.
