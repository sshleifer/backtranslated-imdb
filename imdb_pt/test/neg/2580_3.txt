The Patriot (nothing to do with the film of the same name as Mel Gibson) left Steven Seagal was still doing that 'saving the environment' thing in his films. That's fine. But this does not contribute to a good deed. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) of this movie finally came on the scene, I saw the turnaround (?) coming a mile away. The anti-war stance and care for Seagal's mother-nature is not very subtle. For a movie that would debut in theaters, it is filmed as a TV movie, despite some wonderful country scenes made by Dean Semler, the Dances with Wolves photographer. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does like 1 fight scene throughout the movie and it's totally boring. As an action movie, it fails, like a drama that stinks, as an environmental message is obvious. Avoid how Ebola crossed with plague.
