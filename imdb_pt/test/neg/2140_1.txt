Italian film producers love to rip American movies. All our movies and whenever possible. <br /> <br /> I am not claiming this as an insult to Italy as a whole, but I would like to note that the Italian film industry is greatly harmed by allowing such transvestites to come abroad to be seen by the world in general. That's all I'm saying. <br /> <br /> And there are no more serious injuries to which the Italian people submit than to apply severe pain to those who made the world watch "Shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is admittedly an imitation of the " Jaws "much higher (as if you did not know). Haw-haw ...): A huge monstrous thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler attacks many innocent Americans (ie: Italians) to the off the coast of Florida (ie: Italy) and the intrepid and stew of beer Peter (Sopkiw) sails with his anorexic girlfriend, who drinks beer and other people who explore beer, whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature, killed by mysterious forces who want to leave the creature alone or just stand up and be useless (and drink beer). or be the doctor in this movie who repeatedly defibrillates patients who die (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for their oars to recharge (it must be hell of a good battery there, doc. , there's the monster ... brother, if you thought the shark "Jaws" was fake, look here and have your mind changed IMMEDIATELY. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that was directed as a late reflection by a Bava!), edited with an onion cutter, acted for floating pieces of wood and written by (PRESUMING PIGS OF BEER) people who should never be left near a typewriter, a movie studio or a large city in the If this is how the people who made this movie think that real people act in such a situation, obviously they made many of them zombie movies, or drink a lot of beer. I have to say that this movie is bad Is it: bad as green cottage cheese; bad as a Hawaiian shirt in a box bad acting like "Bad Theater" skits Dan Aykroyd used to host on "Saturday Night Live"; bad as weight gain pills Calista Flockhart - get it? Good. <br /> <br /> Mike and the SOL gang slap this drunken beauty of beer over their heads over and over and reveal this "horror" movie as what it is: horrible. However, with a certain European charm: it is charming, when attended by a European - preferably a beer drinker. <br /> <br /> No star for the soggy dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
