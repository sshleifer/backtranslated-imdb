Also titled -> The Magic Castle -> This is a snippet. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story line that has almost nothing to do with the play nor the lake of the swans. Just some rockbart girlfriend, the book stolen from forbidden arts and the original characters (no voices remain). Naked to your bars, this is a continuation by a thread. The next thing you know is that some bird will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and Swan Princess 4: the magic bird will be born. Fortunately, although the chapters are supposed to be closed and this will begin, but the ill-finished trilogy will come to an end.
