In this horrifying attempt to make a mockumentary of Blair Witch, a group of people go to Africa to investigate a creature called Half-Caste. It is quite obvious that there was no script to speak and that everything was improvised. This can work if you have good actors, what this movie did not do. <br /> <br /> This film tries to gain points for originality by exploring a darker myth and an exotic culture. As a result, there are many scenes in the bush where the characters make "peculiar African things" like eating elephant manure. There are also some very good scenes of lions eating (from a National Geographic perspective), but there is not a single scare throughout the film. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Cannibal Holocaust or the Blair Witch Project, this movie will not bring you surprises, and you'll probably be able to watch the best filming of lions on the Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely a Half-Aste effort. <br /> <br /> A note to the filmmakers: boys, do us a favor and, next time, save the home movie "How I spent my African holidays" to your family and close friends. No one else wants to see it.
