directed by albert pyun in his unimaginable but strangely hypnotic style, "crazy six" is another crown jewel for the chic haos of this decade (frank jess?). Superdirection "sleek", incoherent plotting, time-outs in the middle of action sequences for the Eurodisc torch - long performances, all this seems to mean traits to our Pyun man. The most interesting is how he always receives first-class cast, compared to Wynorski or other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles and the very strange Burt Reynolds are not a bad cast, although they seem a bit confused. Check out "Postmortem", "Mean Guns", and "Omega Doom" for more Pyun Mayhem!
