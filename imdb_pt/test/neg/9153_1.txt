Who's taking care of the store here? How could a producer / executive / network director let a team shove the funniest plastic palm trees in movie history on the sands of a Canadian winter beach and try to fool it like tropics? Those trees were for real palm trees what a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is for true. And who let Dermot Mulroney go in front of the camera with painted gray hair that would not have passed in a high school play? And none of the geniuses who did quality control over this thing thought of correcting the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gas instead of gas? Everyone involved with this heavy "movie" - writer, director, actors - has done not only a good job, but brilliant elsewhere. It went very fast between the events and deadly slow inside them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and invented - maybe it just sounds like one of Lifetime's worst movies because of all the hype Red Carpet it was presented with. And I'm saying this as someone who loves life. What's up, guys? <br /> <br /> All this said, the work of a certain actress in a certain critical turnaround in the movie (and if you saw, you will know exactly what I'm talking about) It was so brilliant that the movie would have got 10 of me if it was the whole movie. Unfortunately, it was only about five seconds.
