"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is the first exhibition by Jeff Daniels writing and directing talents. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse premieres, but this is not so good. <br /> <br /> Escanaba in da Moonlight begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. We follow Rebuen Soady (Jeff Daniels) on the eve of the 1989 deer hunting season. He is getting close to Soady's record The film takes place in the upper reaches of Michigan and has all the normal clich√© characters, but there's a warmth there that tells you, that's not being evil. Well, Reuben is going to Soady Deer Camp and before his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero) gives him a Native American collar, his lucky hat and two forms of liquid you probably do not (Harve Presnell) is waiting, and her brother Remnar (Joey Albright) is in the middle of the camp. is about to appear. <br /> <br /> Ok, let's move on. there are some laughs, some moments when I laughed out loud. But most of the jokes here are used a few or several times. <br /> <br /> But the biggest disadvantage is the spiritual / Native American happenings. Only when you adapt to the characters do these strange things happen. But the special effects are so cheap, it's a great flash of light and then the head sways quickly back. <br /> <br /> And the ending, well, it's useless. <br /> <br /> The movement itself was not bad, the quirky character and a fun parody were good. But I should have stayed at that. Instead of having an idiot spiritual awakening that looks like rejected scenes from some demonic possession movie. <br /> I give "Escanaba in the Moonlight" to 4.5 out of 10.
