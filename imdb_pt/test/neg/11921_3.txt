He started to watch, but he did not believe any of the characters. In particular, the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress simply did not work for me. The scenes between the owner of the bakery and the assistant were good, but the rest was very slow. It was a very shallow film and it gave me the feeling that I was watching the play instead of a movie. The characters were very 'stagey' and the plot was very much like a stage hoax. The moment the pyromaniac attacked the assistant, I was bored and I did not care what happened next, so I hung up. Good thing I did not pay to see. He did not laugh or even smiled once. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to rate their films as "comedy" when they are funny and not funny ha ha. I've finally learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies, which usually turn out to be awful and awkward. Now it looks like I'll have to be a bit more picky when they call it a romantic movie comedy as well. Maybe the comedy means something different when applied to a movie, rather than a series in America. I do not understand why America can produce incredibly funny comedies like Two and a Half Men, Will and Grace, the King of Queens, but they can not produce really funny movies without resorting to bathroom humor. This movie was not disgusting or anything. But it was nothing, just a big yawn ...
