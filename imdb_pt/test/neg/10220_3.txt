About GW is almost a failure of a feature debut, not because it is not without trying ... Actually, it is. It's a mess even more because writer / director / technician Nick Gaglia has gone through the same rehabilitation cult he portrays in the film. Sometimes a filmmaker for the first time, full of the vigor that has been getting a few thumbs up from fellow film students, goes headlong into a style that is very disjointed, insecure and dramatically frustrating than the personal side of the story, the extremely personal. is blurred in the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 when she underwent a horrible program that basically tortured and brainwashed her "patients" with bullying tactics from the group, psychological sessions that could last for days and attitudes of the rehabilitation leaders that would make most of the Nazis shrugged, finally escaped when he was 15. I'm glad he's gone though it might help if he's now going for a real rehab for his film making skills, even if only for a few days, to learn things like that, structure, proper lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with the actors and other basic aspects that are perpetually lost here. <br /> <br /> It is even more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public (there has recently been a Newsweek article referring to a similar cult AA rehab). Often, a person wonders if certain personal character studies may work better as documentaries, as opposed to narrative dramas. This is an uncomfortable feeling throughout the GW, where it almost seems like Gaglia wants to tell the truth but does not know how to properly communicate through her characters. The character closest to him, the Bronx teenager Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, is actually much more of a one-dimensional being . there is very little history (we see a brief outbreak in black and white in his old house) and little connection to his mother (Moriarty) who has more potential than ever is diverted from a cold stone that passes his children to another. But there is a story to go with your two-year crisis, I guess. <br /> <br /> Things soon get tough (a bare cavity search in the first five minutes), and it soon becomes clear that medical care is more like a cross between controlling anger and some bizarre religious sect where Chief Medical Officer Hiller (Insinnia) is a total madman who controls too much. But soon Tony's sister, Sofia (Donohue), is thrown into the program, and unlike repeated moments of outrage and alleged noncompliance with Tony, she goes head-on with the three-step program and once released becoming a fugitive. Sometimes there are pieces in this fractured nightmare where there is a woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been on the show for a year and a half discovers that she has become a prisoner, and when the father of the main brothers arrives and makes an angry visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them, which contain some brute force, brief glimpses of Gaglia being able to at least get some influence on the pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are moments few and far between. It's not just the unsuccessful characters, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that turn into something like D.A.R.E. hysterical. mistakes (perhaps some of them, such as a raging young black, passive-aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister, who is accused by the brothers as having hit a joint and almost played in the show, would resonate more if there were more time to develop any of them). It's just that Gaglia is so out of focus in his multiple roles on his minuscule $ 30,000 budget that neither side of any potential talent he has can go through. He uses colors excessively, especially with a shadow that looks coated with urine), he shakes his handheld DVX camera as if it were an intense ward of God, occasionally a character will only shoot the picture at random, his choices of songs are like the worst possible selections of pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there are even scenes from fake interviews with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) and Krakowsky who feel as fake as possible. Could not Gaglia just have not been able to get interviews with the actual victims she was with and resorted to the allegedly cathartic B-plane? In short, no matter how much the real-life stories may appeal to you, do not bother watching it at the movies, or even renting, unless you love a final scene with two kids staring at the digital. sun of the Hudson River with the final words: Dedicated to children.
