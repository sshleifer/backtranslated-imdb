This was one of the most mixed movies I've ever seen. Everything in the movie seemed to be bound to justify some other element that had been cast. There's even a talking buffalo who wants to rub his wet nose to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be stuck just to give the children an excuse to run away in a wagon. It was laughable, but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used only to set the plot.
