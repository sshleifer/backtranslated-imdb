Mansfield Park, in its second half, is my favorite of Austen's novels, and Fanny Price, my favorite heroine of her heroines, so I am saddened by the unfortunate fate she has endured in her depictions on large and small screens. The only good reading of the character I heard was made to radio by Amanda Root, who gave the same quality she did with the character Anne in the film "Persuasion": a sincere, sincere and moral centrality. If the actress were younger, she would also be a good visual actress; but the Fannys who have met our eyes to this day resemble, respectively: Mary Crawford; Ruby the maid; and (in this incarnation) a girl of jovial, or possibly sour, service with her high moral principles drawn down. Well, I expected better, but I feared it would be worse. The show had a solid Edmund, an actor who was best in nice tweaks, and the perfect, or perfectly abominable, Mrs. Norris; otherwise, it was dull. The film, which was apparently conceived as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea, came out as a confused burlesque. After these disappointments and the more recent disappointments of the sister pieces of this production (the new "Persuasion" and the "Northanger Abbey"), I could not help but have ambiguous expectations for it; and, in general, made me a little more willing than not. He condensed the novel intelligently and, in the end, left me with the same feeling, as a comic version could. On the other hand, in order to do so, he had to remake most of the characters except the Crawfords, and this diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book, including his most famous character and what he ought to be, if it is not, it is the most famous scene. <br /> <br /> The character is Aunt Norris, always ready to guide other people about what to do, but always avoid having to do any of that; here you can not see any of this. And with it goes much more: his observation that cuts Fanny, "... considering who and what you are"; Sir Thomas's discovery that she forbade Fanny to set fire to her room during all those years, and her indirect apology for it; Fanny's honesty in acknowledging during a visit to the house that Aunt Norris, for all her faults, could manage the house better than any of her sisters. But then, this whole journey is lacking in history, and so it is more than what happens in theatrical essays and much of what disconcerts Sir Thomas on his return; and, indeed, Sir Thomas himself and his wife are different from what they were. Above all, the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny, one of the most complex of Austen, is simplified for a simple story; The lack of it is Fanny's firm conviction about what she knows to be right, and what she knows to be most likely true, against all the distractions that Crawford and anyone else can throw at her. To a male reader, now no less than when it was written, it reveals incomparably clear - incomparable, at least as far as I know - what a woman goes through trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust . It's a brilliant scene in the novel; on TV is just a scene. <br /> <br /> And Fanny, oh, Fanny: when will we see your taste?
