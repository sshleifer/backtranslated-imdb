This is undoubtedly the most misunderstood film in history. The jokes invented by Carrot Top are some of the most terrible attempts to be funny in recorded history. I'm not familiar with your other work, but if it's as bad as that, then I'll cry. I give this film 1 of 30 billion stars, and may God have mercy on the souls of those responsible.
