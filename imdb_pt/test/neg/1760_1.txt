I had to write a review for this movie after I saw it last night and read some of the comments from people trying to sort out the discontent of this movie going to the wfmitchell) post. I do not fit into any of these ratings. The other rating that needs to be on the list is 5) people did not like this movie because it was not good. I found the movie to be boating and forced. My wife chose it for us to see why she is a big Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law. Speaking of law, it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe in his southern accent. I can not help but wonder if they did not make their character less talkative on purpose, so we would not have to hear so much of the tortured accent. <br /> <br /> As for the movie, it took a long time to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then it fell off at the end. What was interesting, is that I did not know that this movie was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes after the movie, I asked my wife, "This is not going to be another English patient, is it?" It was absolutely. <br /> <br /> As much as the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word it accurately describes is simply "dumb." It was forced, it was unbelievable, it was silly and it was stupid. (After the battle, I looked at my wife and asked "Was that just stupid?", With which she nodded vigorously). <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the movie was Zellweger's performance. The role was a bit more acted like any decent comedy relief paper, but it worked. From his speech pattern, his walk, his mannerisms and esp. her little jokes (my favorite: "If you want to have more than a meter butt, all you have to do is listen to the chatting boyfriends"), she was able to create an almost cartoon character that did her job I just did not like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of person who says he likes it (or the patient's English). I suspect you could rank them in a category: 1) Novel fans
