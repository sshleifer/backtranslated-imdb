I saw this movie at a Cinema-Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants were from the local private school where I was teaching. I had seen some of Godard's films earlier while living in France, and although they were not my favorites, I could at least understand them. Being able to speak French helped. The rather innocuous beginning of "Le weekend" soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps very well photographed, which soon made no sense to me. For me, movies, like books, should have some clear meaning. This is not for me. I suppose I'm not "into" artistic films. Images still haunt me of the movie. To this day I refuse to eat rabbit meat, loved by the French. Those who have seen the film can understand why. Yes, the theme of materialism came to the surface, but cannibalism, the wrecked car, and all the other scenes of destruction and horror only made me sick. I'm not sure if I left before the end, but I certainly felt that way. I promised myself that I would never watch another Godard movie, and I did not and will never have it consciously. <br /> <br /> My rating: nothing. It was the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. Others may have been more inept, foolish, or stupid. I forgot those while scenes from this will haunt me forever.
