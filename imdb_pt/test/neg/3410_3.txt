Being a science fiction fan since my childhood (a long time ago), I have always hated implausible plots. It's a shame that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. I always suspected them of thinking, "Children are stupid to realize, so we do not have to strain." The writer of "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy on his parents because they think parents are aliens. As intriguing as the idea seemed to me, the more I was bored with its realization. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this idea and tried to stretch it in the ninety minutes by plunging it into a dark, elegant, meticulously slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me in my place was the question "how do they get out of this implausible garbage"? And then - bang - they did not even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for children and parents, go watch "Klatret√∏sen (2002)".
