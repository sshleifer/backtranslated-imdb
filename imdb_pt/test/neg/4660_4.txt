I watched this movie six years ago and recently did it again. If I remember correctly, I did not like it the first time and I enjoyed it a little more this second time. <br /> <br /> This film obviously has a big budget. The effects are mostly top quality (except for one or two "hits") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First, whoever decided that Peter Stormare should act like a mad Russian astronaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I'm sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is simply stupid, both with respect to lines uttered and acting. So ... something must be wrong with the script. I would like to see Peter as a Russian professional astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes that happen on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to watch. It is total chaos that lasts more than thirty minutes with few moments to catch your breath. In addition, the events that turn out to be simply unreliable. I would like to see a much more sensible and stripped-down version of this part of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, scenes involving flying space shuttle are very biased. The buses are maneuvering like a pair of MIGs, at a safe distance from zero, as they play car-sized ice blocks like ping-pong balls. The director must watch Apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecrafts like these. <br /> <br /> I like the soundtrack because it is dramatic to a degree that makes it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is great. In addition to the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and fairly easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With some minor changes, this would have been an 8/10 movie. I'm sorry, it's not!
