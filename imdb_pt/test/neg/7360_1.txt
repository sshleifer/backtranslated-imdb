This review contains spoilers. I have no expectations about this movie. I took it off the shelf with the movie "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First, the credits for this stupid movie last about 5 minutes. The pace from start to finish is slooooow. The main heroines do not like wearing a bra and the director seems to enjoy the swinging effect as Anna Paquin descends the stairs. If you like breasts movies, this one has a low level buzz factor. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is good that the film rips elements of Lovecraft and other genre mechanisms of terror, but in better films, there is no less some rational or consistently irrational behavior. This stinking man tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality, but then you have situations where no one calls the police, even though they have discovered a potentially incriminating treasure chest of evidence, and rituals from other worlds are well explained in a comprehensive book on another world. rituals as in Buffy. I was waiting for Miles to appear and make some inquiries about how to kill a certain type of demon like this. <br /> <br /> The premise is that it is possible to open an era of Darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you. Ho hum. To do this, you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven children who must have their throat cuts by people who love them. This opens the world to the Dark Ages. At least that is what it says in detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. Which raises the uncomfortable question of, well, how those who wrote the book know, and if that is what happens, you would actually leave that information in a book you can take out of the library, much less get from a library in a world which is not already covered in Darkness, an age brought by lunatics who could have done it earlier using the "Hidden Practices to Bring the World to Darkness for the Laity, 2nd Edition"? It turns out that the father of the story is the seventh son, who fled the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is the doctor / grandfather in the movie, who wanted to experience the ritual with presumably other stupid parents who just wanted to see if stupid as this opening the world to the darkness really works. The grandfather let his father go because he "did not really love him". Aduh Stupid stupid movie written by an idiot director who seems to think he's some kind of Eurofilm Auteur. There is also a scene in the movie in which the boy appears with big marks on the face and the mother grabs him and has total lack of reaction. The whole movie is like this. People seeing really strange are happening and not reacting to it in any normal way. It must be a bad plot and direction. Anna Paquin does her best to interpret her character realistically, without breaking a smile, and she looks sensational in a top, but in several critical moments of the story, she does not bother to call for backup. You know, more of the same, "I'm going to get into a demonic demonic situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others who carry flashlights or firepower, even though I sense the impending doom." And even dumber as it may seem, even if you bring the Dark Ages, those creatures that bleed you can not attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know, and they tell you to turn off the source of light. Reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; maybe this movie is an excuse for the concept of the game. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the movie are the young man and Anna. Both die in the end. The whole family dies. The creatures of darkness lead them to death, but in fact, the stupidity of family characters was the leading cause of death. The other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors in the Red Shoes Diaries movie series. <br /> <br /> So to top it all off, the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in blindly bumping into an obviously abnormal situation, the plot of shit (there is a former architect in history who designs a house with a altar of sacrifice hidden in it - the architect suspected from the beginning that there would be hidden sacrifices in the house, but did not say either, because, well, no real reason, they could not find the children, but he did not bother telling the authorities about the HIDDEN ROOMS he designed in the house but he likes to stay in the house for a period of 40 years because he cares about what is going on inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), the banal use of scary mechanisms ( more children standing in the dark or just appearing in photographs, and blood on the wallpaper), and the selfishness of the director that when you see him on the DVD features describing his crap job as a new and original interpretation , makes you understand where the real horror of this movie is. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? At a speed of 2x on a DVD player with subtitles turned on, it can be fun, until you get to the end and realize that the movie sucks, otherwise, draaaaaaaags. The cinematic equivalent of a fat shake; the empty calories are horrible. <br /> <br /> The film gives the impression that the director must have seen "The Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in humor, that in this respect, the film fails miserably, and then also to that respect, Jaume Balaguer√≥, it is my opinion that you are very bad at what you do.
