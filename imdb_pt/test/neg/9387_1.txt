With NBC's "Thank God You're Here", the network may be trying to replicate the successes of ABC's hit comedy "Who's Line Is Anyway?" in which presenter Drew Carey would judge the performances of a handful of regular cast members asked to improvise scenes of some sort. In the NBC series, Dave Foley and co-host Dave Alan Grier supervise a handful of notable comedians who have to improvise their way through several scenes that begin with "Thank God You're Here." It takes itself very seriously (because viewers must be repeatedly reminded that the actors have never seen the sets before), both co-hosts seem less enthusiastic. After watching the insatiable and continual attempts of the actors to request a few laughs, I wonder if the live audience is actually laughing at what happens, or if they are also improvising. This timeframe is expected to be very short.
