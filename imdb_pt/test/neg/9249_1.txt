The acting is awkward and scary, and not in a good way ... not at all. Writing, dialogue, and chemistry among the actors are horrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds for a long time, making it look like a Mexican soap opera. Everything about the writing is unreal, and all the actors involved make it much worse with their exaggerated interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this ?? To use the word tacky to describe this Canadian disaster would be the euphemism of the century. Did the director even watch the final cut before being put on the air?
