Ok ... for the most part, and all of its tacky, this movie was actually pretty good for an MST3K movie ... but then they decided to ruin the little kindness it had about fifteen minutes before the end. * SPOILER ALERT * The movie is very basic ... a rich mommy named Danny meets a bum named Bix, and the two travel to a small town, where Bix meets a beautiful girl named Carrie (that's a lot). Now, the basic premise of this film seemed quite promising. All they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a scary guy in town wants Carrie ... Now, I know what you're thinking . .. Bix fights the crazy and finally decides to calm down with Carrie, and Danny returns home, and everyone lives happily ever after ... right? WRONG!! Because Carrie is murdered by the city, because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many homosexual tones between Danny and Bix.) And then, the whole town decides to lynch Bix, even though the city was easily the prime suspect. So the city confesses to kill Carrie without much hesitation ... (must have felt bad, the poor drug). So, Danny brings Bix home with him ... it's the movie that "happy forever". Sad is not it? All I can say is that I thank God for Joel and the Bots. Because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite episodes of MST3K.
