When I first saw this movie in the '80s, I loved it. I was totally fascinated by the music, the dance ... everything. However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely amazed at how utterly stupid the plot was - as it contained holes, inconsistencies and - quite frankly - a lot of crap - and how horrible the dance was. I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have entered that repertoire of ballet ... The whole thing was pathetic. The development of the character also lacked depth. I think this was, quite a product of the '80s: the movie does not hold up today!
