A tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and racism of its predecessor, "Gold Diggers of 1933." The Production Code was firmly in place at the time of the release of this film, so humor is all kind of wokka, wocka-wocka and it was the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping from the lips of the beautiful ladies of the first movie. A cast of second-rate stars and character actors go through the motions here, and the motive "put on a show" seems terribly forced; instead of the world of Broadway, the show here is a charity event offered by a luxury hotel. Who really cares if the show continues or not? The punctuation here is bland too. Of course the big number of the film is "Lullaby of Broadway", which accompanies a long line of fantasy dance about the eventual death of a new socialist society of New York - does not have exactly the same effect as the number "Forgotten Man" . like the final in '33. Busby Berkeley directs and choreographed this film, and any promise made in the film's fluid-opening scenes quickly deteriorates. Unfortunately, no one learned a lesson from it, and there was another Gold Diggers movie two years later. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
