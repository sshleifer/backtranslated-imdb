This is one of the worst-made movies I've ever seen. One must take Truffaut seriously; it's not just a B movie released by hacks. Of course, Truffaut could not decide whether she was making a noir or a sentimental girl movie. and neither Deneuve, whose dozen (?) of character slippers, is simply unbelievable - not even misrepresented; simply did nothing. Among other things, as a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person like Julie / Marion is simply beyond the ability of anyone to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely requires someone not so handsome. Belmondo's performance also suffers, though his character is not as unbelievable as Deneuve's. The clich√© ending (which I will not describe) is unfortunately very appropriate for this complete error.
