Crashing is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. A great example of how to make a pompous and self-important movie with a message. Haggis tries too hard to defend his point of view and excels in almost every category of the film. She feels very passionate about her own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer in the skull. Of course, race relations affect everyone and there is a lot of ambiguity in the matter, but the 'Crash' universe operates to suggest that we are all victims of our own perceptions about race. It is a tiring thread that repeats ad nauseum and wears its welcome in the first 30 minutes. I found the results of the characters not surprising and forced, and the film took forever to undo and die. The fact that this movie is among the 50 best films of IMDb is proof of the public's willingness to be deceived by the Hollywood malarkey. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you want the real "Crash", check out the one from David Cronenberg: Dark, Twisted and Original. This movie is an enigma, tiresome and masochistic.
