<br /> <br /> I understand that people have different expectations of low budget films. I also know that John Sayles has a kind of glow about him, that anti-Hollywood vibe, ground Tim Robbins, the Coen brothers and Atom Egoyan, who makes him a darling with the critics from the start. But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it just is not. <br /> <br /> She snakes. It has many characters. His tone is uneven, his point of view is confused, the performance is generalized, from the naturalist to the superior. It remains for long moments with minor characters that we do not care for and eliminates tense scenes only when things are getting good. <br /> <br /> Lose the target. The flaw in the film is that the two closest things to a protagonist, Edie Falco's Marly, and Angela Bassett's Desiree, are hooded in characters that have no drive. Marly is an apathetic drunk, steeped in the very inertia of her life. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own pent-up pain. When the worldviews of your two main characters can be summed up with the phrases "I do not care" and "I want to get out of here", why should the audience duck in a mouse? <br /> <br /> It will become clear: Sayles writes a funny dialogue. He is very adept at crafting a scene. The problem is that these scenes are not going anywhere. There is no spine in the film. No Drive The movie does not create interest in any of the characters. In my opinion, he is also very obsessed with bad and big corporate America swallowing the little guy. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a "small" quality movie, see David Lynch's "Straight Story." Pass it up.
