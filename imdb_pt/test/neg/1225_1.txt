Wow ... as a big fan of the Western tales of Larry McMurtry and the Lonesome Dove series in particular, I was looking forward to Comanche Moon. What a tremendous disappointment. Maybe my expectations were very high because of Lonesome Dove's excellence ... the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... everything worked. <br /> <br /> Comanche Moon, by comparison, comes across as a bad skit on Saturday Night Live. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is chatter and the plot snakes without thinking all over the place. It looks like the actors are reading the TelePrompTers. I could not relate to any of the characters, good guys, bad guys, not even the incidental characters. David Midthunder's performance stands out in particular. It looks like it was wrenched from an eighth grade high school performance. I'm sorry, I'd like to find something positive to say about Comanche Moon, but I just can not do it. There's nothing here.
