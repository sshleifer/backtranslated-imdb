"Undercurrent" features a cast of wonderful actors that may have been set for the perfect comedy hall. Unfortunately, they are practically wasted on a 'woman's sight' potboiler - and such a thin paper. Katharine Hepburn is actually radiant like a maiden maiden who finally gets married, but her husband is deeply disturbed and harboring obscure family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli has absolutely no idea how to put together this strange plot, invented by Edward Chodorov from a Thelma Strabel story, and the nice first-rate cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) is left stepping on in dark waters. ** in ****
