carrot top in a full-length movie, enough said. The only reason this does not happen is through my personal voting system of only a 1 and a 10, and this is not an extreme operation. God horrible horrible. there are some movies that are so bad that they are unintentionally funny, so there are movies that leave you physically sick and there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide. record all copies of the film, shoot anyone who has not received creative comments in this film, torture anyone with any creative input and as for the star there are so many things that can be said online but he must be begging for the final. ten seconds of existence with a severed head the moment the work is done.
