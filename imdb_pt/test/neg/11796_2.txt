There are a lot of repetitive dialogues in this movie about "cold spots" (signaling the presence of a ghost), and characters praying to surround themselves with white light to protect themselves. To recreate the feeling of the movie, I will make repeated references to cold spots throughout this review. I've seen movies worse than the St. Francisville Experiment, but this may be the * forgettable * one of all ("it's getting cold!") Basically, a 20-something few years spend the night in a haunted house. This is filmed as a supposedly true documentary. Obviously not real, but the house contains some cold spots. SPOILERS- (as if you were not able to predict most of the plot!). Not much happens in this movie. We have the horror clich√© of a cat jumping from the hideout near the start, as a "practice" scare to warm the public. People walk around with lanterns, occasionally taking a moment to remind the house that they come in peace, which do not mean any harm to the spirits (or cold spots) inside. Every now and then a door closes and it scares someone. Of course, the ouija board makes an appearance. They talk to a ghost named "Charles". A girl eats a sandwich with a cockroach. More cold spots. Another door closes and a guy shoots over the sound of the door. Scuff, scuff, he says. Oh my God, someone says. "Surround yourself with white light." I admit there is a good scene in the attic (where a chair is knocked over by a ghost) that really caught me off guard. But in addition to some funny dialogues, the chair scene (the split second when it's knocked over, nothing immediately before or after that time) is the only good thing in that movie. However, there are still some cold spots here. Eventually, the movie ends. No one dies. No more details are needed. I was not a big fan of the Blair Witch Project, but it looks like a masterpiece next to the St. Francisville Experiment. You may not be discussing whether or not it is a real documentary, but whether or not it was meant to be funny. I still do not know. But whatever was destined to be, it failed.
