When a hard-working entrepreneur is rejected by a prestigious country club, he starts a battle between members and eventually purchases Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) and turns it into a theme park / golf course in which everyone can participate. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but still a little fun at times. Almost all comedy is cheap jokes and bad jokes except for Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase plays one of his biggest roles as Ty Webb for the second time and plays very well. He's not just the funniest character in the movie, he's the only funny character in the movie. Even Dan Akroyd can not bring humor to this movie, which aspires to be a major sequel to a classic comedy, but falls apart with others shown at Comedy Central. The film could have been better if Ty Webb (Chase) had a bigger role, but instead he was reduced to a smaller character and the star became Jackie Mason (Who ??) They should have brought back the whole cast and done a sure path! This is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie. Overall, Caddyshack II is humorous, but a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
