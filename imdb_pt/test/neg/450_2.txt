Every time I see Larry King Live, he asks the softer questions for his guests. He rarely receives useful information because he does not ask the difficult questions. This comes from your radio start. King settled on the radio and basically did not change anything of the format of the television except for his talking head being visible. He becomes like a puppy to his guests and the only time he actually gets useful information from them is through a volunteer or a program interlocutor actually asks a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is a good kind of interviewer type. That means he should not have prime time on a large news network if you consider CNN. I do not do it because of the CNN story. <br /> <br /> Copying (ie cable) New Network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to the news network in which he could broadcast news 24/7. When it started, the only TV competition was from NBC, ABC and CBS. Because of this, CNN copied the format of its competition and achieved respectable rankings. <br /> <br /> This worked well for CNN until they got competing networks that were innovative and provided better / fresher news coverage. In response to heated competition, CNN went into denial and panned out its competitors who were eating their lunch and ratings because CNN wanted to resist the switch. This did not work for a long time and their rankings began to plummet. <br /> <br /> Now Copying News Network is trying to reshape itself, reinventing itself by copying the leading news network format. Unfortunately, this show represents a big part of the problem. He is 21 years old and shows his age very badly. <br /> <br /> Sorry, King needs to be removed from prime time or totally discarded.
