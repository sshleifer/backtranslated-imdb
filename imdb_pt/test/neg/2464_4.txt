Jack Black and Kyle Gass make fantastic versions of themselves in this comic book show for the band Tenacious D, an artistic rock band with satirical and bearded lyrics. An ex-fugitive obsessed with heavy metal and a lazy man who lived on the seashore and who pretends to be a rock god, meets and forms a band (birthmarks on both cheeks form the group's name). Opening with a funny prologue that mimics a Twisted Sister video from the '80s, "The Pick of Destiny" is a rather well-produced film directed at older children; occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle-aged variation of "Wayne's World," with ridiculous interludes and a climactic attack with Beelzebub himself, but Black and Gass have an extremely comfortable relationship (they also acted as producers, co- wrote script and all music). The target audience will obviously, though the inspiration is a bit low, particularly in the second half (almost at the same time our heroes impulsively outrun the police in a driver-student car). The musical sequences are far more successful than the attempts at film satire, and in the first thirty minutes Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 of ****
