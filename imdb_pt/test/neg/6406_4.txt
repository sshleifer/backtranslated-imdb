There was a time when Joel Schumacher was right at the top of my list of favorite directors. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, when his name was attached to several major films like "The Lost Boys," "Flatliners," and "Falling Down," he really was one of Hollywood's most talented directors. Then came the stupid sequences of "Batman", unfortunately, and after that it seemed that every potentially sublime script turned into a gigantic mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better movies and even the incredibly stupid concept of "The Number 23" should have been rendered in a slightly more engaging and entertaining film. Literally from beginning to end, "The Number 23" desperately tries to be a mysterious and mysterious thriller and therefore uses all the terrible clich√©s of the great book of film history, including heavy voice narration, flashbacks, disordered structure, characters with multiple personalities, countless twists and turns that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings. Nothing helps, however, simply because of the sheer nonsense of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of the cast and crew. As much as you try to associate with the main character and be open-minded about insane theories, this still remains a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comic role) is a bored animal hunter whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. The book talks about all sorts of diabolical theories and strange coincidences that are tied to the number 23. Walter almost readily identifies with the protagonist of the book (a dirty detective investigating a somber case of suicide) and begins to identify copious examples of the puzzle 23 in his own private life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia, and apparently all this absurdity of numerology actually exists and certain people honestly believe that most disasters and accidents are directly linked to that evil number. Well, is that just? Crazy! But, hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter how insane they are, and I can only share my humble opinion of a movie based on a frantic riddle. "The Number 23" is not suspenseful despite several dark scenarios and unpleasant effects of makeup, and never at one point manages to make you think about the role of numbers in your own life. All of the cast members performed well below their normal capabilities, but it was still a joy to see the lovely Mrs. Virginia Madsen in a relatively large production again. Definitely not recommended in case you are looking for a solid and frightening night of thriller fun but bearable and not entirely without merit.
