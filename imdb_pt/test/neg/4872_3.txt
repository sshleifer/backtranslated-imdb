They make it all very easy in this movie. It reminded me of Indiana Jones, where he lurks outside a submarine during an ocean crossing. Everyone knows everything that is happening, it is very easy to get anywhere you want in the White House. I do not even know why I watched half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge from all angles and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually faster than a car in a garage or an ally). It was silly, mostly, and I did not even know I had a ten-story elevator in the White House. Anyway, anything conspiracy is always interesting.
