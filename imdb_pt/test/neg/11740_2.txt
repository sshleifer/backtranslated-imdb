* SPOILERS INCLUDED * Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant and groundbreaking adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel was an incredible film, unlike anything it had been before. Every photo, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. He did not just break the rules, he invented a set of new ones. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler: there's absolutely nothing new, different or original about this movie. Gus Van Sant does not just pay homage to Hitch, he rips all ideas and does so in a less original and more conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before seeing this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and thought My Own Private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question that comes to mind when it comes to Psycho's remake is, "Why did you do this, Gus?" <br /> <br /> In my head, there are only two reasons to make a remake: The original was a good story, but the movie sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone thought of a new approach to the material. None of these factors is present in Gus Van Sant's Psycho version. In addition to the fact that it is in color, and there is a scene in which there is a montage of disturbing images related to the possible internal dialogue of the title character (which I find unnecessary), there is nothing new here. <br /> In addition, I found the cast left something to be desired. Anne Heche was quite like Marion, but she did not have a certain vulnerability that Janet Leigh portrayed in the original. I did not feel sympathy for her character because the choices she faced seemed much less restricted as a woman in today's society, as opposed to the choices she would have faced as a single woman living in the early 1960s. Vince Vaughn had a few laughs with the interpretation of an incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I think the timing and the nervous and haunted look of Anthony Perkins were far more effective. The only performance I enjoyed better than the original was Lila Crane, played by Jullianne Moore. She was excellent as ever, and brought new strength and intelligence to the character. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there is a beautiful camera job, especially during the famous "bathroom scene", in which Van Sant takes advantage. of his use of color to show the murder in vibrant shades of crimson. And yet, all through the movie I had this irritating feeling of deju vu. Have not I seen this somewhere before? Oh wait, I've seen this somewhere before! Almost all scenes appear to be copied to be taken from the original. We almost got the feeling that the director made this film as a school project. "Look, I can make a Hitchcock movie too!" <br /> <br /> If you have not already, go see the original. This has persisted over the years and overcomes this bit of mediocrity, hand in hand. You will not be disappointed.
