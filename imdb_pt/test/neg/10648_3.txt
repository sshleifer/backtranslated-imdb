After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth," the chapter that served as a sort of "deathblow" for the franchise, another embarrassing cheap money came as no surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain all the mysteries of Pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film less than 90 minutes ... On display is below average acting compared to the unfortunate film B special effects, and a ridiculous and insulting attempt at black humor while still trying to keep the whole project completely serious. I'm thinking, how many damn directors did this? Poor Pinhead has SO MUCH screen time, that every mystery and threat that this iconic character possesses, is completely lost. After an hour listening to long speeches and dramatic stances, we just want to tell the guy to shut up! moderately entertaining on some points, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to look like a cheap and ugly movie to TV movies after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: Pinhead along with his pet Cenobite dog , killing a bunch of idiots ... in outer space! I'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two films in the series, who gave this abortion a movie of more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. On a side note, the movie that follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly clever and elegant piece of noir that brilliantly reinstates "Pinhead" as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of evil inherent in the human species, which was the centerpiece of the original film and the main point of the story. For any serious horror fan, see Hellraiser I and II, skip the lousy III and this one, and continue with "Inferno". You're not going to miss anything by skipping this crap ...
