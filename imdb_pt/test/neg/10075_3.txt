I've been looking forward to this movie since Lost World was released. It did not bother me that Lost World was not as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just waiting for a good movie of monsters. It was all about "dinosaurs eat people". However, it was disappointing, even at that level. <br /> <br /> To start with, there were not enough people to eat, and while I'm going to keep secret how many people are eaten, it was not enough. In addition, although there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were almost no "enough" dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-a-club-on-tail-their-osaurus, just made appearances and did not do much considering how cool they are. <br /> <br /> (START SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls. The figures I read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the film made them look closer to 300. Worse, they could not eat anyone, not even splash them on the rocks by loosening them. There was no end to the film, nor, suddenly, the credits. (END SPOILERS) I was wondering if the issue I saw was missing 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion is that they taught the Pterodactyls to sneak their long beaks into their pockets and get their $ 7. Will rent the Carnosaur series; at least you will not be disappointed.
