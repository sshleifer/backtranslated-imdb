The film is powerful as a political statement on extraordinary extradition, torture and politics of the war on terror. Others have commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you have not seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point. <br /> <br /> Several issues are raised by this film. First of all, the protagonist was guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation for the fact that the NSA has decided that it was picked up and processed in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation why he received phone calls from what the NSA thinks he is a terrorist? If there is, the film does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie unsatisfactory for me. It is very good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, so let's take it to the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps we were well trained to resist to some extent and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proven wrong with a little research, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man to confess without actually being guilty. However, there is nothing in the film that proves that he is guilty. <br /> <br /> The various other loose spots out there are: 1. Then a devious CIA agent got him released and taken back home. What prevents the NSA from picking it up again? A little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here ... If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene in his favor, what does Corinne Whitman have to fear? 2. If the NSA is tracking which phone numbers are being called by whom, why could not they hear some of the calls to find out if something underhand is being discussed? 3. The plot is even more stupid anyway. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on a prepaid anonymous phone line, not on a line that could be traced back to him and his home. <br /> <br /> The whole movie revolves around tugs. in the strings of the hearts of the spectators, showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture. But when you think about it in more depth, there is nothing substantial in this film, just many unanswered questions and the feeling of "what, is this? !!!" At the end of the movie.
