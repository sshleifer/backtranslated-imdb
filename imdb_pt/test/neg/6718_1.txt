Lord have mercy! Why was this movie made? Why did Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to participate? The Stranger is so painfully bad in all conceivable ways that he confuses the mind. <br /> <br /> The film has an ultra-cheap look for it. As a budget a couple of dollars was far out of reach. The worst thing is that manufacturers know this and try to make it look smooth to make up for it. The result is a movie that just does not feel right. The fight scenes are so dull and edited 'discreetly' to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is no longer in good shape. None of them is engaging or exciting. The plot is an absurdity that does not matter most lightly or has some uniqueness in it. Eastern Europe's sites (a cunning move by producers to keep the budget low or nonexistent) seem unpleasant and should not serve as the backdrop for an 'action' movie. <br /> And what is the deal with the title? As far as I could tell everyone in the movie was foreign. What title does it refer to? <br /> <br /> The DVD is in 1.85: 1 widescreen anamorphic and in Dolby 5.1 sound. Nor are they remarkable enough to guarantee a single rent. The stranger is not worth a second of your time. Gotta love that slogan tho! "If they think they can stop him, they are completely wrong." Sheesh!
