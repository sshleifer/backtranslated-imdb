Remnants of an ambush Army unit join a group of cowboys to fight Indians on the way to war. It sounds like an exciting western, but it's boring, monotonous, monotonous. It moves like molasses, the action scenes are not inspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photograph is not very good. Eastwood, in a very precocious role, plays a former Confederate who does not like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. This is the only remotely interesting situation in the entire film, but Eastwood was not experienced enough for an actor, and his character appears petulant rather than angry or bitter. A very ordinary western. In fact, a western much less than ordinary. It's worth checking out if you're an Eastwood fan and want to see him early in his career. Otherwise, do not bother.
