For a film that was most watched in his homeland, South Korea, for most of 2004, was a major disappointment. It shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make melodramatic and overly emotional films. The film was over 130 minutes long, but not much happened and everything that happened was pretty much what we expected, the plot was so transparent. Granted if one of them was Korean, maybe someone would come in more, but for me it did not do much. Suffice it to say that, as the case is usually in Korean cinema, the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite murder squad of prisoners sentenced to death to kill Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> A tedious plot does not bother me much if the characters are good, but unfortunately this is not the case this time too. They are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and, too often, is exaggerated, as is often the case in Korean cinema. Much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant, cardboard cuts of a dimension. They should have spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how hard and cruel the training and the soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing that reminds us is that a smaller of two errors is still wrong.
