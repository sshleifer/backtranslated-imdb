Putting simple words, or rather a word, would be more appropriate for PATHETIC !!!!!! The movie begins by attracting a bit of interest in the plot, but, but how few minutes the audience is getting restless for toilets and getting snacks, or to breathe some fresh air out of the dark hallway closed .... <br /> < It looks like we watched a 60's movie in which the colors were monotonous, directed by a rookie and represented by high school students! The film revolves around a high-profile American actress trying to make a comeback to the films while performing in one of the not-so-great Indian films. Her performance is real. Praised for the worst delivery of dialogues. OverAll: I Would not Recommend Anyone To Watch This Movie Still Wants To Watch: So try watching at home, when some TV channel goes on air, believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single ad and no sponsor. <br /> <br /> It's better to take aspirin, you might need it if you can not find a remote to switch channels! p.s. I have no idea if the other reviewers still watched the movie? I did and lost my $ 10 on the ticket!
