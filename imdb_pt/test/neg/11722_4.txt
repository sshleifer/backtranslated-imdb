I saw this movie for a reason: the slogan is "annoying the head" and you're dead! Crackling It is not surprising that this stupid horror comedy runs out before the tape comes out of the box, but it laughs at its strange premise and cast of characters: a human-eyed radar of eagle, a strong, huge man and a large sexual magnet of large breasts are controlled by a huge head in a chair, who is not happy with her family being blackmailed by a killer asshole. This seems to be a promising mix of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are a joke and the plot is pretty common if you, erm, ignore the giant head.
