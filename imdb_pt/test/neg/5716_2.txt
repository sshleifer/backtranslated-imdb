You know this movie is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the supporting role played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. While this was still relatively early in his career and he was not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she drew much attention was her breasts and why she was involved with the incredibly self-defeating footballer Mark Gastineau. So instead of this being her "break out film," this and the Beverly Hills Cop movie mark how high she was in her career a grade. It was obvious, too, that the funding moguls gave up on this film as well, because the supporting cast (aside from Arnold) is rather lame and the script is monotonous, tedious, monotonous. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would no doubt be disappointed with this slow and uninviting film.
