I'm a big fan of Robert Taylor and I've been trying to find all of his movies. This is one that I did not have but I watched recently on Fox Movie Channel, and I was very disappointed. I know he was a hired player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the off-screen relationships between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry was on the screen between the two. But the film's premise was so ridiculous: that the president of the United States would order a navy lieutenant to secretly leave the service to hunt for bank robbers and report only to the president, which made it difficult to appreciate anything else about the crime. movie. The death row scenes were utterly motionless. The only thing worse than Taylor's performance was Stanwyck's singing. She got better later at Ball of Fire, thank God.
