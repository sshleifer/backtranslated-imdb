If you find the depiction of violent murders and the controversial brutality expressed in a less playful movie with fun glacial hobby, then you are bound to enjoy Vigilance. This film was rubbish to mind and spirit. The notion that this is a "suspense" is comical; this would involve some sort of tension and twists. You've been waiting for the story to actually finish "getting started." It never rises above a glorification of violent criminals with weak minds and individuals from all walks of life. Imagine all the violence of "No Country for Old Men" without any kind of chase or friendly characters. The thrill seekers are furious. The acting is good, mostly, but the script is a stack. Do not bother, and tell your friends not to bother.
