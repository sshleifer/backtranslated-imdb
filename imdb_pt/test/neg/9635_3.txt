This representation of the popular story of children in the movies is pathetic enough to watch. I know it's one of the first efforts in filmmaking, but this 15-minute photo is unimaginable and poorly filmed. "The Great Train Robbery" (1903), which I also commented, is much more creative and exciting to see. <br /> <br /> We saw a small, long-haired cow with Jack (2 men in a cow). suit) to a hatful of a merchant's beans and then a beanstalk grows from where his mother throws them in the backyard (I guess the poor Jack has reached the wrong type). Jack dreams of a goose (actually, it seems to be a chicken) and a golden egg and the next day he climbs the stalk into the sky. <br /> <br /> There is no effort made to be creative in this movie. The stalk looks like a rope with leaves, the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a house with nothing abnormally large compared to Jack and the climax of the movie in which Jack makes his escape with the goose chicken and his golden egg is miserable as a plush doll falls out of screenshot in place of the giant and then the actor takes his place - standing up on his feet in an exaggerated death dance as in most early movies. The beanstalk (leaf-covered rope) comes down from above and curls neatly on the giant's forehead. <br /> <br /> See something else.
