Throughout this movie I wonder why on earth they did it like a "documentary", even if they did not include real images of the people who were interviewed? Of course, it would have been like any other documentary, but it would have been for the filmmakers to discover the meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> Using a number of well-known movie stars (many of whom apparently asked to be in it) to portray "real" people gave me the feeling that there was a pre-determined message to be delivered, and the director was so focused on this that real people could not be trusted so that actors and rehearsed scenes were used. (Yes, I know this was also a play, but a documentary should be a documentary.) I really surprised myself with the various stars, and I was waiting for one of them to leave the character for a moment and say, "I'm a good person because I'm in it. "<br /> <br /> This movie could have had a much more powerful social commentary if it were more objective or if we saw Matthew Shepard and his killers as people instead of symbols. (The much higher "Boys Do not Cry" had an inflexible view of those involved - good and bad.) Instead, The Laramie Project makes an almost relentless talk that one's sexuality must be accepted independently and little else.
