This is a family movie that was aired on my local ITV station at 1am a few nights ago. This may be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers, but REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film, strange in the way you do not want to bother your audience. Come on, there's nothing that children like more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was such a popular author for children. It also explains why the DOCTOR was such a successful show all over the world. In this script, you're dying for the science fiction author to do something nasty for kids, but that does not happen. I'm not advocating child abuse, but seeing Howard Spitz lose his rag on the little ones would have made the movie a little better. Can you imagine how much worse the KINDERGARTEN COP would have been if the producers had gone all PCs? I mean, if you're doing a movie centered around a child author who hates children, should not the story show and not tell? Much of the problem lies with director Vadim Jean and you get the feeling that he does not know how to deal with the material, which is bad news for the film. As someone noted earlier, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey Grammar is very wood. I think he was trying to play like it was a show he is famous for, but it does not work here and there are many scenes with ridiculous camera angles that seem unintentional but that are very disturbing. But at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the sensibilities of the public.
