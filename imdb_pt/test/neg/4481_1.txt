I was extremely excited for this movie! my expectations were under control because I read the book first sooo I expected differences. What I did not expect was how big the differences were. Starting with the physical appearances of the characters ... like Channing Tantums lack of tattoos n Amanda Seyfried not being a brunette rsrsrs but I let it go ... the character's developments were not there at all ... you did not have time for love amanda seyfried character and you could not feel for her or for john when they parted for the first time ... i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated that she left first after him ... it required emotional separation .. and why they changed Tim's book ... why they made him a father instead of a brother and why they made him look so old and the movie did not have that intense moment when they figured out what happens at the end I didnt want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it you know what I mean) and why ooooo wwhyyyy they changed the ending ... in the book was heart-breaking and emotional and emphasized the decision of Cha character nning Tatums why they cheered ... it just made it look like a hurried end ... it was terrible ... tha ts what most disappointed me ... the end of the book should have been exactly the same :(
