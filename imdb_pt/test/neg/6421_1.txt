Good God! This movie needs to have a new rating on its cover "see if you have absolutely nothing to do!". I'm disappointed. I was anxious for a good horror movie over the weekend ... I needed adrenaline and that formidable tingling sensation in my spine. But this movie did not do that. A reasonably good story, but a very horrible performance, dialogue and filming. It was disjointed and sometimes completely silly. We've had actors looking in the wrong direction of the camera, people talking aloud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what will happen, shadows of equipment in some scenes, silly cliches like "I just need you to hold me "in totally wrong places and situations. Thank you for allowing me to unload and sorry if I offended anyone, but it was a waste of time and money.
