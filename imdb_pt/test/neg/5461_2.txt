This looks like one of those Australian films made by "talented" and government-funded students. It is filled with intelligent images of colors and shapes and verbal excursions in Freudian psychology to be enjoyed by both art students and teachers, but in general a stupid mockery of good cinema, good narrative and generally good taste is perceived. This happens when art students become so obsessively indulgent. "Pink Flamingos" is miles ahead of the same subjects. Some pornographic films of the 70's are much more helpful and inspiring. The book of Revelation is not entirely without merit, but as a general experience it is well below the B grade average.
