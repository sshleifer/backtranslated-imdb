This movie is terrible. A true hockey fan would have to assume that the people who appeared and produced this movie never played or watched a real hockey game. I have this hope that it would be a "face movie," but the only people who would probably enjoy this movie are women between the ages of 13 and 17. The hockey scenes are terrible, defenders playing as if they were 5 years old, goalkeepers diving into shots that are 10 feet wide from the net, etc. It's so hard to predict the end of this movie, though !! For those who have seen, who could have imagined? For those who have not seen it, do not waste your time! <br /> <br /> I discovered this in the middle of the movie. To call this movie a drama is ridiculous !!
