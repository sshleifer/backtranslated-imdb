From the budget point 2.5 million CAD is not much when you look at the animatronics, puppets in this movie, which alone is the reason for the 9 week shoot. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was hoping to catch it when it came out, instead it was released on DVD recently. My main problem is that it's nothing funny, it's better than Tenacious D, who does not have a funny bone in his body. But this was a truly disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a physically very strong but his acting sucks! Rachel Skarsten gives what is possibly one of the most annoying and not at all funny performances I have ever seen. The only really great star in this is David Scott, which is art for the monsters is fabulous! His work with special effects is the main reason why this film deserves to be seen, loved the Cyclops and the Troll and Prof Monster went straight from the library of Henson. <br /> <br /> If you notice this, it will not be a greater waste of time but if you are looking to see this for a great Comedy Romp Horror ... Do not worry.
