Do not misunderstand me. I have a considerable weakness for the works of Charles Band, both as producer and director. But you have to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name on "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" puts a pseudonym on anything. As a bit of bad movie fun, "Head Of The Family" is quite lacking, although it's better acted than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these types of movies. J.W. Bitch is also quite funny as the titular monster, although for a super-intelligent being he is easily deceived. You know, I'm criticizing because the rest of the movie is so clear and witty, of course .... And have a main character named Lance Bogan? Good people. We did not know you Americans knew that piece of slang!
