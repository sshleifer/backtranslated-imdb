This was one of the most dishonest, senseless and non-peaceful films I have ever seen. Representation of the other, of the Israelis, was racist, backward, and unjust. On the one hand, the song played on the E.S car radio when placed next to an extreme right-wing Israeli driver was "I put a spell on you" by Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I even heard it on radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (such as architecture, food and slang) are influenced by Arab culture, and there is no reason for an Israeli Jew to be offended or irritated by a nearby car playing that music. The E.S. It seems so calm and collected with its dark glasses and cold look, through a long, still shot, is intended to force the viewer to see the Jew as dejected and racist, and E.S. as noble and temperate. <br /> <br /> I've traveled all over Israel, and I've never seen an IDF recruiting poster, since the service is mandatory. But in the film, not only is there a recruiting poster, but it portrays a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "do you want to shoot?" This is an extremely imprecise representation of the mentality of most Israelis, as well as Israeli soldiers, and such "propaganda" would not even exist on a random Israeli highway. In including him, the director intends to convince the public that Israel is a society of racist anti-Arabs determined to kill. <br /> <br /> The ninja scene was gratuitous and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers firing on Palestinians would be as undesirable in an Israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comical and violent scenario have been able to elicit applause from the audience since the director smeared so much the Israeli side that any shot of Israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. The director shows absolutely no attempt to build bridges, portraying the "other" as human or working for peace; violence is made to be the only solution. This is promoted by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends serves in the Israeli military, and the targets in gunfire are never Arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to shoot in front of an approaching Palestinian, unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning cry, fire in the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. Arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the steering style was also bad. The repetition became repetitive and no longer captivating. Symbols, like the Arafat balloon drawn, are forced out of any plotting structure or effective integration into the configuration; the balloon is Palestine penetrating and recovering Jerusalem, and is created without reason by E.S. The ambulance being checked by Israeli soldiers followed by subsequent Israeli ambulances passing through the checkpoint is an overly obvious statement of a double Israeli standard by the director. The director's attempt to show life in Nazareth as somber and meaningless is done with exaggeration; Show the routines of random people repeatedly, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that no cast member ever smiles and is minimalist in the dialogue almost screams the purpose of such scenes, the sadness of life, without allowing much room for interpretation folks. Contrasting a "section" of the film, daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this sadness on Israel, but never provides any direct evidence of why such guilt can to be properly <br /> <br /> I spent hours trying to understand why the music ended abruptly and began abruptly, and why many modern tracks of metal action and fashion were included in the score. I still can not get an answer. I felt the music was out of place in this movie; the contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was really annoying and did not affect or provoke thoughts. I can understand if the director intended the music to give some comical aspect to certain scenes, but I discovered that there was nothing comical to be found in Israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting with a ninja, or a woman having to undergo another walk a checkpoint, though defiantly. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during the intense scenes, and bothered by the lack of a score during silent scenes. Whatever the director's intent, he provided only one auditory dissatisfaction throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This film has no legitimate political message because it provides an imprecise and extreme representation of the other, and fails to address any issues. It is a propaganda film because the director claims that various symbols, styles and scenes attract the sympathy of the Palestinian side, while showing the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman, without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of a Hollywood scene filled with action or intense music is displayed in all acts of Palestinian violence against Israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and exciting feelings that music and filmmaking provoke are directed towards a side. There is no thought, reflection or deepening of the audience's understanding of the conflict; the emotions are simply pulled aside and held there in a "good versus bad" clich√© scenario. I believe that there was a lack of depth, quality and power to other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee".
