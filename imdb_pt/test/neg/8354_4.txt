The rich daughter of a businessman, who, as a young man, got rheumatic fever and now suffers from shortness of breath, discovers that his marriage to a charming woman was arranged by his father (whom she affectionately refers to as "Sweetheart"); worse than that, she may indeed only have a few weeks to live, leaving her husband free to marry her conniving romantic rival. Pure bed. Paul Osborn's screenplay (through the story of Jerome Weidman) shows the redundant flashbacks in the second half, instead of continuing with the plot, which submerges the already soaped scene in a dark conversation. Why go back when we can find out what is happening for ourselves? This is a "tearful woman" without faith in her target audience, so simplistic is the setting. Dorothy McGuire, who is covered in fur for most of the picture, is not a clever and smart heroine; when she is upset, she turns in and into the stone. When realizing that her marriage is basically a hoax, she dodges her husband like a consummate virgin (well, it's a possibility, she and Van Johnson sleep in separate beds after all!). Ruth Roman has the best moments in the movie as a society shark with her trap for Van, but what exactly do these women see in him? Johnson can be charming when needed, but put him in a melodramatic setting and he also gets engaged. MGM values ​​production only, but director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add some visual flavor to the flashbacks in a row and tries a lively pace for the opening half-hour of the film. ** in ****
