How to round out all the possible cliches and stereotypes in the horror genre and then insert them into a massively bad movie? The answer: "Camp Blood." That's absurd amateurish slasher done in a micro-budget and a bit too obvious inspired by "Friday the 13th." Four of the most intolerable teen characters you've ever seen? are they like a combination of ugly, stupid and boring? They camp and are quickly chased by a homicidal maniac in a clown costume. Do not even ask me what the killer's motives were or even who he was, because if he appeared in the movie, I missed it. This is one of the worst movies ever made, without inspiration or craftsmanship. The values ​​of production were so pitiful that there are actors playing various roles without bothering to make them unrecognizable. The only decent and valuable half-full sequence in "Camp Blood" is the opening in which the stunning and voluptuous Meredith O'Brien has sex in the woods with her geek scout. Yes, I am fully aware that this is a totally superficial observation, but again, this is a juvenile and retarded film, so who cares?
