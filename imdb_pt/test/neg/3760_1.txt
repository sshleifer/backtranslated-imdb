Calling "Rocketship XM" is a science fiction classic due to its release date (1950), its ability to capitalize on "Destination Moon" advertising and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as Sea Hunt's Mike. Nelson, the father of Rockford and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad enough to be good for MST3K and is best seen with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the most suitable type of movie to add riffing of the MST3K characters; Something lazy, slow paced, badly scripted and full of painfully bad attitudes. While unintentionally funny things like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" do not lend themselves to satiric comments (because the film constantly overshadows the presenters), really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. So, add some stars to the rating if you're watching the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story has the team making an unplanned right turn on the moon and ending up on Mars. What they find on this planet are the remnants of a human civilization, devastated by an atomic war. Only a Martian is shown in close-up, a normal-looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. The men look like the "henchmen" in the old Popeye drawings, they run nimbly around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with incredible accuracy - especially if they are supposed to be blind. Of course, none of this is explained, as this would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the script. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are featured in something called "Sepia Color" to distinguish them from the rest of the film in black and white. If you're thinking of "Wizard of Oz," you'll be disappointed because it's just black and white with a slight brown tone added to the post-production impression. <br /> <br /> In line with the imbecile sexism of the movie, the icy scientist spoils his fuel calculations - coming and going. Her inability to keep up with men makes her feminine side appear, and she and Mike Nelson cuddle each other as they face their death (insert the sound of gagging here). <br /> <br /> The real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center. So much so that MST3K was inspired to especially welcome these unknown heroes. The intrepid group of "journalists" appear within the first 10 minutes of the film, then occupy stations within 30 cm of the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center. Later, they are called upon to ask the stupid questions the mission director needs to expose the already very obvious message of the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD has an extremely low audio level, no subtitles and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you're grateful to be only 77 minutes away, it's still about 60 minutes long, since any 30-minute episode of "The Twilight Zone" has several times more content than this entire movie. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
