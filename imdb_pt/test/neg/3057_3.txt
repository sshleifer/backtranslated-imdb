This movie is about a party set up by "scary girl" high school. According to the illogical of these types of films, she is allowed to hold the party in a house that used to be a crematorium, a dubious place long closed and locked. Apparently, the history of this piece of property is one of the secrets of the best city not spoken among peoples, although the legend is whispered among the young. <br /> <br /> Why was this crematorium really closed? What really happened there in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these kill and kill movies of a supernatural nature, as long as there is something in them that is not copied from a hundred other films. The highlights of this film are a small "7-11" robbery by distracting the clerk with a vivid vision, the scene of changing clothes by the "good girl" witnessed by his idiot younger brother, the eventual disappearance of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the mirrored mirror scene and the concept of running water being a barrier against the supernatural; the best part of this movie is when the party sponsor owned dance for BAUHAUS in front of the fireplace; this scene rocks.
