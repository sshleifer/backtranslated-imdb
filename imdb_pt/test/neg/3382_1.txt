Okay, so when a friend of mine told me he should drive MM2 and MM3, I thought, hell, I have to take a look at Monster Man and see how it is, maybe I can be a part of it, but when I showed up on my device and tried to stifle the first 45 minutes of anything but bad, bad, I mean a horribly annoying comedy of that fat ass thinking he is funny, not to mention how looooong the director spent on the useless trip to the desert I came to the conclusion that these guys did not know what they were doing and lost the boat for a long time. The story had potential to be a bit different than the ordinary BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood Video shelf released by Lions at the time, but they certainly screwed it all up. Why put so much time and effort into shooting bad acts and bad jokes, why not shorten the trip and put more of the plot in the movie? Myabe's writing was so bad that they had to cut a lot of the movie or maybe the director did not shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to find stuffing to do the usual 84 minutes ???? All in all, and I'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald guy in the bar scene who has his skull crushed when chasing the three leads to the street, I'm going to give at least 1 star to try, and the scenes blood / death were not so bad, again, they tried. Too bad, Lions Gate might have created a legal franchise from that idea, but it failed. I do not recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a reduced version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene. FILTH!
