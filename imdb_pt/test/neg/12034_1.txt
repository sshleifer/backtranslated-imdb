I'm so glad he was not alive to see it. This movie is a mockery of your work. I agree with the other commentator - this movie was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it a zero, but I'm forced to give it one. <br /> <br /> The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was done. It's really amazing how the ropes can be pulled to do anything. If this film was able to reach the general public, it puts high hopes on other independent filmmakers who are worthy talent and who are fighting! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. By all accounts, this was not serious to be a comedy. The horror movie is a better game in a horror genre - this movie sucks.
