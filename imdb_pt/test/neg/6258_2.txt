This movie was one of those films that completely misled me into thinking it was a 1980s film slasher, based on the cover, but it was not. It was possibly one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The image on the cover did not correspond to any part or scene of the film; in fact, it did not involve a chainsaw. Not even the slogan fit the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two crooks who escape to a desolate cabin in the cold forest for a weekend getaway. However, things get colder when they start being murdered by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is hunting a dangerous killer. I'll cite the problems in a list. <br /> <br /> 1. The acting. Boy was cheap and horribly bad. It looked unnatural and looked like it was a screenplay. None of the actors seemed to have tried to present themselves with good intentions and therefore looked silly and tired. There was a bad acting out of all the characters in the movie, so I'm not going to target specific people, but I'll say the drug addicts did a horrible job, as did the police and cheerleaders, which is not a surprise. 2. The plot. This story had created a perfect storyline for the good old fashion slasher movie, but instead they filled with plot holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and a stupid background story for the killer's intentions. There were big holes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and still be there in the group of girls when that happened? The ex-convict virtually served no purpose in the film besides being a useless plot device. There was random and unnecessary sex and nudity scattered about him, even for a b movie or my taste was a little too much. As for the killer's intentions, let's just say it was stupid and it does not make sense why she's killing young girls. In addition, there were also some very predictable deaths that I saw coming to about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. The technical side. The lighting was good, certainly not the worst lighting I've seen in a movie, but there were spots where it should be dark, but it looked more like the afternoon. The house seemed darker with the lights on, then the lights off. The work of the camera was medium, had no good shot, no panes or amazing zooms, I thought the work done was creating some suspense with the framing. Overall, this film, in the sense of plot, character development and performance, was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time. What I thought would have been a great horror movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was really bad and wooden, there was virtually no sense in the plot and there was no excitement for this movie. However, the technical aspect of this movie saved it for me, because if the camera worked or the lighting was bad, I would have turned off the DVD player and put something else. I highly recommend this movie for those who like really bizarre b movies as well as those who follow cult classics because this movie certainly is. I partially recommend this movie to those who like slasher movies from the 80's. But for me, this movie was lamentable and totally horrible.
