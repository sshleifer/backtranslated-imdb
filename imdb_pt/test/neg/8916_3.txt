I love his martial arts style, is fast, up close and oh so fast but it seems his films are becoming more and more quality of life based crime and less meaning ... I thought he was out to bring a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda, this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character, but the rest was so far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts are also suffering. I hope to see a more dedicated Segal in his future films. This movie also lacks the plot keeping, there are many gaps, so the thought is lost. Many things are cryptic without a solution.
