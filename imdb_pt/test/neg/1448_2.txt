The Power began to look promising but soon became annoying and tedious to watch. The plot is about an ancient Aztec doll that takes possession of those who own it. The idea is "decent enough" and this movie would have been quite fun if it had been done better. However, after the first ten minutes, it soon becomes boring; we do not have any good death scenes and we have to listen to many conversations. In the end, one of the possessed men meets his death, melting in front of two girls, but it's not very interesting and definitely not bloody. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend the power to any horror or slasher. fan like just to gain from it.
