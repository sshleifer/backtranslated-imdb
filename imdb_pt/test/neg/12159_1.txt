As a "fan" of Genghis Khan, I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens' epic novels about Genghis and reading many historical discs, I feel like I know something about it and was very happy to share my knowledge with friends through this film ... <br /> <br /> This is over a disappointment. This film is practically done from beginning to end. There are some things that seem correct, but most of the time it is pure belief of the writers. This does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment like anyone else, unfortunately it's more boring. Nothing of the greatness appears in this film. <br /> <br /> I would NOT recommend this movie if you knew anything about it.
