Okay, I had reasonably high expectations for that. The controversial subject was a good concept. As a horror fan, I admit that I was fascinated and very excited about it. <br /> <br /> It turns out they had a great idea, but it was terribly executed. We will see. This movie seems to run in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be. The "happy" parts that I believe were made to contrast with the "dark" parts, but they do not work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The movie transits between these 3 modes very badly, I can not even begin to say how bad the direction and the editing. There is sex in the most unpleasant and unerotic way. I'm not complaining, but even by the Horror standards they were unnecessary and fulfilled. <br /> <br /> The characters are all unpleasant, except for Paula (Powerful). Your friend from Munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies I've come across recently. <br /> <br /> There is a plot that I will not go into detail ... It is not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. There's even a cool twist and a cool conspiracy going on. Do not try to understand everything because there are gigantic holes here. <br /> <br /> It's all so badly done that you do not care about the victims, the perpetrators, nobody. And to think that this could have been great. I can say one good thing about this, that is, the film shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures. With genetics and the controversial sciences advancing, this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these issues. But you will not find this here, just a series of freely glued scenes with people and things you do not care about. <br /> <br /> Skip this and go watch Flatliners instead, you're welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
