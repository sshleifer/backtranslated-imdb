I'm not really sure why people are being so complimentary about this weird movie. Having said that - I really sat for the entire two hours and can not say it was not totally uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and this is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer, so he will have seen a film made many times and will understand what happens in the process. But I think this is quite different from being able to actually direct a movie - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and without direction. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and that happened, I feel, in the finished product - it seemed to be a group of ensembles that had really no continuity in their feel or character. <br /> <br /> Fun, watchable, but good? Do not.
