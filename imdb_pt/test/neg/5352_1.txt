First things first - although I believe Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here), most of the blame for this ugly film transvestite should go to John Grisham, whose novel is based . Set at an undetermined point in time (the 1950s - the '70s? Now?), The film begins with the rape and murder of a child by so caricatured hill countrymen that their purpose seems to be to reassure the racists. that "at least we are not that bad ??" Cut to the wicked who come to court when the girls' father, Samuel L. Jackson, fearing they might leave with some technicality, shoots them in cold blood before the trial. <br /> <br /> The scenery is a 'deep south' that probably never existed - the few black characters live in shacks and seem to choose cotton, racist dyed wool (Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version of a Klansman ) are laughable in their villainy. The set-piece is the trial: for the defense, there are the "good guys" - a lawyer milquetoast played by Matthew McConaughey as if in a coma, his assistant played by the breasts of Sandra Bullock (she does not seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and Donald Sutherland as the drunk-lawyer-who-under-to-fight-the-good-fight. For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey undergoes the devil's movement, while in the city as a whole, crosses are burned, witnesses are intimidated and local citizens do not seem to care? <br /> <br /> Some of the comments here state that the film is immoral, since certainly Samuel Jackson is a killer and must rely on law enforcement instead of devoting himself to a faint oratory of Matthew McConaughey. . To be honest, objectionable, although the underlying message "Vigilante justice is good" may be, everything about the film stinks: the characterizations are unfortunate, the acting of lead, the slow direction, the script and the dialogue almost bordering the parody. Peter Menzies's exuberant, 50s Technicolor cinematography is beautiful, but derivative. <br /> <br /> And it continues for almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What remains to be said? This is a waste of 141 minutes of anyone's life, it is tedious, empty and unbearable and, almost like a belated reflection, it is morally repugnant.
