This was one of the most annoying movies I've seen in a while. I'm in my late forties, and watched it with my son-in-law (early twenties) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a failure. We watched about an hour and hung up. I spent more time on my iphone during the time we watched what I actually spent watching the movie. I gave a 3 because I liked the scenery and the cinematography; otherwise I would have given a 1. I am sure there are people who really like the "art" of it all, who will find my comment shocking, but we all have a right to our own opinions, right? I could not figure out if this was supposed to be a "girl movie," where the focus was on the mother, or whether it was to be a movie for the guys, focusing on battle and adventure. In my opinion, it was not successful in either.
