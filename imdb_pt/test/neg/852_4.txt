This was a mish mash of a movie that started going nowhere, got lost along the way, suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced. There were so many ugly and choppy mutton faces in this movie that I lost track of who the owner was and who the supervisors were. I have a theory about the cast though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and an ugly actress) and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. In fact, the actors who represented the final victims, the slaves, were beautiful, as were the priest's innocent daughter, while the owner of the farm, his minipulating lover and his supervisors were quite hard on the eyes. On purpose? You make the call. <br /> <br /> I hung there until the end and some others could also do it. If you just want to look at bare breasts, there are many of them here and if you have a slave / master fetish then you will love this movie. Otherwise, watch once, vomit, bathe and never talk about it to anyone.
