After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday newspaper, I hoped it was not the usual duff movies that are donated because no one would buy them. I was wrong. Sheens acting is similar to that of a ten year old in a school pantomime production and the same goes for most of the cast. Neill is satisfactory but plays a Russian and is not helped by his hybrid New Zealand / Northern Ireland accent nor the rest of the KGB characters who appear to be at a Cambridge Footlights meeting. In fact, the only people with genuine accents are extras that provide a strange word here and there, informing us, at least, where the hell everything is happening in what is otherwise a complete mix. The "espionage" factor is mostly blank and basically consists of Sheen faffing in various ridiculous disguises as she tries to blend into the background, quickly becoming not only boring but laughable. The plot has potential, but it is completely murdered by the rest of the confused production elements. That could have been a lot better.
