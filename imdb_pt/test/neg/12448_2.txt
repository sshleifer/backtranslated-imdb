That was pretty bad - bad acting, bad technical details, bad camera shots and poor audio (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I could not hear what they were saying, sometimes I played my speakers, even within the same conversation). The plot was predictable, and the characters consisted mostly of unbelievable neurotics, bi-polar and cartoons. The character development was horrible ... the older, sulky sister (why was it written in the script?), The annoying mother (again - what purpose?) The tearful girlfriend (why he has not abandoned her (like original - could not think of a better name, I think), hot girlfriend of the drug dealer (I have to have a hot latina, if you're going to have LA gangs, I I guess, but really ...), etc. etc. I can not believe I've watched the whole thing.
