This thing should not be called a movie, it's almost worse than "Hands", but you have to see it's hilarious. If you see in the video store rent it, if you see the 10th anniversary edition, yes there is a special edition, for less than $ 10 buy it, if your friend borrow it, you just have to see it. The acting is so bad, and the blood is so fake. After seeing this, you are wondering why they made this insult of the art of cinema? That's assuming your face does not melt like the Nazis in "Raiders." If you can see this, make sure you vote for this movie as 1 (horrible) so it can get to the bottom 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not Number 1 right now.
