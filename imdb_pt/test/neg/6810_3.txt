We were excited to rent this one after reading some reviews and see that it has scored so highly here. Well, we got home and we do not believe what we saw. Its basically comes out as if it were written by some old pervert who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime movie that really lacks plot and humor. The main character is all over the place ... one moment, he is like an immature little child, the next moment he is mature and intelligent, then heroic, then a perverted persecutor. <br /> <br /> The worst part is all the sexual content out of place. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has good sexual energy but this is just presented in a way that is scary. Nipple slip-ups, close-ups of a girls groin (often) in white panties, or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed that the person who wrote it was trying to live some fantasies through their cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> We were expecting something of a mature nature, but we just stood looking at each other and wondering what the hell this was ... besides rocking cartoon boobs and bad dialogs. If you want to see some cartoon characters, cleavage and groin ... this is for you. If you're looking for something more than that, this movie was empty. The characters and the dialogue were simply annoying. <br /> <br />
