Although many Billie Dove fans are delighted with their work here, I have to go through. As a socially prominent member of the British intelligent group, his British accent is basically non-existent and his line readings sound like, well, line readings and his emoting seems to be a trance and ponderosa. Basil Rathbone, usually a great actor, seems unbalanced and also speaks with a strange kind of accent - in his case, something like Italian, although we can not be sure. The script manages to keep its precise ethnicity a secret. He is further hampered by the script that gives him one of those old movie ailments, something to do with nerves, which requires surgery. The only real amusement is provided by the illustrious Kay Francis, who bears a lacquered bobbing with side curls in her role of a depraved countess who blatantly devours men, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. She pulls it with her unique demeanor. She's the only thing alive in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
