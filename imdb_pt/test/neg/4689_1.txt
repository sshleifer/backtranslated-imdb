What a terrible movie that was! I did this about 50 minutes and started to skip chapters until the end. The plot is nothing special, and the dialogue of the film deviates so much from the main story that his head will explode with anger. Many useless minutes squandered just listening to the chattering characters about something irrelevant to the plot, AND / OR something they could say in a short period of time. Camera work is unstable and grainy. It seemed that Mr. Milligan needed to take his finger off the zoom button! I also noticed that at some points during this film it seemed that Andy was having convulsions and was shaking the camera uncontrollably. The seams between the scenes were shaken and did not flow. The murder scenes were nothing special-incredibly, and ridiculously false. Ill any gore, as the title suggests. This movie runs about 1 hour and 20 minutes and the murder scenes take about 1 minute TOTAL of the entire movie - if that. What a piece of crap this movie was. Andy Milligan is actually probably one of the worst directors who plagues humanity with his untalented direction and camera work. Usually, I can go through really bad horror movies and laugh about it later. Seats BLOODTHIRSTY, however, I can not. I'm angry, I lost an hour and a half of my life watching this (which I would not do to win back). Accept my suggestion and DO NOT watch this movie unless you plan to fall asleep. TERRIBLE.
