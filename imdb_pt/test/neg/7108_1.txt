My poor little tank girl, they ignored all the good things about you. Why does it have as little to do with comics as possible? I would have loved a movie that followed the plot, or at least had the right characters. <br /> <br /> WHY WAS TANK GIRL? She's Austrailian, dammit! And she is not living in a post-apocalyptic war zone, she lives inland with Booga as a savage. She does it because she wants to live that way, not because she needs it, because Malcolm Mc Dowell is acting like an idiot. And why is she taking care of these children? The only children in the comic books end up being violently smothered by her, it's terrible that they have made her a lame mother figure. <br /> <br /> And my poor Jet Girl and Sub Girl! In comic books, Jet is a sarcastic joker and Sub-girl is ... another sarcastic joke with a strange sense of humor. In the movie, Jet is that little thing and Sub is a middle-aged jerk. And Booga does not look or act in a manner similar to what he should be. Although maybe human / hot love was too much for the US box office? The humor was so dumb too. What happened to all the stuff about the Smiths and that brilliant slang they used all along? What kind of line is "This will take too long? I do not want to lose Baywatch". Even programs for young children can come up with better material than that.
