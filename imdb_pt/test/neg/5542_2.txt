The sequel to Sci-Fi Channel by director and writer Michael Hurst of Stan Winston's classic horror tale about revenge that went awry has its moments and some decent gore but ultimately falls short of the original. <br /> <br /> Of course the filmmakers were not trying to make a comedy, but I found myself laughing everywhere. A family dispute initiated by a car accident is the basis for this entry into the franchise. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a city with dirt roads, drive trucks, drink in the moonlight and kick their asses whenever they can. Just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love by causing the attack to hit the shan. One night, the two young pigeons decide to go into the woods for a while while Ricky's sister watches, but it turns out that that same night some of the Hatfields accidentally kill Ricky's sister and get Jodie and him together. You know what happens next. Ricky finds his body of sisters and decides to make a visit to Haggis so that he can take revenge through the powerful Pumpkinhead. Ye Haw! In addition, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential condemned souls against using Pumpkinhead to relieve his pain. Which really puts a spot in the story because Harley should have called Pumpkinhead years before this story happens, but the setting and the characters look like dirty pilgrims who somehow traveled through time to bring the pickup truck back to Plymouth. Then there's the sheriff (Rob Freeman), who has his own ties to the devil and it looks like he belongs to a 1970s revenge movie instead of a cable horror movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the gore and special effects were cool, but instead of joining the man-in-suit way of thinking, Hurst used some horrible 3D pictures for certain scenes. A particularly embarrassing shot shows Pumpkinhead jumping from tree branches like a poorly rendered 3D monkey. The cinematography was exceptional and elevated the quality of the film quite a lot. The performance was also pretty decent, with the exception of a few poorly performed accents. <br /> <br /> Family fights never go well, especially when the families involved in the dispute deal with Pumpkinhead. I did not enjoy every minute of this movie, but it was a lot better than most of the movies that the Sci-Fi Channel does. Maybe it's a sign that the channel is trying to bring the quality of its films to match the quality of its original series. " I would not waste any coins on a location, but if you had the chance to get a replay in the tube, I'd say take a look. It's a not-so-killer movie, but it rises a little above the level of junk that hits the DVD these days.
