OK, here's the deal. I love action movies and I usually have no problem hanging on too much disbelief about plot holes or other implausible actions. However, this film went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to ridicule. Let me get this straight. Police send a notorious gangster and police killer (along with several other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. They are then forced to stop in an enclosure where precisely two policemen are working, one of which is one day away from retirement and the other is a fire. Apparently, the building was about to be closed, so somehow the police decided that everyone in the entire police station would have the night off for New Year's Eve. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne appears to catch Fishburne before he can report him and the other dirty cops. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or transactions). Interestingly, the police who launched the attack on the premises are in full SWAT equipment with night vision goggles, assault rifles, the entire nine meters. Later, they even bring a helicopter with more people in full gear. I'm not a cop but I'm sure you can not just leave the station with a full squad of equipment without someone asking what you're doing. And the police helicopter ??? In the supposedly dreadful winter storm ??? Also, no one near the enclosure happens to hear or see this siege happening with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire coming out? I mean it, come on. I know this happens in Detroit, but even so it would raise suspicion on a supposedly secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if there were no other glaring issues as well. For one thing, the first two minutes of the movie are filmed in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought it would set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The rest of the film has no sense of rhythm, tension or drama. The "characters" are not related at all, which is probably due to the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There is no action interesting enough to make this a good action movie, and there is enough character / story development to make this thriller / drama passable. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing the director even tries to make interesting or intense. Oh, and by the way, the final scene in the desert? I thought this was in the middle of an industrial part of Detroit and suddenly we are in the forest ?? The acting is not terrible in this film, it's just that direction and writing are atrocious. I really like some movies from Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy, but this is terrible.
