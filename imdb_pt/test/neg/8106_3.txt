MGM Miscellany of Jimmy Durante giving a big party to everyone in Hollywood. No major stars appear - we have the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, Durante and Lupe Velez. I did not recognize anyone else - they were probably unfamiliar (for good reason). The film contains annoyingly boring jokes and some really awful music and choreography. The only things that save him from being a total disaster are the "battle" of Laurel & Hardy with Lupe Velez and a wonderful Disney cartoon called "The Hot Chocolate Soldier". It is a beautiful and very colorful drawing that gives the film a great boost. Otherwise, the film is a colossal hole. There is no director credited - what does this tell you?
