I am amazed at the top reviews here for this OK surf movie. This really stems from the "California Dreamin" school, from barnyard to beach, and is not really plausible. The idea that the main boy learns to ride a board so well in a concrete wave pool that he beats the real surfers at his game in the real ocean, is simply silly. In Australia, where most urban teenagers surf, this movie was ridiculed because the public took everything with a grain of sea salt. Made in the 80's but with your heart in the 60's, it's fun to watch and it looks and sounds good, but it's not one in a classic class at all. Even the actors did not survive it. WE ARE SERIOUSLY IN LIQUID BRIDGE OR WALKING THE WILD SURF or BINGO OF BEACH COVERAGE here. Oz stars like Occy and the great heroine of Wednesday, Gerry Lopez, are recruited to add head recognition to the talent of the waves of our boy of farm, but this only made the cinema audience laugh. It's for 10 year olds who do not question much. Not even in the hands of Gods and that was silly too.
