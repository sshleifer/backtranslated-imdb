A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It is not relevant whether it is a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a bad movie is a bad movie, regardless. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I'm scared, it was a very poor movie. First of all, just by making characters look dangerous, or sexist, they do not bring an aura about them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (the character of Amitabh Bacchan) that we should be in the aura of his "power" and that showed the "benevolence" of the character? Anything. <br /> <br /> This fact was said by a commentator and Amitabh continued to give facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give bright facial expressions, but why should that mean anything if there is no story or story to accompany it? <br /> <br /> There was no adequate characterization of the characters who worked under 'sarkar' as well. Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he is wise? The film's flow was usually monotonous because scenes from The Godfather were created (such as the cop beating Abhishek Bacchan), the elder brother being killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed by Pacino's instructions), but much was sought to be packed into the film with little history and depth to follow. That was really the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of intricate details as a godfather in 2 hours and also with a few dialogues, what you get is a light show of a cricket game, never making the full impact watching a full match.
