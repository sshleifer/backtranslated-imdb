Thank God I was not operating any heavy machine, it could have been an even worse disaster. The shots were slow and very repetitive. Different scenes, same pictures, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. The story line was pretty empty. William Hurt was the worst. Where did he get that stupid accent? Random scenario shots just to include them really did not add much. There were more shots of Arbor traveling in his car than anything else. The direction really did not take us through any of the scenes and also did not make me feel for any of the characters. I would have rated zero if the IMDb had the option. Great sedative if you can not sleep. There were 2 hours of my life I will never go back.
