I came across this movie by accident and I wish I had not. <br /> <br /> Why do a sexually rude sequence (and a little blood when a man is beheaded) from a well-known children's movie? <br /> <Do not make the boys see that the title deviates, has nothing to do with the original Snow White, except for stealing their characters. Better yet, do not bother going, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I could not watch everything, the poor (compared to Disney) cartoon graphics, and no plot other than how to ruin everything A classic movie made me want to give up and quit.
