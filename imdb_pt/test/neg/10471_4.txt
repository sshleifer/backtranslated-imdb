.... OK, sheriff with no notion of small town? Checks. The sexy daughter of the sheriff? Checks? Ne'er-do-well boyfriend of the sheriff's hot daughter, who does the sheriff hate? Checks. Developer of corporate land that greedily puts profit on people? Checks. Is the rank and file of the developer accidentally dropping a primordial monster and being pressed to cover it up? Checks. Natives warning of death and mass destruction if things did not return to the way they were? Checks. Special effects of amateur CGI that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Checks. Seriously, virtually every clich√© in your typical Sci-Fi Original movie has been grouped into a classic, very good movie. The only thing missing is the scientist / specialist trying to convey his knowledge; There is a paleontologist with three students who are ambushed in The Bone Eater early in the movie, but they are basically extras in the movie. And I can honestly say that I foresaw practically all this; who survives and who does not (though I have to say I got the actual death time of one of the characters wrong in about an hour). I swear I could have made this movie if they gave me all the characters. Despite all this, the movie is fun to watch, if for no other reason than playing MST3K with your friends. If you like mindless fun, it's a great movie to watch, and that's why I give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4, though for all intents and purposes it deserves a much, much smaller rating. But again, you would not get in tune with an original SciFi movie if you were looking for a movie with a real plot, important characters or good special effects, is not it?
