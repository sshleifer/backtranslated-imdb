Total Garbage !!! No reflection into the heights of Washington that so often. If I had four arms, I would give four stupid ones down. Performance performance worse than the plot. Truly over rated. Hour and a half of visual torture. Watch some of Ben Aflec's films for the rest of my life. Feel bad about the movies that lost this crap. What were the judges at the film festival watching?
