Martin Lawrence is not a funny man, I'm Runteldat. He only has a lot in mind and he is very crazy, who attacks his puns well at the beginning of the game. He tries to make fun of the critics, which boils down to "f *** them". Then he goes on rather primitive sexual jokes in smokers with throat cancer and just descends from there. 3/10
