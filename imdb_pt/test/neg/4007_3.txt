Finally. Here is a movie that does the same for the reputation of the men of Greece and Russia as "Gigli" did for those of Affleck and Lo. FROM THE EDGE OF THE CITY details the sad and sordid lives of some young Russian emigres who live in and around Athens and spend their time assaulting cars, fucking, prostituting women emigrating and prostituting themselves ("But we're not gay because we do not know ... And if we do, it's only once or twice, with the same face. ") There's practically nothing here that you have not seen before and better; only the location of Athens adds a little novelty - even so, there are only one or two scenes that are scenic. Screenwriter / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 Steps to Paradise") offers 95 relatively generic minutes, in which highlight moments involve how stupid, sexist and (by the looks of things) most of these faces are practically irretrievable. (Curiously, the happier the subject, the more redeemable he appears.) What really bothers you is the treatment of women. Greek and Russian men would seem to give the Italians a run for their money over the famous madonna / prostitute complex. Has life in Greece improved much for women since the time of Plato and Socrates? One must imagine. <br /> <br /> If I seem to be comparing Russians and Greeks to this criticism, I apologize, but even the non-emigrants pictured here (the taxi driver, for example) are idiots. According to another review on this site, the film (a hit at his house) was presented by Greece for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. What this says about the state of Greek cinema, I hesitate to reflect.
