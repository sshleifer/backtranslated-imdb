Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto who put Neoedision and flixer.com (a once promising online movie community) temporarily out of business and out of the network because of his style of direction and his method of filming in his next movie THE BEST FRIEND OF GIRL. <br /> <br /> The HOLE suffers from this style of cinema "look at me, I am a filmmaker" that is becoming the standard next to Hollywood today, to the detriment of content. The HOLE really begins with a unique concept, but this concept and the promise of captivating content are soon to be destroyed by the film's directional style "look at me." <br /> <br /> There are some funny moments that still shine through pretense, but it's a painful short to watch. <br /> <br /> How sad when the new generation of "filmmakers" choose not to be a servant of history, but rather to try and dominate on and off the screen. Heck they do not mind as long as they get the studio contract, beach house and a new car, content and presentation are minor issues. <br /> <br /> The real sad part of all this is Hollywood embraces so much the "look at me" attitude that the whole aesthetics of cinema is changing. Instead of presenting a story in a straightforward way that puts history first, today's directors are getting "tentative," that is, "look at me." <br /> <br /> Am I or am I the only one that was really put on? outside by SWORDFISH's Seine opening minutes. This movie started to rise above Sena's directing attempts in the movie "look at me", unfortunately this short film by Mr. Ishimoto did not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 from Elec Tv.
