Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty, who specializes in cheesecake chorus magazines; she manages to put herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her impending solo success (with romantic offerings on all sides) left her boss Gene Kelly chewing a little. Terribly tired part of Technicolor candy cotton, with memorable musical designs (the two worst are irrelevant flashbacks of the 1890s, with Hayworth portraying his own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well, but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious, he's unbearable, and the rest of the time he's flying with adrenaline. The script is a lead weight, not even giving support players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines. * 1/2 of ****
