Solo is a bad movie - it can not be ignored. The acting mostly is a lot of wood (the only exception is the performance of Adrien Brody as the creator of Solo, Bill) and the story is small enough that you'll probably forget it while watching the movie. That said, such films are more about action than about plot / acting and as such live or die by the action pieces - which are ultimately the purpose of such films - give something to the 14-year-olds to smile at. adults watch movies of real substance. And even in this Solo can not deliver - that little action exists is poorly done, bland and uninspired. After seeing the trailer for this on television, I was expecting something along the lines of Predator with a robot replacing Predaot. Instead, I got a lifeless action movie with a poorly constructed attempt to delve into it, assuming the message that robots can feel it too. Watch Terminator II or Predator instead ... both the classics that this movie desperately wants to be but lack the inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.
