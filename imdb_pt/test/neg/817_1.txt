I say that. If you want to see art, you go to an art gallery. If you want to see a movie, you go to a theater. The attempt to interweave art and filmmaking is disastrous in "Where the Heart Is." An interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby." You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Above all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "The Silent Partner" because your character here is a terrible embarrassment. In fact, all this production is a constraint. Of course human art is intriguing for a few minutes, so make a short, but do not subject an audience to useless nonsense, disguised as filmed entertainment. - MERK
