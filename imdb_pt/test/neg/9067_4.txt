Is there anything else on earth to be more attractive than to learn what awaits our fragile bodies after death? The Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (soulmate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides a step-by-step answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human entrails and crooked minds. Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I do not know what facets of the film, apart from its notorious reputation, may have helped it acquire a sufficiently high rating. Storywise is quite simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or perhaps an assistant pathologist or whoever) is fed up with his morbid routine the duty and unloads your psychological tension in a non-traditional way, right in your workplace. I am perplexed at what specific message the authors tried to provide with this plot of a note. I suspect it may be somehow inspired by the peculiar behavior of Udo Kier's character in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It is difficult to assess the performance of actors who do not squeeze a single word. Her emotions are hidden behind medical masks. There is also not enough room for a great camera - basically all the action unfolds mostly within four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup seems very plausible but only a handful of medical forensics experts can judge how true and anatomically correct the dissection is performed here (if anyone cares). Honestly, I used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of specific organs and determine the cause of death. Now I know that the corpses are broken, raped and humiliated, bowels are torn, brains are removed from the head, stuffed into the abdomen and mixed with viscera, then the body is sewn and washed - nothing personal. And what should these poor boys write in their misleading autopsy reports afterwards? Shock and disgust - it is very unlikely that an unsuspecting spectator discovers, to their horror, that the disc he intended to watch with his wife and children next to a Christmas tree turns out to be a manual of graphic video on vivisection. This obscure item is little available, sought after by people well acquainted with the subject and not easily offended. So it would be useless to warn anyone to sabotage this movie. They are well aware of what exactly they are watching and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is really talented and elegant director, which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" - previous' The Awakening ', amazing short in black and white, and 30 minutes' Genesis', visually stunning and temperamental, with an out-of-rhythm concept and interesting. And I'm sure that one day he will win the hearts of viewers with his new, more mainstream material. And, sooner or later, 'Aftermath' would become a rarity to the meticulous collectors of their 'early warming' works. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, I'm afraid, it can be strongly recommended. for medical students or specialists who study mental disorders and sexual misconduct.
