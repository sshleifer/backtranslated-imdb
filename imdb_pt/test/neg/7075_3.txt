I've seen this movie, and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I did not know what to expect but as soon as the movie was on its way it was cool to watch it. The idea was very original and the performance was good. Especially Jenna Dewan as the exciting / evil Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror movies is making a good ending. But then the movie failed. For a change, a final scene in a hospital, where suddenly all the staff were gone. First you see doctors and nurses running around, but then everyone went home? <br /> <br /> There are no cries for help while they are chased by Tamara, Escaping to the roof (it's also a smart move ... no) and off course it's sort of an open end. <br /> <br /> No .... the movie started great, the main part was cool to watch, but they really messed up the ending using all the cliches of bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick failed in my eyes with this movie, after making some really quality films like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a good horror full of final cliches, Tamara is a good movie to watch. For me, I like movies that surprise me.
