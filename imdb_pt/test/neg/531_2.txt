Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow starring Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks, a karate instructor who helps Cash (Jolie) escape Pinwheel, its creators who seek to detonate it and destroy a rival company. Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd appear to replace the duo, while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the escaping duo. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise, is how the series managed to have quite prolific and unusual actors in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (I do not know her? Well, she was in a lot of 70s porn) this one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcolm McDowell. (Ok, so the cast of Cyborg 3 is not so impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I've seen it on the science fiction channel and I must admit I was not impressed. Actually hit it, Cyborg 2 is a movie that looks lovely, is filmed with great style and the visual details make it easy for the eyes. However Cyborg 1 was the same way, in fact, the film was directed with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made everything easy on the eye. Unfortunately as the first, this one has no new ideas or anything like a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for various reasons, the film does not have much to offer beyond its looks. Another aspect is the terrible acting. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance do well, but seriously, Palance is playing with a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I think on the bright side you can not accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with the cast. Still, the film is monotonous and I lost interest in the story fifteen minutes later. Besides, why did they tie you up with Cyborg? It has nothing to do with your predecessor, which can be worse than. <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
