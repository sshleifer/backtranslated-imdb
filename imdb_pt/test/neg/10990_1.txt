I had a different experience with this movie - it was never charming, pleasant or funny to me. One big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label did not give any indication of the language (s) spoken in the film. another was the lack of options on subtitles. <br /> <br /> I found the lack of annoying dialogue especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was. The wildly inconsistent development of the weak plot was intriguing. Were there characters or just vague gestures? was there really a plot? <br /> <br /> On a separate subject, I am being asked to correct the spelling of the "dialogue," with the suggested substitute for "dialogue." maybe this whole movie, including IMDb, is designed to be confusing or surprising, but I'm getting angrier than fun.
