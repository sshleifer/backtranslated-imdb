OK, I have to admit I really enjoyed House of the Dead, despite its well-documented flaws. However, this was the worst movie I've seen since Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD, the effects are much higher. However, the plot is weak, the action reminiscent of everyone's favorite, the porn movie and the "character" decisions and actions constantly bordered on the imbecile. I feel like experimenting with the latest Uwe Boll movie releases just to get a feel for the HOTD2 perspective. I am not suggesting that it is really the cure, but a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been so abominably insulted, the only way is up. Okay, it's there. I got the minimum of ten lines and I will not waste any more time with the waste of celluloid that is the House of the Dead 2.
