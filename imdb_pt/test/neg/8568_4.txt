I am a big fan of horror, particularly the Spanish horror. This movie had so many possibilities to be good. It's a wonderful idea, a watchful ghost nun, like most of what came out of the mind of Jaume Balangueró. Both the visual and sound effects were also very good. But everything was shamefully ruined by bad direction, a horrible cast and a painfully bad script (exhibition, exhibition!). What a pity. Maybe Balangueró should write and direct a remake ... Also, I do not understand why this has to be spoken in English by actors who do not know how to speak English (and when they speak English), they do so badly that they just make their performances even more false). If you look at contemporary Spanish horror films like El Orfanato or Rec, the performances are totally in tune with this kind of ghost story - and that's being realistic, being credible as someone like us, as real people, because that's the only horror way reaches its goal. Unfortunately, everything failed in La Monja.
