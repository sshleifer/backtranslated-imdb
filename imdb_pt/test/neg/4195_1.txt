In addition to the comments about the technical merits of production, or lack thereof, the performance is absolutely horrible. What's really scary about this movie is that I actually have a copy of it, of course, it was in a bargain box and had been renamed as "Dark Harvest 2," and having seen it, I can understand why it was in the bargain box - they should have paid me to take it out of their inventory. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a cornfield. maze looking for their daughters because he has a premonition that something will happen to them. I suspect the camera the girls were playing at the beginning of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the maze, he is faced with the ghost of some children, who are poorly made, and the film goes terribly south of there. <br /> <br /> I can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise they would never have gotten rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit in, and it was not worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
