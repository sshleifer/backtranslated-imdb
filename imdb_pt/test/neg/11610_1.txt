At my local video store, they have a special place for two girls and one guy. It's a really long-running joke. The official allows people to rent it for free. They greatly value their customers so that they waste their hard earned money. <br /> <br /> I was extremely surprised to see that people gave this movie a good review. Maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes?) People involved with the movie write them? Maybe the director's / writer's mother?) Maybe I've seen so many good movies that this one fails in comparison.
