The problem with this type of lyrical film production is that you make a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little middle ground. Placing it gently, this is not "Berlin - a city symphony" or "Man with a movie camera." Unfortunately, there is not much to look at either. <br /> <br /> The problem with this is that it is simple and half-cooked, as if Michael Moore had participated. It has really nothing to say, or rather show us with images and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propose a thesis. This is just a patchwork in search of a stitch. (Although inadvertently the movie tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than he intended. There is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti-technology, anti-civilization, and anti-media film that is deeply rooted in technology. "Do what I I mean, not like I do. You just have to love the Yanks, huh.) Tonally, there's something bitter and misanthrope about this episode. Both previous episodes had moments of lyricism and joy; This time the tone is consistently sad. It simply does not work during that time, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. <br /> <br /> Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a mess. The whizzy digital material is particularly misleading. This gives the whole thing a super demanding, overprocessed look, and also weakens the "realistic" nature of the "metric found" analog. (I mean, I'm sorry for the guys.) Part of Koyanisqaatsi's joy was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film, but now the optical film is a historical artifact, they have to 'embed' the digital domain, but I do not think digital material often looks like video links from CNN or BBC World.) And with "images found," well, digital manipulation is usually ugly and generally silly and solarization made me think in ... <br /> <br /> ahem ... <br /> <br /> Sequences of James Bond titles. <br /> <br /> Aham. Oddly enough, there is also the possibility that the movie was simply stolen by the performance of Yo Yo Ma; is as discreet as a narration by Lawrence Olivier. The images would have to be very interesting to confront with all this charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass is in a strange shape; I never expected him to drop Verdi's requiem! (It made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired response to any part of this movie). There is even a musical piece that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they have changed their pills. <br /> <br /> From our 'idle questions' department: Is Geoffrey Reggio really an Indian Hopi? Or did he just do a sweatlodge in Hollywood Hills? Oh, and the excerpts from the previous episodes of the trilogy are a commentary on how these films are also part of the global media?
