This film serves all the Greek stereotypes imaginable. In a particularly nasty scene, the tycoon says, "I'm just an ignorant peasant." As the grandson of Greek peasant immigrants who have transmitted a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, I find this film despicable and hateful.
