A sheltered, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted young woman harbors a disturbed and overly emotional side that comes to light after her absent father visits her mother for divorce. Directed by celebrated director of photography William A. Fraker, this moody psychological thriller falls into the trap in which most of the films directed by directors of photography meet: each scene is composed of the best style, but with the sacrifice of a fluid rhythm , thrilling narrative. Fraker (and his director of photography, László Kovács) very much like transparent whites and golden tones, which gives the image a polished feel of tableaux. The mansion in the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor, and Fraker walks back and forth like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, are able to cut the plastic overlap and are quite attractive, despite the irregular editing (which turns their scenes into small, partially realized deals). Sondra Locke, another interesting screen personality, seems to be chosen for her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion." Locke is a curious human jigsaw, and she is initially quite intimidating and dangerous; however, this role is so old that Locke can not find anything new to get out of the deep freeze, and it gets in the way. Fraker allows the scenes of Locke's madness to continue, while Shaw (looking terribly affable) is put in the impossible position to play sweetheart for her. All this nonsense could be worth it if the script had been tempered with a minimum of tangibility (or at least some wit or humorous relief). As it is, Lewis script John Carlino and Edward Hume, adapted from Stanton Forbes' novel "Go To Thy Deathbed", masks the spectator early on and only the charisma of the players takes us to the finish line. * 1/2 of ****
