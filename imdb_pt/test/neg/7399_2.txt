Although exceptionally color-coded for a second string, the vivid costumes of the leaded females can not bring life to the flat and directed script. The "plot" revolves around newly released young people on parole trying to go straight, but being pursued by a vengeful former Pinkerton (a scene chewing Fred Clark) and a femme fatale determined to wrap them in their schemes of theft bank, wanting or not. Like Cole Younger, Wayne Morris is big and handsome, but his "cool" behavior and wooden acting skills hurt things. The action pattern is frankly no better than an episode of Gene Autry or Roy Rogers with the .45 Colt, which never needs reloading and shooting skills that allow a rider to shoot his hip and injure a man of at least 15 meters. ..Oh gosh...
