I watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on the list of "favorite episodes" of so many people. I'm not bragging anyway, but from the beginning, I realized they were in some kind of toybox / can, with huge eye looking at them, for the type of characters there. Even though throughout the episode, the questions of "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What's out?" To bear the suspense of the episode (which unfortunately I have already discovered), I must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them made the episode interesting enough. Although the twist of history may have been harder to guess if EVERYONE was (toy) soldiers.
