I rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering I like this kind of movie and considering who was in it but I was wrong. The acting stunk, the fight scenes were so bad and they have some people known to be in it, but did not release anyone with ability to act to play the lead? I noticed that some people gave a 10. Why would you consider giving this stack of horses a 10? You might say it's worth a 10 for pure comedy, but when you vote for a movie that should not be a comedy you can not give a 10 for comedy. You have to evaluate it about what it should be and not for something the director did not want. Maybe some of you guys voted 10 because they thought it would be fun to have this low-rated, high-rated movie so people would go out and rent or buy because you think it's fun to fool people. You are playing with people time and money that you do not have the right to do. If the movie is bad, give it a bad rating, if it's good, give it a good rating, but do not lie. I gave this movie a 4 and I'm glad I was able to check it for free from my library because this movie sucks and it really is not worth paying a penny to see.
