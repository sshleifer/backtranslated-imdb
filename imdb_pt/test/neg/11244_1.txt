I watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes from the start, I hoped it would end. <br /> <br /> It had a promising start; the first 10 minutes. The premise of this film (a friendship that goes nowhere after having spent days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms) is not believable. He kisses her somewhere along the way, and she feels ohh, so terrible about it. <br /> <br /> Very little substance to grab your interest. Performance simply does not hold up. He is very passive. Regardless of how much of the movie is displayed, the viewer never develops any kind of connection to the characters on the screen. You learn that your next statement will be as boring as the previous one. ("Do you smoke a cigarette?", He does not smoke, He wants her to stop smoking, She does not know it now?) <br /> <br /> She calls you in the middle of the night to visit you after a year of absence, she enters the door, they do not even hug or kiss or express any kind of emotional connection. He does not even lean forward to lift the suitcase to help her. That's not how people behave, that's not how best friends behave. <br /> <br /> When he gets the call in the middle of the night (she's in town for a day), he shows little interest in seeing her face, acts more like she's a burden to the night. At this point they have known each other for two years and he has not seen her for a year. It is not believable, it is not real. Supposedly, he wrote a book on Entropy and Enthalpy, but we never see him write, read or discuss any of his interests in Physics with her, not that she would be able to deal with the discussion. We learned that a watermelon in L.A. costs $ 50, (it was not the kind of silicon you mind) it has no problem in giving that fruit. We also learned that the airport is shut down when some really fake snowflakes fall from the sky. I'm sorry, but was that in LA as well? <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them struggling, they're always on vacation. They have endless time, they have no worries. <br /> <br /> Good life. Unreal life. Unreal characters. Title Bad. Bad movie
