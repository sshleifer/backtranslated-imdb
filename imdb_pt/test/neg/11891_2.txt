During university, our Philosophy professor Mr.R touched us "Roger & Me" in its entirety. This was at a time when the obese misfit was still virtually unknown; a charlatan in training, a future family name who was still busy perfecting his reasoning skills and still learning to manipulate the easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated. , the illiterate, the half-literate, the ignorant, and the ridiculously gullible among you. <br /> <br /> When we finished seeing him, I thought, "Yeah, it was kind of fun - in a totally silly Bugs Bunny in a way - but that ultra-biased and anti-capitalist propaganda advertisement that does not have no objectivity, its sole purpose is to take a cheap look at people and ideas for which the creator of the film likes a documentary of any stretch of the imagination. " However, our beloved Marxist teacher was absolutely thrilled with R & M, and we ended up not only NOT criticizing any aspect of it, but Mr. R really spent the rest of the class praising his "qualities." Just to make us understand, the words "propaganda," "manipulation of the spectator," "extreme left," or "presentation of selective facts" never left their perpetually smiling mouth ... And just to remind you: this should be a philosophy class, do not tell your students with your own POLITICAL BS. Anyway, now I get to the really interesting aspect: this teacher, Mr.R, is now a successful screenwriter in Hollywood. He wrote several left-hand scripts with A-level stars. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story: this is the kind of person for whom every door is open in Hollywood. <br /> <Michael Moore is an untalented filmmaker (which he proved beyond a little doubt with "Canadian Bacon"), but being a Marxist liberal opens the door to just about anyone. Tinseltown is filled with radical pro-Chavez extremists, hence the reason that political brainwashing through simplistic portraits of reality has been an integral part of the Hollywood experience for many decades. <br /> <br /> Embrace that demagogue and you betray your own brain forever.
