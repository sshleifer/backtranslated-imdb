I can not remember the worst movie I ever saw. Total waste of actors and audience time. If you'd rather sit on your TV and think about when this movie will be finished then this is the right movie for you. Maybe this movie is recorded. to make people believe that Moscow has some past mystique. But I must say that I expected nothing more from Rade Serbedzija, but I expected more from Vincent Gallo. The film has no plot, character, development, outcome. The main movie is about underground tunnels and how mystical they are. right there is some camera effect, but even this is very poor.More and more are the same images.Total loss of time.
