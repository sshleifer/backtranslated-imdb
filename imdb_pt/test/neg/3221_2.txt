A friend of mine decided to rent this thing, lucky it was not my money .. Very well wasted my time though. A story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by an incredibly bad acting and a horrible montage / direction. Maybe it can become a classic because of all the weird action :) (the character of Gary Busey, for example) All super-acted characters were the only thing that made this movie a little interesting when they caught your eye (by all the wrong reasons obviously) where the movie itself failed miserably. In short: A waste of time and money <br /> <br /> 2/10
