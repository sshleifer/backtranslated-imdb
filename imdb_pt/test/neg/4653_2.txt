All but the youngest Americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of "Laaaaaa-sie!" little Timmy, or whatever the boy's name, moaning his little tugboat for his friend Border Collie. These same Americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that Lassie made the leap from television to film (or was it the opposite? I'm clearly too lazy to do any research here), and The Painted Hills is one of those. It's irresistible to make a "this movie went to the dogs!" pun, so I'm not going (even if technically I just did). But in a way, it does. Lassie (playing Shep, man's best friend) gets the highest grossing. THE DOG GETS THE TOP COVERAGE Now, I'm not familiar with the way the actors or their agents negotiate contracts, but here's how it unfolds in my mind: MOJO MOGUL: Okay, Lassie, in the credits, it's going to be "and with Lassie as Shep! LASSIE: Rrrrowf! Grrrrrrr MOVIE MOUSE: Ha, ha, boy, calm down, calm down! lead â€¢ LASSIE: Rawrf! Rawrrrrff rawrf! MOVIE MOUSE: Oh God! Drop my arm! Top billing! Top billing for you, now drop my arm !!! <br /> <br /> So the dog gets the biggest and the rest of this shocked cast, I suppose is understandable.We received the lovely grumpus Jonathan, the prospector, his young, whiny and seemingly orphaned friend, Tommy, the failed Lin Taylor, and the lovely, old-fashioned religious grunt Pilot Pete The flesh of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences, so I'll spare you the real pain of ass to the movie. Jonathan is a prospector with a dog named Shep, and his partner dies while he is in his claim. He gets a new partner named Lin, who gets obsessed with gold, and Jonathan, for some reason, gives Shep to the weeping whiner Tommy. Lin kills Jonathan, Shep sees, and Lin tries to kill Shep. So Lin tries to kill Tommy. Then Tommy whimpers, gets cold, and Shep makes an elaborate plan to take revenge on Lin, what he (or she?) Does. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless you have a deep and unsettling need to see a Lassie movie (even then, there has to be a better Lassie movie than this), avoid The Painted Hills. When he is not crawling, marveling at Lassie's limited ability to "act" (similar in style, perhaps, to Keanu Reeves - always the same facial expression, only the body moves), setting the obvious using several minutes of movie or insulting Native Americans everywhere with their white actor in facepaint "Ugh! How! Me Running Bear!" stereotypes, The Painted Hills is only suitable for Lassie fetishists or people who have some kind of connection with prospecting through their days as an old prospector look at grigler who gleaming golden vein consolation!
