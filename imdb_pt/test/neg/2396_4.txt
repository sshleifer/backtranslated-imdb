"Love and Human Remains" is one of those obviously scripted, obviously depicted, obviously staged, films that are so obvious that the escape velocity of their inventions and fabrication is beyond me. Not worth explaining, this amateur movie tries to line every smart line, every misanthropic tone, every peculiar sexual predilection in a movie with a lack of concern in making the pieces fit. In short, a sensational crap without the feeling ... that pretty much leaves only crap.
