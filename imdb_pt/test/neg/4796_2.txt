It did not look like a movie, and fortunately it was short (less than 90 minutes), it looked more like a commercial of possibilities in computer graphics: most of the special effects are great, for sure. But that does not make a great movie or a good movie. I'm not saying it's absolutely useless, since you can see what the possibilities are in CGI or GCI, or whatever it is called. <br /> <br /> As I read somewhere, "You can not fix it in the cut room," a bad story and untargeted actors can not be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects ! Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work with. <br /> <br /> However, they thought that this could be sold in the USA is an idea of ​​anyone, since the US are the bad guys. <BR> <BR> <BR> And it's not so typical of low budget stories, do they have to create an imaginative country in southern Mexico ?? <br /> <br /> Well, I have 2! Just because of the special effects, the rest is absolute rubbish!
