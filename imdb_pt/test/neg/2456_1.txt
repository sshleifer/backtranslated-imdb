Greetings to all, <br /> <br /> Is not it amazing the power that movies have over you after the first screening? <br /> <br /> I was so delighted with the first screening of this film that I could stop talking about Flatliners to all my friends for weeks - remember that I was a very impressionable 18-year-old at that time and my taste for films has become a bit more conservative ever since. <br /> <br /> So somehow, I forgot about this movie until I saw the DVD in my local department store and reminding myself how great it was, I thought, "Okay, I'll tear you off the shelf when you bring it Special edition". <br /> Last week, I was very happy when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would love this movie even more at the second screening ... How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Verdict: After 11 years my vision of this movie had changed from a very frightening first class movie to the total garbage that exaggerates on the religious and supernatural side of things superficially. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts's acting (with the exception of Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar) I think the problem with this movie is definitely the director and a script so mediocre. I left this movie feeling that it had no real substance or potential, and just some scary and cheap thrills that were not very well done. Not even the score of James-Newtown Howard, which I prefer as a film composer, could captivate and excite me. <br /> <br /> In 1990, I would have given this film 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would be lucky to give 2/10 at best. <br /> <br />
