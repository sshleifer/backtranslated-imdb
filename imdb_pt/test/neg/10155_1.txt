The kid, this was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this on video. <br /> <br /> In scenes that had music of soundtrack, it was difficult to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was difficult to hear the person on the other side. Apparently, at least two different types of film or video were used, because colors and focus sometimes changed dramatically between issues. And there were many out-of-focus shots that did not seem intentional. <br /> <br /> An indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a report comes on TV. There is only a title card "news flash" barely superimposed with a video effect on a TV screen and a narration by a presenter. They could not film a presenter and then show it on TV. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murderer wearing a surgical gown and mask, holding a scalpel. Supposedly, he is a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to prevent a lobotomy from being performed. <br /> <br /> Students are released from school for a break, and three young people decide to have a pajama party. Three guys decide to beat the party, and a nerd named Science also decides to collide with her. The pajama party is pretty boring, and guys keep popping up randomly in masks, taking off their masks and then disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who would do the lobotomy) of one of the girls continue to appear as well. The killer hits people's throats without anyone noticing. The film's apparent leadership more or less sleepwalking through the film. Maybe it was bad, or maybe it was intentional, since much of the film is a nightmare, and part of it is a nightmare in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The ending is horrible, too. The best thing about the film is the raw art of United Home Video VHS, which was revived for the release of the DVD (a feature film with Tenkiller Terror). I honestly can not tell if it's a photo, a painting or a combination of both. The women portrayed on the cover are not in the movie, and the clothes they're wearing are far more revealing than anything the women in the movie wore. The throat cutting the hood is more frightening than those in the movie - where people tend to affect a silly look with bulging eyes. In fact, that's what the killer has most of the time: head bent and eyes bulging, attacking the camera. Often, the scalpel was kept close to the camera in focus, while the face covered by the assassin's mask was in close-up, but out of focus in the background.
