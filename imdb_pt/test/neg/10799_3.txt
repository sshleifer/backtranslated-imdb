First, I read the director's comments later and would like to thank him for offering his opinion. I've always wondered what the creators of the films criticized in MST3K about their work being shredded (not to mention how Best Brains got the rights). Rissi's comments make me curious about how much science fiction could have cut the film to look different (now I'm thinking of renting it from NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen the non-MST3K version of this movie, but even having seen it in MST3K, I never thought of it as a bad movie or something unattainable (although I thought it was a very funny episode of MST3K)); certainly not, as Pearl describes it, "peel the skin horribly"; not after seeing the likes of "Future War" and "Hobgoblins". <br /> <br /> As for the cut of the film, it has been done before in MST3K, at least once. Case in point: Joe Don Baker's movie, Mitchell, in which the subplot involving the character of John Saxon is cut in the MST3K version, yet Joel and the Bots comment on the absence of Saxon after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I can criticize the MST3K, if you need to cut the film for the sake of time, fine, but it's only fair that the movie is cut (even if it's a movie as bad as Mitchell). Of course, such criticism is somewhat useless, with the show ending, but I think that aspect of the program was kind of unfair. But anyway, if it's the case with Soultaker, it makes me sympathize. <br /> <br /> Still, I maintain that it is a nice episode of MST3K, although the movie itself, even the version that was "hacked" in MST3K, is not close to being terrible. <br /> <br /> As a final note, in a strange coincidence or perhaps a Synchronicity case, I happened to watch The Hudsucker Proxy the day Soultaker aired and you did not know, the guy who played the father of Vivian Schelling had a bit of a part in this film; one of his three other credited roles, in fact. I thought it was kind of weird.
