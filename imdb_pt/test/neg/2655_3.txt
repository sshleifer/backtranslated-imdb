Being a fan of Harrison Ford, I'm probably being kind. It was predictable, sentimental ... my husband made a lot of gagging sounds while we were watching. What a disappointing movie. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) really gave this 4 star a 4 star !!! Hard to believe the reviewer saw the same movie we did.
