When this show first came to Disney, I love it started watching it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney shows, but this show has somehow turned into something that is disturbing and disappointing. <br /> <br /> I now think of any of the second and third season amusements they seem to watch from some teen shows. I call this junk. The first season was very unique because it showed Sadie, who loved science, animals and creatures. The first season was a lot of fun. I mostly do not like the second season because of Ben. He pisses me off and pisses me off. The plot in the second season is also a drug and it's horrible
