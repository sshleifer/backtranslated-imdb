Maybe here in Sydney we are all with the poop aside and as a result, we have to enjoy floats like this e-eek! -Une in first-class theaters. Launched here in 1980, this hilarious tar drama was greeted with howls of joy in the session I attended. In fact, the audience was so engrossed with the ridiculous antics on the screen that it played like a Rocky Horror session. Within 5 minutes, we all knew it was a real disaster: the tugboat scene where you can see the water buckets thrown from the set-off. after that, he was every patron to himself and the cinema played with advice, applauding for bad actions and reactions of oo-waah. Shooting in the basement between the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken spectators with friends in altered states to also pay attention to contribute appropriately. I call those films with Michael Caine from vacation home movies, as I always think he agrees to do them because he saw a house he likes and does not want to spend his savings. Like Jaws 3 or 4 or what was called.
