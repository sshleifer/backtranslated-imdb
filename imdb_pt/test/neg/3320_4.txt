'' Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie I've ever seen. The only thing I like about this movie is the soundtrack, anything else besides (since I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X) There are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that I do not even know how to start. So many stories were cut, like the twin legend (one of my favorites), the relationship of Armand and Daniel and even Louis is not present, to mention a few (The plot was dead) First, they should have made a movie of The Vampire Lestat, 'because it's the second book after' 'The Vampire Interview,' 'not Queen of Damned. They have tried to squeeze so much information into one single movie that you get almost nothing unless you read the vampire chronicles. <br /> <br /> So many significant characters do not seem to have real importance in this film. . This is the case of Pandora, for example. <br /> <br /> The actors they choose to play all the characters do not match many of Anne Rice's descriptions, especially Marius, who is supposed to be a handsome, tall, imposing, blue-eyed blond face like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from being like Lestat) I did not understand why they changed the creator of Lestat to be Marius instead of Magnus as well. <br /> <br /> "Interview with the Vampire" was an incredible movie I loved the actors and Tom Cruise as Lestat was PERFECT and far superior to Stuart Townsend (I'm sad that Tom Cruise has refused the chance to play Lestat again) Only Antonio Bandeiras like Armand did not match the look of Armand, but anyway, far superior to this shit movie called '' The Queen of Damned ''. Anne Rice was so picky about Interview that I did not understand how she just sold the rights to this terrible production.
