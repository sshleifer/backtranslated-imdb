STAR RANK: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh * Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal - is not such a bad actor as Kevin Costner, but ....... aaaaahhhh, you understand) It's a modern day Robin Hood (listen closely, you can hear Brian Adams's music playing in the background ... no, not really), the kind of guy who steals money from illicit blood from traffickers and uses it to keep the orphanages in ruins. But now he has been approached to drive an escape van in a Las Vegas robbery on one of those last things before retirement type jobs. But, of course, everything goes wrong and he ends up with the patsy for the guys at the top and in the chain. Here he meets a guy named (although you do not know to pay attention in the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he befriends and ends up running away from prison. Once he is free, he is ready to prove his innocence, locate the missing money, and naturally match up with those who frame him! <br /> <br /> Of all the recent Seagal movies for the movies, Today You Die has this look is more than anything that belongs to a cinema, even with a rap star as his co-star, as his previous films, Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yeah, it seems like when he's not making movies about caring for the environment, he's pretending to be black and co-starring with rappers. But TYD is not a movie and this is a luxury that The Great One will never be enjoying again until Under Siege 3 materializes (if it exists!) <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a visual smooth and polished that commands attention, but everything quickly descends the hill from there. Once Seagal arrives in prison, the conspiracy quickly loses its coherence. In fact, the character of Treach seems to simply come out of nowhere without any introduction as his partner and from there you quickly lose interest in him. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I've said it before, but I think I'm talking this time. I do not think I'm going to give more of these movies directly to Seagal at any time. I honestly have no enthusiasm for watching Shadow Man. In fact, I can honestly say that I have not really enjoyed any of his STV movies up to this point, and Today You Die is certainly not an exception, an apathetic and boring effort at all the moments, best avoided by all. *
