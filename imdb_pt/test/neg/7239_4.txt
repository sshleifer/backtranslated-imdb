During the summer, the signpost line for this attraction is really long as it is a water walk. It's very well-themed, but many of the artifacts on the ride seem to be out of order. Overall, the tour is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hours. on the line. The fall at the end is exciting, but the whole race could have been better. Indiana Jones creators could have prob. helped these Hollywood designers. In addition, the ride often breaks and causes even longer waiting periods for others. It's also very unpleasant when they only have an open raft departure dock and not the two, as they should. During Halloween Horror Nights, you walk in the dark, and it's exciting if it's the first time, but if it is not, do not bother to wait in a four-hour queue.
