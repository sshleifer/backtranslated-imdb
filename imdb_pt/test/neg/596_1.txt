The Evil Behind You, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to push the personal views of the writer / director on who wants to walk on water or who can dance with the devil. Unfortunately, it seems the creators were so focused on claiming that they completely took power by force, feeding their point to the viewer. The way your message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I heard about the Spanish Inquisition. ! From one true Christian to another, avoid this like the plague, fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message !! <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair (they are terrorists, so they must be Muslims). The premise was good, the story provided a great channel for his message, however, it was the execution of those ideas that fell short, making it very difficult to separate the message from the messenger, so to speak. <br /> <br /> You'd better dust off your old "Ghost" DVD with Mr. Swayze to get this message better. at least that movie did not try to squeeze into his throat. Or if you like Good Christian movies with a powerful message, try "End of the Spear"
