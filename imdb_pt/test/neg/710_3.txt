Oh, why did it have to end like this? The last Laurel and Hardy film, from the cruelly eccentric cuckoo theme (with wrong credit for Hal Roach) to the closing "Nice mess", this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. In the meantime, their relationship is now constructed only of uncertain acting, asymmetrical dialogue, and bland clownishness. People shouted for King of New York, but the Chaplin final did not come anywhere near as unworthy as that. <br /> <br /> What really hurts someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The video cover I'm holding shows them at their peak, all boyish smiles and shiny skin, with a synopsis on the back that says "The photo on this cover is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the movie. "Necessarily? It does not even come close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photos that adorn the sleeve, with Ollie distressingly overweight. This is not humorous, or comically, fat, as it usually appears, but with a bad look and the edge of obesity. He would be dead seven years after this movie was made, after a series of spills. Stan, meanwhile, suffering from a prostate problem and dysentery, looks macabre as his weight dropped dramatically. Every time something bad happens to him, like being squeezed between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for his life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you afraid he can be killed. It would last another fifteen years after the completion of this film, eventually going from a heart attack in 1965. It is disturbing to think of artists so dear that they grow old and die painfully. And it is distressing to watch its deterioration, both in health and performance, on the screen. When I, and I'm sure, almost everyone likes to think of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing them with health problems and performing terrible routines at the end of their careers is a plague on my happy memories of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs are clear from the opening credits, which lists not only four writers, but also someone to propose the concept, and a credit for gags. So if Monty Collins was writing the "jokes," what were the other four writings? And in that case, why did Monty Collins pay a fee, since there is no evidence of a single "gag" throughout the film? Over 40% of the film is spent traveling to the island of the same name, during which we experienced some of the most painfully bland scenes that the boys were involved with. When I saw the bat scene I wanted to curl up and die, it was such a childish ineptitude. However, what kills the death of the film is that the whole cast of support is nicknamed, unable to speak English. This not only makes the film disjointed but also severely depletes Stan and Ollie's reactions to their co-stars. Directly directed with shocking movie stock and absolutely outrageous editing, this totally belies the $ 2 million rumors that were spent on it. Frankly, it looks terrible, and although a DVD release can clean the image, the sound quality and the image is far inferior to any Hal Roach's work. The "friends" of Stan and Ollie, Giovani and Antoine are charismatic prayers that stand out strongly against the outdated repertoire of Laurel and Hardy. This is another major problem of the film, since none of the supporting characters is funny or inserted in the innocent mentality of the boys. The dubbed hardness shown to L & H ("you - the fat one") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than amiable sub - anarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire - although this is not a duck soup - and the concept of an island without rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant now than ever, a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes more topical in 2003. Unfortunately, though, aside from a fun scene in which Stan is elected "the people," this it does not happen. really go anywhere. And this somewhat black humor has its rough edges - or is it a Laurel and Hardy movie in which the rape is directly implicated and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, only to accidentally hit someone in the face, his idea of ​​a good time? After all the years Stan and Ollie shared the bed, we also get a definite reference, with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie wipes the kiss with disgust. Also troubling is the implication that Stan's illegal immigrant friend and Ollie, Antoine, ends his life by being eaten by a lion. Remember, I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they should be hanged as well. The need for intrusive and bland narration is yet another indication of how messy everything is, with the American release (the same version available on video) hacking 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it. <br /> <br /> Almost completely unwatchable, this horribly made, relentlessly bland movie serves only to tarnish Stan's and Ollie's reputation - avoid at all costs.
