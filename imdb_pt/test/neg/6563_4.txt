Star Trek V definitely wins the dubious distinction of being the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the good acting efforts of the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about this movie from the start. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the Enterprise crew taking advantage of their long leave as a makeover to save Earth from the total ecological disaster. His land license is interrupted when a disturbance occurs in Nimbus III, the Intergalactic Peace Planet. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to have their ship hijacked by Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Sybok brainwashes the Enterprise crew and puts her on a suicide mission to meet "God" just after the Great Barrier at the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk must then find a way to regain control of his ship and fend off the Enterprise's pursuers Klignon. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is acting and direction. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest of the cast performed well. William Shatner also does a good job directing this movie. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffered from a widespread lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, Sybok's part was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he declined. Then Laurence Luckinbill got the part. Second, many of the special effects were severely cut ... reducing the entertainment potential of the films. Third, the scene depicting the arrival on the Great Barrier left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this movie did not make much sense ... considering that no novel like this has ever occurred before this point in the Star Trek universe and it has never been explained how such a novel could suddenly materialize between Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very weak film. You should probably just skip this movie and move on to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew made Star Trek VI partly to save themselves after their disaster with Star Trek V.
