Correction Synopsis: The final does not show Ben cruise online for the guys. He is looking for Arabic-speaking courses at The Presido Military Acadamy in San Francisco. Maybe join the war in Iraq as a translator, (FYI - many of the dishonorable evictions of "Do not ask, do not say they were Translators (they are now a great supply) Ben also spoke Russian. Manhatten, but a bit of no reality here. Quite a good laugh at social skills Lame and sad portrait of "Grown up" twenty-somethings not developing beyond the college party mode. Also a brief study of the ever changing the scene in Manhatten (somehow, it's always near the edge of the same BS) Watch the movies together "English in New York" and "The New Twenty" Both good for Nostalgia. that the movie "Twenty" shows how far the blur between gay and straight has evolved. These two films are GAY Time Travel For Sure !!!! ENJOY
