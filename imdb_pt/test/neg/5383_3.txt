I like movies of various types and qualities. Whether it's your typical Hollywood action movie or your Oscar-winning shooting film, movies that meet a certain standard will almost always be pleasing to me. <br /> <br /> In Soap Girl, I received nothing but confusion. First, we met Maya, a massage worker who seems to appeal to all guests in the living room. A virgin poet named Harry arrives in one day and they fall in love. After that, there are several twists in the plot that seem to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> Although many have commented on the controversial issue of an Asian prostitute being exploited by the white man, keep in mind that This movie was made by an Asian director who wanted to bring light to the issue. But whether or not it succeeds, it does not matter, because the problem is whether the film is enjoyable or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl can not achieve the standard I expect from the movies. It was difficult for me to get emotionally involved with this film, given the loose plot and the mediocre acting. Worse, it seems the director wanted to make a drama, when the tone falls more into the comedy. <br /> <br /> A film like Soap Girl that does not hold me to the magic of the cinema always makes me bored. Throughout the film, I could not help thinking, "What is it really?" A movie has to answer that question before it's done. If not, what you will end up is an empty effort to captivate the audience. <br /> <br /> Note: D + <br /> <br />
