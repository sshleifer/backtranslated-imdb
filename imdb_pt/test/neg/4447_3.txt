Seriously, everything that Satan comes to Earth always involves Catholics. Why does Lucifer never mess with other denominations? <br /> <br /> The plot is that Asmodeus (played by ex-Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plan to become human (but he was not always a demon) by getting this young girl who is his pregnant sister to his son . Except, maybe, she's not your sister. The plot is not clear about this, and they inter-splice these scenes where he is seeing a psychiatrist about his problem. The main girl gets pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly scary scene from her father gave her a gynecological examination to prove that her hymen is still intact ... Eeeewwwwww. His sister (played by a washed up and looking much worse to wear Denise Crosby) concludes that this is a sign of heaven. Praise Be! <br /> <br /> Well, the devil baby takes her mother's body for a ride of joy and picks up, in order, a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all being watched over by a former priest military whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born. We find that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal who is commanding the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The ending is almost incomprehensible, and if you manage to go that far, you have a stronger stomach than I do. (I stopped the movie a few times, it was horrible.)
