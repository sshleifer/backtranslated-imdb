I think the company that made this movie wanted people to think about Conan's films, but unfortunately for those who made this film, it does just that. You'll be thinking, man, Conan movies were pretty cool ... this one is totally boring and bad. The story, who cares? It will not help you like this movie any more, because it looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, does not look like he belongs to this, because he agreed to play the role is beyond me. Well, probably for the money. I simply love the monster in the water that ends up being a machine. Lame! This movie is simply simple and terrible.
