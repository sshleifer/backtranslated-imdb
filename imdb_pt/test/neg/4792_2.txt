Another horrible Hollywood movie. This time a woman helps the revolution in a Central American country. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, let's make a movie with no sense of realism. I'm so tired of movies like this. The actors and actresses are awful, the effects are cheesy and the dialogue horrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the president of evil. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he's very proud of that. Well, I should not have expected much of this movie and did not expect it. And I'm happy because that sucks. I wonder what kind of people like this movie. My guess is younger people between the ages of 12 and 16. And I think some people like it because of Kristin Dattilo. Well, I'm not in any of these groups and I hate it. Reputation: 0
