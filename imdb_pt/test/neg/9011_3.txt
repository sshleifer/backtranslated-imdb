This film has a pretty decent premise - one that appears again in science fiction films, most spectacularly in "Alien" - and some decent man-man performances of the male cast. The possessed astronaut's wife, to me, is the weak link in the set - she does not seem to know what to do with her face in many of her most prominent scenes, for which I blame Principal Corman. Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen game, "Blood Beast" may have been pretty decent. But the low cost inherent in production design and continuity errors and gaffes hamper the process. For example, every time I saw the comatose astronaut lying on a "examination table" the width of a ironing board, I started to laugh, it was probably not the emotion that the staff wanted to invoke. And the monster's suit needed serious work; Parrots covered in ferns are simply not scary or convincing. Even so, the premise was strong enough for me to hold on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve, and the motives of the aliens were ambiguous enough. At first, I could think of it as an enigma. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a little impact, along with the development of the plot, where the alien claimed to have assimilated a bit of the dead man's personality. <br /> <br /> It's Corman. It's cheap, fast and moderately acceptable if you do not think too much or expect too much. What else needs to be said?
