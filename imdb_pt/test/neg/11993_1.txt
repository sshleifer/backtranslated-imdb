I was a "chosen" to see this movie in a preview. <br /> <br /> First you should know that this movie is based on the videogame "far cry", a really good game (2004). second, you must know that the conductor of this film is the great uwe goat. this is a man who makes videogames (siege of dungeons, bloodrayne, postcards, etc.) and makes films of them (VERY horrible ...). <br /> <br /> I still remember when I saw Boll's "the swords of the king: a siege-tail of the dungeon." There were such horrible mistakes in this movie (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 in the day, and somehow at night .....) <br /> <br /> So let's go "far away" If you expect a cool story, forget about it, guiding you through the not-so-bad story of the game, this movie is a laugh. the funny movie in a few moments, but in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to see this movie for free, so do not make the mistake and pay for this garbage.is one of my movies favorites to the 100 fund. !!!!
