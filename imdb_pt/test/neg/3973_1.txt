Parties: The Clonus Horror is a horror, alright. There are, of course, the bad fashions of the late 70's. There is very poor acting from Dick Sargent to Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. His days consist mainly of running, jumping, cycling and fighting with each other. When they are not doing this, they learn about America. Not the band America, or the music of Neil Diamond, but an America where they will become part of a larger society. But they get some weird drugs so they have all their body fluids drained (General Ripper was right!) And they are put in the freezer and await Thanksgiving or Christmas when they will be thawed and roasted at about 450 degrees . Oops, that's not what happens, but it would have been much more interesting than the one shown. Mario, of the fame of Super Mario Brothers, makes a delicious appearance like a doctor who fights with Dick Sargent.
