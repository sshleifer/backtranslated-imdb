But I still enjoyed watching it, so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. Its expressions are invaluable. Some of the other cast members (eg Michael McKean) are also very popular. The cat itself is a bit of fun. In addition, the film is all clich√©, culminating in a very long chase. (It is also at this point that the film becomes unnecessarily gross, having been very "familiar" by then.)
