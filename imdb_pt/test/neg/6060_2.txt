I thought there might be some level of value for this movie, and sat down with the whole thing. I can sum it up by saying that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The film started well, I think the initial characterization of Herc was true to the myths. As much as a child and a young adult, it started very strong, but not the brightest lamp. But later he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker loved by all. There is? <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI. The satyr looked fine, but the rest of the animals looked terrible, especially the deer, the most fertile beast in the movie. And how was Leelee Sobieski's skin sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone should shrink at it - were the twelve works of Hercules. Because producers obviously did not want to cover all of them; maybe they thought primitive bolt heads watching that garbage could not count that high. Instead of the TWELVE works of Hercules, we received the five works of Hercules. Yes, the five jobs! WTF?!? He did not even finish the last, so it was actually 4 1/2 work! Just terrible. I'll take Hercules: the legendary journeys on this piece of crap any day of the week.
