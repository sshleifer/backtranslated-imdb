Umberto Lenzi reaches new lows with this recycled garbage. Janet Agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of a Jim Jones-type religious cult in New Guinea. She hires a dirty guide played by Robert Kerman to help her get to the jungle worship complex. This is another (!) Cannibal movie, and I probably would have liked it were it not for Lenzi extending this movie with scenes from his superior "The Man from Deep River". I mean, every cannibal scene is taken directly from that movie, which I think makes it as credible as Al Adamson. I felt stolen. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 star and this is for the vibrator scene.
