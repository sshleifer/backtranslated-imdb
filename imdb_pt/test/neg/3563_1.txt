Conclusion: very, very, very annoying, but I watched until the end, waiting for some inverted effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. The old black & white game did not help at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but that was not the case. The script, the plot, etc., were linear, had no substance, nothing was in progress. When you deal with the psychological, you deal with analysis, therefore, in detail, with the formula of diversity of unity ... there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the tools and creativity of filmmakers ... well, that's not the only one.
