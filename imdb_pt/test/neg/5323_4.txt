Only once, I would like to see Koontz's work given to a decent writer, director and producer! ONLY ONCE! <br /> <br /> This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but all the rest is pure unadulterated junk. The screenwriter must be shot for channeling Koontz's work this way and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> The story is a well written story, but the script is pretty boring, unbelievable and terribly executed. The only elements that work are the performances of LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I really wanted this to work. I love Koontz's novels, but they never gave them the attention, the support and the talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's job that they would play with the barrels at King's, Koontz would come up quickly. But alas! Without powerful people who believe in your work, I fear he will never have the chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this film was a total success. As an independent film, it was not so bad, although extremely weak in many places with huge holes and terrible dialogue, hard and unprofessional that should never have come to the final cut. This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. If they had followed Koontz's original work a little more closely, and invested a reasonable amount of production money, this could have been a much better effort. <br /> <br /> However, all I can see in this is how good it could have been, and it was not. <br /> <br /> He ranks a 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> the Demon :.
