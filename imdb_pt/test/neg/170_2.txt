There were so many classic movies that were made where the leaders were liars, yet they were meant to look good. I never bought these things. The "crazy comedies" were full of those things, as were many Fred Astaire films. <br /> <br /> Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous country writer who has lied to the public for years. and feels that he has to keep lying to keep his persona (and his job). She even minds one guy about getting married, another topic that has always been trivialized in classic movies. <br /> <br /> She is a New York woman who pretends to be a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track of it. I think all this must be funny because the lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. Please pass the bargain bag. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie is not funny. Stanwyck was much better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, pass the bag over again.
