This film has the language, style and attitude ... plus great attractions from Occy (a world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin, like Turtle, has downsized surfing, and surfing scenes are still the best of all time. A true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a baby, and Laird Hamilton shows the first things that made him the world's number one extreme surfer.
