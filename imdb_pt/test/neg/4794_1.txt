This movie is as bad as it sounds. If you like logic (or lack thereof) at the National Treasury and bad acting too, then it could be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, spend your time in the sun and your money in a beer. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks like a promo or demo image produced to promote the people involved (ie actors, special effects and so on). Accidentally, they produce a very bad exposure of their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In a case such as this, the film company must be ordered to return the money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's too bad.
