I was not so impressed with this movie, finding it quite tiring and simple. The plot was interesting, a child setting up his own college and enrolling hundreds of children, but the laughter was few and far between. The jokes were not very funny and I did not miss anything in any of the scenes. The characters were not intriguing and I did not feel for any of them, not even the fat, clumsy boy with glasses who tried to join the fraternity group. It was a good first watch, but it did not surprise me and is not one I would recommend. Comparing it with other movies of the same genre, ie American Pie is simply cruel, because there is a movie that was laughter-to-plenty. This ACCEPT failed to lift a smile!
