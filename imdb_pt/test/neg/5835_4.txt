I challenge you to watch this movie and deny the above statement. That is if you can stop looking at the virtually flawless face. It also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting, but not as much as I was expecting. The film is extremely slow and low budget, although at least they try to find an excuse for the spacecraft to be so overpopulated; almost the entire crew is in "suspended animation", and the ship moves on autopilot! And the heroine does not rescue any of them, nor bring anything useful to "house"; it seems that cheating that wicked lady to travel through space was the only part of her mission that could not be more easily accomplished by the missiles that explode the ship in the end. There are also some soft but long soft-core scenes, and a couple of "Alien" monsters that kill about 2 people. * 1/2 of 4.
