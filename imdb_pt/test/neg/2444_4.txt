A silly Disney movie about a college student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. Not a bad idea and some of the special effects are very good. Still, the script is VERY bad ... all the jokes fail and the acting sucks. Everyone is trying to be funny and they are not. A boring and stupid Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
