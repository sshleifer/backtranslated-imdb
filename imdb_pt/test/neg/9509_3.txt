I admit that the only reason I watched this movie - since it's been a decade since it was released - was because of Ian Holm; I was intrigued to see his interpretation of my second favorite character in this play. Anyway, this movie is as brave as anything that Old Zeff has produced since "Jesus of Nazareth." But some of the best parts of the piece were left out. I understand the direction / editing choices, but I do not think this really does justice to the game. Maybe I'm too purist. I would have to direct people (who read this far) to Branagh's version, were it not for me to disregard their tendency for over-dramatization. Even so, he plays better Hamlet than Gibson. But then, were not we all waiting for Gibson to show himself an actor? Now all he did was prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages. Perhaps the only performance worthy of Shakespeare here is Scofield as The Phantom.
