I wanted to love this movie so much ... I really liked it. But it was a horrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read the Jennifer Egan novel in 1996 and was fascinated by the story. In fact, it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Remember, the book took much more depth than this movie, in plot and emotional resonance. Did you care about the characters. He painted a full picture of Phoebe, unlike the extremely poor characterization of the young woman in the film. <br /> <br /> Although beautiful and showing * some * promises in her flourishing career, Jordana Brewster was as flat and empty this performance as was the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just a terrible choice for Wolf's role, both physically and logistically. What a strange-looking couple. Wolf should have been more of a dark and physically attractive character, as if he were in the book. What's more, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz, however, deserves the highest praise for his performance. She took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life, a true spirit. She is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie. It is very bad that his talent has been wasted in this film that can be forgotten. <br /> <br /> In the book-to-film category, this is a terrible translation, almost as bad as Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner. But do not tell me about it ... <br /> <br /> I'm not that hard on my criticism, but I was so disappointed here because I really cared about the story and wanted to see it told. right. Did not deliver ... <br /> <br />
