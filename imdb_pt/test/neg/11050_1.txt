This movie was horrible, clear and simple. He will probably be revered by those who see only "movies" and not "movies," and therefore will feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I am sure enough in my intellect to say that this film boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully exhausted was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I was fooled into seeing this for the unexplained good reviews I received and came out of the movie. the theatrical thought that these reviews had to have been written by super-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who avoid regular films, perhaps out of fear that they might actually enjoy one day. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knowing his captor nor his crime. He is then abruptly released and given only five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke, when Oh Dae-Su runs around beating people, trying to have sex with a young woman who is trying to use the bathroom and eat a live and twisted squid (presumably by effect dramatic as there is absolutely no other reason for this). All the time he's trying to figure out this horrible thing he's done to earn fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds out it's ridiculous and a big disappointment. His nemesis, a man who was supposed to study with him when he was young, looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know the arrest has been difficult for Oh Dae-Su, but is asking too much to find an actor who seems a little closer to his age? Of all the wrong things with this movie, this seems to be the easiest to fix. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that kept me in my place for 90 minutes when I could be doing something productive - is a joke of a plot involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Let's go! Give us a bone here - was it really the best they could do? I sat through idiotic dialogues, exaggerations, dark scenarios, and gratuitous violence for that? (By the way - I'm not at all against violence in a movie, if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems that I was forced to see our hero knock someone's front teeth and cut their own tongue with a A pair of scissors to distract me from discovering that I was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of junk. <br /> <br /> Accept my advice - do something else with your time and money. go see a humble "movie" - which you may really like.
