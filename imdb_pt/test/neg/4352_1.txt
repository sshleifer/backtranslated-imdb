This is the slowest "film noir" movie I've ever seen. A very weak script only provides an opportunity for Jack Palance and Rod Steiger to deliver exceptionally well, lines that were made for a performance audition. Palance and Steiger claim that they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power, emotion and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, especially in a living room. The director, of course, moved the actors around in rhythmic circles as they presented lengthy lines to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience. The action does not catch until the last ten minutes of the film. If you are someone who is looking for more depth in a criminal drama, this is not for you!
