If you like watching movies because they are beautiful, you should be fine with this. If you enjoy watching movies that start with a cool guy trying to catch an evil guy, then reveal clues about the motives of each over the course of the movie, skip it. By the end of the movie I still did not know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you assemble a serial killer so ritualistic, it would be good to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a pretty similar movie with a serial killer that was not the best either, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls were explained. They also suggested a dark background for Vaughn's character, but they did not explain, they did not really say why Lopez's child psychologist was much more suited to this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, did not give much explanation to the problem of child, etc. If the rest of the story is convincing, I do not mind details like the way Stargher offered all the sophisticated electronics and underground chambers or why the FBI was not checking to see if he had anything. another property or had access to places out of the way while they were waiting to see if the whole coming into the killer's mind thing would work, but I'd like to get a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills such a complex way.
