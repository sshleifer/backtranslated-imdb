I knew Brad Linaweaver on Florida State U in the early 1970's when he was an inspirational and inventive writer that I thought was going to bring greater glory. <br /> <br /> And that's why I rented this video. Well, well, the weather was not kind to Mr. Linaweaver. I suppose that the pressures of earning a living make higher aspirations expendable. Another flower whose flower arrived and went unnoticed in the summer breeze. A man. There is nothing more to say. And nothing else to add. A sad epitaph for a career that once flourished, as stated above. But it is the price you pay for pursuing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for yourself in life. Because this film has no purpose, no purpose, and I kept telling myself, what happened to Brad's creativity, his brilliant genius? Gone, gone, years of neglect has deteriorated his once brilliant mind.
