I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there really would be something of comic value in it. I'm not black, but that does not mean I can not enjoy the black comedy. I know this because I like watching the Wayans Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I've seen bad movies and I'm not easily repelled. As for Soul Plane, I did not even bother to finish it. I do not know if they could land the plane and I could not care less. It would be unfair to say that I did not find some funny parts when I laugh, but I also laugh at YouTube videos of skaters falling in the bag, so that does not say much. The men in the movie were like a bunch of horny hyenas hooting in the mating season looking for "catch some" whenever and wherever possible. And we wonder why all these stereotypes do not seem to disappear. To summarize: Soul Plane makes Harold and Kumar series look like The Godfather.
