I saw this movie partly because of some positive comments here on IMDb. After wishing to have those 90 minutes of my life back, I feel it is my duty to come here and say ... Please do not bother watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I can not argue with the efforts of the actors - they did what they could, given the material, but that stuff is terrible. The pace was deadly - slow, winding, and you saw everything an hour away, and then it took forever to happen. The dialogue was boring, meaningless, not funny. The characters were all completely unfriendly. And the cinematography was, in my opinion, very low quality - the cliche of "character uses home video machine!" was used for a very bad effect. <br /> <br /> Yes, Jeri Ryan is a nice person. Do not let it fool you into wasting your time on this movie.
