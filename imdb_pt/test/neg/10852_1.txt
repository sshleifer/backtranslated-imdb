Hi! I am Sheena, an African white tribal princess (still white!) Who has the incredible ability to become the world's cheapest and tasteless monster (think of the 60's Star Trek aliens) seductively rolling in the mud! When I found myself in this awful position, I took the only logical action: I made a bikini torn in the jungle to perform my mischief misinterpreted. I like novels and occasionally wreck the lord of the African war. And I would be remiss if I did not mention my partner (white, of course) Mr. Cutter, a former US military man who seems to have fled the United States after his divorce. Can you say "dodge alimony"? Either way, it provides the occasional distraction of my difficult life. I mean, how many foolish blondes do you know that they're also a threatened species of monster that cuts through the flesh? Despite my many difficulties (acting is so hard!), I did not give up, and after much research, I finally discovered my role in life: terrifying insomnia viewers who are so unhappy. like no cable or satellite.
