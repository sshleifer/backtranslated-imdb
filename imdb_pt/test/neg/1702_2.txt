I had high hopes for this production, being one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> In fact, a lot of this is reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but does not have the fiendish that the original character is Infused with. Many of the smaller characters do well, and the Scottish settings are excellent. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me is Jason Connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines from a card with the wrong one. glasses - certainly for the first time too. He can do much better. Any production compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979) which, in my view, gave the standard gold performance, will strive to be appreciated, but I actually fell asleep and had to rewind this before I could get through it - hardly a great sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, one to avoid.
