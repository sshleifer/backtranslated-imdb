How bad can you make a movie? A good question that House of the Dead 2 manages to answer. I could not believe it was possible to achieve something worse than the first House of the Dead, but surprisingly the director succeeded. The only feeling you get from the movie is that it's bad, just bad. What with overacting, bad FX and a stupid story. It's this kind of movie that gives a bad name for Z-Movies in general. Why did not they learn the lesson from the first House of the Dead movie? Anyway, I think you should have understood by now that you should not see this movie. It's just a waste of time. Watch "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see some good zombies.
