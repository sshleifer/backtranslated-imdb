If you like me, you like the first movie "Bruce Almighty", my advice to you is not to raise your hopes; in fact, disregard any hope you have for this movie if you are over 12 years of age and have some sense of film. <br /> <br /> Without much attention, the story shows Evan (Bruce's anchor rival of the first film) move home with his family to the suburbs of Virginia to "Change the World" with a new political path. What follows is a somewhat exaggerated and rather "silly" plot, which is obviously targeted at small children as the main target audience. Unlike its predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with the ambiguous genre of 'comedy' marked by its misleading 'sequel' stance, which some consider a modern comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature court hearing. Generally, Evan Almighty understands terrible film values. The acting; omitting Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman, was rigid and many of the characters were apparently used to spend the unnecessarily large budget issued for production. In addition, the cast includes the acting legend John Goodman, who makes an appearance as a leap and is seen only a few times throughout the film; I still have not bought the character and thought that the plot from which he was involved had no depth even for a familiar comedy. All the other characters in the film (especially the wife and children!) Deserve a mention for their extravagant performance that could fill a kiev king-size. Be warned though; is the typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many family-oriented films, so I advise you to defend yourself with the grater closer to the view. <br /> <br /> It may seem that the film is useless so far, however, has some promising aspects. The CGI was excellent and it became clear that a long time was to model the Ark and produce water effects and animation of the computer generated animals at the end. The particles, plasters and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although part of me could not help but I think this was not worthy of a movie with these poor ideals and in my opinion was "too good" for this movie and broadcast the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Overall I see this movie as a disaster in terms of continuing what was a franchise with enormous potential, but unfortunately did not come to a bad conclusion in the Almighty series and approaching the end of the film I had set my expectations high for an epic and final somehow meaningfully to make up for the mediocre content I had witnessed so far. This was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused by the final credits. While I sat in discontent, I could not help but feel that the film was not nearly as "powerful" as I expected. In many ways, the film reminded me of a "Night at the Museum," which showed similar style and features, but unfortunately it was below that. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10, as it's watchable, but it's definitely one to be avoided! If you have to see this movie, be prepared for the disappointment as 'moderately entertained' is the best you could expect to watch the production said.
