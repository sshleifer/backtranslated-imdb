again this type of digital video camera junk with zero budget. and again I fell into this trap because the title had "zombie" (German title: ZOMBIE ATTACK!) the story: day by day some people visit the "museum of the dead" is a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill people, all connected to some Aztec cult. so they fight some zombies in there <br /> <br /> ultra cheap scenario: some runners with black ribbon on it. some dilettante drawings and some skulls as you can find them in all the fun shops. there are no actors, only low-quality models out there with absolutely no idea what to do. no effects. laughable makeup, your local zombie-make-up fan will do better, at some point it seemed that they did not have enough money for enough color, otherwise they just could not do so, dude, they have to realize the look of their "zombies". some laughable martial arts fights with the zombies, in slow motion. only when the director wants to scare you, it uses some standard effect of digital video camera, where everything is flackering. unbelievable! 0 out of 10!
