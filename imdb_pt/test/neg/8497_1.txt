This movie did and crazy. I believe the original of this movie, 'The Mask', was a great movie, worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should do a sequel, but when I saw this, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This movie spoiled the whole idea of ​​'The Mask'. Mask mode? A baby flying in a room? My seven-year-old brother did not even laugh, and he's in those children's movies, but that was worse. A lot of crap !! I'm telling you now, please do not watch this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead you may actually be having fun! Watch 'The Mask', but no, I repeat NO, watch that piece of crap. Thank you.
