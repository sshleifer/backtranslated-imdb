I just got back from seeing "Comedian". It was ... alright. It kept me staring at the screen. Its just not the kind of thing I like to go pay $ 7 to see. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, it would be a great feature of HBO. If this was something I was watching on TV, I'd be hooked. This gives an incredible glimpse into what the comics pass before and after taking the stage. It will interest anyone who likes to see comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to the movies, I like to have fun. I'm not there to be polite. Now I know what it's like for Jerry Seinfeld before he comes out on stage ... fine. But honestly, I'd rather just laugh at your jokes than worry about any of it. <br /> <br /> One more thing: with the bad attitude that Onry Adams has; I'd expect to see him taking my Burger King order before seeing his HBO special. He was not funny. He's the kind of person you love to hate.
