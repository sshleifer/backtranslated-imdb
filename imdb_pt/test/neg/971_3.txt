SPOILERS OF LAND BEFORE THE FRONT !!! <br /> <br /> How such talented actors got involved with such retreads? Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the violence-resistant cop (that is, he beats the bad guys and rolls his eyes to the cops who prefer to keep him) Eddie Murphy plays a not-so-tough cop who prefers to be an actor (ie, he screams, "Freeze, cop!" his "hard look" down pat). Of course, they associate themselves when Bobby's loose cannon tactics take him to hot water with the media and he's basically blackmailed to star in a "Cops" as a reality show . Take a breath, because this is as funny as it gets. <br /> <br /> No energy was put into the script - it seems a pale makeover <br /> <br/> every copy friend movie played in a blender with "15 Minutes" starring, <br /> < Yes, DeNiro himself, pretty much the character he is playing here. <br /> <br /> The jokes fall suddenly, the action seems apathetic, and no one seems to be having fun [...]. He's dead on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time. Even if you have an excessive affinity for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. Becauze if that <br /> <br /> make money, these types of scripts will be appreciated perfectly acceptable <br /> <br /> for actors of your quality. <br /> <br /> And to Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious movies. I remember them - they were good. You were nominated for prizes for them - remember how fun this was? Now, after "Analyze This" (which was good), "Meet the Parents" (which was also good), and "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" it was not good), I think we need to see it parody </ b> <br /> less, and be yourself more. "Casino" seems like a long time ago. And no, I do not count "15 Minutes" as Bobby seriously. Anyone who has taken this media satire seriously should have their weekly news
