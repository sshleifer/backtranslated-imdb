This is an example of why most action movies are the same. Generic and boring, there really is nothing worth watching here. A complete waste of the Ice-T and Ice Cube talents, which were tested shortly thereafter, and who have often proved themselves capable of acting and acting well. Do not bother with this, go see New Jack City, Ricochet or watch New York Undercover for Ice-T, or Boyz on the Hood, Higher Learning or Friday for Ice Cube and see the real deal. Ice-T's horribly clich√©d dialogue makes this movie hit the teeth, and I'm still wondering what the heck Bill Paxton was doing in this movie? And why the hell does he always play the exact same character? From the aliens on, all the movies I've seen with Bill Paxton made him play exactly the same annoying character, and at least in Aliens his character died, which made it a little gratifying ... <br /> <br /> Overall, this is second-rate action junk. There are plenty of better movies to watch, and if you really want to see this movie, watch Judgment Night, which is practically a carbon copy, but has better acting and a better script. The only thing that made it worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible movie itself - but not quite. 4/10
