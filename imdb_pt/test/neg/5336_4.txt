Before "Miracle on 34th Street", Maureen O'Hara and John Payne did this in this movie. I was going to describe it, but I can not find words about how bad this movie ended. The subject of adopting a child and Maureen's disease are very serious and sensitive issues, but in spite of that, it could have been done much better than it was. It was so extreme in its interpretation that it did not seem real. Probably your problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a writer writing a novel and writing a weak movie. (See my review of "A Stranger in My Arms.") The beautiful O'Hara was often overloaded with hiding places like this, the other being the Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews), which I can eventually revisit. <br /> <br /> If you have any emotional connection to it since childhood, you will be kinder to this lifeless, colorless and dull movie. But for something like that, maybe you can find the remake of your TV movie. It has to be better. It has to be.
