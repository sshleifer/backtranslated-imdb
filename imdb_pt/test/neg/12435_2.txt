I've never been a big fan of Larry Clark, but somehow, I've been dragged into almost all of his movies. Now, I like independent films, and I grew up a lot in punk rock, and I would say that this movie is disappointing for both audiences. Not all punk music incorporates "Hi!" in their choirs, as they do in this particular movie. <br /> <br /> But the real problem with this movie is that it changes mood every fifteen minutes or so and it does not have any kind of cohesion. Clark has made a living by pretending that his fictionalized stories are "as children really are," and as such, you will allow him ten-minute scenes of stupid dialogs that are not going anywhere because it is the movie feeling that he is searching. However, when he films a ridiculous death scene (choose any of them except for the drive-by opening), the overly stylized attempts of what I presume to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously filmed (in most cases , much worse than a student film) and absolutely ridiculous in terms of the story. John Cassavettes and "Date Movie" make poor comrades, since the onslaughts in the latest style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - really bad.
