First, I'm a horror fan. But this production of "Tobe Hooper" (come on, the man from the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was below standards even for a fan. The acting was not bad, some characters were unbelievable, but the main ladies were fine. The story was something we've seen hundreds of times without any startling turnaround or anything else. Never exciting or intense, and do not count on any special effect other than blood sneezing. Frightening zombie children are pale white faces with dark eyes and that's it ... This may have worked in the early 70's but not now. Director J.S. Cardone did not do a good job in keeping the suspense, in the middle of the path there is a risk of you falling asleep. My vote is based mainly on the main acting, but this could easily have been called Corn Sons 8: From Cornfields to Mines ... Said Enough ..
