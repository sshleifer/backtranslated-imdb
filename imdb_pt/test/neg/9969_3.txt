Okay, last night, August 18, 2004, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a screening of The Manson Family at Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip-off of all the films of Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam that I have seen. Second, in a brief question-and-answer session, Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he had never made any contact with members of the Manson Family or with Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying that he wanted nothing to do with them , that The film was based on his (Van Bebble) take the judgment having seen all this from his living room on TV and in the news (and I am assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter, which were directly imitated through of the narrative). So I had questions about the questions, asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock n 'roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously irritated the now-squished director who started yelling "f *** you, shut up, that's the truth! All those other movies are bullshit **!" Well, anyway, I did not even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the movie's catchphrase: "Have you ever heard of the side of the laws of history ... now listen to the story as told by the Manson Family. " Excuse me, if this guy never talked to his family and thinks they're liars he does not want to have anything to do with, how in the name of God can he tell the story to them? This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! The film was obviously adapted to sex drugs and rock 'n' roll audiences who had no difficulty attracting the dimly lit little theater, and was even more obviously engendered by the sex drugs and the rock 'n roll mind of a man who could not nor watch his own movie without getting up every ten minutes to get more beer or to shout some kind of link from Rocky Horroresque to the actors on the screen. This film does little more than distort the public's image of actual events (which have helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher / Comic Book / Porno / Rape fantasy created by an obviously superficial. The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained real samples of Charlie's work with the Family off his Lie album. The editing was cool and buzzing to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. In short, this film would have made a much better addition to the Mtv catalogs than to the Underground Film Festival or even to the minds of any intellectual observer. I felt like I was in a Rocky Horror midnight watching the way the public was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was pretty good, except for Charlie who looked like some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions that the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all along did not match the slow, lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie basically explains how Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) states at the end: "You can write a lot of nonsense or do a lot of nonsense movies etc. "Case in point. Even the warning "Based on a true story" is an inoperative statement, signaling that somewhere below that psychedelic pile of junk lies the basis of a real story with content that will make and make a difference in the world. All you need to do is a little alchemy to separate the truth from the crap, or, in fact, maybe you can just avoid it all and read a book. <br /> <br /> All I can say is this, when the movie turned out I got a free beer, so I'm glad I went, but not so happy that I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to Shut up and ask the director a question. Peace.
