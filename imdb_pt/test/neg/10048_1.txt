The English translation of the title of the DVD version of this film is "Graveyard of Horrors", but I think this must be a mistake. It should have been called the "Cemetery of the Horrible." Horrible acting, horrible editing, horrible story and horrible music make it a horrible movie that must be left in a horrible cemetery. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
