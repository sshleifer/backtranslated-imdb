Empty shortening of John Irving's novel strives for depth with courage but ends up being absurd. It is a sequence of quirky sketches, silly and bittersweet, that attempts to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp was born to a formidable single mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (The various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams assumed adulthood.) 'preparatory school where Jenny is the school nurse, through her passions of college, wrestling, writing and sex to marry her school boyfriend, children, marital problems and a writing career. Jenny, meanwhile, became a famous feminist, defending an unorthodox cause. The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and strange adventures. Williams gives a cherub-faced performance. This script was not suitable for his savagery and anarchy, and therefore his talent was wasted. He's like a bruised bird out of control. The role of John Lithgow as father as transsexual, conveying wisdom, also makes no sense. This film was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry in films. Williams recently dropped out of Mork and Mindy and focused more on comedies and movies. The audience was confused by this film, especially for its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
