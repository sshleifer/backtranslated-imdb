I speak ill of G.I.J.:T.M. mainly because I think there was something missing that G.I. Joe had. Yes, there was something that G.I. Joe did not have as celebrity cameos by Don Johnson, and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The movie did not have the passion for the characters that the G.I. Joe TV series had. Most of the voice artists sounded as if they were dead and they would die anytime now. It's a good movie, but I would not say it was the best movie in the world. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built on to say that Serpentor attacking Duke on his chest was not the best way for Charlie Adler's character to leave. Nor was he watching Golobulus remember the Cobra Commander because he was chosen to lead the Cobra forces and then be horribly mutant after he failed to deliver what Cobra-La thought was theirs. <br /> <br /> It was not the best way. for the GI Joe series to come out, but it's better than nothing. :)
