The DVD release of this movie expects you to buy this movie about the name and face of Sandra Bullock. Her picture (years after that movie) is basically the cover art ... and the back cover art ... and the cover art ... the same picture. Its name is highlighted on the cover, all four edges and the disc itself. She is the first name on the list of stars. Your biography is printed inside the case. This movie should revolve around your character, right? WRONG! It's her first movie and she plays a minor role. After watching the movie, each role seems to be a smaller role. The Dog character actually displays some personality. Less than an hour after watching it, I can not even remember the names of many characters. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I watched it several times, I could actually figure out the plot, but I do not think it would be worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait, I just remembered a little funny! Game-shoot-up-up fans will have fun with "Doom-cam". It looks like a first person shooter. Hands and guns pointing at the front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a movie critic, but this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I kept waiting for some silhouettes to cross the screen, sit down and start making fun of him. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that the money we spent on it (used) went to charity.
