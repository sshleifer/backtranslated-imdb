The synopsis of this film led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman defying society's conventions with her. I like strong female characters and expected a movie a lot along the lines of "Chocolat" with less fairy tale and more bite. What I received was a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> For a character-driven film to be effective, I need to feel a connection or compassion for people. There was no one I could relate to in the movie. Grazia (whose work I admired in "Rain Man") portrays a mentally ill woman, probably bipolar, who is often rude, aggressive and violent. Your husband plays and screams when he is not hitting or hitting someone. The children are rude rudes. They scream at each other and the females in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence generates violence. This seems to be an island of people insensitive, aggressive, violent and rude around. <br /> <br /> The direction is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but instead support the viewer. The location is exceptionally beautiful, but even if it is not captured as far as it could be in the movie. <br /> <br /> I would have to recommend that you stay away from this flaw in a movie.
