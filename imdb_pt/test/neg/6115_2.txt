These writers are trying to recreate the characters they have in "scrubs" in a different occupation, however the characters that are stuck have no charisma or acting ability, not to mention that writing looks poor and effortless. These guys are trying to create something that would be nice if the writing was not so disgusting, which would leave the lifeline of the shows just like two cute teachers who can barely keep her alive. The mood in this show seems to be trying to reach an audience with an I.Q. of 40 or below. Another reason why this show is becoming a failure may be that the writing on the program "scrubs" is excellent and this program has to accompany it leaving the viewer in a strange position without knowing if it should cry or just lose hope in new sitcoms all together. This is just my opinion, but I think these guys should stop now, before they humiliate themselves more than they already have.
