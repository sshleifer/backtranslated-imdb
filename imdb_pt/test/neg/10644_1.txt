Hellraiser: Bloodline is just such a movie. I believe it's the fourth installment of the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the start, and all I remember was some topless women and a box-shaped thing on the computer screen. But using my wit and intelligence (and Info button) I soon discovered that the villain (Pinhead) has been released from the Pandora's box, which, I believe, is a direct portal to hell. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Pinhead comes out of the box and terrifies the "Toymaker" family. And that's about it. Oh, and not to mention the random tortures of several people who cross their path. Yawn. <br /> <br /> What mostly happens in this movie is that Pinhead catches the kid, and then releases the dog into his wife, and then kills a random person. Then the husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why not because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too cheesy to be scary. Look at Pinhead's creature servant: a kitschy dog ​​that seems to have been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And a person who is supposed to be a princess of some. order. (I have not seen the previous movies.) Now look at the main villain. His name is Pinhead. Is not that the name you call someone when you're stupid? He has pins on his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he did not have such a tacky name and a tacky address. Somewhere in the movie, two cops approach him and say, "Do not make us put a little pain in you!" Pinhead responds "Pain? How dare you use that word! I AM pain ??" blah blah blah blah blah It seems a little cliché if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the final half of the movie. The characters (and audience) experience more torture when Pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. I do not remember him at the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing repeated over and over again: A guard will inspect a mysterious noise. Some other guard: "Oh no! He's down. I'm going to check him out!" <br /> <br /> After he dies the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's the thing I did not understand. In the movie, Pinhead is reportedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So how does he get back to four more movies? Are they prequels? Why did not he die in the previous ones? Wow. Manufacturers need to think about a different series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is bloody and full of torture scenes, but it has little emotion or fright value. Forget. Bad special effects with bad ones - everything else makes it more festive than good horror. <br /> <br /> Good: Some people can enjoy topless women in the beginning. Also, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I suppose if you like ultra-violence, you might like that too. <br /> <br /> Bad: None of the above makes this movie a very good movie. The rudeness and repetitiveness are very bad. And who names your villain, Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a Private Message about this comment.
