If this movie was made two years earlier, it could have been so much better. But unfortunately, it was done in the decade that I had no idea how a horror movie should look or act. When I first heard about this movie, the people on IMDb were rating it as the sequel to Cheerleader Camp. Oh how wrong they were. Yes, Betsy Russell was in it, but Uma Thurman certainly was not. I'd really like to meet the person who started all this rumor of sequel. I'm sure many of us would leave. I will not give anything because, frankly, I can not remember how this movie ends! I'll just tell you to watch a real-life horror movie ... The Burning, starring Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the Fast Time nerd at Ridgemont High. A word to the wise - Just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title does not mean it's worth watching. Oh, and another thing, any flash flick done in the early 90's was always considered even REMOTE good!
