Put this movie out of its misery and burn the negatives. What am I saying? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, only a few find this movie the least attractive. This is what the vast American majority would call a lot of sex and violence. It will probably show up on some non-premium cable channel someday just for shock value, but after editing nudity (most of the violence will stay) all that will remain will be 45 minutes of really bad acting interspersed with 45 minutes of commercial purposes. There are many hungry actors in Hollywood.
