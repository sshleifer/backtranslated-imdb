I think there's a reason why this movie never came close to getting to theaters. It was probably my neighbors on the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. The acting is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored. The actors seem to double as directors and staff members, without any "professionalism." If the director (s) and / or actors choose to continue with their film making efforts, I would definitely advise them to hone their skills and perhaps do some (okay, many) lessons in filmmaking and acting.
