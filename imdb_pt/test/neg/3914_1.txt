Okay, I realize there's some doubt that Thomas is out there ... I was one of them ... but then I saw that celluloid masterpiece. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that the scene where George Wendt is sucked out of the spaceship by his A ** left me shaking. Sometimes I sit in bed, screaming like an old man on a proctologist's desk, thinking about it. If the director is reading this ... I would pay to be an extra in sequence.
