Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk! Yuk! Disgusting! Puke City! Worst piece of crap ever made. Sick. Weird. Horrible. Enough said. Hold your nose. Do not eat. After seeing this sick, insane trash can from a movie, you will not be able to eat your food for a week. But maybe it's good. A new diet was invented. Go see this vomit-inducing film. Get sick in your stomach. And you'll be so discouraged by the whole mess that you can not eat for at least a week, and you drop about 15 pounds. <br /> <br /> Me Me Lay! With a name like this, it's really amazing she does not have a fan of "worship" to follow. She is the worst actress of all time. His films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. This movie ranks a minus 10.
