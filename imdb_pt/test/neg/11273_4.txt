A bit of Mediterranean machismo for me. The cast was lovely, lovely to watch in all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with blue sky and blue water. It simply was not convincing to me that such an egocentric crude oil was based on nothing but its building could attract so many beautiful and vulnerable women. Just in the Mediterranean, I think. Certainly in no world am I familiar. The sexists were really nasty, and I found it hard to believe that the female characters could have anything to do with them for so long. The script, the cinematography, the direction, etc. was set to deliver a Class B movie whose main effort was to show scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. It was aesthetically good for a while but failed to sustain a very mediocre movie.
