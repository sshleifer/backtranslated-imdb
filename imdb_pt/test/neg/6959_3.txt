Okay, we got JP from Grandma's Boy and Chuck, well, Chuck. I thought this movie would be very good based on the comments, and it started high on my movie scale, but halfway it was dragging on for so long that I lost interest. I really got so bored, probably because you can immediately see what will happen at the end; the story is very simple, I jumped over 15 minutes and did not lose anything! This movie should have been a short work, maybe around 45 minutes to an hour at most. It starts well and ends well, too bad the stuffing is bland, boring, boring, and everything is missing except time. Some people say they like music; I do not care about jazz and I'm not going to see movies for your score, I'm going to the story and when it's taken away ... well, the notes fall on my book. <br /> <br />: Good open fill, great and boring. The story was cool, but if you do not know what's going to happen a quarter of the way, you have not seen many thrillers.
