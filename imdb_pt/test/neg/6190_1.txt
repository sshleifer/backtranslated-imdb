Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience Casbah and the characters in Algiers, I recommend that you not even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko as it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clich√©s and the characters adhere much more the reality. In addition, the ending is so dramatic and fundamental to the character of Pepe that you will see the version of Algiers intolerable. Although Algiers does an excellent job imitating each scene, the acting is insufficient, as well as the credibility of the characters. Also, the wardrobe is really breathtaking in every scene, particularly in the last scene of Pepe and Gaby's (all the time), but also when she's on the boat. Frankly, Algiers is cheap with regard to imitations.
