I'm kind of between the review and the hate criticism. I'm a fan of Lovecraft (and a 'purist' of Lovecraft) a long time ago, and although this little amateur film was of poor quality, it had several redeeming qualities. I went to see the worst thing I've ever seen, and wondering if Lovecraft would deliver his grave, but I was shocked to find that I really liked it. <br /> <br /> I do not want to catalog the flaws of the film, so I will mention just a few that prevent this movie from being a 'stellar amateurish effort'. <br /> <br /> It's a very low budget and shot on a camcorder, so it looks like some soap operas, but when you get used to it, it's no big deal. The direction is very amateur and the shooting range and the use of the shooting distance are quite awkward. Still, this movie was kind of creepy and more faithful to Lovecraftian's intention than almost all the transvestites of Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna (my main exception to the Re-Animator and Dagon movies) put together. The idea of ​​being impregnated by an Old Man is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which is not to say that this movie is as good as these stories!), So the overall plot is quite true to Lovecraft's ideas. One thing that bothered me was that the words of the Bible seemed to leave a zombie prisoner upset and scared. I'm not sure if that would mean indicating that the words of 'God' disturb the Ancients or just that particular zombie. There was no real answer to that. The rest of Christian symbolism reminds me of August Derleth's opinion of mythos. So, in a way, this was a Derleth style, which is based on myths. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie just as a curiosity. It shows how a very atmospheric movie can be done with almost zero budget. I liked the scenery of the wineries. The outdoor shots were sad, though. Using the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same shot) to convey the long journey of 3 characters was very sad. The director needs to bang his head on the head for this. The acting was standard for an amateur movie, with the blonde zombie girl receiving a personal award for "Best Performance by Gollum for an Italian actress." Actually, I think this movie was made before the Lord of the Rings movies. Maybe Andy Sedaris watched it and thought "Dang, she would be a great Gollum!" <br /> <br /> A little kudo to the director, though. The make-up on the zombies was like bad goth boys. I was annoyed watching this and almost stopped watching. I was like, "Oh, so that's how we know she's bad and possessed," but later in the movie you see a girl painting a makeup like that on the face of an older woman (both living). So it was not an attempt to say 'gothic makeup = zombie', but rather, 'gothic makeup was left after the buzzing'. However, possessed / zombie equals "blue contact lenses" ... heh. <br /> <br /> Overall, I still liked this movie more than the Yuzna and Gordan movies (except for the exceptions mentioned above). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this movie did a better job filming a Lovecraft story than they did, and on a tiny budget. <br /> <br /> A quick word to the makeup artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but long black nails looked really silly. <br /> <br /> A quick word to the score writer: I know you could not resist, and apparently neither the director could agree, but when the two characters repented with guns for a 'duel', playing that one little whistle of 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' killed whatever mood the scene had accumulated. It was cute, but cute was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers read Lovecraft and had a lot of respect for him. I liked the little nods here and there: the Carter character with the nightmares, and the Pickman character who becomes a macabre zombie.
