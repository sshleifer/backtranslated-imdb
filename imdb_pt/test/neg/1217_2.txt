Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This came straight from the "Jaws" cookie cutter mold, with some other bizarre cliches thrown in for good measure. I was interested to see this after finding one of it still in a book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I think I got what I deserved! <br /> <br /> Very slow and talky, much of this killer shark movie happens on land, which is not really surprising. It seems that the only method they had to show a shark is through shots of a shark in an aquarium. The shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and that's too bad ... most of the characters are so annoying that you really wish they were eaten. <br /> <br /> The "plot" concerns a group of four children who meet a mysterious Indian on the beach one day while roasting sausages. The Indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that will allow them to track an ancient evil that took the form of a monster shark to attack their tribe ... supposedly because they were too good to fish in the ocean and the ocean god . I was worried they would carry all the fish. Or something like this. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing too, because you do not know that ... years later, a monster shark appears and begins to devour people in the sleepy seaside community. When one of the four guys is eaten by the shark, the remaining three are determined to kill the thing ... especially since (great shock here) the authorities killed a shark and think the threat is over. To yawn. <br /> <br /> The obligatory death scenes are incredibly tedious, and you can see them a mile away (my favorite was the girl who was fighting with her boyfriend while they were sitting in a van, out and says "I'm going to swim," immediately to be swallowed by the shark waiting for them.Have had a lot of nerves calling this movie "Deep Blood" since you barely see any, just water blurred. his clich√©d papers as if they were all thumbs, and there's even a hilarious subplot involving a greasy, rock-type bad boy that threatens our heroes, so it looks good in the end to help kill the shark. time to find this movie, it is rather obscure, so I do not think there is the danger of too many people wasting their time with it.However, if you must be attracted to it ... do not say you were not warned!
