The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible, but you should forgive it because it's so violent. No you should not. There are spoilers at the end of this review, but how can I "spoil" this rotten movie I have no idea. Even if you're a fan of Alien / Pred die like I'm hoping for the DVD. Also not worth a rental of 3.99, but you'll be much less inclined to really hate this movie if you pay more than 12 dollars or more per person plus shopping in concession at a theater. <br /> <br /> Theater I watched AVPr had exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. In addition, there was total silence everywhere. No ooohs, or "that sucks!", Nothing. Imagine being a patient at a surgery table and just receiving the anesthetic. Now you know how you feel in the theater after the AVPr opening scene. <br /> <br /> What was the budget of this movie? Like War of the Worlds, MI 3, and other films directed by f / x, the director seems much more involved in what CGI people can create than developing characters or a plot. Spielberg tried and failed several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Of course movies make money, but should they? The War of the Worlds and the Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent script, Tom Cruise and others, and the SS himself, but they were still terrible. I'm sure AVP wasted 90 percent of its CG budget and had no choice but to hire any actor who said yes, even though the casting agent had done better by going to the grocery store and choosing the actors at random. <br /> <br /> There is no tension developed in any scene, so we are never close to being surprised. Who cares who gets killed? We did not know any of them, we all know what happens when the aliens make their bodily exit, we all know that blood is sour. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, and even AVP the directors make use of the fact that Aliens can think, can hide and can put traps. This director decided that Ridley Scott, James Cameron and others were idiots to develop characters that you really want to see live or be killed. In this plot you will never care who lives or dies, not a child, a father, a pregnant woman. The characters serve only purpose in this movie, to die for. The opening scenes establish the fact that the film will be a predictable joke. The character development scenes blend clich√©s, moodiness and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really do not care about death, as long as they die in ways never seen before. But they did not. The director tried to do something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise, but only managed to discard the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and steal the rest of other recent science fiction films. <br /> There is no original use of the Alien or Pred characters. Pred really has few problems to kill Aliens in the dozens, even though the last film led us to believe that Pred revered the Aliens as such a deadly enemy that they used the death of one of them as Rite of Passage. AlienPred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. His ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different films, most recently probably it was Hellboy, where Samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom, where mutant creatures left their tongues behind after pricking the victim's throat . <br /> <We simply are not given cause to worry about anything in this movie. There is violence, but it does not shock or surprise and it is nothing that has not been seen in any of the 100 horror films. The CG is OK and both species of aliens are made to look and move like they have in the past movies. But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad, we hope they all die. The girl was probably the best actor in the group, but unfortunately we are not obliged to care whether children, women or anyone else lives or dies. We just want the movie to end. Eventually this happens, but not before another plot stolen from Resident Evil 2 has a Gunnison nuclear goal to end the "infection." And not before a stupid scene that should open the door to new sequences, but really? In a movie full of bad scenes, the worst may have been saved to the end. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the repetition, but everything repeats itself: bad script, no plot, action scenes without originality, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f / x that were wasted because of the many flaws. <br /> <br /> I do not mind going to an indie movie and being disappointed. Actors, directors and staff are probably making their careers and working on a tight budget. For a movie with that kind of budget and propaganda, I feel cheated and disappointed. This movie is a painful loss of time from the opening scene to the final credits. It's sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 did not even look so good.
