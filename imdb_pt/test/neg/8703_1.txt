This movie was terrible. Biblically very imprecise. Moses was 80 years old when he took the people out of Egypt, the film is about forty years old. Moses was about forty years old when he fled from Egypt, went for forty years and was with them wandering for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died and was denied the privilege of crossing the promised land. I realize that movies use a lot of "poetic license," since the biblical account is not so long, but in making a Bible movie, they still need to reflect the known facts, and maintain the general flavor of the main biblical character, this movie failure in this regard, and many others. Even if the 1956 version also had its problems, theatrically it was much better.
