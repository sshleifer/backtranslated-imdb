This is as stupid as it sounds. <br /> <br /> A classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act exactly the opposite of what a sane person would do in the same situation. This reminds me of a scene in "Scary Movie," where Carmen Electra flees from the killer. There are two signs, one marked "for safety", the other "for certain death" (I am reciting from memory). <br /> <br /> And just like in the horror movie, the characters always run in the direction marked "Sure Death." <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why did the girl start the fire in the cabin and hold the door? Did she rather die in the fire instead of being killed by the guy? Why, oh, why, after cutting and dominating the driver, did they sit him down on the bench and have him observed by the wounded man instead of simply shooting him or at least knocking him down? He was running over his friend and killing him a minute before, but they have scruples ?? Why, oh, why a hundred more things ... If this movie were a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. Everything is so unlikely, it's starting to hurt physically at times. <br /> <br /> Add mercilessly exaggerating "actors" and a small budget for it and here's what you get. Looking at the rating and the comments, I get the impression that these people watched a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing is the infamous red toolbox of "While She Was Out" - movie that is similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.
