Okay, this movie starts and it looks like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed novel fan. She has no contact with reality outside the soap (as the inverse of the main characters in "Pleasantville") and flees to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well, it's a cute movie ... but at the same time it's also a dark and very violent film about two gunmen who are ready to kill Betty for reasons that can be complex to be told here. Any plot would have been enough by itself, but "Nurse Betty" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very shocking. I did not like that much.
