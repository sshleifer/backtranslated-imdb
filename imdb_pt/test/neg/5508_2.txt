I'm a fan of the bizarre style of Jess Franco, and a lover even of his useless films, and my personal opinion is that he, in addition to several very entertaining movies, also created some masterpieces such as the brilliant "Paroxismus" aka "Venus ". "Sadomania" in 1981 is certainly one of the most popular films in the history of filmmaking, but it is not surprising that the more than 180 films that this highly prolific filmmaker directed in his career also include a lot of great stinkers of time. one of those stinkers, just a totally bad movie and plot less with the ability to annoy you despite constant nudity and nudity. Of course, constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes but one time that keeps going back and forth like that is very likely to get bored after a short period of time.The only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is generously spoken a little fun. <br /> <br /> After some newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island, they are stopped by a group of topless women carrying guns, guards from a local prison camp.While the husband is banished from the island, Wife is taken to the camp. the prisoners, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely perverted governor. The prisoners are, of course, totally hot, most of them blond, the guards are totally topless women carrying rifles. <br /> <br /> The plot, if you can call it that, is extremely stupid, of course, but who's going to watch it for a good plot anyway. The only interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a movie "Women In Prison". There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top, sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really nasty. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so annoying. The sleaze will keep you watching at first, but after the first 45 minutes I actually had a hard time not falling asleep. It also makes me wonder why, of all pornstars, Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who had been born a man (well, maybe just for that reason). If you really want to watch this, make sure you have enough beer at home to watch it and just watch the sleaze and the exploration (and perhaps by the slight factor of unintentional fun). Do not expect to be too entertained, however, it's almost unbelievable how a movie with such a sleaze level can be so annoying. I'm a fan of Jess Franco and I always will, but "Sadomania" is bad. 2/10
