I love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie. However, in the first ten minutes of the movie I knew it was going to be bad. It was poorly executed and very slow. In addition, he was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes putting racial, ethnic and other types of insults has a point, illustrating the fanaticism that exists. In this movie there was no sense for horrible fanaticism and no one learned from what was being said. Part of the problem is that it was an adaptation of a play and a remake of a 1982 film dealing with a 1950s basketball team. Having this film happen earlier in time would have made a little more sense. It did not translate well in modern times and the writing was horrible. I do not know how the piece was originally written, but I can not believe that any movie as bad and as odious as this came to television and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Do not waste your precious time with this.
