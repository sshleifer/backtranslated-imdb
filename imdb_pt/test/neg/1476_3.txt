The concept of this film is unique, but its execution is smaller than the special one. When I got to the movies and realized there were only about 15 people in the crowd, I thought I had made a mistake. However, the mistake was made in shocking detail when the movie was over and I knew I had wasted two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Without the cruel recordings of the old man, and the stupidly funny friend, this movie would have rated 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> This movie is special, especially since it is probably the worst movie to be released to the general public. <br /> <br /> Also the question of whether you could call it a movie or just an advertisement for the probably "Northwestern" crummy. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie for the plot, the humor, the filming, the local, then no. On the other hand, if you like to try both ends of the movie production spectra, then go, just grab a book, or a small game or just some novelty item.
