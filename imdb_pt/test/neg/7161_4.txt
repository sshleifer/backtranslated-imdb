After the book, I was very sad when I watched the movie. I agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel, but in this case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: 1) because the ranks are different (for example, Lieutenant Diestl instead of sergeant etc.) 2) the final screen is very poor and does Diestl as a soldier who feeds and wants to die. But this is not true at 100%. Just read the book. He was also a bull-dog in the last seconds. He did not want to die by destroying his weapon and simply walking towards Michael & Noah. <br /> <br /> So, this is a kind of happy ending that does not fit into anything for this movie.
