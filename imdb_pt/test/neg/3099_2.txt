What's the story of what's on the screen? At first I must say, do not touch this movie, it's for your best (sucks). And really what the story is, at first seems fine, but after ten minutes everything gets worse. And that's not all, you can hardly see what is on the screen that is very dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Do not touch.
