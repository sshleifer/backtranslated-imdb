Yes, Lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid. And this novel is not joking when they make Perry King, supposedly a renowned doctor, unable to see the evil around him. Put your trust in the doctors, huh? How can anyone not see what is happening? Is he so stupid? And the bad wife, with the face of a horse, leaves killing all her family without a trace. How does she get all the drugs? This is not explained. How can she be a secretary in a hospital with no credentials? I think the director, Don Faunt LeRoy, asks us to believe. I did not do. I kept yelling at the screen of King's stupidity all right in front of his face. If the wife was so attractive, maybe, just maybe, I'd take it. But she is not even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell her that she has the face of a horse. I would not cross the street by her, but our perfect husband does this and quickly. After everyone in the cast was eliminated, I was not satisfied with the money that was given to our villain. She deserved more than she received. William Moses plays the doctor's brother, who unfortunately knows the result from the first day. Nice to at least see a pretty face in this clinker. The one of Lesley Anne Down. She gives the film a count just for the relief of seeing someone looking for this mess. Perry King deserved his fate. What an idiot.
