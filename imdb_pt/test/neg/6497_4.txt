I have seen this egocentric "effort" in getting a film of "epic" status in the company of several members of the native Russian family. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from the cult to Mikhalkov to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of money "Canal +", put some of it into his (and other's) pockets and turned the project into a group of film students. I've counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. There is no way the same director can be responsible for these different scenes. Compare them by yourself: Cadets polishing shoes with a dog. <br /> <br /> · Scene from the train station (saying goodbye to Andrei). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor panorama shots. <br /> Ormond talking through the keyhole. Initial attempt at the Grand Duke and then chases scenes to get Andrei back to sing in Figaro. <br /> · Fencing sequence <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than superman. Learning about her transfer belatedly, she travels all the way through Moscow in a minute to bid Andrei farewell. <br /> <br /> The Russian natives felt that the impression of Russian life was "caricature" and not history. They called it the "tourist postcard" of Russia. <br /> <br /> They were all proud that a Russian director / producer / fixer managed to get in the "big time" and be able to waste more than 30 million dollars from other countries. people's money, perhaps putting a little in local pockets during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think" you've seen Russia go see this movie. Have some coffee before you go.
