As fast as these films are going through the artifacts of the Amityville house, it will not be long until we get to the floor, but for now it's a mirror that's causing trouble for more cardboard characters in this sixth installment of the series. A homeless man gives the artist Ross Partridge, who has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. This mundane horror rolls in a monotonous rhythm, leaving us waiting for an accumulation that never happens when the various "scary" events lead to a stupid end. Dull and lifeless, with the rude acting and the huge hair of Partridge not helping.
