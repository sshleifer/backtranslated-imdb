Oh boy, oh boy. This film is something for lovers of "real" cinematic art. It really does not make any sense. It's totally annoying, especially because of the "anti-climaxes". All people behave more than strange and unrealistic. Sometimes it's like sitting in a theater, because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera (and therefore the audience) instead of the other. As I said before, if you are in the most artistic films, shown in Cannes - go ahead. If you're not, you'd better leave this movie alone because you'll be more than disappointed and in the end you'll know you've wasted your time - as I did. Two thumbs down ...: - (((
