Do not waste your time. One of those cool boxes that you get on Blockbuster on a guess, but it's not even worth it. You will NOT say, "It's so bad, it's good." It's just "bad." The greatest American hero is a writer who rents a cabin on the African island, called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on the boat that leaves you out, but they do not stay on the island. They just stop there to let the writer out. Then the boat is stranded there, and - in true Hollywood originality - the island's first and only radio is stuck. Then they start to walk around and see a lot of snakes. Like hundreds of them, it really got boring and you knew that the plot would not go anywhere. It's not like there's ever been a main snake. Like a giant mutant snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes. Instead, there are just a lot of ham-and-egger snakes of all kinds of breeds. His only goal, then, was to escape from the island ... instead of having to conquer the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew they could not try to kill them all, and they did not try. I saw a similar movie where a city was haunted by snakes and they took all the snakes in a cave and exploded. At least you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. On Snake Island (by the way, each character was shocked to see snakes on the Island ... duhhhhh, it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no other plan besides trying to get gas for the stupid boat. Oh, they never get gas on the way. They "just happen" to find another boat on the island already gassed.
