I can not believe I bought this movie on DVD. I do not even remember being shown on TV last year. Why in the world could not they have made a real sequel to one of the best Christmas movies ever? Damn and Randy Quaid looks like he's got the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I did not know about this movie until I bought it tonight and thought I would take a look at IMDb and see how it was rated. Boy, I made a mistake. If your reading this review be warned stay away and just keep the first Christmas holidays. Well, at least I did not pay more than $ 10 for that. Maybe I can swap it and get half of it on Tower Records. Then again, maybe not. PS I have not watched yet, my DVD player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie, The Riddick Chronicles (Cut No Cuts Director) courting bitch.
