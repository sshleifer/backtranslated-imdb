This is the kind of movie I'm wondering why someone would have considered doing this from the start. This is the kind of movie that I can not understand how people put money into it, as the rental company can put the DVD on their shelves. This is the kind of movie that I blame myself for having rented. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies, and I do not reject the genre. When they are good, they capture interest in the action, they have well-written characters and act well enough for you to care about them. The effects on some of these movies support the film in many cases, and you may like them for originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject matter and script are at the level of cheap comics - just a clich√©. The effects are cheap - and I do not care that the movie is low budget - you can do a lot on a low budget, but you need some talent. There are as many errors of continuity and other errors of direction as in ten other films. You do not care about the characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the movie you wonder if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery, there are some good places that are worth a much better movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst movie of the year so far.
