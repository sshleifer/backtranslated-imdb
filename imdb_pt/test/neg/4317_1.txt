This movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The suspense created disappeared because of the horrible performance or lack of direction of the director .. I do not know .. it was like a tasty chewing gum that seemed to have no taste, but you continue to chew because it once tasted great. Like most thrillers The Hitchhiker had promise still failed to deliver when I had bright eyes and ready to turn down the volume (I was watching the movie alone .. in the dark) This so called thriller came as if it were made of transforming Lego in something else. He simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a TV-style movie with one exception. Probably classified as R.
