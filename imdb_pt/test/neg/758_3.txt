It's not just that the film is lame. It's more than that. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another Western? How about a Western with African Americans in the securities papers? Sounds stupid, implausible and a weak attempt to modernize the genre? This is. Incredibly lame and simple in spirit. It's like that lame Baz Luhrman movie, "Romeo and Juliet," where he rode in modern times to lure the young and create some hype with his reworking of a classic tale. Well, Baz Luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. In fact, the story is not bad, but the idea of ​​removing racism from a racist genre when casting an African American cast is racist by itself. He is also childish and simple (like Baz Luhrmanman, he is a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He's in the movie too! How can you be racist? It is not. I said that the idea of ​​pitching all African Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film is not racist, it's just meaningless, stupid and very annoying.
