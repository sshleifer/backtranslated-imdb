Great performance, great production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the script begins with great pace and interest in the first half and then collapses in the second half. We are clear about the character and motivation for the first time, but the second time leaves many questions unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts raised are convincing, but the result is weak. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is pro-war, but we do not know if this philosophical stance changes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of picture that makes me want to look for the facts in the history books. I do not feel like I can trust the movie to get a clear idea. The representation of war itself is extremely accurate, although the lack of enthusiasm of women does not reflect the hysteria of war. which swept Britain at the time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; like a lot in this movie, I just do not know.
