Four Guys (Jacks) enter the restaurant business with a fifth Guy and lose all sense. They let themselves be abused more than the textile workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I just hope I can resell this item to someone who might like it. <br /> <br /> True, it will catch your attention if you can let the illogical developments in the plot not bother you too much. It's very silly in every however, especially when a stranger enters the restaurant. Who is he? Guess what. <br /> <br />
