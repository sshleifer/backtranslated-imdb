This movie is really bad. The hero can not play. You see a lot that he learned his color walk moves. And believe me, he walks a lot. For 45 min, nothing happens. He just walks to places and leaves ... As if the story were so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring scenes of "looks-as-a-suspension". <br /> <br /> The dialogues are very bad. I counted a lot of "hello" and few "hold" in the first part. <br /> <br /> Blood is orange like Mercurochrome that you put in the boy's bubbles. And the scenes are not following. A bloody neck on one scene, one neck clean on the next. <br /> <br /> The story could have been improved. Yeah, I mean what the hell is the story? <br /> <br /> Martial arts? At where? Is this martial arts? See how the movements are hesitant and slow !!!!! If you give a kick and get punched it's called martial arts, so I'm Bruce Lee !!!! <br /> <br /> The only good point I found is in fight scenes: they do not zoom and fast change scenes that give you headache in most action movies. <br /> <br /> There are many low budget movies that are great. That was just to make money. Just it.
