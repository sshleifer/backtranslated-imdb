Horrible movie, bad editing, horrible lighting, terrible dialogues and complicated scripts. <br /> <br /> The lighting is so bad that there are times when you can not even see what is happening, I even tried to play with the contrast and brightness so I could see something, but it did not help. <br /> <br /> They must have found the script in a trash can, the development of the character is so horrible and while you hardly expect much of a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie this manages to beat a low of all time. You can not even laugh at the 'tacky' thing. <br /> <br /> Direction and editing are also terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every step, as it spreads through the plot that is so weak, it's just unreal. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say other than being very bad and nothing like the previous work of Jean-Claude Van Damme that you might like. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plate, frankly words fail me to condemn this "movie".
