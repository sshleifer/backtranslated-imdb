What can I say about a movie as bad as that? The people who made this movie did not even try to make the monster look realistic. You never see more than the head, and the head is just a giant marionette that has little movement except when it opens its mouth to roar. And the sound they used to roar is the best part. In many moments of the movie, it looks exactly like a TIE fighter flying overhead! I could not believe it when I first heard it and had to step back several times to make it sink. Aside from the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes, there is not much else for this movie except for some tacky attacks. scenes and the crazy Scotsman attacking the children trying to have an intimate moment in their castle. Still, it's watchable if you like that sort of crap. I know I do ....
