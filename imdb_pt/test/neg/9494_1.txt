The revisionist history-making the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic-is rather surprising. But the atrocious performance, the amateur cinematography and the terrible dubbing make this movie painfully bad. The only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the movie are beautiful. And, surprisingly, being tortured for days, with tied hands apparently does not detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle, and makeup. My guess is that the producers filmed mostly in Russia, choosing women for their looks - and willingness to work cheap - rather than acting ability. If you decide to watch it because you have nothing better to do, or if you are a film student looking for bad examples, quickly move on to all non-nude scenes.
