Maybe the target audience of this Disney Channel TV movie is satisfied with that, but if any parent are watching with the youngsters, they will see clearly that the "eccentric" is written throughout the production. Obviously, it was not anyone's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was invented in a meeting room somewhere, then produced with cool efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas do not stand a chance to show off their talent. The incredibly cute Elisabeth Harnois is involved as the First Daughter, but Will Friedle is once again playing another dumb character, though not as dumb and boring as her "Boy Meets World" role. The backdrop to this movie is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there is no real "presidential" sentiment in the film and the Secret Service is considered a bit better than the Keystone Kops when they do their duty. The Disney Channel features many original TV movies and most of them are better than this.
