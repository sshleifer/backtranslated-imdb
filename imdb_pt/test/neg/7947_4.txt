I'm sure many guys will love this movie. The only woman who shows any "balls" (unhappy mourned pun) is made to look, speak and look like a guy, the other two women are portrayed or as sex objects with one thing on their mind - sex / being sexy, with sex as their only attribute and ability (Iris) - or how scared little princesses that is neurosis denies any professional strength and authority they had before all hell broke loose (Doc). The only force that Iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a great strong man. In addition to my negative reaction as a feminist, I have to do camera work and Ethan Hawke is great in the first scene. After that, its performance loses steam. Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. At least the film addresses the subject of the duality of good / evil in the criminal mind.
