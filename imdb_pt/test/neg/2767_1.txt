This movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> Just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this lie about a cool girl (Joan Woodbury) who gets into the underworld because she needs money (and because she's too lazy to accept a job of friends after offering it). Alan Ladd should be the star of this thing, but he is not found in the first half hour and when he appears, he stands as a constipated mannequin. A real failure with plenty of talent scenes and characters (besides stupid ones) to make you want someone to shoot someone, like too fast. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
