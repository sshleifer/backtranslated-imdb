Now, I love Italian horror movies. The more cheesier they are, the better. However, this is not Italian cheese. This is a week's spaghetti sauce with rotten meatballs. It's amateur time on all levels. There is no suspense, no horror, with just a few drops of blood scattered to remind you that you are actually watching a horror movie. "Special effects" consist of lights turning to red whenever the ghost (or whatever) is around, and a rope pulling the sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The quality of the DVD is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the movie more than harms it). The dubbing is below the lower standards of "bad Italian film" and I gave a star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! And what we discovered when she finally looks in the attic (in a scene that is diurnal one minute and the next night) ... well, I will not ruin everything for who really wants to see, but let's just say it's not very 'new "!
