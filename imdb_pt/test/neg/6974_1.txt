"Glen or Glenda" was the first attempt by Edward D. Wood Jr. to direct a feature film. For this he chose a close and dear theme in his heart ... the transvestism, the "art" of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with subjects that were largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a prologue to Bela Lugosi, who makes little sense and then moves on to the discovery of a dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis, aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot), with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Alton (Timothy Farrell), tries to understand why a man would like to live (and die) in that way. <br /> <br /> Glen is engaged to Barbara (Dolores Fuller) and reluctant to tell her about her obsession. And that's it. We see countless footage of everything from motorway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of Wood walking down the same street, dressed as Glen or Glenda, looking anxiously at the women's clothes in the window of a store. The poor little Bela, who lost her luck and was friends with Wood, continues to appear throughout history. I'm not 100% sure, but I think the scenes from Bella were added to the value of her name after the body of the movie was completed. <br /> <br /> To increase the confusion of Lugosi's narration, Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides off-screen narration. Lugosi goes on to say, bevare, bevare ... be careful, be careful, as well as some nonsense about snakes and snails and dog tails. <br /> <br /> The story is also about a transvestite who succeeds sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between this person and Wood's character (s). The sequences of dreams are laughable. A wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. Wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors (?) Completely dressed, but leaving little to the imagination, undecided for 1953. <br /> <br /> This film, along with the other "classics" of Wood, was so bad that they have become embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. For this reason, they survived to this day.
