The most disturbing thing about this movie is not that it's a load of bullshit (the CPUSA was never really a spy threat as the movie does out). The troublesome aspect is how it whitens the totally unpleasant tactics of the FBI and the Committee on Non-American Activities. Secret informants, gossip turned into accusations, errant searches - that's the sort of thing the secret police thugs did, like the KGB did, and presumably, what good patriotic Americans were fighting. However, the FBI did and did not crash an eye. This is the only realistic part of this movie, and they have no feeling of shame. Add to that to undermine the Constitution itself, with only Communists invoking the Bill of Rights. The film also makes veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was Communist-inspired, another bundle of lies. It is extremely difficult these days to excuse this outrageous propaganda, even to understand the paranoia of the times, when one realizes just how damaging it was for real people then.
