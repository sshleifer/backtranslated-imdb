More of a frisbee like tortoise with fangs that rise like a wart hog. More battles with people in bird suits who look like people in bird suits. A ping pong ball space ship. Two rude guys who know how to do everything, including boarding the spaceship. More tiring music. More "Gamera is a friend of children". I remember when Godzill and Rodan left. The movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were really a menace to people. Now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them. The adults are all ridiculous and idiots. Like the American sitcoms, the boys are the bosses (when in reality they could not get out of the paper bag). These monster movies should be the Japanese way of dividing these little myths. Above all, however, is that after seeing three of these films (with the same plot several times; check the footage), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you have not seen this, do not bother.
