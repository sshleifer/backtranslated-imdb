Why worth it, this is a pretty decent Road Runner cartoon if a bit short (just under 6 minutes). The gags are appropriate, at best, the animation is competent, and the new restored DVD master looks cool. However, that is where the qualities end. Let me give you one small story: in 1958, thanks to a labor dispute, the WB got a lot of canned music that would be used in six of the year's cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is only one sentence. to describe the music of this short, and that's "has 4Kids sound". I use this phrase to describe music that has absolutely no correspondence with the onscreen action, and it seems it was recorded by an orchestra composed of members of a Sonic Youth cover band. The song in this short seems irredeemably nailed and incredibly unpleasant, especially considering there are scenes in this short (ie piano trap) that would have worked better with little or no music. <br /> <br /> I did not think a WB cartoon would be ruined by horrible music (even though Lava's scores are not so unpleasant), but considering that the cartoon is not so remarkable, it is almost painful to watch with the music. It's like how late 80 episodes of Doctor Who could be bad anyway, and still be made unattainable thanks to the unbelievably horrible music of Keff McCulloch (who sounded like he hit the demo button on all 5 of his Casio keyboards at the same time ). <br /> <br /> I'll have people calling me crazy for this, but I easily watch one of Larriva's RR cartoons about it. At least the canned music was usually in sync with their action.
