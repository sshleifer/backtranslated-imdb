... So some people may argue that this may not be the worst movie ever, and no, it's not. I've seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on. <br /> <br /> So, why do I hate this movie Ã¼ber alles? Well, it's basically about a man who is kidnapped for many years, and when he leaves, he tries to figure out who did it and why, to get revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with blood or terror but <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> THE GREATEST SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ***> Our main character is basically driven to have sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut off his own tongue so his enemy does not tell her because she did not know. It is as humiliating as it crawls to its knees like a dog in utter submission. And why did he deserve this? Because many years ago, he saw a brother and sister having a moment of tenderness - the wrong way. He continued and told some people and as a result she commits suicide. And viola, it's the brother who puts our main character in all this just for that. I wondered: maybe I hate this movie so much because I think its punishment is very hard. Maybe because I think this movie does not condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I expected something else. <br /> <br /> *** END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, no one deserves what happens to our main character at the end, and I'm very serious; Do you know how some movies get under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt dirty after watching this movie, and I REALLY wish I had never seen it. Stayed with me for days, and some may ask, well, is not that the purpose of a good movie? The ability to affect us in such a way? Yes, it may be, but this film not only made me sick, it made me feel raped.
