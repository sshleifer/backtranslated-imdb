Well, I just got the end of this movie on HBO, just the last 10 minutes, but I must say it probably contains the most laughable representation of the long distance run you've ever put in the movie! I am a serious long distance runner and a dedicated sports fan, and I have been through many painful demonstrations in previous films. However, nothing could have prepared me for what is shown on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this movie, it literally defies belief! The representation of the runners is even more ironic considering that the African runners completely dominate the sport, and they are elegant and graceful. The female protagonist crawls like an overweight pregnant woman and her "highly trained" male supporters are no better. Right on the run, this supposed world-class runner is surrounded by plump and obese people, many of whom are RUNNING! I think it's interesting that the director has decided that she leads the women's competition, but in the end she is seen passing by people who seem to be staggering on both broken legs! Can we believe that this incredible star athlete has outgrown only one crippled person at the end of the race? Perhaps the director thinks that female runners can not run faster than 12 minutes of a mile, and he obviously never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a racing fan you will be surprised by the insanely inaccurate portrait of the race, and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy. Here's a note to the director: The next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, it may be worth hiring at least one person who has actually watched this sport in action.
