I did not get a chance to see the previous movie, but from what I read in other posts, it was supposed to be worse than this, although I doubt that's possible. I'm a big fan of the genre "Zumbi", and I'm fascinated by the psychological aspects of seeing creatures, which for all intents and purposes are human, like an atrocity that is only worth filming in the head. That said, HOTD 2 takes the movie "Zombie" to a new record. <br /> <br /> Without giving big spoilers (what I really should do to not bother wasting time watching this movie) I would like to express my complete disregard for the way the writers of this film portray the Special Forces of our countries. Gomer Pile probably could have survived more than the soldiers "Spec Ops" in this movie. For shouting aloud, they should have called them Special Education Forces. If you are going to write a road map in which you send an elite team to deal with a zombie outbreak, at least the soldiers are smarter than the walking corpses. I understand you have to kill some or most of the team but you can find better ways of doing it than having them lowering their machine guns and walking to put a soft hand on the shoulder of the crazy drooling person swaying backwards Writers really try to take the whole zombie to a higher-tech level, making it a virus for which they're looking for a vaccine, and the idea has merit if it were not stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of unlikely movies. I mean, come on, zombie movies are not exactly "high art", and the viewer expects a bit of ironic tackiness along with blood and emotions, but HOTD 2 is the kind of cheese that makes you turn the channel on disgust and fear of the sheer stupidity of the characters. If you are a fan of zombie movies like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this.
