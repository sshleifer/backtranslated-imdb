Awful Star Wars was knocked down with a slightly more comical tone. Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe today (as all poor people stay alive is a mystery). He connects with Mary Crosby (Bing's daughter, about 25 and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. Also in the cast are Anjelica Huston, looking embarrassed, in some hilarious sci-fi appearances, and a plump, rumbling Ron Perlman (which I thought was two feet tall from her other roles!). And John Carradine, who seems a few days into the death and grumpy of Hollywood Squares (relative term) Bruce Vilanch. If you've always wanted to see Bruce Vilanch beheaded, here's your movie. But again, even this is not worth seeing as it does not shut up (think he might have been a robot, but I shook my head a couple of times).
