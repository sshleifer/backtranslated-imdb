I watched this video movie with some friends as part of a triple-headed teen comedy, alongside Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Obviously, we were not going for quality, but for the air-head entertainment and gross jokes. Usually we have what we are looking for, but Wild Roomies really stood out: for being horrible. <br /> <br /> First impression first, the cover: The Norwegian's cover showed covered breasts and a lot of "crazy" roomies in the background; Bring pictures of semi-nude drunken teens making bunches of funny things, do not they? - The "crazy" roommates on the cover did not even appear in the photo. And the funny things you suppose they'll be doing? - Absent too. <br /> <br /> This movie was labeled comedy, which is a bit strange, since it's not even remotely funny. The drama of the relationship would be more precise. <br /> <br /> Putting the film on soon is about a young couple inheriting a chic home in Los Angeles, and are forced to get some rooms to make ends meet. These roommates eventually put the young couple's patience and relationship on the test, because they are so "wild." The problem is that they are not. And here's the problem with this movie: the protagonist couple is so anal retentive and neurotic that it can generate zero sympathy. You will find yourself cheering for the antagonistic roomies in the middle of the movie. Add mediocre acting, lame dialogue, and tedious direction, and you'll have a movie that's best not seen. <br /> <br /> See something else.
