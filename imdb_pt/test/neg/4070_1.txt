Hilarious!! I would have sworn Ed Wood wrote that. Terrible. I loved every painting. Amateur for bad movies, this is your trophy! I'll watch it again. Words can not explain how fun this movie is. Pare's career must have fallen, but I really think he's going in the direction of Leslie Nielson. He was perfect for that. Terrible, just terrible !! You will love!! Get some friends, lots of beer and you will have the best time of your life. It's an MST3000 party, waiting to happen. Appreciate!! It's worth the rent !! You like the "Columbus-type" cop and the comedian doctor. The thug will have you on the ground laughing. He's also in another movie Stop, Komodo vs. Cobra, and he's so good there. I do not know what the budget was, but they will get it back because this movie is meant to be the best unintentional comedy of the year.
