Ahh, something like cheese, outburst, semi-pornography, disguised as horror ... This starring Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), the nubila star also seen in "Femalien", "The Erotic House of Wax" , and that favorite of the family "Nude Bowling Party". She is now a figure in Surrender Cinema's untried cuties line-up starring in senseless and soft-porn movies. "Head of the Family" really tries to be a true moovie. A swindler and a homeless man try to keep the husband away from his housewife. They turn to a big-brained evil genius in a wheelchair, and their family of misfit idiots, who uses mind control to send zombies to make their nefarious moves. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: it's about the extent of the movie's humor. But basically, it is an excuse to show the ample talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). Tied with some of the strangest dialogues may be herd (what the heck is "plowing oats", anycow ??), and simply stupid, this thriller headline will moost likey appeal to the chest-cownters of Drive-In Theater but no more one. MooCow says avoid the bereft, unless you're looking for a rent on a night of horrific T & A horror. : = 8P
