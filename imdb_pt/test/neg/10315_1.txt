This movie stinks more than the cheese limburger! If you find that in a garage sale, LEAVE THERE! I love Sandra Bullock and still hate this movie ... Although embarrassed, I own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play with the fact that Sandra Bullock is in it. They play to be "The Sandra Bullock Movie". She only has a small role throughout the film and she does her best with this, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Well, everyone has to start somewhere ...
