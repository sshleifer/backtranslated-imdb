It's hard to believe that oprah winfrey has produced this piece of crap, the show has not even been able to handle the culinary shows of the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray is the most annoying TV show and talk show in TV history, since Ainsley's harry has had a bad cooking show I've ever seen, at least harry hartle has some good times and some style, this one has no style, she sucks as a hostess, the kitchen seems atrocious, the writing is horrible, the teleplay is overdone and the opening credits are so bad that they make me sick. Now I like cooking shows that have a cool sense of style, but this has absolutely none of that <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst TVs of the year.
