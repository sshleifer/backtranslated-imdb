I want to believe that all the new horror films that leave Japan these days are nervous and provide a nice view. <br /> <br /> The Spider Forest is none. <br /> <br /> It is rare that I finish seeing something and end up disappearing because of the loss of time, but the Spider Forest was an exception in that sense. I was very discouraged. The creators of the film succeeded on one level; Throughout the movie I could not stop because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery run through the plot. I could not stop watching. That's why I was so angry when the movie ended ... they dragged me for 2 hours of boredom to this POC? ATTENTION: The Spider Forest is another of those Japanese "ghost" stories, although you do not realize it happening. <br /> <br /> I never want to see a Japanese ghost story again. They are fake and invented. "It's a ghost story" has become like a big rug under which to sweep away any and all of the insoluble plot holes you have in your story.
