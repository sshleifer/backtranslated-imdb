It almost certainly staged women's montage reading lines (very briefly) and getting naked (not very briefly) in front of an anonymous panel (and uncredited) - almost certainly including producer Charles Band. Launched random scenes from the many Surrender Cinema movies (mainly lesbian scenes). Most women like to "ride horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish who seems to have no interest in acting despite going to a hearing; a secret; camera that films actresses getting naked behind the screen ... <br /> Jacqueline Lovell (very makeup, but pretty) presents two scenes of her own film and speaks in a sexy way to the camera (if you like lesbian scenes , the only one with Lovell and Vanessa Taylor from Femalian is included and they are probably the best lesbian couple ever. A strange excuse for a movie and, beyond the obvious tie of naked women, a frankly boring and uninspired experience.
