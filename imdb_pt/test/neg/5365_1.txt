I was very excited when the Paranormal State first appeared in A & E. I thought this might bring some more interesting ghosting evidence. The value of the production looked good and I really love the logo. So, after a few episodes, I began to think that this program may not be looking for evidence, but it had a strong religious agenda. <br /> <br /> It seems that every case they investigate has a powerful evil demon. I can not even make a cup of tea pass on the camera, but everyone is terrified. Then comes some power from the ritual of Christ that saves all. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is very little focus on other team members. The entire show focuses on Ryan and he feels like one of those people who hands him fliers over his church on the street. <br /> <br /> Are paranormal phenomena and demons becoming the new missionaries of Christianity, scaring people to convert? Really, this should be on a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
