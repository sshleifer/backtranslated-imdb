This is by far the worst British comedy of all time, as it went through the first episode and much less the pilot is beyond me. The acting is weak from the main character interpreted by Ben Miller until Sarah Alexander (of the fantastic coupling) to the cast. The plot / story lines were bland and very predictable using many worn-out ideas. A very painful series to endure, but unfortunately put in a slot between two excellent shows. Describing it as Britain's response to 'Meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog. Britain should have learned that the thefts of other countries never result from the sad American attempts to do so.
