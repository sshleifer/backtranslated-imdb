This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The problem is that he does not know if he wants to be an intelligent, 'artistic' political movie or an exercise is eroticism. As a result, it fails on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, the narration and the supposed symbolism are useless. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this movie. but this is not good. Of course he has an intense and 'unique' appearance, but ultimately he can not really act. Just look at how he reacts when his lover leaves .... <br /> <br /> I really do not watch this movie, some say it needs repeated views. I say one is too much.
