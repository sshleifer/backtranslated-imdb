The book, although not particularly good, was decent, but this movie changes completely. Many of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the film, but Ross's character is from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with his greed for a heart-in-she-maid Monday in danger that it will do nothing if it perceives the slightest sign that it can be less than noble. When films change the book a lot, but keep the same name, it must be a crime.
