The only good part of this movie was the ending. You know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you go out to go home. No, no, this can be a bit harsh - the dance in the movie was sensational, but unfortunately that's where the plot ended. While the cast was dancing and not talking, the movie went well. As for Chayanne's debut - not too bad but hopefully your next movie will take a little more depth. As for watching the movie wait for the rent or the TV. Do not make the same mistake I made and pay 8.50
