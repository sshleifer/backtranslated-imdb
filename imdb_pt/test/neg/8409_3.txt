Very poorly made for the TV sequel to the classic Roman Polanski. Rosemary's son, Adrian, grew up and is incarnated by the scary Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke), a group of wizards, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, prepare the son of Satan for world domination. It's not really scary and takes years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a satanic thriller full of chants, lots of candles, and Ruth Gordon trying to act silly and unpleasant at the same time. Gordon is the only remnant of the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets, replacing the late Sidney Blackmer. Newcomer McHattie is the only true salvation of the film. He is very unbalanced and looks really sinister without doing anything. The music of Charles Bernstein is very scary, but so used that ends up being intrusive and not effective. O'Steen, who edited Polanski's earlier masterpiece, shows no talent or subtlety.
