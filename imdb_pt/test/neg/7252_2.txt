I do not think the number of military and strategically contained bugs in this turkey can be beaten. Everything in this mess was made on the cheap and made soldiers look really stupid. Examples: At first, the 2-star general receives strategic advice from a lieutenant and accepts him without question. The map used by the lieutenant shows the enemy positions, but apparently they have only a single narrow valley to use in the advancement of the battalion (although the map showed a further dozen). The rear is positioned from where they are clearly seen by the enemy and exposed. They hit our heroes from the high ground, but this superior firepower makes little difference. A single enemy tank advances near the end (at first called armored), followed by a solitary infantry point (!) That moves extremely slowly without covering the area, and then opens it when it judges that it is not necessary to proceed. - a very bizarre scene. The soldiers hide in a cave. All around them is ice and deep snow but in the cave not a yard of the entrance is a deep puddle by which they all wade over and over - their feet would last mere minutes before they freeze off. Later, the survivors walk pathetically slowly and chest across a river to return to their unit. Remember that it is deep winter and the soil is frozen. Yeah right! <br /> <br /> And so on. They shout commands to positions on higher ground, they place mines near their own position and warn each other not to step on them (!) At first, credit is given to some soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor. Was he blind, or did Director Fuller simply ignore him? Truly the most inept soldiers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> One of them nudges his own injured leg with a bayonet and ends with a shrapnel, without shuddering or groaning. He announces that this should qualify him as a surgeon. Now that was funny.
