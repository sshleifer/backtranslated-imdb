I had always seen the efforts of the Italian horror master Dario Argento as a producer with some suspicion, and this was only confirmed after my recent observation of the terrible DEMONS (1985) by Lamberto Bava; the fact that this was to be his third installment did not sound promising at all, but I decided to give the movie a location regardless now that we're in the swing of Halloween. Did I check the theatrical trailer on DVD Anchor Bay before seeing the main feature? the undeniably impressive visuals intrigued me to be sure, but then the film itself (which makes no more sense than what is presented in that frantic two-minute set-up and in retrospect can be seen to have wisely compiled most of their highlights) proved to be a definite disappointment! Promising enough opening with a direct medieval prologue of Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it descends rapidly because it relies heavily on surreal images at the expense of narrative. Consequently, several characters randomly take center stage everywhere ?? with the unbearable male lead succumbing to obscure forces early on, the sinister-looking bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) resulting in a mere red herring, the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities, the protagonist is, for some reason, predestined by a goat. a demon-in-shape (culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of other cultists, obviously taken from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year-old Asia Argento as the rebellious but sympathetic daughter of the sexton (who emerges as the sole survivor until the end). Incidentally, the older Argento also co-wrote the story of the film and the screenplay with director Soavi and (under a pseudonym after they apparently disagreed with Dario in the early stages of production) the original author Lamberto Bava and the prolific screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti (whom I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004). <br /> <br /> The second half extremely confused of the movie, then, see a group of people? including unavoidable teenagers but also a treacherous English couple (whose constant fuss is given an unpleasantly amusing joke)? in the same way enclosed within a building in the clutches of evil spirits (the church being the cemetery of a satanic cult), not that this walk of terror is capable of dissipating the subliminal memories of Luis Bunuel, THE EXTERMINATOR OF THE ANGEL (1962) you see! In the end, the film is even more disappointing (although the gruesome effects of Sergio Stivaletti, at least, are remarkable), given that I had thoroughly enjoyed the only other title Soavi I watched ?? CEMETERY MAN (1994), which I own through the R2 SE DVD. Having said that, would I still like to get your first movie? STAGE FRIGHT (1987)? and the director's follow-up effort to the CHURCH, entitled THE SECT (1991) ...
