I thought it would be an Ok movie after seeing the commercials about it. It was funny in some parts and some very nasty. The only person who has lamented me is Horatio Sans, who has a hot wife who is cheating on him with other women. But he never got a chance to have a threesome with up to what was good, but they should have made it bigger through the movie.
