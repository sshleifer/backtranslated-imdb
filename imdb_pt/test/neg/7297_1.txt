Looking for a movie for your Turkish Film Festival? THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst films of all time. The plot, the story of a post-apocalyptic samurai warrior, is a complicated blend of cinematic references to everything from STAR WARS to SEVEN SAMAURI. The performance floats from soft to abysmal. The scene in which the villain tries the old master is embarrassing to the point of mocking laughter. Frank Stalone's Black Knight very much resembles John Cleese's Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON AND THE SANTA GRAIL. (Word of Advice, Frank: When you lean to make a movie like this, your career is over.) I risked this little bomb on a low-cost cable channel and could not stop watching. It's like watching a train accident, you just can not look away.
