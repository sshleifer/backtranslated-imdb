I would hate for anyone to watch this movie "inspired by a true story" and draw conclusions about the true event. Few things that did right were overshadowed by things that simply were not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never found anyone in the graveyard, and killed them, with no evidence that he was returning body parts to the graveyard. The things he did were terrible enough, why try to get worse? <br /> <br /> This movie is among the 10 worst wastes of visual fatigue. "In the Light of the Moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this.
