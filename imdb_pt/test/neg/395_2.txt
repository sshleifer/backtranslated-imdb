This is one of those movies I watched and I asked myself: Why did I watch? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself, I did not find it very realistic. No, I've never used a batch of lizards, nor seen, nor heard of anyone traveling the country in a brand-new RV of seventy thousand dollars or so. <br /> <br /> The same thing about a pimp who has never tasted the woman in question (by the end of the movie, well, he has not yet done it ...), and getting only $ 50, when the prostitute wins $ 200 (well, $ 150). after his cut, yes ...). I still laugh at the lizard's comment that Ivey made (they're the Lizards, they're going to ruin everything with $ 20, and some are men dressed as women ... or something equally strange), that is, we're better than them, we may still be prostitutes, but we are better paid. <br /> <br /> Another then, it's just a story of a young woman who wanted something more out of life, then a dead-end job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and embarrassed by your mother basically doing the same thing (dead-end job). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She turned five tricks on the road ... I wonder if the $ 750.00 she made was worth it? I think not.
