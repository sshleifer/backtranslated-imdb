Being a fan of bad movies, I was thrilled to find a 3 pcs pack of cr @ ppy horror on Best Buy today. The set was cheap and included a terrible movie called "the Dark" that I really remember seeing in the movies. <br /> <br /> The other two were equally bad. "Creatures from the Abyss" being probably the worst of the group. Since they were all bad they are not saying much. But his stupidity, poor acting, terrible effects and retarded plot really made it so much fun to watch. I was rolling on the floor with each new plot development. The discovery of the abandoned ship, the missing crew, the realization that there was something terribly wrong !!! It was great!!! Of course, everyone's favorite scene seems to be the sex scene. OMG!! I almost lost !!! Between that, the "monster camera", I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of bad movies, so I liked it, but in all fairness, I had to give the movie a 1. It was AMAZING ... But if garbage is your purse, at least rent this one here ... (YES, the pun intended EVIL was intentional)
