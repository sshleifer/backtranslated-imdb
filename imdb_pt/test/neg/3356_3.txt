When Pam Grier made COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting film, though flawed. The plot was bold and satisfying - even if the acting was often amateurish. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to redo the formula the following year with FOXY BROWN - not a bad movie but certainly almost like "COFFY II." Now, just a year later, the studio apparently gave up creating something new for Mrs. Grier, like SHEBA, BABY was essentially the same plot of COFFY and FOXY BROWN again. Because the idea was so recycled and because the acting and acting are so tired and low energy, it is actually scraping the bottom of the barrel Blaxploitation. <br /> <br /> Exactly like these other films, SHEBA, BABY begins with some local Black mobsters pressing and eventually killing someone that Pam Grier loves. In the past, they had been drug dealers and pimps, now mafiosi were trying to run all lending companies and out-of-town pawn shops to corner the market. And like the other films, Pam is a one-woman squad - dispensing justice and a good ass. And like the other films, there's a "cat fight" between Pam and a white lady right in front of "Mr. Big." And like the other movies, Mr. Big is a white guy pulling all the strings. And, like the other movies, she is captured by Mr. Big. And, like the other movies, he does NOT kill her right away, but it gives him ample opportunity to escape (here, leaving a knife conveniently nearby). And like the other movies, she ends up freeing up and kills her jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> Although this formula seemed interesting in 1973, this film was frankly a predictable hole. Even if you had not seen the other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - the punches and kicks seemed so slow and staged. The same could be said for the game of weapons. In one scene, four guys with machine guns, an AR-15 and a shotgun shot. Pam responds by firing a .357 revolver and killing 3 of the 4 and getting the other to surrender !!! Even if she's a good shot, she was pretty slow and the guys seemed to wait until she killed them !!! In addition, even a world champion shot or Rambo could not have achieved such unilateral odds - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and they were already pointed at her when she "deftly" pulled out her pistol and easily dispatched these successful men of success !! <br /> <br /> In addition to slow and weak action scenes compared to any other Blaxpoitation movie, the film has many logical gaps that show that the writing was terrible, but the studio simply did not care. In one case, her boyfriend, "Williams," knew about the yacht and Nu-tronic at the end of the movie, but Pam never told him - how did he know about it? In another, the cops approach a boat full of hoods and the hood immediately opens fire. However, the cops had no evidence that anything was happening and the thugs began firing with little provocation. And the thugs had 30-caliber machine guns and other incredibly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by police officers wielding 38s! The bottom line is that this is a great example of "Been there / done that .... a whole lot better". I love Blaxploitation movies, but this one is too doped up and slow to deserve to watch, except for very dedicated fans of the genre.
