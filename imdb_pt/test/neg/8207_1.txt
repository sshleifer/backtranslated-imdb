Why can not a movie be rated zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies like "Plan Nine From Outer Space" are so bad they are fun to watch. This is not one. "The Dungeon of Horror" may be the worst movie I've ever seen (some anyway. I had to go a long way with this!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advanced age, there may be worse films I have seen, but fortunately, I can not remember them. The sets appeared to be made of cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. The special effects looked like a 5th grader's C + diorama in a shoebox. The film contained unforgivable gafes, as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant. He then immediately enters into a fight with his fleeing victim, who takes the flint and shoots at it, without the gun being reloaded! This movie was so bad that my copy on DVD only had name credits. I do not think any company or studio wanted to be incriminated. Although I find that when you film in your garage and produce sets of cardboard boxes, a studio is not necessary. This movie is definitely in my basement of all the worst movies with horrible sacrileges like "The Manipulator", the worst movie I've ever seen with a Hollywood man (Mickey Rooney). The only time I would recommend watching "The Dungeon of Harrow" (or "The Manipulator") would be if someone paid. (I'm kind of cheap) I would have to have $ 7 or $ 8 dollars for "Dungeon" and at least ten for "Manipulator". phil, the never out of the can cinematographer
