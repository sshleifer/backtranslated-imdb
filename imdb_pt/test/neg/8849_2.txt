I can enjoy films with subtitles from foreign countries and especially those where subtitles are weak and do not seem to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie had many parts that really did not make sense. <br /> In all, I can admit some creepy and weird parts, but they are repetitive, I felt like I was watching a loop trailer; It looks like it was a short film filmed with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the veins of RINGU and GRUDGE, but not even close to the hype ... the excessive length killed the emotion. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a hard fan of these types of movies (which I thought I was), do not waste your time on this one.
