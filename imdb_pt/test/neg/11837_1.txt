I understand that Roger Corman likes to do cheap things, but that's just sad. I bought this dollar movie at my local rental store, not a month after watching the original Carnosaur. I was impressed; It was the same damn movie, with only a few Corbin Bernesen mended! This reminded me of all the 1980s ninja movies that took old Kung Fu movies and mixed them up in a bunch of white ninjas running around doing somersaults with the word "ninja" written on their hair bands (if you have not seen it yet, check out "" Ninja "Terminator," "The Thunder Ninja," "Black Dragon," and "Ninja Warriors.") Thank you Roger Corman, You just made me waste a dollar.
