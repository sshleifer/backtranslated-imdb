If you thought Herbie was knocking herself off a bridge in 'The Love Bug', you got dizzy, wait until you see him acting horny in this second bewilderingly silly sequel. Dean Jones is back as the rider competing in the rally from Paris to Monte Carlo; this time his conscious VW falls in love with another car in the race, a Lancia run by Julie Sommars. By this time in the series, energy and charm are missing even more than in "Herbie Rides Again"; the film is long and exhausting, although it is watchable thanks to Jones' typically nice performance return, some funny bits and frantic assaults from the cast.
