Hilary inept - like "She wore a yellow ribbon" remade by five year olds. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ahead: Despite its title, and high body count, "Slaughter Trail" is actually a musical with Injun. battles rather than dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a B movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as shooting in the short-lived Cinecolor process, which resulted in faces changing tone within the same shot. But there were definitely some reckless ones about the main setting of the film, a cavalry fort that seems to be in part a Norman castle. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote "The Naked Needs for Disney". The Jungle Book, "provides a score full of original songs that would have been wonderful for a cartoon, but that fit the West's action as a fluffy slipper stuck in a stirrup.A song tells how" horse hooves beat and their melody sounds like the serenade of the hooves "... during a very serious scene of a cavalry patrol. Other songs literally narrate the story by scene, introducing characters, describing their manners and gestures - as they happen on the screen - and even stop to announce <br /> <br /> The script sends fierce Navajos into the warpath to avenge the death of two of his band by an outlaw trio.At the end of the movie, what looks like a hundred Navajos and knights stung the dust (thanks to repeated filming of the same characters dying over and over again) .But the boss is pleased when he sees the trio of dead bandits.As the singer gently informs those who were not paying attention, the The Navajos moved away, the battle was canceled. The captain of the cavalry, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerfully praises his appreciation. The direction could be described as wood or, more precisely, Wood-en. Navajos are consistently shot in horses - never just one. Virtually every red man on foot dies throwing his hands up and down. The film also employs Hollywood's most cautious stunts, who crouch before leaving the one-story roof (and still can not land) or turn to look back as they slide "dead" down a rocky slope. The star is Brian Donlevy, who certainly deserves an Oscar for not blushing. After the endless end of the battle scene - "climax" is hardly the word - he scans a list of the dozens of his dead soldiers, and shrugs, "It could have been much worse." Andy Devine begins to sing and assailant / assassin Gig Young laughs at Andy's antics ... leading a character who has been arrested by masked bandits attacking Gig: "I know I laugh anywhere!" <br /> <br /> And for anyone forgetting how Howard Hughes could be a nasty job, remember that as head of the RKO, Hughes was the first on the blacklist of the original star Howard Da Silva when the HUAC he denounced it. It took Hughes six more years to complete the execution of the studio, which had already been celebrated, but it did not help much when he insisted on redoing all of Da Silva's scenes for this film, replacing Donlevy. It took nearly a decade for Da Silva to return to work in Hollywood. But considering all things, to get him out of Slaughter Trail, he should have sent a thank-you note to Hughes.
