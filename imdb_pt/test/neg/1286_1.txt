This movie descends like a square pin into a square hole. A poorly done peg. A stake so cheap it could not even be produced on a sweatshop assembly line in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, when you try to hold the pin in the hole for which it is obviously designed, it disintegrates into sticky and repugnant pieces that smell like rotten fruit and are not washed. Quigly is a trick. <br /> <br /> This movie is so frighteningly horrible that it could not even have been created. A movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature; some bizarre entity that froze in the corner of a damp office somewhere and got infected and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at. Only science would be interested in such a thing; Anyone who is not committed to studying it, would exhume it from this world. <br /> <br /> What comes next is: if you're the type who likes first year violin recitals, racism or Coca-Cola Zero, just be your birthday.
