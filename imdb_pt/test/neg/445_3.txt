It was once a great American movie. Which combined horror and comedy with equal emotions. This film presented a clever direction. Innovative special effects and excellent comedic and serious acting. It was titled "An American Werewolf in London." Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel was finally put on the billboard outside the local theater. It certainly would have at least some of the original's emotions. Think again. 'An American werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to end regrettable. Problems begin with the leader. The performance of Tom Everett Scott is hard and tiring. From the outset, he seems willing to prove that all young people are simple-minded. In his defense, not even an experienced actor of Shakespeare could have extracted a good performance of the youthful and insipid dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, whose soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being dismembered by one of the werewolves, is finally able to go to the afterlife. He then plays with Scott and his friends. "Okay, guys, see you later." What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon appears as Scott's mysterious love interest in Europe. Basically, she's a French girl playing the French girl. It's not very dificult. But all this stupidity is not the most disappointing thing in the movie. The special effects, an integral part of the superb original film, fall far short of this failure. Werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with vigorous lycanthropic muscles. It's still hard to be scared of a cartoon. So, instead, the American holiday gang, led by the ultraconscious Scott, continues to find excuses to return to the werewolf catacombs lair. Here it is much easier for this incompetent team of special effects to keep computer-enhanced creatures or absurd animal masks under cover of darkness. Some have said that if you do not look at this movie as a sequel, it is not so bad in comparison. I disagree, this movie can not stand on its own, and it's even more a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original. If you do not want to be seen as a sequel, you should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 movie. I do not care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you loved 'American Werewolf in London'. as I myself did. This simply is not worth wasting your time. "Okay, guys, see you later." Terrible. 3 out of 10 possible T.H.
