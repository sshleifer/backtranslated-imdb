A similar plot, done many times before, and this was not an improvement. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes to this, and you should practically be able to turn it off - the final was deja vu once again. <br /> The only moral I could see of this is: - stupidity + criminals are not equal to success - if he has screwed you before, he will do it again
