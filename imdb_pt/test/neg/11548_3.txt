This mid-'80s TV movie, unintentionally, is based on the premise that the sex bomb Donna Mills (in an almost horrible wardrobe) is a neglected housewife, yearning for her sexy past as a cheerleader . She escapes from her empty life by fantasizing about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she meets, finally giving in to her fantasies and giving herself up a little to the side, though all she really wants is to rekindle the flames of passion with her . There are many laughable aspects in this film, Mills' first foray into co-production (later, after her departure from Knots Landing, she found great success as a useless TV movie queen). starring in most of the melodrama of the week's issues for most of the 1990s-she usually played a victim of some sort, clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining connivance she had played for so long in Knots. More funny are the long fantasy sequences, filmed as if they were soft-core porn (smoke and smoke machines, backlight, porn music), but since this is a networked TV movie, the scenes are very chaste and , ultimately not very sexy at all. The most entertaining (and bizarre) scene has Mills taking a stroll on the wild side of the center among punks with spiky hair (complete with Robert Palmer's soundtrack). Less laughable is the terrible dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter (sorry for poor Cicely Tyson as the compulsory psychoanalyst, or Veronica Cartwright as the obligatory best friend, or even pre-Babs James Brolin Of course, as in all these types of films, we have learned that all problems can be solved through psychotherapy and then the film simply becomes silly, while we briefly explore the reasons for Mills' "shocking" behavior (as if it could not be just that she wanted a good fuck!) <br /> Vacuating.
