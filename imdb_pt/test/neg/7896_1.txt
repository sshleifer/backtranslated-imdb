The movie begins relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an African-American passenger renders an airline negligently. There is a scene where your pet dog is sucked into the engine and that is really a sad thing. But the way it is portrayed makes it difficult to discover whether this was an attempt at raw humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of neglect. After that point, they clearly ran out of ideas. If you stay here long enough, you'll soon be treated to one of the worst movies ever made. It's basically a highly racist sequence of smoking marijuana, bathroom humor, style of each segment of the aircraft to reflect African-American pop culture and virtually nothing else. You would think that the only 3 white passengers on board would lead to some hilarious consequences, but none of this happens. They were basically added just to show how much they could be initially treated and subsequently be accepted in the hood if they behaved. Avoid.
