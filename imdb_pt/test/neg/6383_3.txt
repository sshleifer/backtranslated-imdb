I know that Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but to claim that this movie is good is simply silly. What was the movie about? What is a parody? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No response there from Gilliam script. Totally confused and meaningless, moving from one historical era to another. I find it funny that some people actually call this movie magical. Is it because they have to praise any movie that is vague and indecisive about what it is? 3 stars for special effects, considering that it is 1981. Roger Ebert is right in his commentary. The film is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam's joke with money just to make a vague movement of masked children like a historical magazine. The film also tries to confuse the prospect by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the highest grossing.
