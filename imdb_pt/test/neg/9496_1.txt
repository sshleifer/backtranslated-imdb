I've never felt the need to add a review to this site so far but having just watched the movie I felt it was necessary to alert parents who might be thinking of showing it to their kids.

The video box describes the film as a 'pleasure for all ages' and the IMDb plot line describes it as a 'family movie'. I just had to find a definition of 'family movie' and came across the following: "Generally consisting of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of useful animals, friendly supernatural beings, and fantasy worlds. all aimed at stimulating and attracting the imagination. Whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and usually a lesson is learned along the way. "It's not a proper description of Tarka The Otter, which contains some completely unpleasant scenes, totally unsuitable for young children, and an ending that qualifies the movie as a 'feeling bad' movie. But unless you hate your family, that's it. <br /> <br /> Another review, more revealing than that, but worthwhile to read, may can be found following the link "external reviews".
