Cage plays a drunk and is praised by critics. Elizabeth Shue actually has to make a love seen with the most uninteresting and overrated part of manure in Hollywood. I literally threw up while watching this movie. Of course I had the flu, but that does not mean that this film did not contribute to vomiting in kamode. <br /> <br /> Why can not Nick Cage play something he can actually do as a bad actor? Nick Cage, who is brilliant in a role of bad actor. There is no one who can do better. <br /> <br /> The quest begins with Nick's deal with Lucifer or Lou Cipher's "Night Train To Terror."
