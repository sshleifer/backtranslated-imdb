In addition to Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), an appearance by Henny Youngman and the final seconds of the film, there was really nothing particularly good about this movie. Why is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me - the film is 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I would have expected from Hershell director Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lewis was known for making a number of low-budget exploration films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. However, in recent years he has been christened "Gore's father" and he has many, many fans - fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how some of his films were groundbreaking. But in addition to the liberal use of fake blood and real courage, deep down, his films are sheer shit - and do not believe in dozens of 9's and 10's for his films. That would be like putting a Elvis velvet painting in the Louvre! <br /> <br /> The film is about a series of very terrible murders that happen with strippers. When I say horrible, it's very bloody and sick for 1972 - though by today's standards the special effects look surprisingly lame. So while some very deviant and cruel crimes happen in the movie (I prefer not to explain them - they are of a very sick mind and show a particularly sick disrespect for women), at least they will not annoy you because they were done so badly. It is obvious that in many cases they are cutting rubber dolls and mannequins. But getting them to do some of the sickly acts, even if they are not realistic, is quite unpleasant and shows a lot of misogyny. The only hope in the film, as the police are all idiocy, is a guy named Abraham Gentry - whose mannerisms and speech style are very close to the actor, David Lochary, of the early John Waters films. While his acting is bad, he is so extravagant and funny that he kept my interest. He can be quite funny and strangely this is the only movie he has ever done !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - especially since they just did not look like him. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the movie, they are idiots and idiots who might not act. In fact, I kind of hoped that MORE would be killed - they were really coming! None of his performances were at all credible, and apparently the director NEVER re-filmed a single scene - since most of the scenes in the movie were worse than any in Ed Wood's masterpiece, OUTER SPACE PLANNING. In fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearance in the film is that they are willing to take off their clothes. Now I know this will sound pretty mean, but most of them were incredibly uninteresting and looked like drug addicts who stripped off to get their next dose. When these ladies take off their clothes, men in the crowd give them money to put it back (wow - Henny Youngman should have said that in the movie)! But considering Lewis's budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he got. <br /> <br /> In general, a despicable bile bile that succeeds in being worse than most other director's films ... and that's saying a lot! It is violent (still stupid), anti-women (treating them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is completely incompetent from beginning to end.
