Worst movie of all time !! It's not smart or funny or thought-provoking. 84 minutes of bad actors doing their best with a horrible script. <br /> <br /> Act was so bad that you can see the dead breathing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the combination writer / director believed were Quentin Tarantino or something (you know how to make a movie about anything still cool), but failed miserably. <br /> <br /> I hope the writer never makes another movie EVER! not everyone is born a writer, sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a toilet attendant or whatever. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie even in mute with the stereo going still a painful 84 min.
