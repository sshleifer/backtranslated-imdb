I'd like to know the real name of the Lodge where the scenes from the movie were filmed. It is truly beautiful and dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, like the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on any Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and I wonder if it still exists. As for the film itself, it's really amazing that Jane Wyman was nominated for an Oscar. This must have been a time when she was much loved by her colleagues at the Academy. It really would have been interesting to get a real impression of Wyman and the other actors in this movie in relation to the script. The script of this film, like Kevin Costner's recent movie with a message in a bottle, is so unbelievable that it limits the credibility that actors can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, was able to focus primarily on his appearance and did not get credible roles until later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman must have been forced to make this film through contractual requirements or the studio system.
