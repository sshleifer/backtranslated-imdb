In the same way that Lamberto Bava was a facsimile below his father's standard, Mario (who was an overestimated director anyway), Michele Soavi is a director below the standard in Dario Argento's cast. "The Church" has at least one thing to recommend it - the incredibly detailed art direction - but absolutely nothing more. The film is long, full of one-dimensional characters and almost made me sleep several times. There is a fine line between "art" and "pretentious crap," and while "The Church" is not completely useless, it would be better to watch the other thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
