It's a jigsaw puzzle for me like this turd from a movie has already been distributed. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's horror and there's a fair share of nudity, but by god, the production value is the smallest I've ever seen, the equipment used is worse than standard household equipment, everything is illuminated, giving everything an amateur look, bringing your thoughts to America's worst domestic video or whatever the show is called. <br /> <br /> Please folks, is that it? asking too much for you to really make an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of people's lives watching it? You really should have done some short projects first because it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs! 1/10
