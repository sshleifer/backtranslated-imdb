It's not even two years since I first saw this movie and yet I barely remember anything about this movie. Needless to say, I found it very forgettable. From what I can remember, nothing stands out as particularly good. A talented cast is wasted on what I suppose should be a dark comedy, but if that's the case, it fails miserably. At best, this movie is slightly interesting. At worst, the seemingly ubiquitous covert skies are more interesting than the plot. If you like watching movies where it always seems damp and cold, then I think you might find something to like in this photo. Just try to ignore what else is happening, because it is just watchable.
