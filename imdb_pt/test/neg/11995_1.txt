A total and absolute farce of a movie. "The dark power" is the kind of movie that even the troma would be ashamed to cast. The script, direction, acting and action sequence are so terrible that they are almost painful to watch and one can not help but think that it is only 75 minutes in duration could have been better spent. The reviewer above should be related to the director as that is the only reason why I can see for his evaluation of this garbage, some may call it fun b-movie or "so bad it's good" just to excuse that there is pleasure in it , but when the lead actor (and the more experienced cast member) can not deliver his lines convincingly, you know you have a very, very bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
