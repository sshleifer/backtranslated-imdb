I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things in this movie. She is my favorite actress, every role she plays is always done so well. His character is astute, sarcastic, intelligent, light, funny and cunning. She really takes this role well and you have a good sense of what your character is. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is very bad. Music is the funniest thing left. One of the characters has this strange circular radio that she brings with her while she wears a tight striped zebra blouse. <br /> <br /> One thing that was a little intriguing about the story was the idea of ​​someone hiring these three college boys to decorate an abandoned old theater. He gives them the keys and says: go ahead. That would be a lot of fun and I would like someone to give me that chance! Imagine entering an abandoned old theater with two other people and you decide how to decorate it and fix it. You have complete control over the entire building. that would be great fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not think of it as an exciting adventure, they think of it as a great task. They walk with long faces and fight all the time. It's kind of annoying. But it's fun to think of the possibilities with which these people are not at all excited. <br /> <br /> The movie does a good job at making you feel helpless or a little scared at the theater itself. However, acting (besides Woronov .. and possibly Murdoch, the boss - just because it makes a fake smiley business man hungry for very good money who never has any luck) is really horrible and you end up feeling unsatisfied. In addition, the random slapstick is a little tacky and kind of ruining the reality that the movie tries to create. <br /> <br /> See this if you like Mary Woronov, electronic 80s Casio keyboard style beats and if you think a scary giant theater and abandoned to you is intriguing.
