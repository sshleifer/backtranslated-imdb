After watching Caddyshack 1, I learned that there was a sequence and I decided to search. The movie looked really bad and I told myself to stay away but stupid handed me over and I really bought the damn thing! All the comments and all the bad things you've heard about Caddyshack II are true. The movie is simply worn out with ideas and the storyline and the most ridiculous jokes I've ever heard, the gopher, the whole movie acting is really bad (Randy Quaid was funny). <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this movie as much as you can, that's all I can say. I deeply regret watching and buying the DVD, but I'm not sure what the worst decision was. Just stay away as much as possible.
