I had a chance to see if maybe a really good WWI movie escaped me - that's not it. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are tough on their performances and miscast for their roles. The dialogue is mute or non-existent; the flying sequences are good, but very repetitive. Compared to the fantastic "Blue Max", this film should never have been made. Watch George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress on BM and you understand why this movie is one of the best war movies ever made and it's not. Recently released on DVD Richtofen and Brown is presented as a great 'lost classic' of the 70's, I resold mine the day after my purchase. Do not waste your time or $.
