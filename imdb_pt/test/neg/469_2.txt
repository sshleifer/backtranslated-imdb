How to take the fantastic intellectual journey of Charles Darwin and turn it into a girl's movie. His essential and seminal ideas and his radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched, except for two brief scenes, one of which is alleged to be "killing God"; pure demagogy to make the film emotional. And the rest of the film yields to this purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes, with exuberant music, in which one must cry. Anyone who actually read "Origin of Species" would be clearly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwin's works; on the contrary, there was an increase of reverence and respect, and a new revolutionary way of seeing things. A good film about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that contradicts the intentions of the novel of that film. This is a film that is designed to make people whine in planned sympathy and then feel transformed, though unable to understand why; He makes quick use of Darwin's big name only as a marketing influence, as if he left a name famous at a party to create an impression. It's sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production figures, with the exception of writing, were obviously high. See if you want to cry, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.
