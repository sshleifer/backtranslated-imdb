At first I thought this little fantasy outing would be a little fun. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A good cast (Roy Scheider as president) did not help at all. The story had all the possible worst conceivable scenarios that could occur in a nuclear terrorist disaster. And none of this could happen! <br /> <br /> True - the kidnapping of the President could only be accomplished with the internal help of a traitor in the Secret Service (Air Force One wing), but everything they described about FOOTBALL and the helplessness of our country if he fell into enemy hands it is ridiculous to the nth degree. Seriously, not even the president can fully dominate our missile control. The case is used only for retransmitting requests. In this situation, our system would have completely eliminated the codes and the whole thing would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - there would have been a missile launch because the silo crews would have been instructed not to (communications include a physically connected system). There are just too many guards safe to prevent this from happening. <br /> <br /> It is true that films like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE have given some credibility to the concept of losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this movie goes too far and can not suspend my concept of the unbelievable. And that makes the experience a waste of the viewer's time. This movie is a failure.
