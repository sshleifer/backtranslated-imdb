First of all I hate these jerk raps, who could not act if they had a weapon pressed against their foreheads. All they do is curse and shoot at each other and act like a clich√©d version of gangsters. <br /> <br /> The film does not take more than five minutes to explain what is happening before we are in. There is not a single nice character in this film except the homeless, who is also the only one with half the brain. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton and William Sadler are both drunk and Sadler's character is as villainous as the gangsters. I had not liked him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The film is full of meaningless violence and Walter Hills specialty: people falling from windows with windows flying all over. There is virtually no plot and it is a big problem when you cheer for anyone. Everyone dies, except for Paxton and the homeless, and everyone gets what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only blacks who can act are the homeless and the addicts, but they are actors of profession, not irritating. ugly dead rappers in the brain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. At the very least, they have characters you like, sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.
