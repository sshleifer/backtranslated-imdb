A friend gave me this movie because she liked it. I decided that I would finally attend. It was sooo long. I kept waiting for the suspense to happen, but it never happened. I kept hoping something would happen after the opening scenes, and it never happened. I stopped the movie and came back later. I really forced myself to watch the rest, hoping it would get better. It got worse. I was wondering who these people are? Do they have feelings? Are they just robots? I'm glad I did not pay to see or pay for rent. The end would have been better if Dutch had died of the gunshot wound. At least we would have some excitement from the audience. Or maybe not.
