Written by, directed and starred by Bruce Campbell Field Champion. Easy on its easy to say this is a budget on a tight subject; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can say for sure is that nonsense is not always funny. Campbell plays a wealthy American businessman with a traitorous wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a business deal before being murdered. He hires a taxi driver to take him to a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is "continuing" with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being beaten; the taxi driver is killed in the same place. A mad scientist (Stacy Keach) goes on with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head. With massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and walks the streets in search of his wife; all the time he's arguing with a strange voice inside his oversized head. Campbell wriggles his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. So Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I have the impression that this must have been written as a direct comedy. Completing the cast are Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Pay attention to the science fiction channel.
