Oh boy. Where do I start in this piece of mud? This is one of the few real high budget movies on my list that I really found it appropriate to give a 1 rating, and this is not for production figures, which are quite high. This movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the Bible, and treats the whole story as a laughable fantasy. I could not recommend it to anyone except to see how low a society we became ... For the first thing, Noah was not absolutely a friend of Lot. Anyone who actually read Genesis he could tell that Abram was who they were thinking. The writers were just trying to follow the story with the whole subplot of Sodom / Gommora, and it seems out of place because it is. Noah is treated like a prudish goofball ("You were kissing! You were kissing!"), But at least it's a step above hilarious Voight overage in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> However, these offenses pale in comparison to God's heretical treatment in this film. God is portrayed as a petty and incomprehensible being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("I am an eternal perfect, but I may be wrong") What? Where are they taking it from? That kind of God ... no one should pay attention, let alone worship, praise or love. What the director is saying in this, I do not pretend to know. I just know that responsible handling of Noah's Ark should not be so easy. What a shame for these people.
