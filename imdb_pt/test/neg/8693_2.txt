Nice attempt to bring Shakespeare's language alive in a post-apocalyptic environment, but the end result is terrible. Futuristic Liverpool is not at all convincing; the budget was obviously not too big, but the production designer could take a slightly more creative approach to the subject. Alex Cox made some good movies, for example. Repo Man and Highway Patrol Man, but I really do not know what he was thinking here. Just an opinion.
