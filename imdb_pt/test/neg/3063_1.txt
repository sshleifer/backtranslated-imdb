Some people may remember Russell's films as "Black Widow," which had some appeal and critical acclaim. Boy, she must have actually needed a paycheck when she signed a contract to make this dog. <br /> <br /> Yes, there will be those who enjoy gratuitous violence and nudity. But you need to sit back and imagine, in retrospect, what someone else had to spend money and time to do it in the first place. I just saw this movie on one of HBO's, and I can not believe they got it. <br /> <br /> In 1996, Mrs. Russel did not have the physical attraction she did earlier in her career. . But let's go! Have her play Ma Barker ??? Your "children" look like they could be your brothers. It's also scary because you think there will be incestuous relationships (thank goodness, there is no hope that does not count as a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added to the cast, this is the movie B 'straight to the video' all the way. <br /> <br /> The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, in person or on the phone, are a terrible and terrible acting primer. Ah, wait, I also forgot a terrible and terrible writing. Chalk this to try it. A bad experience.
