Well, first of all, I'm sorry for the pun on the title. I was browsing for movies to rent the other day and I saw this. I heard something about it so I picked it up and looked back and there was a short synopsis of short commentary on this from John Fallon AKA Arrowhead! At that moment I thought, "Well, if he likes, then I have to like it!" So I rented and finally got to watch last night (college keeps me so busy). Oh, and I'd like to add that I read a little of Arrow's review and that of 4 stars he gave 1 and a half. So my expectations of this movie went from very high to dubious. Well, after watching this, I again agree with Arrow (and it turns out that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about it!) Wow, this movie stinks or what? Where do I begin why this happened? Well, the movie was so annoying in my opinion. Not even the bits of blood cheered me up and when a decapitation does not excite you in a movie, it's bad! The characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who would not. In fact, the movie proved me wrong on some points, but the worst thing is that a particular character that I wanted to die did not! What the devil? And the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? I did not feel that. He was obviously there just to be eye candy and give him a loving interest, otherwise I thought he was a waste! And as a horror fan, I should have known that making the "stupid horror movie" sometimes has to happen, or else there would not be much film, but the ones here are annoying me! Hello? Why are you picking yourself up in the murderous nun's room when you should keep an eye on her? And it was made by the supposedly smarter characters, not least. The turnaround ... oh, it would have been nice if it had not been done a billion times and I did not have to go through that movie to get to that point! My main point: stupid movie that sucked me in with some words from my favorite (actually, my only favorite) movie critic. Jerks!
