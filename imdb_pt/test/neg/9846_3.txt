This movie was, in a word, terrible. It was boring, predictable and downright scary. I kept waiting for it to end, and when it did, I was horrified. The ending left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. My advice to anyone interested in movies about the development of female sexuality: stay away from this movie. Movies like this give classics like Lolita a bad name.
