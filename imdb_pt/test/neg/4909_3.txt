This movie is a third-category attempt in a thought-provoking and moody thriller and fails miserably on all three counts. He practically managed to keep my attention while the protagonist was seen slow and predictably breaking all the rules of life he had conveniently placed at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But it's the last 25 minutes or so that things really start to spiral. A vaguely plausible plot (and this is generous) becomes completely ridiculous as suddenly new characters appear out of nowhere and random and bizarre events are never explained. <br /> <br /> That would not be so bad if the script was not so tacky, the acting so wooden (despite a strong British cast) and the uninspiring direction. This is not a good example of making British films, nor should Tarantino keep an eye on it, at least in comparison to his previous work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, if it is difficult to get on, do not lose the effort. If you're a Brit like me and you're at your local video store, be clear. Maybe go to the video titled "American Beauty" - now that is an example of great British direction.
