42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with clothes", but is not at all in the same league as his much superior Tarzan series. Basically, the Jungle Jim series became a substitute for Tarzan for Johnny Weismuller, after he began to get very out of shape for a thong. In Jungle Jim, he's fully dressed. It can not compare with the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, scripts or production quality. It's very corny. This is the first best of the series, and this is not saying much. Many images are used, and it is so obvious. The punctuation is exaggerated, and the plot is lame and production is so poor that it makes it difficult to observe at times.
