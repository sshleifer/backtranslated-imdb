In terms of quality films, this is not one of them. In fact, it's the first Chuck Norris movie I've seen and I was very disappointed. The fight scenes are slow and do not have much variety. Norris uses a lot of kicks on all the evil ones that come after him, which makes fights very boring. The movie is also very short, but for some reason the movie does not even seem finished when it ends. It's a pretty anti-climactic ending. Even so, I've watched a lot of bad movies, and that's not one of the worst I've ever seen. Worth watching, I think it's especially for Norris fans. Also there is nothing like seeing a group of platforms in the desert, which in my opinion was the highlight of the movie.
