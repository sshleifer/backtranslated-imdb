One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is, first of all, too fat to be a novice firefighter. NYFD does not recruit Pillsbury boys. John Travolta has a bad job, and the strange glow in his eyes throughout the film made me think he was in some sort of extending Scientology. The plot hits all the tropes and cliches of what the average Joe believes that life as a firefighter really is: they all get drunk, get into fights, have difficulty expressing their emotions, their wives stay at home crying, they all have problems with the father, everyone has a Boston accent, etc. An execrable piece of schwarmerei that touches our cultural worship of heroes after September 11 - which was, by the way, a valid worship of cultural heroes. This movie unfortunately does not feature believable heroes to love.
