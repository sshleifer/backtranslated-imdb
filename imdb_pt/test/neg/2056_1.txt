Once again, I fell in love with it, at my roots I long for a fun and bloody horror movie, even a vampire. Even if it's stupid, as long as I have my grace in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it does not take much. So I saw the cover of "Bled" on Hollywood Video and I was kind of curious about what it was, it sounded kind of interesting, so I decided to rent it. Because? Why do I always fall in love with it? Not only did this movie not satisfy the satisfaction I needed for my violence and nudity, but I was bored. This movie has the kahoonies to say that it's a vampire movie and it really is not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for cash back because this is one of the rare times I really turned off the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist knows a vampire, I guess, I do not know, I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he was, but his name was Reinfield, so I'm assuming that maybe he's a cheap guy who Do you like to scare people? I do not think I know. Anyway, he thinks the artist has a certain glow to the dark, so he gives him a drug to enter into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I do not think I know. Then your friends get excited and decide they want to try the drug too, I guess, I do not know. So, after they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I guess, I do not know, and the vampire is now taking advantage of girls with big breasts in scandalous clothes. I do not think I know. But do any of the girls really end up being vampires? I think, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I Dunno's," this is possibly one of the worst reviews I'm going to write, but that's because this movie was just plain awful, annoying, and confusing. I just love seeing these actors you can say that they are waiters looking for that "big hit". Not too smart for them to fall into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes not, in this case they should have read the script. Because the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, everything about this movie was just plain bad, I really recommend you just pass the movie if you see it at your store. This could possibly have been an interesting movie with the concept of a different dimension, but why did they choose this director to display their "creativity" if he has any? This was a bad movie, just stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
