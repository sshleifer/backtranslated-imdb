I felt that the film Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. It shows the things that people will do to survive during the war and the shame that results from these actions; however, I feel it was not thorough or attention. He never fully entered the plot or deeply into the character's emotions or reasons behind his actions. The only thing I found more attention in the film was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Often during the movie were just the two main characters sitting or doing their daily tasks and not even talking. I understand that this was to show the reality of these people, however, I feel there are other ways to show reality and make it fun. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this movie in a most fascinating way.
