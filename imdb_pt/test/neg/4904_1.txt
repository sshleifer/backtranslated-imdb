A horribly bad movie, supposedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up the casino life. It moves in the rhythm of a snail. Dizzy, bland, bland! Virtually everything about this movie is amateur and unconvincing - with one very notable exception: the performance of Clive Owen, who is like a Rolls Royce purring in a slum. Advice for the casino sequences were supposedly provided by a professional, but judging by the way they are treated, they were completely ignored by the director. While the casino staff may well be a different race to the rest of the world, they are not nearly as clever as the characters featured in this script. Odds and ends are thrown in the script in an attempt to provide a compelling story, but appear to have been listed in a cocktail napkin list. For anyone who makes a living in the casino business (as this writer has for the last forty years!), This is a representation of his poverty-stricken world that, even in the farthest and darkest reaches of England, ! A disgusting and insulting mess of a movie that crawls and crawls and walks for an idiotic and unconvincing end. American critics loved it.
