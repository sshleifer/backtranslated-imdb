Okay ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Network" will be his true major film success ... but for now, this somber comedy is not the classic it aspires to be. It's awful, though it has some good scenes: the first murder victim, the emergency room man responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, Drummond's confusing delusional, and the last scene in which Scott's character recovers his professional integrity and self-respect. . He also has some ridiculous scenes: the shocking monologue of Scott's character during his initial visit to the hospital psychiatrist, Scott's character raping Rigg's character, Dysart's horrific assault on his brief scenes, and O.R. doctor jumping on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "I already have a lawsuit over negligence." <br /> <br /> Chayefsky also tries VERY HARD playing all the conceivable obstacles in this hospital (ie murders, administrative procedures). mistakes, the poor protesting from the outside, etc.). It may have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. Acting: Scott is acceptable, Rigg looks miscast, Hughes is inspired and Dysart reviews his brief performance. The rest of the cast is one-dimensional TOO.
