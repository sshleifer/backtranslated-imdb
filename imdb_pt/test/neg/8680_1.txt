The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad it forced me to register and make a comment. I must add here that I am a film aficionado who rarely goes through severe judgment. But sometimes a film is so poorly executed, ill-conceived, poorly edited, with such a poor history that it begs for criticism. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark and beautifully filmed this movie was. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely thin. The pace of the movie was agonizing. I gave new chances each time (mostly because I did not want to feel like I was missing out on a Saturday morning in NY), but with each new scene, it dragged on for longer, delivering characters I did not care about, with whom I could not connect, for whom I could not empathize. When I see negative reviews about small movies like movies, sometimes I wonder if the poster has a personal ax to grind (something like that.) He used to hang out with the gaffer, she dismissed him and now he's going to ruin everything she's ever worked on) . But not here. I do not know anyone who has worked on this movie. And I wish it had been great. But the film was not dark (as some have already mentioned) or depressing (as others have stated). . . those suggest that I connected with the movie. . . No, Henry May Long was too long, empty and tedious. <br /> <br /> This is Tomas.
