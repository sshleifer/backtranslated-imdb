Good. Carrey is a good actor and he proved it in "Man on the Moon" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." But, hey, what can an actor do without good story and proper direction? He can do the "Number 23". <br /> <br /> The Wicked One <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor and overrated director and proved this in almost every movie he did. What he did with Batman is just a disaster, but probably the Batman movies should be good. Well, they did not. Instead of Gothic and macabre, we have Disneyland. Of course "Falling Down" was great, but can you spoil the movie with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas and with excellent script? No you can not. <br /> <br /> And so good actor and poor director finally met and made "Number 23" ... <br /> <br /> The Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know which is stupid to start, but ... Fingerling's subframe (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like intro to another chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, detective story quality itself, character quality, even color, mood and music, editing and sound mixing too! Maybe it works for the game, but it certainly does not work in the movies. <br /> <br /> Mise en scene is so bad that it gets funny. It's not even boring. Carrey reads down the stairs in the park? Because? It's natural? No, but it looks good. Why did Suicide Blond cover the walls of her apartment with white paper? If she just wanted to kill herself? There is no logic in that, but it still looks good. Guess, it does not look good. It seems unnatural instead. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Because? Who cares, let's continue with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is this Fingerling? Private Detective in Suicide? Hardly believable. <br /> <br /> Scenes where Walter Sparrow is arguing with his wife about the weather book is about him could be the best part of this movie. Instead, we have the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no sign of people living in them except significant objects (shoes, photos etc.) Bad luck. <br /> <br /> The dialogues are not so bad. But what about V.O. Well, that's another story. "There is no such thing as destiny. There are only different choices." Captain obvious to the rescue! "The number was coming in after the Fingerling, and now it was coming after me." Cliche. And so on. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the common housewife would enter the public building in the middle of the night. Successfully and undisturbed. <br /> <br /> The subplot of the dog dragging the main character to the graveyard. This trick is so old and so comfortable for the writer, and that it should have been banned. I mean it! <br /> <br /> Flashbacks and issues similar to "what happened in the latest X-Files episode" is not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. IS? <br /> <br /> I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but no. It makes no sense. Counted in chronological order is weak and unbelievable. All the time we have underdeveloped characters trapped is a chain of situations that are nothing more than poorly written fiction. This can be fun, but - since the whole movie is very serious - it is not. For many coincidences it is bad for all stories. And the "mystery"? It is predictable and easy to guess. Losing touch with reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I've never seen any of it in Hollywood productions. If you are interested in the subject just watch Polanski's "Repulsion" or something like that by David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History of Violence," both films deal with similar problems that "Number 23" wanted to show. Honey, but it failed.
