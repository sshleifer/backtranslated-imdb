This is so bad that I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> The lead role is a good starting point. She is a supreme character of Mary Sue who has few things in common with the original book, which was (a little) more believable. No, this is invincible, infallible, indomitable and insipid, even beyond inflated standards, that this era of "girls with swords" is that our media is spinning too late. She is a top twenty-something model, lean as a starter but rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper, and seems to have enough authority to overcome any official FBI agent. She is God. To balance this, she should be socially clumsy (due to her typically harsh upbringing that turned her into a "Spock") that gives us some delightful moments where she wonders what "Star Wars" is. , or "American Idol," but even so, when it's really important, she can conveniently reveal herself as a negotiator and diplomat, because she's so superior, you know. On top of that, she is played by a wood actress. The most talented Boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir symbol for this construct, acting as a clumsy comic and house "Watson." In fact, everything there is a pop parody of better works such as Sherlock Holmes, CSI and X-Files, from which it tries to imitate the sexual tension between the main protagonists. However, it is cheaper, since it is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will undoubtedly buy it, hence the crazy classification that this turkey wins. <br /> <br /> In fact, the lowest common denominator is a good way for this sad puppy, resulting in exciting sexual details from the legion of partners who pretend to show you how bold and modern, while the overall tone of the program carries a obvious neoconservative. There is not much here to feast on, since crimes (which always start with some horrible remains) are resolved using nonexistent technology, while the "grips" are lovely. but so wrong (women less than boys) goes in varied theories, all of them futile as the main character has everything from the beginning, and once established, she goes out and then punches the guy, typically a real man, with a spin kick here and a slapper there. The end.
