Technically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes) and incredibly amateurish, "Flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit down and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogues are surprisingly true and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an absolutely convincing performance. A curiosity, of course, but the most polished "Garbage", made two years later, is a step ahead. I suggest you watch this instead. (* 1/2)
