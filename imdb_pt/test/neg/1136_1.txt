God Bless Randy Quaid ... his cousin and lazy Eddie on Holidays and Christmas Holidays hilariously stole the show. He even made the terrible Vegas vacation at least worth a look. <br /> <br /> I will say that he struggles in this TV sequence, but that the script is not so funny that the movie never gets anywhere. . Quaid and the rest of the returning holiday veterans (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are wasted here. Even Eric Idle of European Vacation can not save the show in a brief appearance ... <br /> <br /> Pathetic and sad ... really painful to watch .... Christmas holidays 2 is the worst of the holiday franchise.
