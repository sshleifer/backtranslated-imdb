This movie sucks. It's awful. If anyone liked it, these people should get there examined heads. The character of Jackie Mason looks like a retard. That guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked. Even though Chevy Chase was in this movie, he was not funny. This movie had crude and bland jokes and did not have Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. Even though the character of Jackie Mason has the personality of the character of Rodney Dangerfield, the character of Mason is a drug. Rodney Dangerfield was funny! He should have returned! I do not care about Ted Knight, but Bill Murray should have returned too. The original Caddyshack was Murray's career performance. If he was funny at first, he could have been funny in the second. <br /> <br /> Final Comment: I recommend this movie to ... NOBODY !!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE SUCKED !!!! IT HAS SUCKED, SUCKS NOW, AND IT WILL ALWAYS SUGAR !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> 2/10
