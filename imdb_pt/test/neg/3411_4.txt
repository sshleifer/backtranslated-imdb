The first of three films of Aztec mummies is the only one that, as far as I know, has never been completely copied into English. The film was cut and used in pieces by people like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to do Face of the Screaming Werewolf, and it appeared in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere. ) The longest of the three films, a good piece of this film composes the two later films that use this as a base of flashbacks. The plot of this movie has a scientist conducting a past-life regression experiment that causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden cameras in an Aztec pyramid. The group, as well as a sinister figure known as Bat, hopes to use the information to discover hidden treasures. Instead, they discover a living mummy that has other plans. Long and long-winded this film has very little action to sustain its 80 minute run time (worse the mummy does not appear until an hour past). Probably the smallest of the three films, it's easy to understand why this movie was separated, it's the only way to create a non-sleeping inducer movie. Watching the movie last night I found myself struggling to stay awake. It was a difficult task and I discovered that I ended up digitizing until the point where the mummy appeared. Given the choice, I would watch and watch the second two movies.
