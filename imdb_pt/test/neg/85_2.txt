I have no idea how anyone can give high marks to this movie. I did not rent it thinking it was the next big horror movie, the next big parody of terror, or the next big parody of low-budget horror. Obviously, this is not to scare, but a fatal flaw in production completely undermined the joy of the viewing experience. The sound editing was awful. I had to work the volume control of the whole movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget parody - when you are increasing or decreasing the volume, or trying to anticipate the next time you need to do it. The regular dialogue is very low, and all the screams, noises, etc., are very loud. We're not talking about switching between 5 and 7 in volume control, finding a happy medium at 6. We're talking about switching between 2 and 9 in volume where it's virtually impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this movie may be a decent example of what it should be, but you will spend so much time adjusting the volume control you will never have a chance to take advantage of it.
