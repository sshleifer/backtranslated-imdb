I had to lower my rating of this movie to a 4 due to the terrible soundtrack. I'm sure it was not a problem with me or the tape because some actors and the soundtrack sounded great. But most of the actors' voices have been distorted or distorted beyond recognition, especially to non-Britons. <br /> <br /> There are many twists that would make this movie enjoyable - ending up in Bosnia by mistake is great. - but much of the humor was lost in the sound.
