The only good thing about this dull thing is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a college student can not find humor in something that is free, it is useless. <br /> <br /> Stow acting and poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent but bewildering set design (which goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I do not know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the Grinch's previous success (which has its opponents, but I liked it a lot). It is difficult not to overcome this failure and imagine what better projects have been transferred to finance it. <br /> <br /> Do you want a funny adaptation of Seuss? Go with the Grinch.
