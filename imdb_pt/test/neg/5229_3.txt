This film is based on a novel by Stephen King in which the mysterious shopkeeper Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) offers every citizen of Castle Rock the item he desires most - but there is a high price to pay for these transactions. Local sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) is soon forced to deal with a variety of brutal killings and suspicious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Below average for Stephen King's cinema: I can see why some people would think it was boring. It drags on without offering genuine scares and forces the viewer to spend time (again) with a group of loathsome losers, whose hatred for one another is scary. <br /> <br /> I like romance and I do not believe that this dull movie does justice. There are many unfortunate book changes for the screen. <br /> <br /> Von Sydow makes Gaunt very charming. We should have Gaunt SCARED at the right times, not having fun with it. I also hate that sheriff's chief delegate (Ray McKinnon) is written and portrayed as a Barney Fife-type idiot. Star Ed Harris seems to have been forced to make such an image by his agent, but professional he is, he really sinks his teeth into his dialogue. Bonnie Bedelia (like the one in love with Plyborn, Polly) and Amanda Plummer (in one of their normal roles of mental imbalance) are the closest to creating characters who are nice. <br /> <br /> However, it is also bad and stingy. <br /> <br /> Though I'm cursed if it does not seem a bit cathartic to watch a lot of nasty movie characters get ripped apart. The climax has some good blasts. <br /> <br /> I usually give the movies a better rating than they probably deserve, but in this case I feel like I must be really honest and just say: 3/10.
