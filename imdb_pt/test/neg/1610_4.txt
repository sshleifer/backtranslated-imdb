The "Stranger" plot mirrors the 1969 film "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (made by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson of the fame of "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999"). A land of parallel universe is the premise of both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" features a totalitarian regime to crush the citizens' freedom, "Journey to the End of the Sun" only showed a true mirror where calligraphy, roads, houses, machines of all kinds, and of course organs were all in reverse (or mirrored) order. Thus, the similarity of the parallel lands is the only connection of both films. Similarly, the TV series "Land of the Giants" came before both films, having run from 1968 to 1970. a world that was almost parallel to Earth, with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who landed there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to capture and contain "little people" was similar to the premise of "The Stranger" rather than the premise of "JTTFSOTS." Perhaps because of the similarity with "LOTG", a series for "The Stranger" has been filed. If it had turned into a TV series, it would have been a science fiction version of "The Fugitive," star Glenn Corbett being chased by bandits week after week, hiding in different places, etc. helped this movie.
