Unless there is a huge ironic conspiracy, my jaw dropped when I read the positive reviews of this film; I can not believe this movie was released, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I admit it's not my kind of movie, but I tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, it's so bad, and I was still offended by its enormous enormity. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, they may not have seen the reeds and I'm guessing there was a take by scene, it really is so awful. It's the worst movie I've seen in years, actually, I would not even call it a movie, it's a tragedy. The gay black friend, whom no one actually calls "gay", is implied because he is so crazy? Homophobic. This is not good, in fact, this is vomiting inducer. Jokes die in their pathetic asses, music is so bad it defies belief. The person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most malicious songs they've ever heard and put them in this waste of film material. Oh my good Christ I can not believe that the 80s produced total trash like that, I grew up through them, and I can not find a noteworthy thing here, it must have been a somber time to be a movie goer. <br /> <br /> If you even contemplate watching this movie go see a psychiatrist, it will consequently hit you, you sick, ill.
