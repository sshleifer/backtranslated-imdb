When I first saw this, I thought pieces of it were quite scary. But the horror is somewhat weakened by the fact that sleepy teenagers are so annoying that you do not care what happens to them. There are some genuinely good moments, like Angela's speech about demons, and the demon seen soon is effective. But this does not really support repeated views or upcoming reviews. It's all very tacky and cheap-looking and often completely silly, pornography and not much taste jokes, often replacing the horror. The music is excellent, however, and the epilogue is certainly entertaining, but this movie does not have much to recommend it, it just shows up as another type of staff and Jason type slash.
