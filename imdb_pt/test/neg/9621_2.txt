"MirrorMask" was a terribly disappointing movie for me. I expected a lot from a Jim Henson production and found favorable reviews comparing it to "The Labyrinth" and "Alice in Wonderland." Unfortunately, the film ended up in one of those "style over substance" movie stacks. <br /> <br /> While most children dream of running away from home to join a circus, Helena is a child who grew up in a circus (child labor, anyone?) who wants to escape to join real life . Helena wants her mother to fall dead, which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a child's fantasy film. The next thing you know, Helen's mother gets in the way, and for some reason, she's suddenly transported to another world. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I felt as if I had been transported to the Museum of Contemporary Art with a couple of The creature showcase and scenarios generated by CGI was interesting at first, and I liked the Orbiting Giants. I got a little tired after a few minutes, and I felt my mind wandering ... <br /> <br /> With no sense of narrative and clips and MTV-style soundtrack (the sphinxes reminded me of the film by Basement Jaxx "Where is your head?"), I did not feel involved in the suffering of the protagonist and also frustrated, as we waited for the film to take us wherever it wanted, hopefully towards the exit signs of the theater ...
