I'm guessing people who are talking about this nonsense are the director's cronies or something. That's bad, not Michael Jackson's kind of music. Comparing the pace of this film with the progress of a snail would insult the snail. This movie goes through what seems like an eternity, all to introduce us to some non-frightening zombie kids with silly makeup and some kind of revenge, or bloodthirsty or whatever. Believe me, you will not mind. Only the thought that Mother would take her two daughters to this dilapidated, dirty house is absurd. And worse, I found myself just not caring. Backstory about zombie kids? Snoring. Danger to mother and / or daughters? Dont care. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was so annoying. Do not bother yourself.
