OK, here's the summary of this ... this movie is full of sharp dialogues, top acting and a beat-up script. <br /> <br /> There are times that claim to be very dramatic, but that just seem humorous. because of overacting and poorly written lines. I could not help but laugh at moments that should be very serious. The bright spot in this movie is the circus. Seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treat. <br /> <br /> There are times that go by so well. But then he penetrates back into the territory of movie B. I was tempted to stop watching him several times. <br /> <br /> I certainly do not know how he got the best photo, though. It must have been a slow year!
