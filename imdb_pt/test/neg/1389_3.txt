I am surprised that the comparison has not yet been made between Mind of Mencia and the television program The Awful Truth, which happened a few years ago. Directed by controversial director Michael Moore, the show would begin, in exactly the same way as this show, with Moore interacting with the audience, and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and skits, which were brought together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current problems . The difference? Mencia rarely plunges beyond the superficial and the reactionary. What he says and does is usually captivating and rude, and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for himself. There's a difference between being "daring," with which I have no problem, but Mencia tries too hard to achieve this, and ends up leaving as arrogant, with little support. It does, however, make points occasionally, but often, in order to get at them, one has to sit through some cute mind numb shock attempt mood.
