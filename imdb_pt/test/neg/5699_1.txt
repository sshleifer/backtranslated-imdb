I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I watched her on many TV shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new movie T3 I wanted to check out what other movies she's been on. <BR> <BR> She is fine in terms of acting. It's not good and it's not bad at all. She makes up for it by being extremely beautiful. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was a big surprise as the hero. He provided the only good acting in the film. He is a very good actor and probably must be an action star. <br /> <br /> Besides Kristanna being well and Rodney being really good, everything else about this movie is rubbish in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A hacker hacks the system of an airplane off the ground and, using a joystick, he tries to hit the plane in a nuclear power plant ... or something. And of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and spoil his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen and it's no wonder it was a low budget movie. <br /> <br /> What is shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and has many similarities to the tragedies of September 11. <br /> <br /> Why do they make movies like that in the first place? <br /> <br /> Panic - a star (a waste of good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
