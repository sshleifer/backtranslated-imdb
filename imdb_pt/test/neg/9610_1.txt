Based on how little I've seen of this program, I do not think I'll ever see it again. It's not even remotely believable and, frankly, the character Derek just pisses me off. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but seeing a spoiled brat get his way over and over again? Why do I want to watch this?!? No, thank you, there are many other shows that involve rogue characters (Phil of the Future's Pim, for example) where the evil one does not win or if they do not do it the way they think. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that I think this is a terrible image to paint on living with adoptive siblings. Yes, life is not pink, but you can try to portray a character who is not completely evil and wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you only see this if you like to see the villain win.
