I can not make it simpler than that, this is a terrible movie. I worked in the industry and made several (short) films, so my standard is pretty high, but seriously, I absolutely hate this movie. I did not comment on the IMDb before, but I hated this movie so much that I literally had to come and warn others. It's a piece of shit. The writer / director is an idiot who has no idea how to write a good movie and has the writing skills of a teenager. The characters are unrealistic (the main woman does not think about getting the police officer's pistol, but is she ingenious enough to improvise a Molotov cocktail? Please ...) and not even kind, damn I hated her and applauded her when she died. I do not understand what the director was trying to do with his demonic idea of ​​a hick, but it just seemed like sloppy writing and a convenient bullshit with no real thought behind me. This is officially the worst movie I've seen all year. Congratulations Shiban, you are now there with big names like Micheal Bay, in the prestigious "should not be allowed to spend millions of dollars in making a movie" club. I hope you read this, I really do. And for the 163 idiots who rated this movie 10 out of 10 BWAHHAHAHAHAh oh my god I expect a country cowboy demon to appear conveniently behind you and torture you.
