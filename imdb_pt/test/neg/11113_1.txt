I just joined the UK sci-fi channel on July 5, it sucked. Shame on JRD! It could be that he was bored for a week! He can not keep an eye on LOTR. I suppose he was not guilty. Mr. Sheppird was. I hung up after 50 minutes, I could not stand it. The cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5-foot bat. Who financed this project? I think the whole thing must have cost $ 250. Avoid at all costs, do not think about buying the DVD if they throw one, I can not imagine they would spend dollars producing one. Let's hope someone makes a decent Chupra movie and a decent BIGFOOT movie. Sasquatch was fine, poor Lance. It's a shame that a big, straight forward studio does not take any chances, no more superhero movies, please!
