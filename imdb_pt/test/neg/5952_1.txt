I can not believe I actually created a 'season pass' on my TiVo for this, apparently they had a good preview or something .. I can not imagine that. After seeing about 5 minutes I thought to myself .. why am I watching this .. It's definitely not reality, and some of the worst acts I've ever seen on television .. I'm a total addict of reality shows and no there is nothing real about it. THE ACTING .. (if you can call it that) is awful .. The only ones who are almost 5% decent are the girls who are meant to attract the viewers to the show .. although they need to be much prettier to save this disaster from train .. if they had more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent. This is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap. There is no way to get a job on anything else. Someone needs to direct these people to a job in the food service. Maybe they could do it. Oh, and by the way, Parco P.I. does not take up more space on TiVo's list of season passes or TiVo. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
