Eghads, what a bad movie. Tart is perhaps the worst movie I've seen all year, and I've found some doozies. There is nothing redeeming about this rubbish, from characterization to story direction. Even the normally brilliant Dominique Swain failed to save this movie. None of the characters are anything but sympathetic, with the possible exception of Eloise (beautifully portrayed by Lacey Chabert, the only bright spot in this grim failure). <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ******** <br /> <br /> The main problem with Tart is that he wanders without saying anything. Get drunk instead of taking us down the road of history. He also introduces numerous potentially tempting details (the hypochondriac brother, the possessions of the mother constantly being retaken, the anti-Semite colleague, the murderous father of the other classmate) without successfully exploiting a single one of them. And when I finally thought there might be some sort of resolution for the characters, the movie had an unexpectedly violent ending. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling that it was trying to tell me something, but with the strong impression that the message was forgotten before it could be communicated. This is an obvious first film by a writer / director who really needs to spend a lot more time working with more established filmmakers before foisting more of their work on an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 1 out of 10, and I am usually very generous even with bad movies.
