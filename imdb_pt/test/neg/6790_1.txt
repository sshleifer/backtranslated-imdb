This series is stereotypical and boring. The episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. Some purely evil character does something cowardly, Walker goes after him and ends up in a Karate game. Villains are supercliches, evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest, and holy, and the stories are simplistic and unreal. After about two episodes, the show becomes totally unacceptable to everyone except the less demanding fans. Certainly not the best job of Norris. His other work may be cliché, but he usually does not crawl for weeks. If you like snooze-fests stereotyped, boring, repetitive cliché, then this is for you.
