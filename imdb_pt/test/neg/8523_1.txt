Spoiler with the plot explanation: A poor family is being thrown in the middle of the war between the wicked (who comes out of nowhere, and no question is asked) who was crazy, and Casper, the friendly ghost, trying to avenge his death. With each film frame gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. Ending the completely stupid seams has nothing to do with the movie itself, I think someone runs out of ideas or just gets to the point where the movie is like that or not, so it may well have a stupid ending. Waste of time, resources and money. The actor's game is very poor. If you think about the dialogues, you may find that family conflict is artificially imposed by bad communication between the characters. Some scenes are random. In summary: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Waste of time and money.
