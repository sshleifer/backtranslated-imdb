This spy melodrama has a pleasant cast, almost promising, and should have been very atmospheric; there is a will, or an intention of atmosphere and also a lack, or a lack thereof. Sheen plays a dissident who now activates as an agent, he is a loner, loved by women. but lofty; Mrs. Fossey is your lover. Neill interprets the gallant, generous and chivalrous Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are essentially annoying; Finlay plays a special role and other well-known actors. Mrs. Fossey is hot; but again, it always is. <br /> <br /> I'll be your true friend and break it for you ?? the film is low on suspense and excitement, is banal and rather boring; The good thing is you can see Mrs. Fossey naked. Other than that, exploitation of spy derived warm.
