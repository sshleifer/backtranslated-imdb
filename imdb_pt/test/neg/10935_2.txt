Surprising that something like that could find the way to be seen by the public. I knew it was by Uwe Boll, and I found it in the bin at a store for $ 2 (still quite steep, considering) but the morbid curiosity led me to see this, and: 1). I'm pretty sure this is a scam of Seven, Silence of the Lambs and American Psycho, all in one, with dialogues that may have been written by preteens. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character, and he is so utterly bizarre and scary that almost anyone would know he must be the crazed serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays the "good cop" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home-cooked dinner, and what does she get for her work? I'll let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" cop who drives a VW Bug, new style, that is, with a siren in it. A VW Bug ... that will scare the hearts of criminals when they see what's coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks up with her fianc√©, but she still has a "non-engaged" party, complete with "not a wedding cake". Imagine everyone's surprise, he appears (he was, of course, invited) and they are all shot. <br /> <br /> 6). In fact, that should have been number 1, actually. The killer is known as "The Monkey Maker". This is undoubtedly the most idiotic killer name anyone could have invented in a million years. Presumably, it has something to do with "do not see evil, do not hear evil, speak no evil," completing with monkeys. It's possible that the monkeys have something to do with the script as well. <br /> <br /> 7). Oh yeah, and there's a club that Van Dien visits near the beginning of the movie. Has bad disco music, I mean, really bad, and a fenced-in cage with gang members hitting each other with baseball bats? That's what it seemed. And, of course, that's just the tip of the iceberg, the really cool things (?!) They happen in the basement, where a questionable "actor" tells a woman to sign a confession before she gets shot, that being, I think snuff movie I'm not sure how that fits with the rest of the movie, and Boll probably was not, so if he was not worried, then I will not worry. <br /> <br /> An incredible piece of non-entertainment that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe. A parallel universe that is similar to ours, but where things are just enough where they do not seem right. You entered "The Boll Zone". Get out as fast as you can, and do not look back. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
