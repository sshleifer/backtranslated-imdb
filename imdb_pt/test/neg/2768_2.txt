I could not make heads or tails in this terrible noir movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the acting was good, but the picture quality was horrible! Although I bought this in a "Gansters Double Pack" (8 films on two discs) in WalMart for $ 5.50 and when you put the DVD, he apologizes for the quality of the image that some movies may have. <br /> <The plot was flip flopping everywhere I could not understand and had no idea what was happening ... so "The End" appeared and the movie ended. <br /> <br /> What a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I say, do not waste your money or time on it! Or if you also bought the Gansters Double Pack then skip this one ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
