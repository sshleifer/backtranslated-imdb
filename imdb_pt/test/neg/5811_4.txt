I fully agree with the previous reviewer. There's no chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr, and the film's focus is on their relationship. Hedy Lamarr is not at his best, and Spencer Tracy seems to be na√Øve, simple, and overly hopeful - both in love and in life; an idealistic role that unfolded best in 'Boys Town'. If you can get through the ridiculous crowd scene at the train station ... whoa ... it's an ass and not worthy of any cast. It is not the best performance of anyone. Miscast is incompatible. The story is empty and several contributions are devoid of rights. Hedy Lamarr is absolutely stunning, which is truly the best part of the movie. Spencer Tracy can not match the sophistication of her beauty and wardrobe, and the film does not seem so convincing, at least for that reason.
