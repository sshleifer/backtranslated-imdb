What has the beep been going wrong with Disney in recent years? Are there many good ideas? Where's the magic? Where are the good animators, the good composers, the good directors, the good ones ... Okay, I know, Walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can not go back. But is this a reason to produce countless cheap sequels and, slowly but surely, destroy Walt Disney's ideals? I never rented or bought a sequel to the Disney movie. Because I had read a lot about his (absence of) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's Return" aired today on TV in Germany and I watched. This confirmed my doubts about sequences. It was absolutely annoying. Fault animation, primitive color rotation, simple characters, some frustrated attempts to simulate the famous Multiplane camera with CGI, mediocre music and a mosaic of different and simple stories. Seems absolutely not like Disney! It's not like Disney, I know! It looks like one of countless, inexpensive and simple animation series like "DragonballZ", "Beyblade", etc., which aired every day on children's TV. My first reaction after showing this crap was to load "Bambi" on my DVD player, to see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again, to see Disney in his climax again, to see the awesome art of handmade animation again. "Bambi" was the first (and to this day the only) movie I give 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: the return of Milo"? No magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit ... It deserved only 3 out of 10!
