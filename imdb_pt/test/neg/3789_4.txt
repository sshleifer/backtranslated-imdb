This opens with the credits of the company informing us by the World International Network. I knew I'd seen this credit before, but I could not remember where, but I knew it was at the beginning of a very bad movie I had seen, so I seriously thought about switching channels, except that I had seen all the movies. in other channels, which is one of the problems of being a IMDB reviewer. What the hell did I think it would not really matter if WANTED was good or bad, because I'll still be able to review it for this site. <br /> <br /> As I expected, WANTED was not that good. It's a plot I've seen so many times (often) before involving a fugitive on the run, a bit like the Incredible Hulk TV series without the ripping shirt. Jimmy crosses the mob in an entirely planned fashion and runs away, and in a completely artificial way, finds himself working in a Catholic reform school. Have you noticed a description often used in the last sentence? "Totally invented" is the answer. Let me repeat for thinking that this is a totally invented movie where everything depends on the coincidence. Another problem I had was the church-run retirement school - it's very compassionate and kind, I tend to believe that such establishments make Alcatraz look like a country club, I'm telling you this is a fact, but when the priest boss seems to Donald Rumsfeld's face that you feel there is a great deal of sugar coating going on. <br /> <br /> To be honest, despite the ridiculous twists, etc. Darling is not really a bad suspense although it is a very good one too. I never had the urge to turn it off, no matter how artificial it became, which is a compliment to the movie
