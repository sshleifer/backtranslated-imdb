The movie made no sense to me. Good actors (SergioCastellittoapparticular favorite; he was great in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker", but that was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director in opposition to the mediocre one that made that effort), but horrible, terrible, terrible edition script and a director who seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say, and ended up saying exactly nothing. The filthy burden of garbage, but the kind of film that certain Italian pseudo-intellectuals, which I had the misfortune to know in the far and distant past, would have loved and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on them, they can be found everywhere and probably clamor this as a great masterpiece. I never thought much of Bellochio as a director. I remember seeing his first film "PugniNella Tasca" (or some title like that) in Rome, when it was first shown 50 years ago (I used to live at that time). All the usual pseudos raved about it, but it made me very cold. I did not think he was much of a director, and I have not done it yet. Age certainly did not improve it, and this movie should be rated as one of its worst.
