** SPOILERS ** The killer in the movie does not wait a second when we see him entering a shower of girls and nudging her to death taking his arm cut and bleeding while he makes his escape. So we started this official prologue, as if we were watching a real story, stating that several horrendous murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small collage in the Midwest. Looking at the grandfather, and the hearing impaired, Sheriff Ron Delboys is confused by this murder and then when the murders of local collage students, all the women, continue their race for state senator is in danger with him that hinders the investigation at every turn. There are at least two occasions when Delboys says they will never be another murder while he is in the case and in a few minutes another murder happens. <br /> <br /> Finding a gold amulet at the scene of each murder, the daughter sheriff, the collage librarian, Tina finds this reference book on Withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witch cult that originated in the early 1700s, shortly after the Salem Witch Trials. This cult was launched to avenge the 19 accused witches who were hanged by the people of the city in 1692 and went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part. When the body parts would form a complete person, they would be burned in a hidden midnight bonfire ritual. <br /> <br /> You can never understand what exactly is going on in the movie "Blood Cult", not just because it is totally disjointed. story, but it is increasingly scandalous and high school level, especially by Charles Ellis playing butter-loving sheriff Ron Delboys. Putting himself in more trouble, even the loose killer could have put him on. The clumsy sheriff Delboys ends with his head bursting coffee spiked, as well as nearly burned alive, after being dismembered. The only reason he was not was because he seemed to have dreamed of everything while under the influence of some strong, nameless drug. <br /> <br /> There is a strange sequence of dreams in the film, suggesting that a number of respected members of the community are members of the Witches Cult which is responsible for the murders of the brotherhoods. The film does not bother to explain whether the dream, which the drugged Sheriff Delboys had, was a dream or really a real experience on their part, dropping the whole thing as if it had been cut from the movie! Leaving the hospital and guarding the collage brother's house while chewing on a bag full of McDonald cheeseburgers, Sheriff Delboys finally came face to face with the killer. Shefiff Delboys discovers that he not only knows who he is but is also willing to let the killer escape. <br /> <br /> The first direct movie for video shows. Not just anyone would have the right mind to be crazy enough to pay admission, at least with the video you can record. Thank God, see this disaster, but no movie owner would dare touch him onscreen without the danger that the outraged patrons, in a justifiable demonstration of righteous indignation, destroy the place!
