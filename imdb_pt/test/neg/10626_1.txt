Great spoiler here: this movie is B! THE! D! But have fun, it's very good. Bugged is the kind of movie you can not believe that exists, with dialogue, plot and direction so inadequately handled that Uncle Ned's Carlsbad Cavern home video looks like an IMAX experience. . Since it's a Troma movie, there's a lot of coarse stuff on the tap, but it's even dumber than normal. Most of the production money seems to have been used to buy sodas and sandwiches for the cast and crew. The brilliant dialogue is best summed up in the immortal: "% @ # $! What was that?" which only loses to the people who shouted, "Now, what?" <br /> <br /> Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to Ronald Armstrong, the writer / director. When one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper / termite / termite thing, Armstrong makes the survivors immediately make time with the fluffy, but idiot like a doorknob, "Divine." While she is being hit, Divine is cooking a large steaming pot of a mixture of oatmeal / oatmeal on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling dead from the smoke! <br /> <br /> Murderous insects are as scary as the pi√±atas, which they look very much like. The effects used to move them include dragging them across the tile floors quickly, with the legs dragging them back. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie would probably have been the blast of the house, but they were out of money or never had one, so instead of even seeing a miniature catch fire, they just let the screen go black (Eat Your Heart In ILM). <br /> <br /> The cast is practically all black. How can the NAACP constantly censor something really funny like Amos and Andy (which portrays characters certainly no less similar than those in 99% of all white comedy shows), but does not say anything about something like Bugged. Oh, well, it's best that they do not know how demeaning this film is for all involved (as if it were touched by any ethnic group, frankly). Before putting kabosh on Bugged, join some friends and get ready for Plan 9 of the Bug Exterminator movies.
