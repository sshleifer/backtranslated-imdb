They call this movie "horror of the euro trash". <br /> <br /> Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it's "euro". Garbage? Oh, yes, it's rubbish, all right. <br /> <br /> You know you're making a great movie when, right at the beginning, the DVD gives you a text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. Expect crackling, strange cuts and the film does not fit the screen. Also, there is the sound - at first I thought I was watching a dubbed movie. Then, watching the lips carefully, I realized that, no, it is that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of sync. The plot itself is rather goofy-an old, disfigured woman named Dr. Bannister. kills a scientist for his youthful formula. I'm not giving too much, because when you see the "old woman" it's pretty obvious that she's under a layer of coarse and poorly applied makeup. Anyone with a little common sense, seeing the false old age, knows what comes next. <br /> <br /> Yes, the "old woman" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman - complete with make-up for the face and a long hair wig! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say that the old woman is disfigured, I mean that she has corns on her face. The film does not try to explain how the corn flakes got there. By the way, there is no attempt to explain anything related to any of the characters. They are never developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /> <br /> The two cops chasing our anti-heroine simply wander, seemingly confused by the simplest clues. The murdered scientist was working on a young serum, the old woman disappeared and we kept running for a young woman - how do these pieces fit together? What does all this mean?! One of the cops sweats a lot and patted his face with a cloth. The other smokes a pipe. That's pretty much all we have in terms of character. <br /> <br /> Dr. Bannister (the old woman, now a beautiful) walks around wearing strange outfits and then pulling them out so we can see her flesh. She has cases with men. She gets into a fight with a young girl in a nightgown. She's going to Geneva so we can see the lake there. She skies a little and takes off her wet clothes to reveal a strange beaded curtain bikini. She takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume striptease. <br /> <br /> The end? Well, without revealing anything, it's just a bizarre and complicated conclusion that makes as little sense as the rest of the image. It's the kind of thing a writer invents when the director wakes him up at 4 in the morning and says, "Hurry! We need an ending to our movie! What happens next?" <br /> <br /> The writer mutters something awake, and the director runs along. <br /> <br /> What is good about this movie? Some of the songs are exaggerated and fun. That classic 60's organ music that's so cheesy enough to make you laugh out loud. There are some strange scenes of seduction, bizarre dialogues, goofy moments. <br /> <br /> It's too close to being so bad, it's good. I was able to watch it from start to finish without tearing out my eyes or sobbing. I think that's praise.
