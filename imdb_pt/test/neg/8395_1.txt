This movie is honestly the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. this is slow, less boring plot. the director of photography deserved to be shot. There were several aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared being strangely camp. He laughed many laughs, but also many yawns. Do not watch with anyone, anytime, anywhere. If you hate someone, I recommend that they buy or rent it. great waste of time and money. Thank you Gus Van Sant ... no. I can not think of anything else to say except never see this movie, it'll make you want to jump off a cliff. I hope Gus and his comrades read this comment before it's too late and he does a follow-up or some other catastrophe with what looked like being filmed with a camera phone.
