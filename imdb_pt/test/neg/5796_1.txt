Unfortunately, this movie had potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. I do not think I've ever seen any movie where all the scenes end up falling, like it happened here. Besides, I do not think I've ever seen a "drugged" sex comedy that did not offer at least a laugh, but that whirlwind of pain provided nothing but moaning and sadness. The last time I was surprised at how funny a comedy could be was with the horrible "Great Mama's House". Scene after scene, these films will turn your brain into jelly. Silly and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer. An absolute failure at the bottom of the pit.
