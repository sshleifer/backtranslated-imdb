This movie is really that bad, and I'm usually a sucker for bad movies, but that was awesome. Seeing this is like OD'ing in pure suck. Now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have gone through all the titles of Full Moon and Troma, all the Edward D. Wood Jr. movies, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun and straight to DVD movies of faded action men. You may have even seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake and a wide range of movies that the MST3K covered, but in its original form. But you do not know the really horrible movie until you see Darkhunters. And if you have not, you should not. Do not bother yourself. This film is not only incredibly poorly written, directed, filmed, edited, rendered and sprinkled on cheap after effects. First of all, it's a pretentious mess. But it's no good, Greenaway or Lynch style pretentious or hilariously confused in a fashion type of Ittenbach or early Waters. It's the kind of pretense that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks he invented something incredibly clever. More or less like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Only that man looks like a damn messiah when compared to this train (and this coming from an ominant Shaymalan). It's also annoying. It's not annoying, which is for sure, if the movie will reward your patience. Darkhunters does not do such a thing. It's annoying in a "Oh my fu (King God, if I see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio suggestion I'm going to fu (King kill me!") - Kind of way. > Anyone who claims to like this movie is a bold liar and anyone who claims that this movie is complex or deep knows how his mother is in bed.
