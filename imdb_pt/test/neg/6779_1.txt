The problem with this and all the Vietnam War films is that they are very biased. Anti-war films disregard the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while pro-war films ignore the fact that many of the soldiers actually committed such atrocities. This movie sucks. It's time for a movie that is neither pro-war nor antiwar, neither liberal nor conservative, but COMPLETELY UNBIASED.
