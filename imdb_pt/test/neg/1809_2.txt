A television version of the Heart of Darkness seemed a good way of adding more details to the book, well, that was the wrong assumption. The film made it even worse. I was very disappointed with almost everything in the movie. I hoped the film could help put together the parts of the book that I did not understand, but that did not happen. It still left me confused and hanged. It's one of those movies that makes it feel more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. Not exactly anyone's cup of tea. To begin with, Nicolas Roeg must have been very desperate when he decided he wanted to accomplish the task of turning the already tedious book into a film. . It is a guaranteed loss. It's like getting into a knife fight, but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter. The person without a knife will lose; and in case, the person without knifeless was Roeg. Everything I've heard about the movie is bad stuff, and the movie deserves these bad things to be said about it. While watching the movie, I got the impression that the people who made the film just slid over the book to get the key points. <br /> <br /> In addition, although the film followed the book's main line, it left out some details, and also changed the ending. I'm not a fan of that. Roeg set aside when Marlow and his team found the Russian seamen's camp and found the book in that camp. He also did not show when in the camp they came across the sign that read, "Wood for you. Hurry up, come with caution" (Conrad 110). Also, at the end of the book, Kurtz dies in the boat, not in the inner station. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Nicolas Roeg did a good thing while making his film; he managed to hire some decent actors to play in the film. For example, he acquired Tim Roth and John Malkovich, who later came to have successful careers. In doing so, he added a little something to the horrible movie. Also, although I'm ripping your book apart, I have a little respect for it, because it takes a lot of courage to try to face The Heart of Darkness. It's not exactly the easiest novel to portray in a movie. Twus a brave effort, though! In conclusion, if for some reason someone really wants to watch this movie, I suggest reading Heart of Darkness first. That way, you'll get all the scenes that were left out of the movie and you will not be completely lost when watching it. But I really suggest you do not read the book and that you really do not watch the movie; both will be a complete waste of time. Trust me. I was forced to do both by my English teacher and now I wish the book and the film did not exist. If the book or movie is chased, good luck!
