This film is anything but the true story of Phoolan Devi. The claims of director Shekhar Kapoor are contradicted by the fact that he made the entire film without even meeting Phoolan Devi, in whose life this movie should be based! The excuse is that meeting the woman would have interfered with the story's design! The film misses the opportunity to sensitize society about the suffering of low-caste women in Indian society and ends up as a stereotype portraying Phoolan Devi as an angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder, this Shekhar Kapoor's film was successful in the West as it catered to its non-Bollywood tastes!
