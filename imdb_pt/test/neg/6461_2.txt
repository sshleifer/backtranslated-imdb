This show is incredible and we are really enjoying it. Set in Alaska, I do not agree with homosexual content on tonight's show. I feel like you're pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. It's one thing to have a New Yorker struggling in wild Alaska, but trying to turn the Alaskan city into New York? This is a good show on delicate women and real Alaskan men and bring a same sex couple to the mix is ​​throwing off the balance. Alaskan must be portrayed as a man and New York as a woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you guys are doing. We can not have a good show without the imbalance of nature.
