I should have known better ... the clues were all over IMDB.com. This film was written and directed by the same guy who has no history. The cast is a lot of unknowns with the possible exception of Joe Estevez, who seems to specialize in bad movies. Etc. Suffice it to say that I see no reason why anyone would want to see this horrible, amateur attempt to make movies. Turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies. Nuff said.
