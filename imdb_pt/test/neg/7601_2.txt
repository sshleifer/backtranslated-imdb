No wonder many of us hate classical music; And what should children think? With "educational" PR like this, serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. Children know when they are being convinced, and this is no exception; Why can not someone make a movie about classical music for kids? I must admit, I appreciated the actor who played Beethoven, he took the role with enthusiasm and a great balance between the poignant and humorous aspects of Beethoven's character; he obviously did his research. Otherwise, this is a third version of the old ABC Afterschool Special format, with none of the occasional charm these short films had. Sorry for the speech, but this is an important subject for young people to meet, and it could have been well done; I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? Either way, kids are smarter than you think, guys ... <br /> <br /> Medtner
