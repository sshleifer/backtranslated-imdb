Because I would never have seen this movie until the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie, I could not understand more than about 15% (the chic English couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, none with a real point, with just a few of the most unlucky and lifeless people I could have imagined and a load of foul language. He did not find it funny, he did not find it amusing, he did not find any sense in it. 4/10
