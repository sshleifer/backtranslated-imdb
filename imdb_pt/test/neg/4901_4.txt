Inspired by a true story tale is full of 1970s sentiment, but is disjointed in the narration. This is the tale of a black college swimmer who winds up in Phillie at a recreation center in a bad neighborhood and somehow rides a swimming team. The movie stumbles blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, as our hero, takes the kids to the pool. This becomes more engaging, though it still does somersaults. There's a good story about it and it's clear why Howard and Bernie Mac joined in, but the script is bad and most of the direction seems to want to make it look something different instead of making us feel something about the story. <br /> <br /> It's not the disaster that some comments made out to be, it suffers from all the actual stories of the recent sport-Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., who at least knew that you have to at least work with the story to make a movie instead of just letting the audience suffer because "it's true."
