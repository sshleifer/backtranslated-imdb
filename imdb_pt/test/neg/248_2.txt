I saw this at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and even this show could not really make this movie bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course, you expect terrible special effects with such an old movie, but I've seen better silences. The plot has huge gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are in certain scenes. The cameraman apparently does not know what a tripod is, and has drank a lot of coffee, or something harder, perhaps, because the camera is ALWAYS stirring. I could not even follow the plot, but suffice it to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: I saw "Epic Movie" a while back and I have decided to give this movie a 2. It is NOT the worst movie I have ever seen anymore!
