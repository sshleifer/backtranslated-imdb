I can appreciate the satire that goes against my own points of view, but it must be witty and well placed. This movie is ... how can I explain this? He makes no attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. In fact, it's hardly horror. Dead soldiers come to life, but are not interested in brains, only in voting booths. Because? It signals an endless stream of the most stupid, banal and swollen maddening "bad president, bad conservatives, bad republicans." What a piece of self-indulgent, messy and extravagant swine this was. <br /> <br /> Even if they agree with the "points" of the episode, only the stupidest of the liberals would say that they liked to watch it. So again, assigning a degree of stupidity to the crazed, rabid, hostile, anti-social, anti-something-middle-normal liberal spectrum is a difficult task in itself. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a liberal convention.
