In 1904, Tangier, a wealthy American and her two children, are kidnapped by Berbers, desert murderer pirates who despise the Moroccan government, and in doing so they kidnap the "American pestilence" that attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt. The fictional historical epic is less a great adventure than a peculiar and rather exhausting setback to the sheikh films of the 1940s (with a bit of "The King and I" interposed, in addition). Portraying the overblown, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his arrogant, arrogant captive, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two completely different films (neither of them seems to know how far to take their characters' camp elements and dialogues, and both seems singularly without proper direction). The various cuts (and anonymous) and decapitations that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the great scenes of action become blurred, noisy assemblages of violence swept by sand on horseback. The positives: A soundtrack highly praised by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar nominee, but a loser of the film of John Williams, "Jaws"), filming in locations and cinematography. * 1/2 of ****
