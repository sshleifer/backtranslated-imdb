the acting is good. That makes the positives out of the way! SOSN is superficial and superficial. Almost all the characters are middle class and English. Gays are portrayed as fickle sex predators, with the goal of using children in their empty lives. This movie can only appeal to people who know health and get less satisfaction. There is no time to get involved with the characters and has a result that you do not really care about them, Catherine Tate at the height of her comic fame star as a woman seeking divorce from her husband and on screen for almost the same time that her sketches of Nana could not convince, however, if she had said "what a freedom of life" I would have agreed <br /> <br /> I'd rather take a walk in the park, not clever junk!
