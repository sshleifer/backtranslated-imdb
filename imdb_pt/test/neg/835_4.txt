Any weapon can play (2 outta 5 stars) Totally routine "spaghetti western" starring that guy who used to play "Kookie" on "77 Sunset Strip". The plot is a complicated absurdity over some stolen gold coins and several dubiously motivated gunslingers trying to track him. This is one of those "laid back" Westerns ... which means a lot of "comedy" attempts ... and some really atrocious songs during most action sequences (you might say this is not Ennio Morricone's work). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter named "Strange" ... but he does not make much impression ... he just does not have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero, who are able to do a lot with a low-density character. The ending is a complete tribute / parody of the ending of "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" ... though it's a little fun enough to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the film is the first 5 minutes ... which features standardized actors after Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and another person (he's supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very clear ...) who are confronted by strange . It's a fun joke for Sergio Leone fans and western spaghetti aficionados ... but I guess no one else would see the point.
