I decided to watch this movie to fall asleep. It kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was quite bland. <br /> <br /> The performance was good. I do not think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as believable as a killer on the other side of the hill can be. The dialogue in this film does not offer many opportunities for these actors to show their full potential, but they still shine. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint for the viewers. Even the weather improved the mood of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The flaws of this film lie in the development of the story. The plot with the mafia against Blackbird does not get enough attention. The plot for Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI seems to work faster here. Is there paperwork for all these processes? Is it really so easy to dig up your brother's body from the grave, burn the corpse and identify him as you? There are a lot of loops in the plot for me to give this movie something bigger than a 4 out of 10. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they are really bored and smoked some very good herb. Even though WoW is under maintenance, look for something better to do than watch this movie.
