If you're in the mood for a really bad porn, without good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, make sure you spend time watching everything but that. The acting is of low quality. The "plot" is of low quality. They try hard, and all the time I was waiting for the good scene that could make the movie worth watching. No. Keep the cable scrambled.
