What a silly movie. While it looks good, it does not make much sense. On the one hand, the film suggests that Juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. On the other hand, she has an obsession that is in the worst Victorian romance of the wronged woman, and that seems like a kind of mental problem, like Miss Havesham in a castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth had not been able to overcome Essex's sexual attraction.
