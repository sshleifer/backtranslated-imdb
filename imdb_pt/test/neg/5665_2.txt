Because of boredom and great curiosity, I decided to check out this show today, since my four-year-old niece loves it. I should have known it was a show that only a four-year-old could enjoy. The show was really bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the show was not funny. The laughing tune rang at the most inappropriate times, which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes were funny. The trail of laughter fired at some point when the only boy who is the videographer said "I'm going to polish my lens." How the hell is this funny? The parts in him (like the drums) that should have been funny were just idiots to those over 11. <br /> <br /> Now, I get the feeling that four-year-olds are not the target audience. . However, since I have a four-year-old niece watching, this sort of thing worried me while I was watching: It does not show very good behavior. In the episode I was watching, he shows Sam stealing Carly's sandwich and pushing her to the floor, just so Carly can get up and do the same thing back to her. I would not want to see my niece acting so badly. I also do not like the idea of ​​two girls having a web show where they give out personal information ... If this were real, there would be freaks all over her. <br /> <br /> This show will probably be good and funny for someone who is eleven or younger, but anyone older than this, just stay away from it. I'll give these two stars since I think I can see how this can be funny for a child.
