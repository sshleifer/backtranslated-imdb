Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because he is arguably all these things. It takes a real genius to scare generations of moviegoers from bathing and wearing ties around their necks. Saboteur, however, is not creative or prolific at all. Instead, Hitchcock set out with the intention of creating a film to gather American Pride, a certain title of arms, to support the title of our troops, which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely underestimated other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, credible dialogue, and a flowing and running storyline. Typically Hitchcock does very well with espionage films, only a few years before reaching the cinematic grandeur with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but apparently missed the step in the creation of the Saboteur and merely recycled the same story lines both of their previous excursions readily provided. Without going into too much depth here is a list of some of the main problems of this film: 1. Despite having his face stuck in every newspaper in America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind. <br /> <br /> 2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia do not want to run to the door because the bad guys can grab them and tell the party they're "porta-nailers". Of course, what prevents the spies from picking them up and saying this at any time during the night? Also, does anyone need to be reminded that Kane is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when can a fan belt cut cuffs? <br /> <br /> 4. No one recognizes you ... your face is in EVERY JOURNAL !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The spies reach Kane in the ghost town and assume that he is the man Freeman sent to work with them ... should not he have some kind of credential? I know spies do not run around with badges and photo identities, but with a secret handshake, maybe? <br /> <br /> 6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman's house, yet it seems no one recognizes this guy. <br /> <br /> 7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe in Kane without evidence? They do not even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene just disappears and we are forced to assume that everything is now kosher. <br /> <br /> 8. When the police check out the Carnival Caravan, how do you know that Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed that Kane's story, of course, would not have reported his missing daughter, kidnapped or, more importantly, that he ran into Kane. Why does not this movie employ logic? <br /> <br /> This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot does not make sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists to their homes and cars every day because it's not a big deal. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.
