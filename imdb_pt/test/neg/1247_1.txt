I rented this movie hoping it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. What I got was a kind of documentary look at a average life of guys who happened to be really good at cards. I want to see the romance with your wife? NO I want to see everything that has happened in this guy's life except poker? DO NOT. Well, that's what you get out of this movie. The acting is good for such a cheap piece of crap. The movie never tries to break the mold or do anything unique. Sleep simply walks the script. The ending is disappointing and never looks deep into Ungar's mind. Instead, focus on what was already obvious. He was a junkie gambler, with an average life not unlike any in Las Vegas. The film focuses on aspects of your life that were extraordinary to the UN, not extraordinary. The poker scenes throughout the film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. Ungar's achievements of winning the WSOP 3 times seem like life after thoughts. A 10-year-old could do a better job directing this movie ... or maybe it was the script suck from the start that condemned this joke of a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie movie about the Rounders game of chance. At least you have style.
