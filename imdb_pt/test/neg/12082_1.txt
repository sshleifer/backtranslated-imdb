Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this horrible "woman image" and I mean it in the worst possible way. The problem is that it might have been so good if they had left out the Jane Eyre stuff and got the much more interesting scenes involving the Spanish / Portuguese Jews in the early 19th century in London. When the music on the soundtrack is better than the movie, you know you're in trouble. When you advance the video because you do not support the movie, just to make sure you do not miss anything, you're in for an even worse problem. This movie will end up in the romance channel where it belongs.
