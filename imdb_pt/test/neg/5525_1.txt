This is so bad it's watchable. <br /> <br /> The plot deals with a crew of gray spaceship that is passing by a seemingly abandoned Russian ship. In the empty expanse of space, the two vessels accidentally collide (!) - and the 'Alien'-esque fun follows as a cyborg of the Russian ship threatens our crew. <br /> <br /> The interiors of the spacecraft are clearly a doll factory set (metal walkways, boilers, tubing). In this totally unconvincing scenario, 'Kody', 'Snake' and the rest of our hero crew grimace, grunting, running and repeatedly and repeatedly busting their rifles without firing them. <br /> <br /> The gafes of continuity are what set this movie, and they are nothing short of amazing: <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. The rifles are cracked. A cigar is more time being smoked. The rifles are put back on, just to be sure. The contents of a bottle increase when you drink it. <br /> <br /> The film advances through the usual cliches through the intense ham effect, the excellent camera work and the quality of Ed Wood until the climax of the showdown.
