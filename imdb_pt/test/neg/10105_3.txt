OK, the box looks interesting, the opening has good music and it's kind of original, so everything is OK. But when the movie starts ... well, it's not my first videoville movie, I watched Ghost Lake, and it's very similar to this movie, except it's even worse here. The story at first seemed interesting, but the whole movie looks like a movie filmed by a group of college students, with special effects that make me laugh, the blood looks like a mixture of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demonic face seems to have been made with a program that I could buy at my local computer store. The whole film is filmed in the daytime (very good for a movie that is supposed to be horror) and there is no gore (only one scene and it looks so homely and not credible) and almost bloodless (can be considered a big thing considering the blood show) and 1 demon for the entire movie. The story is going nowhere, it gives the impression that it never starts, there are so many useless scenes made just to give the movie the average length of time (when the demon turns the guy around in the dogs for about 4 minutes ...) more slow things. Well let's just say that this film is from the Z series and very poor. Every cool idea got lost and you got a bad movie. It annoyed my whole time and I'm not the guy who gets bored very easily with horror movie, man I even like home of the dead and alone in the dark of Uwe Boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst directors but here looks a lot like some guys who want to make a movie for fun. In addition, for us French speaker (difficult I understand English I prefer to watch movie in my native language) there the usual bad translation videoville. In normal movie you can barely see that it is not the actor talking (you have to check on the lips etc) here you just have to listen and you know it. Very tacky
