The type B movies of the 1950s, which were fun and entertaining, is what Predator Island pays homage to. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is set on an island called with a Hell's Beacon lighthouse, which is inhabited only by the couple that takes care of the lighthouse. In the typical 1950s science fiction fashion, after half a dozen youngsters hit their boat on the island's rocky coast, hideous creatures from outer space invade the island after a meteor hits nearby. The creatures begin to inhabit the bodies of their victims and devour them. Many evil and lame returns are the main form of dialogue in this film. It's so corny that you just have to laugh sometimes. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid but in a fun way, then this fits into the design. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I appeared in the movie as a corpse in the far background of the final scene. During filming, they needed about 50 extras, but about 300 people attended the opportunity. They eventually used almost 200 of them.
