IT'S OK. First, I just wanted to check if this movie has an average rating below or exactly -1. But 5.9. This is more than any process of the killers -, -. This made me curious about what people wrote here ... which in the end made me create an account to give my 2 real cents in this "illusion pit" I find here. <br /> <br /> How dare you even MENTION this movie in the same sentences as for example Seven? The only thing they have in common is that they show several crime scenes. It is. And "Best Thriller of 1999!" ? Did you watch another movie this year? Or some other movie in your life? 1999 is not a year that people are reminded by RESURRECTION ... what about real MOVIES like 8mm, Eyes Closed, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (They are actually more of a "thriller" than this could be ..). The resurrection does not even deserve to be dedicated to ONE SECOND OF 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you can not be serious. I watched that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of hers. A "Great Movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... that I had not seen yet? Hmm ... Well, first look at the covers: OK, nothing special. In the second glimpse you do not need to have supernatural powers to be aware that they simply mirrored Lambert's head, cut off the nose and that, then they created a negative pattern on top of it, to get the killer's picture in COVERAGE. You might even think they had some apprentice eat a gallon of marshmallows just to label that scary mouth (booooh! -...) .. whatever. It turned out and the plot begins with "It's raining in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Come on, a six-year-old could have made that stretch seem more exciting. Now, with this huge excitement coming from the fantastic presentation of the movies, you absolutely want to start watching. Because it can not be that bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. This assumption of mine was wrong. With "proven wrong" I mean it was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst acting imaginable ever known to mankind (every actor, but the tops are the "I can do 1-Liners!" Police chief, Prudhommes Wife __ actually a better detective than Prudhomme when she recombines several incidents for a tip still ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN in the case !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme itself) presenting a squadron of false and inhuman feelings, logical errors in a minute-circuit, light-years, absurd conclusions that, in my view, represent an insult to any thinking human being, and last, but not least, to a videographer who was obviously a hyperventilating kangaroo. Oh well, and if you do not completely turn off your brains (these are not premises to watch it), then you must know who is who and what is after max. 30 minutes, simply because you know any scene after the first. This is exciting. Exciting because this movie almost makes you think you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: This is by far the worst movie I remember. Trust me, I've seen many horrible movies that somehow were at least just bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. Resurrection, however, is the best example of how to fail in every possible way. It was so bad that, after shocking at its unimaginable quality, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the team's daring to publish such an extraordinary film strip. Good thing for Lambert he was in Highlander: Endgame a year later so he can be forgiven. ; ^ Either way, I recommend watching this movie EVERYONE. In the end, we had a lot of fun watching: ^ D. I assure you, once you've fully watched the Resurrection (be brave, you can do that!), You'll love the acting level on any given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Or just go see Highlander one more time ... that's what I'm going to do.
