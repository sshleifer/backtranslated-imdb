I hate guns and never killed anyone, but when up to half of the events that happen in Shuttle happen to you or someone close to you and you find a weapon, YOU SHOOT YOUR ATTACKER. 3 TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes the pulse stop at them and increase in you. I think even God would say, "Good call." In a very 'Hostel' type movie, but more realistic? how could this really happen to someone, well, if you're a very young woman, is that ?? 'Shuttle' was a decent movie, albeit on the longer side. Some good shocks (always call AAA even just to change a tire), basically just a surprise but for the most part, you could see things coming. And in addition to the typical "tie it up" instead of the shot previously mentioned, the most annoying part was the revelation for closing one best friend to another. Going through it, it's nice for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling alone from Mexico (wow, that's original) and one has lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious sign language scene, they enter a "very good to be true" on a half-price tour. Athletes clich√©s, previously introduced, go their way on the space shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's stunt double in 'Speed'. From here, it's obvious what happens (I mentioned it was a 'Hostel' tip), but still, I did not find it too horrible, but nothing spectacular. However, it would have served the public better with about 15 to 20 minutes erased, I would recommend it if you had almost 2 hours to kill and you were in a sickly horror.
