Everyone has commented on the obvious fact that the first comments were obviously from people who had an interest in the film or had friends / family members who were interested in the film, and that's fine - if I had made a film, everything from my family and friends would be there praising also. In all honesty, there are some good things along with the bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, bad things far outweigh good. Good: The general plot was slightly interesting. The music was overall very good. Several of the songs (when you could hear them) were cool. The only musical problems I had were: # 1) the first suspense scene with some kind of quiet instrumental music (it really seemed to take the suspense out), # 2) the song that was being played when the main characters went to a party outdoors. a friend's house and # 3) the songs that were good were very quiet, especially when a heavy metal song played in the background while Danny Trejo hung a man (it sounded like a really cool song but should have left the scene when Danny Trejo was left with thrush. Now for the really bad stuff: the script was atrocious. I mean, HORRIBLE. I saw a softer dialogue in a Star Wars movie. Advice for a writer's part-time writer and a full-time movie fan: When you write the dialogue, ask yourself, "Is this something people would actually say?" Honestly, the script was laughable. I want to beat acting, but with that kind of writing, it's hard to know if they have talent or not. The slightly interesting plot was seriously hampered by low-quality dialogue. I know it was low budget, but words do not cost money - if you have a good script, even competent semi- actors can do it. This movie also does not look like it, but we hope the director has a second chance to make a better movie.
