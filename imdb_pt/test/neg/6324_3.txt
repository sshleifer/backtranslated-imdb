Ok, where to start. I can not believe how many good reviews I read here. I watched this (year 2004) and I had to fight not to hit the stop button, I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I read. After watching him, I felt it was my duty to let the world know that. First of all, the movie looks like it will never begin, the plot does not occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends, leaving the viewer thinking, 'When will this start?' a 'revenge movie' because revenge does not even begin until more than half of the movie has already passed. Also, the movie tries to make you believe this is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I'm sorry to show rural roads dusty half the film and a letter pie on a plate did not convince me of it, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. So, anyway, add that over the random homoerotic subtext and you'll have a bad movie (I have nothing against gays, there was no need for that). The only good part was the first chase scene, good direction considering it was 1979, and another good part is how it kills the last guy. So basically I recommend that you watch the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes and you will have so much more fun than if you sat through all these things in the middle, which could lead you to pluck your own eyes. Do not say I did not warn you.
