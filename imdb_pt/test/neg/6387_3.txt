An absolutely disconcerting western with flash-forward sequences in an asylum, South of Hell Mountain was one of the first films produced by the Schlockmeisters at Cannon Film. Co-directed by William Sachs, who later turned in fan favorites like The Incredible Melted Man and Galaxin, the film tells the story of a trio of gold robbers who come across a booth occupied by two women who hide some untrue secrets it's worth discovering. The cast (most never made another film) tries bravely, but is hampered by the script, which generally does not make sense. Asylum scenes are edited with little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. Ultimately, it's a lot of talk and little else.
