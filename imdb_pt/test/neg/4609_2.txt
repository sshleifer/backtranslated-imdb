Be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving "over sexed jocks". There is nothing redeeming about Carrie 2. The plot is absurd, the acting is terrible, and the ending is very predictable. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting a masterpiece, but I was hoping to have fun. . I was not. The only way I could rationalize watching this movie was because I was at a relative's house while I waited for my car to be repaired. Unless in the same situation stay well away from this movie.
