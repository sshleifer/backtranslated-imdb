Greedy baron of the land in the tiny town of Prairie City in the west of the country wants all the farmers on their land to use intimidation tactics and criminal fires to get them to leave; It seems that the city is swimming on top of the oil, and when a Swedish farmer refuses to leave, he is killed by the baron's rented weapon. The farmer's sailor's son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he is up against and trying to gather the rest of the villagers to fight. Another lawless story in the West, with everyone under the villain's thumb (which naturally holds all cards). Derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch, with a long wait before our stoic hero finally get his fur up. Sterling Swedish's Swedish accent is a big problem, although he has a strong, friendly presence on screen and almost makes the image worth it. Director Joseph H. Lewis plays most scenes rigidly, like a Western TV, and Gerald Fried's heavy score does not help, though Ray Rennahan's rich black-and-white cinematography is excellent. An independent production released by United Artists, the film has a bizarre beginning (beginning with scenes from the end, followed by scenes from the middle of the film), but has a certain power of needle that certainly leaves the viewer on Hayden's side. ** in ****
