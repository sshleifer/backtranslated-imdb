I thought of this movie when I watched pluto nash ... why ... because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot, this movie made years before but probably written by a screenwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that . ..Whoa ... AVOID ALL THE COSTS even to honor the great late Andy Kaufman it's hard to do here ... find another movie or just watch the reruns of taxis on latenight television ... your character latka gravas is much more lovely ... TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
