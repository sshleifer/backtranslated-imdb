Crazy Six is ​​torture, it must be Albert Pyun's worst movie. Even Blast and Ticker are better! I can not believe how boring this movie is! How was this clear? I saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing I remember is how bad it was. This is not good bad movie, it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (½ out of *****)
