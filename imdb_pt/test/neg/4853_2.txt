This game is a genre of games that have tried to take advantage of the whole Myst-inspired trend - go around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but I will continue with the acting itself, which is just a little better. If you are looking for a convincing performance of any character, you will not find it here, but it pays to buy this game just to witness the truly hilarious performance of Christopher Walken. His acting is so horrible in this game that it seems like he's imitating someone who happens to be playing for him. He is a caricature of himself. <br /> <br /> So buy this game if you are a masochist, a Walken fan, or simply want to hear the F word a lot.
