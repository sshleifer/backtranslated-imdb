Barney is that dumb dinosaur who (unfortunately) did not die out with the other dinosaurs many thousands of years ago. Instead, he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100% useless and / or extremely dangerous: this is "STRANGE IS YOUR FRIENDS YOU DID NOT FIND!" The reason why I say he is evil? Well, on YouTube, there's a video of a Barney song about toy balls. When it's thrown back, it comes out as "EVERYONE CALLS ALL TO STICK YOU! LET'S BE THE KNOCKERS!". Do not believe me? See for yourself! I also read in another review that they are reading PC folklore and fairy tales. Now that's just stupid with a capital S! I mean, really! Anyway, I do not recommend letting your kids watch this filth as it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends (as I said before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food, being an individual is taboo , magic can solve all your problems and lots of other ridiculous crap.
