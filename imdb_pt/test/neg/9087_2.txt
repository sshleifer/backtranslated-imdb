Whoever has compared this to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew what he was talking about. He could also have compared it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "Kay Hoog" remembers Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow, quintessential man of mystery - and the first "Dark Knight" - was also thought to be a Kent Allard.) If someone were to first take Savage's first name and add Kent to him, you'd end up with Clark Kent, funny Hoog is not above stealing the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his robberies are often more blatant and less "charmingly mischievous" than Jones's). Unfortunately, this two-parter is a far cry from the subsequent series (of any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the earliest indications that something is wrong about the cinematic narrative is a scene in which the hopeless on horseback, literally breathing down the neck, simply watch Hoog escape from his claws in a hot air balloon. Why they do not bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many cinematic mysteries that haunt these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. Sure enough, this was one of the first serial series and as such should be cut a little off - but there are even limits to tolerance. (At one point, the hero's capture is performed not on the screen, but in the narration itself! Talk about cutting corners ...) Fritz Lang is one of the greatest filmmakers to make movies; unfortunately for those of us who most admire what he did, THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill to swallow ...
