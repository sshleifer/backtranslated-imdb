I can not believe I even wasted a NetFlix rent on this whole part of the CRAP. How long did it take to make this movie? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen dollars? I can spend a few hours with my Sony Camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous bit of bile, and it's even available on DVD! It's a very sad thing to think that classics like The Stepfather were not released on DVD, but this piece of steaming dung comes to the format. I hope that my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE will make the overall (already) pathetic rating of 2.5 be BELOW.
