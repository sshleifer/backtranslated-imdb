Dull acting, weak script ... the worst Spanish film in years ... I was attracted to the beauty (naked) Paz Vega, but as an actress she is useless, you can hardly understand what she is saying ... < <br /> <br /> About the story there is not much coherence to say ... we've heard of it before, but as this is a "modern Carmen", we found some changes: -The soldier French is now a Basque soldier. "Merimee is a character in the story. -Carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous "killer" and she can speak Basque fluently ... <br /> <br /> Can anyone understand this mess?
