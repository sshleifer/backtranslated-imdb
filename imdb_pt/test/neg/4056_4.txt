There's nothing wrong with softcore, but this is pretty clinical - a lot of nudity, but it's all fake (of course, it's always fake - it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it is all random nudity and bad acting of "lust" and sex with each other. <br /> <br /> Part of this is, of course, your personal preference. These women clearly have some body problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that overly plastique & leathery looks so great, you can see all of it here. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone's expectations are too high when looking for a movie title like this, but for many people, it would be a lot like looking at cyborgs fembots ... they almost seem but it's actually more scary.
