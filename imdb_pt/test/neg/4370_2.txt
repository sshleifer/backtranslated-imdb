One day I thought to myself ... what is the worst thing that can happen today? I answered myself with a simple, "Oh, this already happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on DVD. Well, what's there to say? The budget was not big enough to rent a police uniform, the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. There's a funny line that I remember and the acting is a lot worse than the first one. There seems to be no illumination in the "set" (the forest somewhere) and the killer clown known as Killjoy (which makes the Leprechaun look Exorcist) is less than spectacular. This time he is not portrayed by Angel Vargas and is completely changed as a character from a mad annoying clown to a different kind of crazy annoying clown who says a lot "kid." Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and a blade of grass ... lies this version of Killjoy. Somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of stones, is Killjoy 2. The evil is underestimated. This movie has no redeeming quality, except for the song at the end of the credits, which in turn gives some pleasure. Killjoy 2 is not even a movie but an exercise in tension. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered the worst movie I have ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ######### Let me describe one of the scenes of supernatural killing. A girl is locked in some wooden shed (maybe a little house?) When Killjoy peers through a hole. He has some small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at Spencer's Gifts) and he does something to them (maybe he'll get them!). Then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can not be written on IMDB). From what I've seen of this scene (not what's shown in the movie), the teeth went into the outside toilet and killed the girl in some interesting but undisclosed way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I were those teeth I would have run. Run away from Killjoy so he could never get his hands on me again. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy we'll have to endure. Even as a fan of movies that others would say are very bad, I think this "movie" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this movie and anything that reminded us of it would be destroyed. I give 2/10 - simply because the creators have managed to make the photos move.
