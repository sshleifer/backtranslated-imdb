When I saw that Icon was on TV, I was surprised. I know the first clue where I was going was the fact that I was on the Hallmark Channel - It has to be said - sorry !! I was hopeful when I saw that the FF itself was the Producer Exec, but quickly realized that the only real way the TV movie and book were similar was only in the names and characters' names. The TV plot was a ho-hum to say the least, but I agree that by itself the action was worth a 3 star. In my personal opinion, Mr. Swayze could have portrayed a valid Monk, however, I think to do justice to the film, it would have been a much longer film, and I do not think Hollywood itself would have gone into the plot of discredit by subterfuge. A case in point is the terrible film version of The Sum of All Fears - need I say more?
