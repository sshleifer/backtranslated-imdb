The Comic Strip featured actors from 'The Young One's' - a comedy based on eighties students. Features of the Comic Strip included parodies of westerns, 'The Famous 5', and The Professionals - all much funnier than that. Having said that Alexei Sayle puts on a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features good music of the time. 5/10
