This movie is fine, pretty silly and should be taken lightly. But what I can not stand are the innumerable heroes and the commentary of the boy's sensational ILEGALY near the end: "Look, they all look the same." Is not this by far passing the standards of good taste? I thought it was revolting, as were the heroic and altruistic acts of some of the people in this movie. I'm not saying this is not going to happen like this, but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach flip.
