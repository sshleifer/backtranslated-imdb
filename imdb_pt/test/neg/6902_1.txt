I can not find any redeeming value in this movie. It seems to be loosely based on the school of thought of the Lion King. Father is dead, son can not fill his shoes and tries to flee, etc, etc, etc. The only difference (besides being in a barn rather than a jungle) is that Barnyard try to "cheer things up" with the club type of music. They overcome everything by trying to be cool. The problem is that it really is not legal. It's like "that guy". Everyone knows at least one of the "guys" who are older and still hang out with the younger crowd in a futile attempt to cling to the youth. They try to be cool to fit in, but they really are not. This is the movie. <br /> <br /> But, hey, if you have money to burn and feel like paying someone to suck 90 minutes of your life, do not let me stop you.
