Steven Segal has made some terrible movies, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably one of the worst in movie history. Is someone running because they stole some money? Do some types of mercenaries kidnap a Supreme Court justice? Their goal is to swap the Judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money? Meanwhile, the Execution chamber is full of trapdoors and fake floors and looks like a scene from one of Cirque Du Soleil's circus shows. <br /> <br /> Then there is the question of arrest. Here, the Warden is a Homie, played by Tony Plana. All the prisoners have their colors and gang signs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating some guards while the Warden watches. What happens? The Director gives them a stern conversation. He can punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are many moments in this movie that are good for laughs. However, Nia Peeples looks very good, and Ja Rule tries to be an action hero. Lots of fun watching the prisoners all "do the right thing" and arm themselves so they can free the Supreme Court from their captors. Regardless of how bad the Half Past Dead might be, when you watch it, keep in mind that it's easily the best film that Steven Segal has starred in since Under Siege in 1992.
