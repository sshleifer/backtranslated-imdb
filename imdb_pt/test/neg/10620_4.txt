Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. A film produced and by and as a vehicle for a rock band in the middle of a comeback should not be classified as high on artistic merit, and in this case certainly does not. Indeed, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film itself, which, like the 70s rock lifestyle it attempts to portray, is characterized by overeating, drugs, and exaggerated mischief, but unfortunately it is not. almost as much fun. Using a script by Carl Dupre horrible enough to make a fellow screenwriter shrink, and squandering the talents of Edward Furlong, the only highlight of this piece of rock and roll was the music, most notably the elaborate re-creation of a KISS show in 1978.
