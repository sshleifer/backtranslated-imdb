I always think it would be nice if you could somehow get a preview on some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD before you buy them. That way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain degree of aggression when you feel so disappointed. <br /> <br /> "The Buddy Holly Story" is such a movie. <br /> I do not want to get into the characterizations or the holes in the plot, nor confuse the historical facts that this film ends, for I had already reached an agreement with them twenty years ago, when I began to watch it. <br /> <br /> I had recorded it on the old Beta machine (Monaural) in the early 80's, and enjoyed it so much, that it became a favorite played regularly. The best part, in my opinion, was the performance of Gary Busey as the young Buddy, and his almost perfect vocals and guitar playing. <br /> <br /> I longed for the day when I could attend ... STEREO ... and that's where disappointment comes in. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is (supposedly) remastered in audio and video, according to the shell information, but I'm afraid it left me sadly disappointed and looking at my watch, wishing it to end . <br /> <br /> The sound is obscure, bordering on the unintelligible, and so unprofessional that it made me crave the clarity of the crystals. vocals from my old Beta tape! <br /> <br /> Despite what you think of the pictures, or the plot, or the characters, the real drawing card here is the MUSIC ...... and if you can not hear the vocals because they are drowned by cymbals, or by supporting harmonies, or other environments, then there is not much left, is it there? <br /> <br /> I'm going to convert my old Beta version to (Mono) DVD for subsequent views, and put this one where it belongs, with the junk! <br /> <br /> "Extinction is the Rule, Survival is the Exception ..."
