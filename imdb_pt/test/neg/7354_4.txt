What could have been an extremely frightening thing turns out to be an incomprehensible and crazy movie that even the filmmakers themselves probably did not understand. If they had shown more of the satanic ritual or anything else, it could have been more frightening, but as it stands now, this is a waste of time and brain cells. Is anyone else getting sick of the whole "boy drawing scary pictures with wax crayon" thing? Could there be a bigger clich√© of horror? Probably not. I know, I know, it's from a different country, and it's very refined and sophisticated for me to understand, so I should not expect the "plot" to be fed by me, blah, blah, blah. Whatever. I still say the movie explodes.
