I've never been a big fan of Almodovar, but generally I always found something to enjoy in his films. Unfortunately, I had more difficulty finding something to enjoy in Hugs Parties, so I would normally think I would. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest failure in Broken Hugs is the characters and the lack of depth they exhibit. The film is essentially a love story, tragic and that wants to engage the viewer in their stories. I have encountered this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our 'hero' director / screenwriter, Mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young man he has just met. Your agent comes in when the woman comes out timidly. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our 'hero', the director / screenwriter, Mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young man he has just met. His agent walks in and rolls his eyes as the woman comes out timidly. Mateo babbled something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he left. Having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his 'true' love Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer could accept this idea except that the rest of the film never illustrates why Lena was the love of his life or any other . depth for your character or any other. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena the mistress of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the beginning, their union is very pathetic, since Martel is jealous of Lena, and Lena avoids the uncertainty of being alone, getting Martel much older. To jump ahead, Martel finances a movie for Mateo so he can accompany the star of the movie, Lena. Of course, without any history, Lena and Mateo fall in love. And, in Almodovar's world, it's really that simple. Mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Mateo falls in love with Lena, after it is revealed that he had a child with his agent after his love affair. Your child responds to this information with a laugh and an "Oh, well". Again, without depth, without understanding for any of these characters, everything happens. From the beginning of the film to the end, I had no depth of Matthew's emotion. It is flat, and does not act very differently from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The only scene I enjoyed was when movie producer Martel is watching a video recorded by his son under the guise of making a documentary of Matthew. There is a good moment for Martel watching obsessively while a lip reading confirms his worst fears. Later, Lena confronts Martel as he is watching the footage and speaks his part aloud matching the video of his lips as she speaks. Some very bright moments. Quite artificial, but still really fascinating. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for me, the rest of the film made me bored. I could not care less about these characters or their situations, so no amount of cleverness on Almodovar's part can compensate for this lack of depth. I think if you're a fan of his work, you're going to like this movie, but if you're like me in the middle, then you're going to think you're missing.
