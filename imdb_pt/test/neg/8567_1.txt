The film is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Nothing about it borders on scare ... not even near the edge of the scary ... <br /> <br /> It's just another case of "another teenage horror film" - a visa and you've seen them all. First minutes in the movie and you'll know what happens next. The worst part is that the script is more direct than the latest scary movie. It would have been better if it had been written in Spanish. And do not get me started with the inner jokes and jokes. <br /> <br /> Although I give a little credit for the special effects. But trust me, like any other Hollywood horror movie, CGI and special effects has little or no effect on the ability of a scary movie to scare. In fact, that makes it worse. Between Anita Briem's ​​cool face and the frightening location, there is not much to see in this movie.
