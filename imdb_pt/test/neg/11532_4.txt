I found this all a very predictable film. There was a good stunt work that gave a good degree of excitement and suspense to the story. However, a person had to suspend his credulity on several occasions for the plot to work. For example, although they lost the transfer cable, couplings and harness when the pilot manually retracted the landing gear, they fortunately found a spare on board the aircraft, complete with Caribbean. According to the plot, drilling a hole in the ceiling of the safe would disable the alarm system in the safe when the system was reactivated (I can not think why), according to Daltry, the battery drill would not be able to drill the ceiling safe , however, they only started to have a complete hydraulic drill with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take-off points in the hydraulic system of airplanes located above the vault. Because the airplane has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how this can be done without affecting the control systems or at least setting the hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. Accepting this because of the plot, it takes several minutes to drill a small hole in the top of the safe (the voltage will be able to drill before the FED gets there to check the false alarm), but from the moment the safe The door closed, and before the FEDs had walked a few yards to the second security door, they had opened a squire's hole in the vault's roof, big enough for them to pass. One can accept all the theses and other inconsistencies because of a good wire, but what spoiled the film for me was when what seems to have been an effort by screenwriters to discuss what was until then a fairly predictable end, they killed the two heroes (if anyone can refer to pots as hero) Ketchum & Brooks one was shot and thrown from a 747 to 10,000 feet the other wiliest sliding by the cable between the two planes the villain Daltry with one hand manages to loose the cable carrying the weight of an adult man with the air pressure of several hundred miles an hour pressing him and dropping him to death. And yet, in the following sequence, these two, without any kind of explanation (however tenuous or implausible), survived miraculously at 10,000 feet and had time to create an elaborate farce to get the money. The only comment about survival was for Sophie that her brother is a bad shot. Do not expect an Oscar nomination for this one.
