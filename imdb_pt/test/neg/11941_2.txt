Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about a tense chef played by Zeta-Jones, who ends up carrying it to her niece when her sister is killed in a car accident. While she is taking care of family matters, she is replaced by Eckhart. <br /> <br /> A bland tale, no chemistry among the leaders (she's a dead fish and he's fine, but not much of anything). Watching this, I was wondering why anyone would want to see this, since the Zeta-Jones character is so unpleasant. Come on, she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best she does is cooking for her therapist or talking about food. Ugh I will not use any of the countless puns that come to mind. I could not finish.
