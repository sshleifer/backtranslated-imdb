Horrible movie about a doctor who goes fishing and ends up catching a mermaid when she is thrown overboard. She catches him to bring her back with him. <br /> <br /> Glynis Johns, in the title role, is really a silly person with a tail outside. <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford is the nurse. which is supposed to be so eccentric, but we do not see eccentricity here. In fact, Miss Rutherford was not allowed to use her real comedic gifts. <br /> <br /> It's good to see David Tomlinson in the movie. He would meet Johns in the distant superior "Mary Poppins" 16 years later. <br /> <br /> Miranda is pissed at these two guys, a neighbor's bride and the driver (Tomlinson) fall in love with her. <Br /> <br /> Ask any mermaid you see, which is the best tuna, Sea Chicken! Forget about this movie.
