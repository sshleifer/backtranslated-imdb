Talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I have this waiting for a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railway. I expected to see the crazy stories and swear words of an eccentric man and discover his inspirations for this bizarre material. Boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> Spring and Chaos is boring with sporadic moments of innovative animation. There is certainly nothing to write about and not nearly as good as NOTGR, which is something I suggest you watch. Leave this hole alone. If you absolutely must see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Do not pay top dollar.
