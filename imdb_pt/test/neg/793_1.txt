The first time I felt I needed to write a review. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of movies in my life and I enjoy a wide variety of movies. I am reasonably open-minded, and I can easily say that I liked a movie while still saying "yes, it was not good, but I liked it". I can appreciate the mastery of such great films as The Shaw's Redemption, Godfather and American History X. I may like good movies in a genre like horror, or comedy, even though the movie is not so good. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (Bloodsport). I'll also try to evaluate the movie fairly, even if I do not like it. The Charlie Chapin City Lights were not a movie I liked, but I can appreciate the acting and the stories of the time. <br /> <br /> I think some people when they go to this site, instead of randomly clicking on a rating, should take some ideas into account. Try to evaluate the movie based on how good it really was. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. See also other movements that you have evaluated and compare the movie you are going to evaluate. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was the worst piece of crap I've ever seen. 2 hours of my life where I just got robbed. The acting was horrible, across the board. The scenes are unstable at best. However, the real disgrace was the story. In the first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to point B. However, after that, it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new elements, but nothing was explained. Nothing really made sense, the butler was alive, he was alive, he hit the light, it was actually enlightenment, it was alien, he was an alien, and so on. The ending did not match anything and really did not answer any questions. The only good thing was that no one cared about where we were happy to leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 ??? What's wrong with some of you? I'll admit the 8 of us where so crazy to see this, we thought "what would do best?", And we decided to tell some of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie. What I can say misery loves company. That's really the only reason I can see a rating of 6.5. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your life!
