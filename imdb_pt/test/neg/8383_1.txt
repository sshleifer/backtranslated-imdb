This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as I had when I finished watching this movie: "Uh, okay, it's over, what a relief!" I felt pain watching this movie, so bad it was! It's a low-cost B-series movie, for sure, but I do not think it's an excuse to be so bad! I've seen brilliant, low-cost movies with cool plots, good production, great acting and, above all, some substance! This does not have any of that! The plot is hilarious, it almost looks like an "American guide on how to turn old Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie, with some kids playing with the occult"? I do not know if the Chinese tale present in this movie is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! The production is simply awful, a simple zero (what "special effects" are these?). There is no suspense. The so-called "stress scenes" are a complete failure. The acting is not better; and the dialogues? Oh my gosh! A movie that has several dialogues like "I'll go there later, okay?" "Okay, okay." "Okay, okay, bye then"? I'm sure you deserve no more than a score of 1/10! <br /> <br /> It's true!
