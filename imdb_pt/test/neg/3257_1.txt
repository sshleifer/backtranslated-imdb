I have vague memories of this movie being funny. <br /> <br /> Having seen it again, I moved or was thinking of another movie. <br /> <br /> It seems like we should be sympathetic to the character of Jackie Mason, but nothing in the movie really begets that emotion. It is remarkable that he is really the only person who has given a tender dialogue with loved ones. No one else's character can rise to the status of something vaguely human. <br /> <br /> I do not even like golf, but as the movie continued, I found myself cheering for Robart Stack and the club guys. , really hoping they would repel Mason and Chevy Chase.
