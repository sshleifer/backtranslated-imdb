Sigh. I get puzzled when I see a short such as this, draw attention and assignments and other things. I saw this movie at a festival before the filmmaker got attention and immediately forgot. It was mildly irritating to see him pass the gag of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas along with the narration, the scenography seen many times before, all the weak style of Tim Burton and the story that leads nowhere. And we have the "joke" about filming the crows with the 45 the first time, right? <br /> <br /> But I think what's really unacceptable is that it still steals your basic concept from a 1999 comic book called LENORE. , THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! Like any quick search on the Internet will reveal. I mean, what is this? Is this what they base on a Hollywood contract and opens doors in Canada to a filmmaker? "Shake your head," as Don Cherry would say.
