Yet another recent comedy that shows that Hollywood can not even do the basics when it comes to making movies you used to do in your sleep for decades. If the writer / director had any brains, he would have based the film around the character of Jack Taylor, the boss tyrant. When he's in the movie, it's nothing special, but it's slightly promising and occasionally entertaining. Once he leaves for most of the movie and Kutcher has his 'hilarious' adventures doing house-sitting with the guest after a boring guest shows up, the movie completely disintegrates. <br /> <br /> As a result, what should have been passable timewaster turns into an inept stinker.
