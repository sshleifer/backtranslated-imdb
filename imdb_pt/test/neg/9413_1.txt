I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devils' lawyer), but since a woman's Scent he pretty much plays the same role and screams a lot. This movie had no captivating characters to heat up. Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least sympathetic of the group. He did not even approach a real human being. Pacino was hopelessly unpleasant and, my God, how old is Renee Russo? The only high light of this miserable mess was the hot prostitute with the perfect lipstick and she has 10 lines in total. Even the generally trustworthy Jeremy Piven was totally inadvisable. Note to movie writers, they do not usually work unless one of the main characters is at least a little nice (notable exception of Scarface). When the movie ends and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was, please, let a plane crash at the airport and kill Brandon.
