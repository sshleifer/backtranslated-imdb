Our story: Two US Navy divers look for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our proof: extremely monotonous entertainment at its best, with no plot in sight. Jim Brown is completely wasted since his help in producing this turkey from the 70's war. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who gave a special thanks in their contributions! DISTANCE PUMPS!!!
