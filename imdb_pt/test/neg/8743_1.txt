Boy Oh Boy, this movie stinks. This movie is one of the worst bits of crap I've ever seen in my life. Please, even if your life depends on it, NO, and I repeat: NO, under no circumstances, see this horrible piece of garbage. Just notice this when it appears as an MST 3000 Episode. That was the only way I could sit with the whole thing. If I had to watch it without this show, I would have stopped watching before it was over. It has one use: a cure for insomniacs !!!!!
