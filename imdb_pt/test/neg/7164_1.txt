Films like this infuriate me simply because they do not deserve the funding that allows them to end up on my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its jacket version and even more impenetrable in its cast choices (why is Mrs. Song a romantic interest? Do they just want an Asian woman there, or does her unconvincing character actually lend this story to movie "message" is a new perspective)? One has very little to approach this film, let alone when the story unfolds. But a good time for the process, I realized that the annoying cast is all that the casting agent could unearth, the unconvincing character studies are the result of writers' brain fart, and the story is amorphous and plagued by not-so-subtle references to misfortunes. capitalism, materialism and progress in the postmodern world. At the end of this film, just before I nodded and lost the last two minutes, I had the feeling that "Everything's Gone Green" is a product of "connections" in the movie world - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little steering ability, met someone with absolutely no marketing sense (but a lot of disposable ego) and broke out this monotonous and inefficient attempt at eccentric and humor-with-consciousness nonsense. And this is what is most maddening - how many infinitely better scripts have been passed in favor of this nearly impossible gut to be solved? Ignore this movie and feel good about yourself for doing so.
