That's 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom !! In this 'Action' movie, even the weapon that Baldwin uses (HK G3A3) sucks. It was sent for recycling by the military around the world in the mid-eighties and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I knew this movie was bad, I'd rather watch 10 MacGyver episodes save the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no drive and no feeling. Watch the Tupperware channel? is more exciting than that excuse for a movie. This movie does not deserve a '0' on the scale. Better luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, will I sit here and watch my nails grow? Is this much more exciting than 'Target' ??
