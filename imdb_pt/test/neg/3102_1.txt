I saw this movie a while ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I was rejected .. I tried my best to get the story because some moviemag had said that it would be a movie that would be for Rob Lowe, that Pulp Fiction had been for John Travolta ... Well ... we can all see that he not only failed, but fell all the way. This is really the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies .. just not worth watching for free on tv.
