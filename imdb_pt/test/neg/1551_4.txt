Cartoon of 1940, banished nowadays, probably because of the gag 'Black Beauty', in which Daffy rides a Negro as if it were a horse. <br /> <br /> The whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters in the books come alive every night. Then we have, among others, the Ugly Duck (Daffy) and the Wallstreet wolf. They end up in a chase after the wolf fooled Daffy with a fake duck (hence the title). <br /> <br /> And chase is all there is in this little cartoon, which has no real appeal nowadays. Just fun if you're a true Looney Tunes fan, I think ... <br /> <br /> 4/10.
