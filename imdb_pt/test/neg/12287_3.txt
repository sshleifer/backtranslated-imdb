That may be all you need to know to decide if you want to see it. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes it seems to be aware of it and make fun of how bad it is. It aligns cliché after cliché and even manages to get worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be hilariously fun. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh about the very poor quality in script writing and production values, you can have fun. Otherwise, get ready for some serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
