As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this movie depends a lot on the talents of the actresses, not their talent. In the early '90s, the show-the-babes-in-bikinis-fest has very little to redeem it, as well as showing pretty women almost naked. Joe Est√©vez, Martin Sheen's younger brother, proves yet again that his film career will not even come close to his brother's career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one, unless you enjoy seeing beautiful women in tiny clothes. It's about the only thing that redeems this.
