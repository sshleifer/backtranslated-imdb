What a terrible misfire. Not just the title, but the idea is the same as Jane Fonda, George Segal's vehicle of a few decades ago. Because? I wonder, someone with the influence of Jim Carrey will not only star, but also produce that tired, ugly and pointless excuse for a comedy. He could be taking the comedy to a new level, instead he goes for what he can assume as safe territory. Money, money, money, Christmas. But I'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. I call it uncomfortable because that's how I felt. Conscious as I was of the desperate attempts tried on the screen to be funny. And failing miserably. It could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect comedy of the post-Enron days, but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. What a pity!
