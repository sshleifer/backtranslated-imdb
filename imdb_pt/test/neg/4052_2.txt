My friends and I just saw a preview of this new Australian movie. Everyone who was in the movies agreed, what was the purpose of this film? There was no good story to follow, the characters were underdeveloped and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it strange that this movie, which probably cost millions, has been financed and made. Not for the drama community, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema. It was really a waste of time to create this work without emotion and more time really should be spent with shopping scripts and creating good stories, not creating a mess like that. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were fine, but severely hampered by a bad script. The character of Pia Miranda was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were, at best, medium. A real waste of talent. The saving grace was the cinematography of Geoffrey Simpson, who, like most Australian films, was superb. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about next time, please. <br /> <br /> 4/10
