Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh "<br /> <br /> This must be among the the worst movies of all time. It's totally stupid for anyone with a minimum of brains. Of course, you have the payroll reviewers who give brilliant reviews and vote highly for this abomination, but it's easy to tell who those sales are. Their comments are very good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming that it had some feature of B-movie remedy would be a brilliant review! Calling it a great movie knocks out the hands of corporate executives. <br /> <br /> But enough of that. <br /> <br /> This movie had all the bad features that a movie can have without being so bad. that it's nice to just laugh. The old Japanese monster movies of the 60s had a quality that this film did not have. At least in those 60's movies you could laugh at how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the ropes holding the spacecraft, how the models danced on the ropes, and how the flames curled back. Those movies mocked how bad they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to really think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effects were terrible by today's standards. Besides horrible. However, not as bad as the 1960s monster movies, so they did not have the comic appeal. The plot and dialogue were as sophomoric as I have ever seen, made even worse by being as predictable as you might expect. I will not even point out the plot and the logical holes of this one; it simply would not be fair with this regrettable plan (and it would take a long time to get started). Most of the acting was horrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been too desperate to agree to play in this. <br /> <br /> The SciFi Channel is fast becoming the "channel of the cheapest emotions", producing film after film without a dash of concept or intelligence. I can only imagine - why bother? <br /> <br /> Do not worry about that buff. It does not get worse.
