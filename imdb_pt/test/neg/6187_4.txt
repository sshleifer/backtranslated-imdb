This movie was compared to the hilarious British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda," though I can not understand why. The only connection I can find is Monty Python (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise, the two are unparalleled. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two thugs who want to get out of business before they die, so they decide to pluck their boss and go to Rio. When the escape goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns. <br /> <br /> What at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable medium movie with the usual sex jokes and bad taste. Bland humor. Again, there are the occasional high points, but neither the cast nor the crew can inspire the procedures. An attempt at a "Wanda" manic finish also fails, along with the "men in drag" humor effort, which is not surprising. When you think about it, men trying to be women is funny, men trying to be nuns is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
