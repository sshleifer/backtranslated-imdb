Ok, I watched this movie when it was very small and the day we were cleaning the closet I saw it! I thought, "I have no idea how this movie was," so I went ahead and put Oh my God! "This movie is so bad I never thought this movie could get so close to my favorite movie, but I made it laugh because all the jokes were so cheesy and ridiculous." not very funny !!!! So much of this movie was funny because it was so stupid !!!! This movie is not even close to good. I would have to say that if you want to watch this movie you definitely should not expect anything big and if you have ever seen, trust me, I feel your pain too !!!!
