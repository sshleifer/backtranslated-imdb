A high school star falls dead after winning a race; Shortly afterwards, her older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to realize that all members of her sister's team are disappearing. Who could be the killer? You may not care enough to want to find out. <br /> <br /> The rough, cheap, amateur slasher is practically useless, though Christopher George, first-rate (as the difficult and ruthless track coach) tries to give a ride with an intense performance. Even blood is not worthy of mention. The whole thing is lame from beginning to end, starting with the opening of the movie for a track mount and disco music, and the cast of EJ Peaker, once a co-star of the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character called "Blondie"! That's right, "Blondie." That may mean we should not take the film seriously, but in any case it's a mess. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of routine rubbish that makes "Friday the 13th" movies look like work. The only point of interest may be wanting to see an initial appearance of Vanna White, of all people. <br /> <br /> 2/10
