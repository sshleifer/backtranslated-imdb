Edge vs. Michaels-Boring in general (I loved the sweet chin music in the chair) 4/10 vs. Heidenreich - One of the worst games I've ever seen, predictable as hell 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE match- Why I watch them, no one ever wins a championship in the bang, is not the main event. I liked it when Show took JBL through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship-Pretty game OK, more sort of beat-down by Tripe H than a game, but I was happy to see it after watching the crap. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, I liked the confrontation of the brand, Hassan's bid and the end. 7/10 Overall, still crap. Why does anyone watch the noise ???
