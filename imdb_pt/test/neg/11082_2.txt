The Cavern: 2 out of 10: Blair Witch meets The Cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> I have something to ask of all film schools, could you please teach future directors how to hold a firm camera. Shaking the camera like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks is a headache inducer. <br /> <br /> The film is also basically a visual medium that directors can point to the camera in the general direction of action. The film also requires light to work. Maybe a light source should be used so that you can see the action on the screen. I know it's a cave movie, but there's nothing scary about watching blackness for minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> To show the film upside down does not indicate confusion on the screen, this indicates confusion The booth editing. <br /> <br /> One last note to the director. I'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake CGI campfire. I honestly can not, for the life of me, think of one. <br /> <br /> Now let's go to the screenwriter. Try to make at least one nice character. I prefer two or more, but a decent person that I can cheer or care about can help. Also, if you have flashbacks, make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you are going to have a surprise ending, it will probably be best if you do not contradict every thing that comes before. And try adding some extravagant terms of caving to a cave movie. You may have started with caving. The Cavern is a very bad, badly filmed movie with a confusing, improbable and anticclimatic ending.
