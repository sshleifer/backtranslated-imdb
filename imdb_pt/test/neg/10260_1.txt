Before I really take this movie, I just want to say I loved it. <br /> <br /> First, how many times in the movie did the characters use the phrase "Are you alright"? I'm pretty sure I was counting on the hundreds before I gave up and started watching the movie again. <br /> <br /> Second, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? OK, so the Dansen family led very private lives and had a brown eye, a blue eye, but since when does this turn people into underground carnivorous blue zombie creatures? <br /> <br /> And finally, 'Old believers here will protect me' hahaha :)
