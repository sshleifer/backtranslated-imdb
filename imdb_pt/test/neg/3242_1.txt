Oh, if someday you want to see a supernatural thriller becoming a comedy, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was a shock, since it had so many actors, but what do they do and how do they fit in? <br /> <br /> The handling of college scenes is like a school play in which each person talks and then the next person comes forward. <br /> <br /> Reasons to laugh at the movie: 1) Akshay , Suneil, Aditya Panscholi, Sharad Kapoor, Arshad Warsi as college students 2) Akshay carries a weapon in college 3) Some pathetic acrobatics and SFX <br /> <br /> There are several other flaws like why the snake does not save his lover to be raped and come so late? also why he does not kill them all together alone? <br /> <br /> But after all they have to do a 2 hour movie + then you have a tortorius movie <br /> <br /> The movie is painful to watch The movie was directed by Rajkumar Kohli, who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films such as JAANI DUSHMAN (1979) and NAGIN Rajkumar Kohli wants to help his son's nonexistent career Right from VIRODHI (1992), Aulad Ke Dushman (1993) and QAHAR (1996) ) all the failures he has struggled to promote his son and he also throws big stars for his son to be noticed, unfortunately nothing could help his son's career <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film has several comedic scenes like the scenes of death as the actors after being attacked by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climax <br /> <br /> Rajkumar Kohli's direction is bad Music is bad <br /> <br /> That takes us to the cast Akshay Kumar - ordinary things, he does not have much to do, instead so he cheats Suneil Shetty - terrible Sonu Nigam - the worst deb prize utada goes to him, he gives cartoon acting a new meaning Aftab-terrible Arshad Warsi- nothing to do Sharad Kapoor- Bad Aditya Panscholi-Annoyed Sunny Deol- is comic on the scene when he comes to save Sonu LOL Manisha Koirala- ordinary Rambha - Akshay's pair Kiran Kumar, Murad's Raza are as always Raj Babbar - hilarious for the wrong reasons the girls are horrible What brings us to Munish Kohli This guy has a huge physique, he is even stronger and taller then Akshay Kumar Unfortunately he appears as The poor man Akshay His voice is horrible, his expressions are painful The only thing he has to do in the movie is to wear glasses and make a face evil Rajat Bedi is horrible
