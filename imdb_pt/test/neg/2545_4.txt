This film has some nice special effects, destroying the Japanese archipelago to the point of humiliating Godzilla. The two leaders also put performances above par. Also, it's all a little ropey in this discreet disaster film. The incongruities in the rhythm are bizarre. At one point we have Hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried under a huge tsunami. However, in other parts of the country, people still walk around and licking ice creams when another tsunami rolls ... Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any impediment, or even a crease in his cream shirt. Other people appear with burns, torn clothes and mud marks on their faces. <br /> <br /> The Japaneseness of the film is both touching and disgusting. The sacrifice of Kusanagi on his last night with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry rarely seen in this genre these days. However, the unhappy MPs reflect on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by all and has no friends ultimately suggests a more obscure paranoia that infects Japanese concerns about their situation in the country. Unfortunately, the final sequence is an Armaggedon scratch, edited with a cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> Finally, my own bug-bear - the heavy hand placement of cigarette products. This time around, it's the crazy (or-is-it?) Scientist Toyokawa who becomes the propaganda boy of Japan Tobacco. At one point, it manages to light 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, in a thumbnail below the size of a telephone booth. Gimme a break.
