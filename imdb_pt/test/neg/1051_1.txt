I got a kick from Reynolds telling his lawyer, "Look, I've done a lot in my life, but I've never killed anyone." Obviously, he forgot his career, which fell after starting to make stupid movies like 'Cannonball Run'. Physical Evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'The Jagged Edge' that Glen Close rejected. The verdict is on Avoiding Physical Evidence.
