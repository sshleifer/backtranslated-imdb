This movie has to be one of the most boring movies ever made. The only thing I liked is to use Argento-esquire lighting in most scenes. The music is horrible and the pace is so slow that you can watch 2x the speed and even then it would be slow. History does not exist. It does not even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (at least on this site) as a horror, but it is not. It is a kind of art film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you like that sort of thing and can handle the slow pace, then watch, but I'd rather recommend something Japanese to you (eg Ichi the Killer) I think the only reason this movie has never been in theaters is the fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the sheer amount of boredom generated by this movie. These 80 minutes of duration would have been better spent watching the paint dry. <br /> <br /> I gave 1/10 simply because there is 0 in the drop down menu
