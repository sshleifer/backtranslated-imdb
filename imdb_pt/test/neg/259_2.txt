Where should I start this movie? All I know is that it's a mess. Be it the script, the story or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing of Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before that. According to Rani is getting very annoying, appearing in all the stupid movies since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (happy that Saathiya stopped with this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but spoils the funny movie. The dialogues are missing. I may have laughed here and there, but entertained? NOT!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies, but here he is insane. Your character is misspelled. One minute he's poor and the next minute you wonder how poor he is. Rani Mukherjee looks like a simple jain and was not putting any effort. She happily redeemed her career with Saathiya because her career was wasting time at the time. Pooja Batra has put a little charm here with his looks, but it is still not enough. Jackie Shroff is lost. The beauty and acting of Kashmira Shah escaped her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful, but puts poor performance. Mohnish Behl receives the award for worst actor (supporting) (they need Razzie because there have been terrible movies in India). He says stupid dialogues, terrible dances, seems strange, and is not in his regular form. Just to tell, there are more in the cast that are also terrible. If it were not for Raveena's incredible beauty at Aa Meri Life Bana De, I would not give the film a point. Otherwise, Salman's dance was terrible. Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I wanted the clothes to have a transformation and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dance) had been blown away from the wind. The good song on the album was O Priya O Priya, which does not have a good enough image. The same goes for decent title music. Otherwise, this movie (and the rest of the songs) is a no-no for everyone.
