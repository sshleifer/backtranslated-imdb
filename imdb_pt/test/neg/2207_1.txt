I'd rather have someone cut off my eyeballs with a razor than having to watch that movie again. I watched from start to finish thinking it could not get any worse ... BUT DID. Writers and producers should be slapped for putting that kind of crap on television. The actors are terrible. Get out of Hollywood, you're a fool and you go to work at McDonalds, sweeping the floor and emptying the trash. Anyone who thinks this movie is remotely decent should be suspended. They are an embarrassment to humanity. To think that we have soldiers putting their lives at risk for anyone who produces this kind of empty trash. I'm ashamed to say I'm American.
