Greetings from Lithuania. <br /> <br /> This is the first question that comes after seeing this "movie". <br /> <br /> You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching this, I only had two questions: 1) That was just a parody (spoof) > 2) How could people create such a thing? <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this "movie", then you REALLY do not know what a "bad" movie really is. I mean BAD. The script - Are you kidding me? Acting is so horrible that I think "the actors" are just having fun in this movie. I know, this is the movie "B", but come on ?? Does this have to be a reason to be such rubbish? <br /> <br /> Oh! And what a final !!! A must miss end! Just when you think this is the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because that kind of ending you've never seen before (and I hope you never see). <br /> <br /> Without this "movie" at any cost, do not say that I did not warn ...
