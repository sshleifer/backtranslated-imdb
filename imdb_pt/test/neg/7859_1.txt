"Heaven Can Wait" is an overwhelming lie and a misogynist lie. I can not imagine anyone but movie students sitting through it today. Don Ameche is in almost every scene and although he has a melodious voice that undoubtedly contributed to his successful radio career, he does not have the charisma to carry that film. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence adorable and entertaining, and then directs Ameche to play the role as gently as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on softness results in a main character who is both annoying and utterly disgusting. You would not want to spend more time with this man; He put you to sleep. You would not leave him alone with your daughter, no matter how old she was. Something creepy would happen. <br /> <br /> The look of the movie is pretty boring. Scene after scene consists of diorama-style, overly bright, diorama-style photos of stuffed shirts and busties, dressed in period clothes and overly busy. There are so many frills, frills and arabesques, both lilac and blue and pink sky, you need Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This movie hates women as much as hardcore pornography, but presents that hatred with a candy coating and a sweet little bow over it. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is revolting. In one of the most odious scenes of the movie, an elderly woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
