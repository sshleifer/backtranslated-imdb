This movie has to be one of the all time lows of Michael J. Fox's generally respectable career. I should have known how horrible this movie was when I rented it and found the film only partially seen and not kicked back by the previous tenant. It's never a good sign! Fox plays a grown-up star child who is now an agent for other children's show business. His character is delirious in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being Mikey. His great opportunity comes when he meets Angie Vega, a gifted child. Vega is abrasive and not at all pleasant. In fact, the only friendly character in the entire film is Cyndi Lauper as a Brooklyn receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to put a post-it in the box warning others not to waste their time!
