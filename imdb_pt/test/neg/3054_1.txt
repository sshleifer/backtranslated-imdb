Dear friends, I have never seen a junk-like movie like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS (1988). It seems that director Kevin Tenney intended to copy classics such as Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD (1978), or George A. Romero's RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, that same year. The cinematography was terrible, the film was very dark, so I had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. In fact, the images of terror have to be dark, but not in the manner of the DEMON NIGHT. The whole movie was ridiculous, without suspense, worse actors, except Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger, and horrible makeup effects. An average 5-star vote for this movie? I can not believe this. Perhaps the users were satisfied with the breasts, asses and pussies of the actresses, they really were worth 5 stars. Yours sincerely, Hans-Dieter
