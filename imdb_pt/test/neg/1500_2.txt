This presents an interesting way of dealing with a camera, <br /> <br /> especially for a digital TV movie - the version I saw was full screen - but falls short of the scenarios department. First you have about 20 million conversations, conversations, conversations in a "post-Trainspotting" style, then it's a slasher city. And then comes the most dishonest fraud ending I've ever seen, far worse than "Day of the Lie" - where at least it made sense. So everything in <br /> <br /> everything, it's the old music and dance: interesting director tries <br /> <br /> difficult, but deserves a better movie. Funny: Generally, are the actors desperately in need of something better? Jump anyway, for your time
