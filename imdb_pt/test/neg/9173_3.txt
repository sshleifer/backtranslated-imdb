What can I say ... not much for this one. Quite boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are just OK. The only one that shines in some way is Simmons, but he only has, maybe 3 scenes. I understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum, he maintains the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can not help but feel that his talent was wasted. No one rose above the mediocre. <br /> <br /> The story itself looks like it may be intriguing at first, but it just is not going anywhere. There was not a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like I had just seen something special. The cinematography was rather bland ... I mean desert in a kind of sepia ... not very inspiring. <br /> <br /> The story of his childhood friend back in prison seemed only partially thought out and did not really add anything to the story as well as make an average screenplay of 'Twilight Zone' in a full-length feature film. <br /> <br /> Drab.
