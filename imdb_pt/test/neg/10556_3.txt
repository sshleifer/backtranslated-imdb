As a fan of C.J.'s previous film, Latter Days, I really wanted to like this movie. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say, however, is that it's NOT a horrible movie. There are some good performances and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has some great scenes in which she is talking to her boyfriend's ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a beautiful week. The script falls on strange coincidences and clich√©s of films too often. (Did the main character go to Stanford in a golf bag, and does not his high school friend know he plays the game?) Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was. going or what he was trying to say. There are many scenes that are lightly fluffy, but end up being a waste of time. And you could easily cut half of the characters in the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Still, though, I would have to say that this is one of the best gay movies of the last few years. Which says a lot about how bad most gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope the next C.J. movie is better.
