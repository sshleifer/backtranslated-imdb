This was a pathetic movie. The Alien was decent, but the film itself gave new meaning to the pitiful. The plot is something that has been done over and over again! However, this one does the worst! The acting was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was happening. No one developed any concern for the main character. The film was too slow, and the murder scenes that existed were stupidly worked out and ended up not appearing more interesting than the rest of the film. There are some movies that "suck" but still can be enjoyed because of the total scandalous, but that does not even have it !! Whoever made this movie thought they could do something good and failed miserably. There is nothing this movie can offer except a headache. Avoid it!
