This movie is undoubtedly the worst action movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the film (this movie is serious) is when a chicken crosses the road on foot at about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing error leaves the movie absolutely hilarious for about 2 seconds, then back to "non-stop, on the edge of your seat, while you try to find a comfortable sleeping position, action!"
