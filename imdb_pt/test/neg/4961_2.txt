With my two stars, I'll probably go to the IMDb headline I hated "-list for this seemingly hugely popular TV series. No less because of the enthusiastic comments on this site, I decided to buy a Because I usually find British humor serves me very well. I gave up in the middle of the second installment - and according to other comments the funniest bits have already been through. <br /> <br /> So now I know, according to another comment, that I definitely have no sense of humor. But then I had to laugh like crazy while watching (and re-watching) Fawlty Towers to which Black Books is? even weakly ?? thematically related. Why the different reactions? It may just be a Generation Thing, and yet the differences can be pointed out. <br /> <br /> Both Fawlty Towers and Black Books are created in companies that are supposed to financially support their owners. Both companies are not successful, but they seem? by a miracle? to survive. Fawlty Towers is funny because the protagonists have to deal with situations they can not cope with. The gossip lies in the fact that they make a serious effort to succeed and, while laughing, also feel sorry for them. Black Books has no situations, is there and the owner spends his time feeling sorry for himself. If a situation threatens to arise, it is quickly discharged. The speed and frequency with which a subject is discarded is remarkable, and the protagonists turn to something completely different to produce an additional joke. Telling jokes ?? and not very good - seems to be all about Black Books it's about. Why a bookstore? A hardware store would also have done the work. <br /> <br /> No, stop, wait. It is a bookstore because beneath the veneer of rudeness, vulgarity and arrogance the protagonists are supposedly delicate and CULTURED. They are not some short-lived gorillas, but clumsy semi-intellectual losers. Hey, they're just like you and me. The way the series makes this claim is the only way to explain its success. There is nothing remarkable in the actions of the protagonist, what is special about them are the economically unrealistic living conditions that many viewers can envy them. That the protagonists who narcissistic and insipid impart a sense of belonging and companionship seem to be a trademark of the era in which the First World is currently living. <br /> <br /> Recently I watched Tittybangbang, also a relatively new British TV comedy show. . I found this funny. Often too insipid or xenophobic? but always with a purpose and hitting social criticism in full. Humor is created primarily by situations or by characters with a purpose. The low ratings on IMDb may indicate that this mood mark is not in line with the times, but I'm glad he's still alive and kicking and I hope he continues to do so.
