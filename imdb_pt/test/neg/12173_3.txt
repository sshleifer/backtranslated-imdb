In the confused zombie movie of Michele Soavi's art house, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a janitor of a graveyard where the dead are not buried for long. Helped by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco deals with the zombie problem of the graveyard, either by killing the undead in the head or by breaking his skulls with a shovel. <br /> <br /> However, shortly after falling into the mysterious beautiful widow of one of his last burials, Francesco is busier than ever before. Having received some particularly favorable comments from some of IMDb's most respected horror officiators, I decided to see what the confusion was. I just watched the movie, and I can honestly say I have not been so disappointed in a horror movie for some time. With its dark and confusing pseudo-philosophical plot, and an extremely gentle performance of the leader Everett, the Dellamorte Dellamore is an annoying and laborious mess that not even some splattery gore (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) and well - Free nudity (from the busty Anna Fialchi) can save. I can not understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious basement has received from its misguided fans.
