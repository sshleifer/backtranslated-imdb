I had to watch this for my Canadian film course and was told it was considered the "best Canadian film". When I watched this I really did not agree, considering I saw a lot better. I understand there were Canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and storyline were so disconnected from me (as a viewer) made me not care much what the movie was trying to tell me. The plot was very dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is to emphasize the messages, not to mark the viewers. This movie shows a bit about the history of Quebec. It's not a very interesting movie; definitely does not deserve to be placed on such a high pedestal.
