This movie has the heart in the right place, but unfortunately it's not much film. It is more a documentary under the pretext of a narrative. Bamako is basically a piece of newspaper placed on the celluloid. However, your well-researched general opinion article is much more convincing and concise than anything presented here. The filmmaker is trying to convey to the viewer the difficulties of African life, particularly the country of Mali, due to the unethical practices of the IMF, G8 and World Bank, using the scenario of a mock trial against the aforementioned. There's another 10 minutes scattered throughout the film that make an indifferent attempt at a narrative plot, and a bizarre Hollywood western-style shooting scene, where the director seems quite satisfied with his own cleverness (hence Godard's frequent comparisons). Of course, when the film starts, what and who is being tried is never explained, but, as we now know, the French refuse to feed the public. <br /> <br /> There are many passionate arguments, but they are often wordy, delivered in a monotonous raucous (one that becomes quite easy to turn off after some time), and very light in detail. The last point is the most frustrating of all, for there is a very well-grounded specific case to be made against the institutions in judgment here. Unfortunately, all we have in two hours is that the IMF and the G8 are bad oppressors and should forgive the debt of the Third World. We are given only an occasional indication of the specific reasons why the organizations in trial are guilty, but never a clear case. The arguments of the mock trial and filming of the surrounding village make clear the plight of these African villagers, but one wonders why we should spend two hours when a much more accurate picture could be painted in a 20-minute Newsweek article. or the episode of Bill Moyers. In the end, there is something very important to be said about this issue, it simply is not presented very well, or very clearly, in this pretentious and indulgent piece.
