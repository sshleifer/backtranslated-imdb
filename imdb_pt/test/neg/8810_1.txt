Danny Glover and Carey Elwes have obviously forgotten how to act when they made this film, the acting is absolutely atrocious. The pay is even worse. I'm sorry for Danny Glover, I hope he's been paid well for it, because that makes him look completely silly, the same goes for Mr. Elwes. An absolute slap in the face of any horror movie fan. Negligible. This is probably the worst acting performance of veteran actors I've ever seen. I wonder if they bothered to look at the script, or if they did, they must have said "forget everything you know about acting," because that makes them both look ridiculous. For two experienced veterans to act this way is terrible, I hope the paycheck was too large, I thought, at first, it was a parody. If you can find satisfaction in this movie then more power for you.
