This is one of those movies where acting, location, direction and effects were so bad that you need to rent a copy to get 5 or 6 friends, a beer keg, sit back and watch. Borrowing from the late Douglas Adams, "Watching this movie will be like having your brain crushed for a slice of lemon ... wrapped in a large golden brick." <br /> <br /> What is wrong? All. British actors posing as Americans, there have been many who can do it like Bob Hoskins, but he is not in this. Nor was it necessary to choose North America as a place because not to say what happened in England or something? The director seemed to enjoy taking pictures of girls and girls' asses rather than inventing some kind of character motivation. Then, at this point, your drunken friends will say, "ALL RIGHT! Another shot of T & A!" There is not much dialogue so feel free to jump into the kitchen and make the sandwiches. What I liked about this movie? After my friends collapsed, I managed to collect $ 185 of them and told them they spent it at the bar after we finished watching the horrible movie.
