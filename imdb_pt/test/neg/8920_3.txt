Steven Seagal is a thief specializing in stealing drug dealers, giving to the poor and unfortunate ... ah, Harlan, Robin Hood. Anyway, Harlan wants to go straight to his girl, Jada (Mari Morrow), so he takes a job as a driver of an armored car for a Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, wasted on a paper subscript). Max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, intending to use his charger, Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him the money, but Harlan has other plans. Escaping the police, hiding the money, and exchanging Bruno (who had a gun pointed at Harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he did not drive) after escaping the capture by a huge truck, Harlan fainted. Accused of police murder, among other things, as a result of the harms of high-speed pursuit, Harlan is arrested and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins forces with an inmate, Ice (Treach), a leader of one of the many gangs in jail, coming out with plans to find Max and eliminate all members of his corrupt party. Soon DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who says there are drugs involved. Also injected into the plot is Harlan's desire to save a children's hospital about to close and Jada has mysterious dreams about Max. Seagal and Treach talk to each other talking in gangsta while Buxton spends time trying Help Harlan, finding out the possibility of his boss being in collusion with Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck, allowing Rachel much freedom despite the threat it poses to his career. The Tighe shows up for about five minutes at the most, which is a shame. Seagal's Harlan escapes from prison and finds any and all wealthy partner of Max, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after breaking some skulls, breaking a few wrists and breaking a few bones. Treach speaks in his speech of rapper and Seagal tries to answer it in kind, providing some unintentional laughter. As one would expect, many people are shot and Seagal does not make much effort. It's interesting to see Seagal in prison, among the convicts, helping Treach when a group of "Eses" plans to take him out.
