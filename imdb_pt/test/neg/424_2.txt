THE SPECIALIST, starring Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Crank, characters, monotonous situations, monotonous direction, dull actors, cinematography without grace, music without grace. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if the vocalist wanted to be in a serious movie, but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below his TV drama. And there are some typical "Speaking Scams" scenes here and there, but the main aspect of the film depends on some kind of believable drama, which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so misdirected that it simply does not work with the film. action star. In the end, this confusing movie seems very strange and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is music. The composer is an aspiring Jerry Goldsmith, with his pompous and melodramatic score, that simply does not belong to this type of film (monotonous). It's as if the producers knew they had a very annoying product in their hands and asked the composer to make the film look more appealing and dramatic with their score, which makes the whole movie look even more confusing, dumb and dull. > <br /> Do not waste your time watching this, even if you are a fan of Jeff Speakman.
