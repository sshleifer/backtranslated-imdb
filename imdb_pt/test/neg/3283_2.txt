If you have not seen "The War at Home," let me tell you what you're missing out on. It's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could have just been edgy and funny in the 60's. Where America grew in its acceptance of race, sexual preference, religion, etc ... this show seems to argue with that progress. It is a step back in the evolution of America. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the jokes of the program is that daughter WHITE is dating a black kid from school. This is obviously hilarious, seeing as you can not see that kind of relationship at any mall in America. I lived in cities small and large cities, so do not give me some kind of red state, blue state excuse. This is not just a joke, but the allegedly non-racist father finds it disturbing and repeatedly asks his daughter to break away from her boyfriend, who opposes his character "he may sound racist but just dumb." <br /> <br /> If that is not enough, a second running joke is that one of the children, and soon to be metro-sexual, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. The public repeatedly learns that he is not gay, but the father is not convinced, so he constantly avoids his son, perhaps fearing that his son will hit him, since all gays are savage nymphomaniacs who can not control their will. The father always comes to some acceptance of his son, once per show, but usually continues to avoid it in the next episode. <br /> <br /> The only way this show can heal in my eyes is if continuous exposure to these "unnatural occurrences in life," open the eyes of the father a little, but that may be asking too much - and besides, with jokes like these, I'm sure we'll have hilarity in episodes to come like - Episode 13, "Father Votes Against Women Voters," and Episode 14, "My Muslim Neighbor Is a Terrorist." <br /> <br /> Please drop this show, FOX. We are living in a world different from the one in which its executives grew up.
