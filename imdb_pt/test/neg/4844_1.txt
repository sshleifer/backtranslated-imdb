Like most of you, I watch a lot of great movies; Among those we often find, voluntarily or erroneously, those films that are so useless that we think of reasons why someone would do it. That's exactly what I can say about the dead man's reward ... <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to "warn" some of you. If you like to have fun with a movie because of the story, acting and intensity than you might want to choose something else. Now, not all is bad ... In fact, if all you want is a creative editing of movies, and unique angles, along with the original music of the environment, you may think that everything is fine. As someone who values ​​the plot of the movie, acting and being entertained by a movie, the truth is that I found this movie so terrible beyond words. I could easily find a place for it on my list of the worst movies seen at a time. <br /> <br /> As for having Val Kilmer in it, the truth is that he was probably cast as a favor to the director; As a fan of some of Kilmer's movies, I can not understand why. The movie seems part western part romance ......... In the end, I'm sure most of you can agree with me that it is simply a waste of our time. If you have not seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it altogether.
