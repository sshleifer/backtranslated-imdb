This movie is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! The acting is laughable and Corman has not improved his piranhas since 1978. 90% of the special effects are taken from Piranha (1978), Up From The Depths (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). This makes Piranha II: The Spawning seem to belong to the American Film Institute list.
