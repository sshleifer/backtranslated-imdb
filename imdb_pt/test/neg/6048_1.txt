I just saw ... the story, the plot, the script does not make any absolute sense !! His Samvise the brave part 2 (without the ring), his characters appearing out of nowhere (no motive), his hated Hercules (no one knows why), his Leelee Sobiesky showing his true talents (two of them), his special effects low quality, some good actors wasting their talents (did I mention Leelee's two talents?) ... do I have to say more ??? It's just awful, even by NBC-TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what a waste! By the way: how can you give this mini-series so many stars ????? It's beyond me! .... What a shame! Have to do 10 lines, then this is my final word: AVOID, AVOID, if you are thinking of buying!
