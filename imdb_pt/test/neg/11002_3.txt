The Fanglys is situated in a small Texan town called Layton on Halloween eve, as people in town treat as the second coming of Christ or something, I mean Halloween is not that important, is it? Anyway, Sheriff Pete (Burton Gilliam) was summoned for yet another murder when local boy Ned (associate co-producer John William Galt) discovered a body in the local forest. Could it be Fang Lady (Justin Hamilton)? The central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? Being the fun type of guy he is Mark (assistant director and producer Robert Harvey) convinces his boss Kelly (Laurie Reeves) to go to a graveyard that his partner Steven (Josh Gobin) found the night before for a Halloween party. The idea of ​​spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the forest obviously pleases Kelly and she agrees, along with Steven and a girl that he chose Camille (Natalie Woods) and his nerdy friend Jerry (Tim Boswell). go out for a night of fun as well as a lot of fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. However, they soon discover that the legend of Lady Fang is far from the bedtime story that many make ... <br /> <br /> Edited, produced executive, written and directed by Christopher Abram Fanglys is a very crappy attempt at a horror movie. The script is very predictable, monotonous and does not provide any kind of entertainment value, in the right hands and on a decent budget. Fanglys might have been an effective horror movie, but as it is, it's not. It moves at a reasonable pace but the onscreen action is so bad that it does not matter, I do not know what to say other than The Fanglys is a really bad movie and I can not see anyone getting any kind of pleasure out of it. The dialogue is basic, the character is cliché and lifeless, while the film seems much longer than the 90 minutes in length. Are there any useless attempts at humor that do not fit so well alongside the elements of terror and what retardation were you holding in that cage? I imagine the budget did not allow the filmmakers to show it. Oh, if you want to know what happens to Jerry in the end, then you should also continue to watch the final credits as the truth is revealed, assuming you can actually get that far, of course (believe me, you have to do some things) . ). <br /> <br /> Director Abram does not do anything special. Abram thinks the bathroom scenes in the neon light are elegant, I can tell him that it is not when his film should be placed in the woods. There is no atmosphere, fear, tension, excitement or any of the elements that make a good good horror movie. Forget the decent blood, there's a little when someone eats a bit of an arm and a fork stuck in someone's throat. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Fanglys had a filming budget of $ 2,837, making it one of the lowest budget films. to have a commercial launch, and to be brutally honest it shows. And the retarded guy and his fake joking teeth that look ridiculous? The terrible special effects, the cinematography of the camcorder and the terrible acting of everyone involved, which makes it even harder to sit down. <br /> <br /> Fanglys is a direct crap for video, has no redeeming features. Whatever your score, IMDb's user rating is fully justified, it's one of those movies that in half an hour I was looking at the clock and wishing it were over.
