This film has tried to capture the naive idealism that many young teens have for fun, friendship, flight, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem is that he could not establish these things at all levels; and that's why they failed to build a decent story around them. I could not follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason why I should care. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an exploration of pedophilia. It's basically about a girl being in love with her sister and her sister being in love with the idea of ​​"men". While the second experiences her love for men, the first attempts to win back her sister by "tying." <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, the characters are weak and the reality of it all is similar. for an amateur porn filmmaker (without the sexual substance).
