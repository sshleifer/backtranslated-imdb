For those who expect the cover art and story line to point to another Bollywood Indian production, beware: there are no musical dance numbers or production value songs to brighten the mood in this tale of marriages arranged in British Indian culture - with some As described by Roopesh Parekh, the script skips topics that deserve to be discussed, only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai directs like a traffic cop, trying to unite discrepant subplots to the point of Keystone Cop's tactics. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical student who is gay and has a lover Jack. (Peter Ash) and they live with obese, alcoholic, moral aunt Van Van de Jack (Sally Bankes) and chubby daughter of Sally Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who takes their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a husband. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and their grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide that Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and marriage in accordance with Indian customs - without consulting Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too cowardly not to go along with him, a decision that infuriates Jack and infuriates Vanessa. Hannah tells a "little lie" to Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the marriage is canceled. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house, they discover that Vanessa, drunk, is repelled by her, but they end up deciding that, to Jimi's happiness, they will agree that Vanessa has given them a granddaughter and they decide to use the preparations of marriage. for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi persuades the very reluctant Vanessa to agree to the idea, and soon Vanessa is dressed in a sari, ready for a wedding, and Jimi, terrified of what she's doing just to please her parents, includes Jack as her godfather. In marriage, the truth is revealed and, to Jimi's surprise, his family adapts to Jimi's true self and the day is saved simply because it is true. The cast deals very well with this absurdity and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, though without any indication of a loving relationship (the director seems terrified at show the slightest suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Bankes provides most of the laughter as Vanessa; the rest of the cast repeats the stereotypical roles they have played countless times in Indian films. This is not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it is superficial and too tired to worry about any of the characters.
