This movie is about 3 stories gathered around three separate individuals. One of the worst movies that is available and even better if it is not available. <br /> <br /> The Good: 2 beautiful lesbian actress 1 true and moving story about Theresa Chan <br /> <br /> The Bad: The main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman Theresa Chan does not need be counted in film format and more appropriate in a documentary format. No link between the 3 lines in the story. Minimum DIALOGUE on film, replaced with SMS and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight into the movie and makes you forget even before you leave the movies.
