A trio sits at a restaurant table and looks speechless into space. Later, they lean on a rail and look across the English Channel. A man works a hoe repeatedly in his garden, only his head and upper trunk visible on the canvas. A man and a woman watch another man pee against a stone wall. Each of these silent shots lasts about one minute. Absolutely no information is given that could not be given to us in about a quarter of the time. The editor must have been half asleep. I know I was. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with an amazing shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body. One of them stands. But then the cop (Schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and starts tag along behind them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while Schotte and his friends exchange bland insults with each other and strangers . Eventually the thread of the case is picked up again, but it proceeds slowly, almost aimlessly, following the stylistic pattern already established. <br /> <br /> Sometimes in movies like this, the shooting location offers a kind of atmosphere that makes up for the blunting of history, but not here. The houses of the French village are linked to each other in long lines. The fronts of the house lean against the pavement directly, without steps. The fronts show practically no decoration and are practically indistinguishable. The flat lands are without characteristics. What could have been one of the most interesting episodes - a visit to a stone fort on the coast - annoys the trio until they start behaving like snots and are asked to leave <br /> <br /> The quality is minimal . . No one seems particularly eager to say anything. No joke is made. Nothing fun happens. The policeman has a face almost as interesting as Randy Quaid's. The baby, a tall hefty blond man, looks like the type of putter shot on steroids that the East Germans used to field at the Olympics. <br /> <br /> I was sitting for over an hour before he gave up. Maybe I'll take a look at this another time. Unless I've missed something or unless it turns into a demented Monty Python routine in the end, I do not think you'll get much to lease it.
