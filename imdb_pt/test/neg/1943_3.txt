Overall, I would call this performance disappointing. He tries the old "Anthology of Terror" approach, but fails miserably. The acting was bad and the stories too. Any skin shown in the film was obviously random, only to attract the R-rating for sex. Typical, I think, but bad anyway. Grab your $ 5 and rent a REAL movie!
