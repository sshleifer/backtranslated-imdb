Most American remakes of European films are very poor, but that's a league of their own. In fact, it may even be Sandra Bullock's worst film. I would say that I could have gone through another innocent Hollywood suspense if I had not seen the original Dutch SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is to remove all the intelligence and depth of character that marked the original as a classic. The real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Will the real George Sluizer please stand up?
