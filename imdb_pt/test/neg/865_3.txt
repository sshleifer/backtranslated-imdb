I just saw the Caribbean a few nights ago at the Annual Film Festival held here in Dallas, and I must express my displeasure. The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a picture of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by US oil companies, and the negative economic and environmental effects of that invasion. The main characters are a couple who live a simple and enjoyable life while maintaining a banana farm. Immediately, a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half-sister. I'm not going to go into detail on this (and to be honest, I do not feel like I'm messing up anything with this review), but another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas falls due to budgeting demands in a poor economy. Thus, the main conflict that should be addressed in the film is the husband between the rock and the hard place, trying to preserve their livelihood. On the one hand, the Reynolds oil company basically offered employment and financial compensation (basically bribery) to use its public influence to encourage the city to allow the company to start drilling in their city (compromising their position with the community and community). in itself). On the other hand, he is faced with being killed, but next to his community, protesting against drilling. Given the length of this film, it would have been a long time to explore the problems we just described, but that just does not happen, and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this movie has won a few awards so far, one for direction and one audience award. I'm not going to separate Esteban's direction, it was not bad or good enough for me to be so passionate about writing anything. The audience's prize was at a film festival in Spain, and to win an audience prize, I would have to imagine that the Spaniards would simply dig novels. In fact, Central and South America also digs soap operas, I know that. I presume that Esteban was wanting to take advantage of it or that he was digging soap operas himself, because that's what's going on throughout the film, so much so that he kicked the whole plot of the oil company aside, almost as if they had imagined it, the middle of the process, which had become tiring because it seems that at least three of the supporting characters had their story and character development seriously compromised to make room for more scenes of sex and crying. The only real villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and in no time you really can figure out who the hell he is. It's almost as if they cut their time on the screen a little before taking it off entirely. From time to time, they play with oil against the community plot, but are digressions at best. What we see much more are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate history in such a way that the oil company's subplot becomes unnecessary. It's almost as if this was a trick to legitimize a romantic drama (novel), releasing a bit of political relevance. However, the film gets so caught up in the novel that it ultimately does not know what to do with itself, resulting in such a close ending that you wonder what is waiting for you, or if there was anything to begin. Here are two things I think could have saved this movie: either cut off the half sister or cut the oil company. It is obvious which of the two they were most interested in. Or, perhaps, if the Caribbean were a longer hour, they could have sorted it all out. Regardless, I would be fine with a direct novel and I think the subject of oil companies that exploit foreign nations is in dire need of being addressed by the film community. The Caribbean is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together if they had been balanced, but with a romantic plot circling and taking up almost twice as much time at the expense of an oil field that was ill-established to begin with, both sides suffer. Best of all, the novel storyline is never solved. I would like to say that I would watch this movie again to see what I missed, but I have a strong impression that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned, it would not matter if I saw the Caribbean ten more times. I lost because it just is not there.
