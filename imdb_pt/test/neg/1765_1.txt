This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it. That was all I could do to sit down. The beginning of the movie in which they are at war was promising. It just smelled like "Private Ryan's Rescue" for me ... or at least a try. We just do not care about these people. There was no creation for the characters. The kid who dies, I think it should make us cry ... but for some reason, that only irritated everyone. So we have to listen to line after sleepy dialogue line that tried desperately to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which, of course, was also quoted in the film. Who knows. There was nothing original about the film, it was like sitting in the most mundane parts of all the war films of all time, with a little humor to keep it hoping it would get better. Unfortunately this does not happen. 3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated. Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English Patient, which for his time was a good movie, but now I wonder ... should I rent it and make sure I was not just stuck in HYPE ??? Maybe I was, but I definitely was not caught up in the hype of this movie. I really went to the theater wanting to like this movie. I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh at it, like I did.
