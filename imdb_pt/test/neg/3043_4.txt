This movie had the potential to be a good high school thriller. Instead, we had a party about a spoiled and spoiled babysitter. The problem was that there were many unnecessary things. A fight with her boyfriend, random friends coming to be killed. It was obvious they were just killing time. The main character was bland and uninteresting. Camilla Bell had no emotion during this film. She was just there. Another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. The children survive, so it's obvious they're going to let Jill survive. The only reason this took a four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer FINALLY leaves) are really exciting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
