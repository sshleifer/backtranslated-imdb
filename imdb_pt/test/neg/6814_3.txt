Very blatant, very monotonous, with no real drama. Why not just make a documentary? This is not exactly the passion of Joan of Arc. The only reason to see Chronicles is to listen to the performances. I love Bach's music and even found it difficult to go through this misery of a movie. The great Gustav Leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) Bach. We do not have much sense of him as an actor, since he gave so little to do dramatically. Mostly, he can walk purposely or angry from several rooms. Bach's life, of course, was not a film by Errol Flynn. It was actually quite monotonous and more than a little difficult. This probably means that life is not a great candidate for a movie. Music, of course, is another story. I recommend the Bach stations. Much more information, on the one hand, and some perception of music, which is, after all, why Bach interests us in the first place.
