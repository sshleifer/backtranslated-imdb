I do not think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time. I really like CKY and Viva La Bam. I think a lot of it was really stupid and had no plot to be a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie, but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut. I think Jonny Knoxville should have played in the film because he's a far better actor than most of Haggard's people and probably could have made this movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and should have skated more.
