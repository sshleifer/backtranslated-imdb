I rented this movie, after hearing Chris Gore say something about the effect of "five stars!" in that show bout. Well, when I turned the DVD on and showed the 3 stages of hell, I had to buy it. Just to see the spectacle of a screaming mother with her son to leave her other child in a burning hole. <br /> <br /> I was not waiting for ECW or CZW for an hour and eighteen minutes, but I was expecting less a shortened version of what seemed to be the main highlight of this movie. Well, unfortunately there was none of that. The 3 stages of the death share happen from the beginning, and it is practically from there. Nothing really happens in this documentary. It was very raw, naked and even-handed. Not a bad thing, but there is a narrator in this. You'd expect him to have opinions on the subject of this documentary, but he has not. What would be good to have, a message or a reason for this document. There was no real reason to have a narrator, there should be only one text explaining some of the less obvious scenes. <br /> <br /> It really explains the lives of these fighters as well. It shows a few moments of some dramatic scenes, which seem interesting, but the reality is not as good as it sounds. For example, mother watching her son struggle with bulbs and tacks for the first time in a public park. Instead of seeing her reaction to wrestling, they show her reacting to the camera, instead of telling her an interview later, or simply witnessing her reactions. <br /> <br /> Legitamit documents this, is not it. The source material was fragile to begin with. Nothing truly profound or interesting actually happens. No conclusion to some of the most interesting stories, no real point or final thought for backyard wrestling, edited together badly, and its basically a cheap, failed to rip off the rug. <br /> <br /> Wrestling wise, this is very annoying. the best bumps are at the beginning and slowly become less surprising and shocking. If you've ever seen Japanese wrestling, Indie wrestling, or even Dvds Wrestling Backyard, than this will not shock and amaze you. If you want wrestling, do not make the same mistake as me and see that one. Instead, get some CWW ECW or XPW DVDs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that came out of this documentary was how people can be stupid. Not by supporting self-mutilation or doing dangerous stunts, but by their reasoning to commit such acts. Backyarders look stupid for wrestling. Most of them are unemployed, and probably have some problems in mind, and wrestling is a type of therapy for them. Than defenders look even more stupid. Moms basically take all the rationale "if you can not beat yourself" to deal with the fact that your kids are basically killing themselves. School authority figures support their students in their dangerous stunts because it is an alternative to joining gangs and to a lesser extent using drugs, which is kind of funny since the segment happened in a rural town where people live 20 miles away from each other. others. People are stupid. This is what I got out of this documentary. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the reasoning and thoughts for someone brutalizing themselves in wrestling and basically what the verse of this DVD promises, win UNSCARRED: the Life of Nick Mondo. It's more incredible and interesting than the Backyard, and a lot more fun. Oh and it's really good.
