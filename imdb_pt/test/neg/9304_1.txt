This is the worst movie of all time, no doubt, and Schindler's List, in fact, has more laughs. This not only tells you how unsightly this film is and how big the SL is, considering it is heart breaking and contains a laugh. I wish I could meet Yahoo Serious, so I could personally strangle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's been through. There are also very few things to say about Australia, as they like it. Stupid fruit. Do not misunderstand me that the people (Mel Gibson) from Australia are great, they brought us Mad Max. It makes me very sick that people like this junk, (A comment I just read said it was "very funny", nauseating , it is not?). I personally will be boycotting this movie and I will start an online petition to ban and burn all Yahoo Serious movies for that, and I emphasize this, then DELAYED. <br /> <br /> These are just my personal thoughts, I do not doubt they are shared by everyone who has seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Note: If you are forced to watch this movie, Clockwork Orange style, call me to commit euthanasia on you for free.
