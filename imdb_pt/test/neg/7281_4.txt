I really do not see how anyone could like this movie. I guess I've never seen a movie as boring as this self-indulgent trash. It would probably have been better if the director had not spent most of the film exhibiting his own work of art, which really is not worth noting. Another thing I really do not like is when a character has a punch in the face, a gallon of blood was spreading soon after. I do not know how people bleed there in Japan, but I hope they have many blood donors.
