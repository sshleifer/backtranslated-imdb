This was a sordid and sad mess. I needed a shower when it was over. It's something like this - some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. She discovers that the victims belonged to a clandestine lesbian society, and she befriends a member of the group who may have relevant information. As the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is excited and intrigued (which reveals a lot about Hollywood and her psychosis about women). What is surprising is that none of this is too sexy or interesting, just depressing and disgusting. Ellen Barkin does a respectable performance as a lead detective, and Julian Sands makes an unintentional laugh as a psychiatrist in transvestite, which is why she escapes a star rating.
