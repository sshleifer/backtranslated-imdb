I just watched it yesterday and wanted to read compelling comments from other people, but I found some high notes. <br /> <br /> WHAT ??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * There were so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twisting of spirits trying to help, but just scary looking (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except they are not scary. A beautiful Asian woman who looks a bit pale is not at all scary. The "monk" character explains everything as being a perfectly natural life cycle; nothing scary there either. But the woman simply does not understand, she prefers to kill herself and let her baby let this poor ghost reincarnate. My friend and I were laughing when she jumped out of the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to say why she's following her. That information would have been nice to know before she started jumping, but whatever. <br /> <br /> That said, I liked some parts right in the middle. First she rides a cab with a ghost (ghosts ride taxis?) That has a lot of extra hair that is inexplicably scary. Soon after that at the bus stop, well, you need to see it as quite confusing. <br /> <br /> Throughout this movie is a total bomb, I gave an extra point just for these two scenes above. This is a shoddy Asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying in the womb of almost handsome women while trying to scare him with the same images.
