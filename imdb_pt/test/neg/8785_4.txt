Wow. I mean, whoa. I mean, whoa whoa. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when I came back when I was eight in 1996. At that time CGI films were a rarity; and the good ones even more. Also, at that time we heard things called CD players. But I digress. I used to like this movie a lot since then, and until I see it again, I've kept good memories of it. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All Dogs Go to Heaven" is clearly a robot. But then again, I digress. <br /> <br /> So, I saw it again. This really is not one of your best, I can say now, eleven years later. I've seen a lot more movies, and I've gained a little more knowledge. Now, of course, the dubbing is good, I'll give them that. The story is ... alright. I mean, we see it all the time. VERY. But it works. The musical numbers are what irritates me. That would have been more at home in the 80's with that kind of musical numbers. By 1996, most children's films had epic numbers, such as the Lion King (which came out a year earlier, but whatever), or something. You get showtunes here, vaudeville style. <br /> <br /> The animation also hurts. Sometimes hectic, and in others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot, it's really hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still like "All Dogs Go To Heaven, but this could have been waaay better." <br /> <br /> 4/10
