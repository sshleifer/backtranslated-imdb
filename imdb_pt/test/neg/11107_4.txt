First, let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. The cast is like the saved by the meeting of the bell, the monster is a guy with a bad clothes and as always; the military is useless. It seems like the more training you have and the higher your weapon, the more likely you are to die if you are in a low-budget horror movie. Apparently people in the movie business have little respect for Navy seals, marines and ninjas, who understand the worst. The plot is thin, a cryptozoologist crazy by the name of Dr. Pe√±a arrest the Chupacabra. He then takes him aboard a cruise ship where two crew members release him. You can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss a beat. The most remarkable part that really makes everything worthwhile revolves around the captains daughter. Near the end, she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks her butt. Let me see if I understood, the monster erases the entire unit of navy seals while they are using ammunition ARMOR PIERCING !! Okay, it's a movie that can happen right? But here comes the captains' daughter who can not be more than 19 years old and kicks the chupacabra with front and side kicks. It was hilarious. They should receive a medal for doing so.
