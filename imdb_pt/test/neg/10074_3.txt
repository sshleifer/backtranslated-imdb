Number 1 was a lot of fun great summer popcorn. It was the modern Jaws. <br /> <br /> Number 2 is best summed up by Jeff Goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that). <br /> /> Number 3 is the obituary notice ... JP has achieved everything that will ever be. <br /> <br /> When they realized they had no new ideas, they should have let the dinosaurs sleep. <br /> <br /> That said. The movie is good if you do not mind knowing you've seen it before. <br /> <br />
