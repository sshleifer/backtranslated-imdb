I saw this movie at Temple University. I can not imagine anyone going to see this movie in a theater (projected on film). The performance is similar to Saved By The Bell (the TV show). The plot is simple and unimaginative. The sound recorder likes the sound of wind and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, vampires, vampires. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money.
