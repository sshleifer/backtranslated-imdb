I watched this movie quite confusing. I'm not sure if it was trying to be a horror party in a Rob Zombie-like event or a real-life event. <br /> <br /> In either case, she missed the mark. It is not particularly accurate historically with characters being stung and changed for the sake of history. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither convincing nor bad. <br /> <br /> For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have followed this path without ruining the overall effect. .
