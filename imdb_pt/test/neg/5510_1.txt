Really awful. Obviously an attempt to profit from the Star Wars craze, but there is no excuse for this piece of tasteless junk. The plot gets lost before the middle, the characters are forgettable and the kid is not a talent that all he does is pose for the camera. An alien planet they land on is actually the naval corrals of Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie really made me physically ill watching. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman has made some good and bad movies in his career, but there are no excuses for this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb does not allow you to score a zero.
