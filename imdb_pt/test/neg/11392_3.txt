This strange little film begins with the story of Bruno (Alex Linz) in a Catholic school that has no friends and is beaten every day. He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother, Angela, who is a seamstress, does not think that's something wrong with what her son likes. Angela complains with Mother Superior (Kathy Bates), but is ignored and when the two return to the car, they are chased by the other children and are attacked with eggs. Bruno's father, Dino (Gary Sinise) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a pussy and practically disinheriting him. Bruno meets a new school girl named Shawniqua (Kiami Davael), who is a free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with pistols. Angela has a heart attack and Bruno's grandmother intervenes to take care of him when Dino refuses. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very harsh and unpleasant view of all the characters involved. Angela has a lot to do with Bruno wearing dresses while she practically encourages him. Dino was informed as a boy by his mother that he was a good boy because he liked opera and now refuses to help Bruno when he needs it. The Catholic school that Bruno attends is very undisciplined and all children run free and even call Shawniqua "N". Once Shirley MacLaine enters the shifts of the film and becomes more family oriented (so to speak). **** SPOILER ALERT **** The end after spelling is incredibly artificial and "feeling good". Hugs and cheers for Bruno as reporters follow him and take his picture for his roles. All the time, Shirley MacLaine is acting like the "tough old woman" who clings to everyone. There is one thing about MacLaine's character in the movie that no one mentions in these comments and has to do with her masculine nature. I think Helen's character may be a lesbian! She is very hard and strong and at one point in the movie she shares a dose of whiskey with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time. I do not remember anyone in the movie mentioning who her husband was or if she never got married! That's why I think her character can be gay. Many other good actors appear in the film as well. Joey Lauren Adams, Jennifer Tilly, Brett Butler, Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan should have looked better at the script before signing. I think when they learned that MacLaine was driving it would be an honor to be a part of it. It is very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject is probably impossible for most of them. The actors are not bad, but what exactly was MacLaine wanting? Tolerance for a boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression? We realized that in the first 10 minutes, the rest of the time I was trying not to shrink.
