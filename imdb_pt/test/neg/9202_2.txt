First, this movie was made in 1978. So this tells you that the movie is going to be bad anyway. But I'm not saying that all old movies are bad. Second, the special effects are terrible for that time. Finally, the acting was so bad, Bozo The Clown could have done better. This makes you wonder how people can make money to make movies so pathetic. This movie sucks!
