This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it takes the price of the rotten 2007 film (which is made by me), anyway this movie loses all the ingredients of a good movie, I mean, come on, the actors had a poor performance, the story is just crap. I am very, very disappointed that they have done better than this piece of garbage. I just wasted my time and money on this movie. I wish the producer could give me back my money. Anyway I have high expectations in this movie and I was disappointed. I would not recommend anyone to watch this. So if you want to waste your money on something, do it on something other than that piece of junk.
