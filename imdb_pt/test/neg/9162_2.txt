Do you know the old man saw about a train accident? The one about how you can not look away? This movie is not so good. The only reason you are still there is because you brought your children and you can not leave them alone in the theater.

If it was not basically the only family movie I could take my son for Christmas, my wife and I would not have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop. I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes to tell her I thought she sucked, but she hit me in the punch. <br /> <br /> I'm not joking. It's putrid. Only the extraordinary work of David Cross saves this critique of being just a star. <br /> <br /> The story is sickening, insulting, and stupid, as you would expect for such a film (though the recent "Curious George" was cheerfully clever and funny.) The acting is largely poor "The decision to" upgrade "Chipmunks songs to today's audience was inadvisable at best and at worst." It does not work. "The squirrels of old were clever, malicious, and cunning. These squirrels are stupid, mean-spirited, nasty and surprised, needy to the point of being useless. Whether as a retrospective, as a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film is totally The final straw My son could not wait to get out Spend your money renting Curious George.
