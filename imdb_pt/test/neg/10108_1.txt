<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I'll be as kind as I can about this movie (some people, including directors !, can get pretty upset when the reviewers tell them). ... <br /> <br /> There is a good car accident and the opening credits look good and ... that's it; all the rest bite the great. All the acting is scary, the script is embarrassing, the special effects seem to have been made by school children on cheap computers. After all, this movie has serious trends in bowling shoes. Like a horror movie, it's not very scary, and if the horror movie of a "thinking man" was successful, I kept thinking that the end of this movie is a long way off. In fact, it may be a wry look at the bad horror movies and I'm missing the point, but I doubt it somehow. <br /> <br /> This is a complete warehouse of a car movie and I could not recommend it to anyone. , and it makes me sad to say this as I look forward to the resurrection of the British Horror. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with this review, that's fine, it's just my opinion, and I'm making sure someone will love it (the director's mother, for example).
