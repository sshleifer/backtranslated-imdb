The only reason I watched this is because of its stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare and Eric Roberts and Catherine Oxenburg * and Jeniffer Rubin, all capable actors and have performed well in the past. SOMETIMES, a weak story of serial killer, You can guess who the killer is in the first scene. Very artificial in every way there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 POOR
