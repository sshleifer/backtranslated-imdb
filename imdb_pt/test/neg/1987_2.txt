This film tries to be artistic, but it seems as childish as the first attempt of a film student. Then she tries to be erotic, but she seems as clumsy as a virgin's first attempt. Lastly, it tries to be cruel and exciting, but beyond Kinski's performance - which is powerful but visibly misplaced amid the amateur melodrama - is as thrilling as the hand around a wet noodle (which is an appropriate metaphor considering as erotic this movie is). It features a blowjob scene that is even worse than ChloÃ« Sevigny's career burial performance in The Brown Bunny. Run away now while you have the chance. Go find yourself a Victoria's Secret lingerie catalog instead - it's more artistic and more erotic than this crap.
