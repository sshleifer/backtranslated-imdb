Persuaded by the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is very good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this movie quite boring (about 2 hours) and full of clich√©s, a little girl having several personalities after a childhood trauma, etc. Tamer KAradagli is very funny in this movie, dialogues, etc., you will have to see, he is the tough cop you see in American movies, maybe copied too. I would describe this movie as an ordinary American thriller with a bit of Turkish touch. Unfortunately, once again I am convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in Turkish cinema. of cliches
