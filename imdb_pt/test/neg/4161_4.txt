We are in the not-so-distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, languages ​​mingle (although English prevails over the rest), races have merged, human cloning is a fact and the whole territory seems to have been divided in two areas: that of the valid and that of the invalid ... a brave new world (in the Aldous Huxley style) in which people are genetically archived and blood relationships are strictly forbidden (for health reasons)? this is code 46 of the title-). In such an environment, two souls meant not to fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Winterbottom had an important history with great potential. A good recipe that he spoils giving such a slow pace, narrating in such a tired way, removing any emotion ... Cold, that's all Code 46 conveys. Coldness and boredom. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play their roles wonderfully), nor the visual and sonic power of some sequences can do anything to save the film. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Code 46: what could have been and never was. My rate: 4/10
