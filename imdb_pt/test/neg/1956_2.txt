Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, actually I'm surprised people can make this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> While Sam and his wife go to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill. Outside the fun and taking revenge with inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Do not jump in this movie, most people say it's a laugh with their mates, but frankly, it's a waste of time. If the people who made this movie get a job doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write a better story, especially the names of cheeky characters.
