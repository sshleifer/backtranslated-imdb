This film was a waste of the celluloid it was printed on. It's a disastrous scene, much like a particularly horrible train disaster. <br /> <br /> Seeing this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main point of the plot is that the character played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal that should not play, because that would violate his probation. The children he befriends refuse to play with him as a coach for a while because he plays. BUT ... a few minutes later, after they won the championship, a large sum of money saves their shelter. And where did they get the money? GAMBLING!!! Add this to the scary scenes in the funeral home (why exactly are there BEDROOMS in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
