With several well-known actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner and Joe Don Baker), why did Jeffery Combs take the lead? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead, as well as Warner, Baker or even others in the film as Charles Napier. Combs went miscast on this and did a poor job of it. Everything he did seemed false or fabricated. <br /> <br /> The script is bad. Which means that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead role, he could have saved the movie (removed from my "time waster" category), but it would still have been a bad movie. The screen game was completely gone. The director should have recognized this and helped the film.
