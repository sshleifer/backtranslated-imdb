My friends and I rented this movie confusing it with another one about skateboarding. Watching Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is hilarious. The film is so incredibly predictable and exaggerated that it turned out to be a laughing party. Even though I gave it a 1/10 this movie should be seen especially if you can get it on TV anywhere.
