The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two queer servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently, years before, her mother was involved in a scandal and Ingrid returned in an effort to irritate the relatives they would have forgotten before she or his mother existed. This is because she reasons if they are shocked enough, they will pay to get rid of it. Then, with that money, she will leave New Orleans and look for a millionaire elsewhere, as if presenting herself as a countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper appears and seems totally out of place as a love interest. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that this movie was not the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career collapsed - her performance and character were This is Bad! Instead of the elegant, demure woman she used to play in movies, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in the movie. His false Contessa was shallow, demanding, unpredictable, and stupidly dumb. As she was able to vamp any man seemed a mystery, as she looked less vampire than just plain nuts !! I am not exaggerating to say that she behaved sometimes as someone with a combination of a serious mental illness and a personality disorder, and all this together makes me think "who in the world would fall in love with this mess?" . Frankly, I could not bear to watch her histrionics and narcissistic behavior and she looked more like a guest on "The Jerry Springer Show" than a protagonist! Confused, horrible, and exaggerated are words that come to mind when I think of his role. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is frankly impressed by Bergman's criticism and hysteria. While Gary Cooper is usually an excellent man of leadership, he is dominated by her and just seems lost. And strangely, they created two total weirdos as their entourage - Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Mrs. Robson is best known for her interpretations of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some strange reason, they have put on her makeup, and the end result looked a lot like the loving son of an Indian cigar store and Aunt Jemima! Her face was a lot of wood, she had strange eyebrows, and she dressed like a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf, and though this should not be done against him, his role was written as if he were a jester - a very, very ungrateful role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! Overall, rotten acting, writing and flabby direction make this one of the great stinkers of the day - almost as meaningless and bland as the famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
