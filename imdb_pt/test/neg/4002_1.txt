Piece of crap, I would have given a 0 if I could. The animation is good but not good enough. The plot is absolutely the most ridiculous I've ever seen, and that's a lot! This 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting, but failed miserably. It is almost as if the writer had started a story, then had another idea and tried to combine the two. Do not waste time on this; believe me, you will be as angry with yourself as I am. The only actor of any note in this was James Woods, and his part was peripheral at best. I'm all about doing things that are edgy, pushing the envelopes, but that just did not cut it.
