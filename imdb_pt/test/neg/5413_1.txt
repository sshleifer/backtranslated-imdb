Wow, where to start with this one. Well, if you like to laugh at the failures of the filmmakers, then this is for you. I bought this movie for $ 5 because I never let pass an opportunity to laugh at the mistakes of movie B, from the movie God Casper Van Dien, and the boy was one of them. It may have been enough that this movie contained the only lameest movie monster of all time. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian ghost, looks more like a plastic bucket skeleton than you put on the front porch on Halloween. He wears a cape that is clearly a garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a bucket-shaped cap on the head. At some points this is a man in costume, in others it is clearly a plastic prop placed on top of a horse. This monster has the incredible ability to view with the "predator" view, a clear steal, and can miraculously appear after releasing his spear. Sometimes the spear cuts people, sometimes not. This thing can also get down a helicopter with a single arrow. Wow, that makes a lot of sense when the kid blows up a spaceship with a rocket at the end of "Critters." This creature is immune to bullets, but somehow dies at the end of the movie. At the end of his killing, we never find out why he is, he explodes. This is an incredible feat, as we have seen this thing explode 3 times in the movie. But I think that last time was the charm. <br /> <br /> And do not even tell me about the lameness of the other characters. First of all, which Delta Force unit employs women? Finally, I noticed that the military still does not allow women to enter combat situations. In addition, this unit is "disguised". Because? What possible reason would they have to be disguised? And they are not good at it, I do not think anyone would realize that they were military if they did not have uniforms, BUT EVERYONE WAS ALL MACHINE WEAPONS (which in turn change the sound effects throughout the film, in some points sounding) like air rifles tablet BB and, in others, canons). There is a part when the Man Skeleton throws some construction workers out of a catwalk, and you can clearly see the cushion on which they fall. At another point. Michael Rooker falls on a hill that is clearly flat. They tilted the camera lightly to give the impression of a slope, but he is clearly struggling in this looooooonnnngnggggggg fall scene. Then when he is helped to climb the hill, the rope is flat, and when he shows the woman at the "top" of the "hill" the rope climbs from his grip, not the way it would look if she were pulling someone up a hill. Rooker really has a line that says, "I'm not going after him, I'm going after him." What? This is possibly the dumbest thing I've ever heard, and I see these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part about this quote is that you can say that everyone involved in writing / producing this movie thought it was so bad. Believe it or not, compared to the rest of the dialogue, this is good. <br /> <br /> The acting, bad. The makeup, too bad. These characters either had scars or wounds that they liked to change side of face. Maybe these are alien scars that like to run on your face. Yes, I think I'm going to make a movie about it, "Attack of the alien scars that move on your face". This villain would be more intimidating than the Skeleton Man, and the movie would probably be more scary.
