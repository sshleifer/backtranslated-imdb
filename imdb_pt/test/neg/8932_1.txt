I just wish there was a lower grade than F to give! I got a result in the number of votes. I do not classify it as a normal movie, but as a T & A movie, and this is the worst, the worst and the most horrible movie I've ever seen. The acting, music is all terrible, not to mention that there is no nudity whatsoever to the connisuer.t & A is about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him making applause.I warn this piece of garbage to all cost! this is the worst of teenage cinema in the '80s.
