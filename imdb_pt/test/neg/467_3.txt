I wish I could tell you that this movie is as exciting as the theories it advocates. But I can not. Another species might have come and suffered mutations while I waited for some action. To such a controversial man, Darwin lived the more conventional life. If you did not know the crazy theories, you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have cast Darwin as an idiot who does him a disservice. Even when he momentarily loses his mind due to his relentless theorizing, it was not interesting to watch. Perhaps great thinkers are dull people? I do not know what I was expecting: an eccentric with wild hair and eyes exhibiting his love for all simian things, the glow of madness stretching from a furrowed brow? A long-haired hermit chattering with animals? A lunatic cradling his head with eyes lit like beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great. This is the cinema for Scorsese's love. <br /> <br /> But there was none of it. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no fear. Only Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly, from Sutil as Method Breath School. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a high-speed train, so why did this movie just go unnoticed - like a slow winter? The deception is immeasurable.
