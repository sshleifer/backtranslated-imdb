In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) argue in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, in fact the evil vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by her evil vampire gang on motorcycles. Connor joins a clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from Niran's clutches. <br /> <br /> I hoped that "Vampires: The Turning" was a good movie. The sites and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy score is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but unfortunately, the script and director are terrible and the very loose fantasy of Meredith Monroe does not help her sagging breasts. The story is very short, and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle racing, fights and annoying flashbacks to complete a minimum run time for the movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampires: The Conversion" ("Vampires: The Conversion")
