This is just about the worst piece of crap I've ever had the unpleasure to sit on. The story was embarrassingly amateur, the graphics were horrible and the acting ... I've never seen acting worse in my entire life. A kindergarten class could create a more frightening concept, better written and more fun than that. I pity those who waste time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to do the work. It was obvious that they did not receive the proper direction. Writers must have spent their time at film school in the "back room", picketing. Many teachers lost a lot of time with these two. I would be really embarrassed to admit that I knew them.
