Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you will thank me for it. This is the worst movie I've seen in a while. I came to this forum expecting to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this movie and the performance of Spacey in particular. <br /> <br /> Some will punish me for saying this, but I think Kevin Spacey's acting is quite limited, despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a more evil version of the role of "American Beauty" by Kevin. His character in this movie is ridiculously exaggerated, all the way up to his ridiculous insults that he plays on his assistant. <br /> <br /> There are banal and tedious scenes all over the world, like when Spacey is attacking Whaley about bringing him. Same instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected that this particular scene should be funny, but by now I was ready to press the stop button (that's about 20 minutes in the movie). <br /> <br /> What about the false homage? for "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley proclaims, "I think I've seen this in a movie once," as if he was going to cut Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut it? An envelope! That's right, he'll give you paper cuts! This has to be one of the worst scenes of all time in Hollywood, and the fact that the actors and the director tried to do it with a serious face makes it even more terrible. <br /> <br /> I admit that I do not see the end of this movie (my DVD happily locked up about half an hour before the end), but anyone wishing to say it could spare me the idea that I lost a great turnaround and everything would have made sense. Well, I do not care what happened in the end, because that could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even thought that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie as badly as I did.
