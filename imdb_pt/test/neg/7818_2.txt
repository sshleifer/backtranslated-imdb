For years I hesitated watching this movie. Now I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher makes the worst film mistake of her career, from 'Dude, Where's My Car?' Tara Reid co-stars as Ashton's dream girl, who asks him to take care of his father's (and his boss's) owl over the weekend. The rules: 1. No shoe in the house. 2. There are no people in the house. 3. The boss's son is away from home. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, you can guess by the end of the first twenty minutes, as the rest of the movie will end. <br /> <br /> You know, there are movies like, "Meet The Parents" where bad things happen to someone but it's fun to watch, and it's delivered in a way that you can not wait to see what happens next. This is not one of those movies. You know from the beginning that bad things are going to happen, and are mostly stupid things that would never happen. It's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when I almost hung up because it was so bad. But I paid the rent, and I thought I had to watch it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good, and I would like to see her in more movies. Although, I am not surprised if this has hurt your career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but of course with the kind of movie it is, you would expect nothing. short of this. <br /> <br /> Do not watch. You will truly regret it!
