This movie can not be serious because there's a nerdy kid named Curtis killing people. The other two psychotic kids are kind of cute, but that Curtis boy is so ugly because he wears those big brown ugly glasses. The actor probably walked the wrong set and he really should go to Revenge of the Nerds. <br /> <br /> Another thing I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his time to shoot people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because it took too long and what was going on with his voice? He looked like he was fourteen, not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no reason for that. <br /> <br /> So they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. It did not make sense or even the music. The music did not fit into any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.
