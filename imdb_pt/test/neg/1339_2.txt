I saw this movie last night. I do not usually comment either right or wrong, as I think films are like books where there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. In the end, I thought, ah, this is testing my patience. How many women really look and live like this when they reach the bottom of the pit and if I could borrow money from Mommy and make my dreams of fashion design - hell, life would be great! I was out for a good dating movie with my girl (my dear husband likes to watch movies together and I knew this would not be him), something light and easy in the senses, but this was a bad movie. We are observers of clever and interesting films and this movie was not that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she kept it. Bad bad.
