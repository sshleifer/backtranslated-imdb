This film was announced more than three months ago in Greece as the greatest Greek production ever. Well, it could be, but ... When you hear about a great production, you expect to see something new, something different. What you watch here is a movie without a reason for existence. George Corraface does not seem to like making this movie very much. His performance is so simplistic, it looks almost amateurish. The sound, especially when some of the Turkish actors speak English (voiced?), Is full of whistles. The special effects, fortunately few, showing Istanbul and Athens in the late 1950s and early 1970s are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (5 years) until 1968 (14 years), but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later. <br /> <br /> So much for "the greatest Greek production." At least one would think there would be some interesting roadmap to qualify for such an expensive production. And all you get is a love story among 7-year-olds who meet up 40 years later. Oh, there's a political side as well. A couple of ironic remarks about the Greek "junta" of 1967-74, so childlike that they seem almost forced. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, some good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, especially Ieroklis Michaelidis, the very good scenery and the magnificent music of Evanthia Remboutsika; but they are so few for such an expensive production. <br /> <br /> Bottom-line: Is a movie so bad? To tell you the truth I do not know. I just know that at no time does this justify its huge budget (by Greek standards).
