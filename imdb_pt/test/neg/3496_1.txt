Throughout his 2 hour runtime, Crash traces the emotional distress of his set of 10 characters when confronted with the sometimes glaring and sometimes latent forms of racism in American society. This is the emotional anguish of one of your audiences sitting at the front and desperately trying to understand what the movies have become these days. <br /> <br /> The age we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even the unenthusiastic ideas of postmodernism are being slaughtered by what, post-modernism, aims to destroy all these ideas, nowhere thanks to the great destructive power. ideas of these great "thinkers". But I digress. This has nothing to do with what the movie is, but rather with what the movie is. <br /> <br /> Of course, it seems difficult to make a living in a Hollywood that has to cater to a market that is. So post-post-post all that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think, whether we like it or not. And so a new studio product is born! Indie films, once energetic and idealistic in their challenging experimentalism, now seem to be as adamant as Hollywood movies to sell to independent movie markets. An independent movie must be sold at Sundance before being 'acclaimed'. And then nothing is simpler. Even what constitutes a good movie becomes so obscure. Whereas, in the past, filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and, in these seemingly simplistic attempts, the biggest films are presented - filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good in the first place; movies have to make people think, have to be meaningful, have to be provocative, ask questions, yadda yadda yadda. It all boils down to a subversion of the Hollywood film system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the similarity of Hollywood movies, and the innumerable ways to differ are essentially the same product. <br /> <br /> And I have not even started the movie yet. Maybe I've become very picky about movies I see nowadays. Maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than, let's say, investigated while watching a movie. But hell, this movie is a big load of shit. And I am repelled by this movie not only because it follows the instruction guide for the T's - the characters are eloquent and as witty as they are endowed with God's speech; raises questions about racism and life confronting racism in America; has "touching" moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that, once you hear the ambient / new age soundtrack of women singing on loud records in foreign languages, you know you are within all of the above characteristics. <br /> <br /> And something about the above point - raising questions about immediately convincing issues like racism - irritates me a lot. Like all post-post-post-everything movies, he does not just have a message about this problem. Because oh, our audience is very smart for this nowadays in this post-post post world. Our audience wants us to make them think, they do not want us to put things so simplistically (and then they're going to crawl into an existentialist crap and say) because life itself is not simplistic. Haha ha. What other common drill we here, then, the public needs to think about the problems instead of having them fed to them. Okay, okay, fine. So the movie makes a point of beating the audience with these non-messages and, as they are not exactly a message, it's so decidedly subtle and subtle that it means good, right? So we are being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony was not so strong, we have the character of Ludicrous, the only character who does not seem to take all this discussion of racism seriously, being "turned" into one of those annoyingly significant characters, where he learns something in the end, giving significant looks and pauses where the audience should "learn something about themselves too." A yes. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist movie right after this man. <br /> <br /> To cut through the long bullshit, I think I would have no problem with the film if it was not so bloated self-importance. The anguish that makes up the whole movie looked more like a whinny white boy than Spike Lee's real rage. This is how Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the guy who wants to wave flags about humanitarianism, when the only thing they do not realize is the banner they are waving is their underwear full of holes. In addition, it has become so modern in the post-post-post post world to be completely subtle about this. Nothing is simpler any longer. In his best efforts to really be good, provocative, and ultimately human, he has not become even another indie of an indie director who wants to make a name for himself as an indie filmmaker of credibility. Now, at least, Hollywood is simpler and more sincere in its manipulation.
