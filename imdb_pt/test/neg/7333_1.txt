A man wonders if his co-worker is gay. In a yard sale he finds a lightning weapon called "Gaydar". You point at a person, squeeze the trigger and tell them how gay they are. He tries, works, and goes out to find out if his coworker is gay like him ... <br /> <br /> Promising idea ruined by a dull script (after a promising start) and a terrible performance. The whole cast is overcome and basically shouts their lines to each other constantly. It gets annoying and really embarrassing after a while. The saving grace is that she's short, there's a scene robbing a cat (I love her falling from the kitty's bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his brief moment. But none of this saves the movie. I can not recommend this at all.
