I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a movie made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of filming unused movies that have probably been on a shelf somewhere for ten years, it is so! You can tell why the material used to shoot the scenes does not match the film used to shoot "Jack-O". Ed Wood's curse is still alive. The good thing for Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find in both of your filmographies. The same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some kind of curse is released when stupid teenagers and beer drinkers interrupt a grave. The result: an inordinate killer with a scythe and a large plastic pumpkin on his head! He (he) goes after the healthy Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who stand in his way). The father opens an Haunted Garage for the children in the neighborhood. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has a continuous and perplexed facial expression for all of his scenes and a dramatically misinterpreted dramatic scene in a tomb. At least he's a boy. The mother's eyes pop out of her head as she struggles to read her dialogue. There is also a boring woman who appears to explain things that seem to be trying to phonetically utter all her dialogues. <br /> <br /> What about the known actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (they are used to fill the time). Linnea has a bigger role as a nanny, and she does exactly what she can with that. His enthusiastic performance helps a little. There is also an unexpected chuckle when an ultraconservative couple watching a clone of Rush Limbaugh on TV bites him. The woman slides on the rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. She is electrocuted and the end result looks like a grilled Muppet. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone, great fun! I was not bored!
