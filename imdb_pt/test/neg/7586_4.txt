I would not normally waste my time criticizing a useless movie like this. However, I'm off work this week so I have plenty of time to wallow in nonsensical trivia. To begin with, let me say that I often enjoy non-commercial, non-conventional and non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) That being said, there are many bad movies that are released in countries outside the US. Trust me, I've been tortured by hundreds of them. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly bad movie. <br /> <br /> The half hour of opening is an impressive uninterrupted display of moral degeneration. This film provides some classic morals that belong to the same level as Kim Ki-duk's "Bad Guy" (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. Women really like being raped; 2. Rape must be glorified, praised, and respected; 3. Feel free to rape any woman you like, because as long as you "do" she will eventually begin to like and achieve orgasm; 4. If your wife is raped, be sure to blackmail your rapist for a lot of money, but if he does not pay, repeatedly beat his slut as compensation; 5. If your wife is raped, do not forget to spoil and degrade her the next day while playing the rapist's role, provoking her with phrases such as "Does he like it?"; 6. If you are a husband you are a rapist, just accept; 7. After you are personally raped, make friends with your rapist and go out with him whenever possible. <br /> <br /> How can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters? They are nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives carelessly, but actually revel in meaninglessness and support each other. Do not get me wrong though. I am very capable of enjoying films that portray lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to mine. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting portrayals of sadomasochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an extremely perverted game in child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a blunt accusation of traditional marriage. Even religion-based movies like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) have amused me once in a while. The difference is that these movies actually have some interesting psychological content and character development for them, while "Lost In Beijing" has virtually none. <br /> <br /> It is well known that people with heterodox mentalities exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial display of despicable behavior. Why exactly does Bing Bing eventually make friends and take care of his rapist? Why does a rapist's wife accept her behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was conceived in an inept manner and, in the end, served as a mere situational stratagem. Everything seems very soft and forgettable after the filthy half-hour opening calms down. Other critics here seem to have a confused moral ambiguity with a complex characterization. The reason you can not choose which person to cheer on is because they were not developed properly. Do not think that this movie has complex characters just because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they are not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they are thinking. This is hardly a positive attribute of this film. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the camera work and acting are very good, but everything else gets dull and dull as the movie progresses. You can put this together with trash like "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time Is It There" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002), and the "Bad Guy" mentioned above.
