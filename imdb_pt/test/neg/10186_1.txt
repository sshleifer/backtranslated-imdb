I'm telling people out there, this is just a waste of your time. I'm being honest when I say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just a movement on Christian propaganda! Do not throw away your life, do not see it! <br /> <br /> I think they made the film so that more people would believe in Jesus or something, but it works the opposite way. The actors are all beginners, the story is just confusing! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a work of the devil. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth seeing, so please, follow my advice and do not do it!
