I went to the movies a little apprehensive, left boiling with rage (going through a movie) that I had witnessed. The actors, particularly Travolta, should be ashamed of their participation in this. Clearly the only thing in their minds was the paycheck, no matter the degradation of their talents and us. Travolta needs to do some more "See Who's Talking" movies, since he's back to the level of his pre-Tarantino work. It happens when the LW Talking sequences are better than this. Travolta is no longer the King of Cooling, but the King of Corn. Michael Caine himself admitted to making bad movies for the paycheck, Trvolta should follow suit if he has some self-respect!
