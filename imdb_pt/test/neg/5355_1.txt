This is the worst kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never seem to believe in themselves. White people are monsters who will continue to call two white child rapists on their "good guys" of the 1920s and need to be persuaded that this can be moot for provocation? Are blacks universally inspiring? Does the Ku Klux Klan really stand outside the courts shooting at lawyers without anyone intervening? Do the judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside yelling "Kill it"? Are the blacks really standing side by side with the Klan waiting to hear the verdict? Do the wives really take several months to realize that the husband may be defending a man by unjust hanging because he knew he could have done the same thing? Do juries really absolve murderers because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers actually use a sanity defense to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? Worst of all, any high principles of this film have been lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sex crimes to excite the public. The subject of rape, let alone rape in children's group, really in competent hands here? Is it really a subject that belongs to the hands of Hollywood? And if so, why the completely kidnapping and dispossession of Sandra Bullock? And the statutory violation completely useless against one of the witnesses? It seems the director did not feel so strongly about sex crimes, after all. <br /> <br /> That was to catch the excellent plot of To Kill a Mockingbird and make it a coarse, shallow and tasteless. Shame on them.
