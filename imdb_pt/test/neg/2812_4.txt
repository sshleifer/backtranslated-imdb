The reports of the brilliance of this film seem to have been greatly exaggerated, and unless the other reviewers were watching a different film, I do not see how anyone can find this film anything but tasteless, uncertain, uncertain, excessive, and sometimes unbearably irritating. . I'm not a horror fanatic. I love the j-horrors and horrors of the euro over American horrors at any time, but I feel the need to alert any prospective viewer about this movie before they invest two hours of their lives in it. <br /> <br /> It was so good. A reporter is investigating a series of deaths and bizarre occurrences, which seem ostensibly unrelated, but a series of unnerving tropes seems to connect them - dead pigeons, knocking noises, the presence of strangely tied knots ... Our reporter goes from person to person. person, interviewing them, filming them and then moving on. Three important characters are among this confusion of people, a timid young psychic, an immensely irritating and insane psychic man, and a crazy old woman and her son whose importance is not revealed until later. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie is not at all interesting, which makes its two hour run time unforgivable. Nor is it even remotely scary or scary. Supposedly scary scenes, such as scenes of macabre faces, are incredibly bad, shown twice, or worse, tell us when they are about to happen. Other techniques, such as telling us that a newly interviewed family "died five days later," simply did not make me care, let alone with a slight fear. <br /> <br /> The film draws a little close to the end, as our reporter, cameraman, and cursed psychic woman goes to a village to "remove" the curse that is linking all these deaths. However, at that time, I was in a state of catatonic boredom, and could not care less, so all the camera work and quite scary shocks were wasted on me. The "final tape" is very good, but again, I gave up caring and just wanted this movie to end. <br /> <br /> Flat and boring, not scary and not scary, I advise you to keep away from Noroi. There are promising moments, but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time.
