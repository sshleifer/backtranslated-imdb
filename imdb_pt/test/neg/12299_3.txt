My wife invited my son and I to watch him on cable TV on a lazy Saturday night, thinking that this could play an unusual role for Juliette Lewis. With that promise, at least the movie shows: Your character is ineffective, sticking to almost every cliché of slasher-type horror movies. Just like the movie. A cataloging of their adherence studied to them would be an exercise in remembering something that I hope to forget quickly, so I will not do one. Basically, this is a subject that weighs on the red herrings: everyone seems guilty, rather than just the two suspects from the beginning. The rule "discard the logical and obvious, and what's left is this" rule of bad horror films works well in this. The only surprise that struck me was that he was done with the cliché of the indeterminate end: Jane will keep her commitment to her life-saving attempt, which will tell her the (obvious to the public) identity of the 2nd conspirator, leading her to another round of hysterical victim play. Mercifully, I'll never know.
