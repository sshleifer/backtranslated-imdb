Stanley Kubrick, a director I hold in high esteem for his masterpieces (Orange, 2001, The Killing, Shining, Dr. Strangelove, etc.) took the film out of circulation, leaving it for only the hardcore fans and completists. After seeing the movie for me, I could see why. By the age of twenty-four, Kubrick had perfected his photography career for LOOK magazine and made some short documentaries. Like many beginner filmmakers who came in the decades following him, his ambition for Fear and Desire was, in short, just go and make a film, cheaper, more than likely to see if he could do it. At this level, he was successful. However, the movie itself is definitely not. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the film is a failure, because there was something I liked throughout the film. Even with the story of the film being cast aside, and the actors (whom Kubrick had no idea how to drive, not being a theater man), his talent for producing and capturing great images gets his seeds in this film. . Sometimes there are some close-up scenes and fast scenes in suspense / action scenes that catch the eye. Unfortunately, that's all good I can say about the movie. Although there are some "name" actors in the film (Frank Slivera, who also appeared in Killer's Kiss, and Paul Mazursky, a director by himself), performances are generally dull and very routine. <br /> In fact, this is the main death of the movie for me; whenever I watch any Kubrick movie, even his first noir film, Killer's Kiss and the Killing, I can tell who did it, since his style became distinctive, which would continue as he evolved as an artist. It was not 'artistic' like I could have imagined (which is usually the case with beginning directors like Scorsese and Spielberg) but watching this movie not only made it look like it was not Kubrick, it looked like a lot of the time I was watching some grade film B (or even C) by a director that time forgot - not much 'Ed Wood' bad, but close. Music is as standard as possible, the fades are pedestrian, and the plot does not seem to get much attention. <br /> <br /> In short, as others have already said and I can agree, this is a "Doodle Pad" of a future break-breaker, which shows some shots and some issues that call for some attention (the best scene being when soldiers take the dumb girl hostage), but not enough to really recommend it, except for those, like me, who have just seen everything from Kubrick (or perhaps having to watch every ultra-low budget war movie ever made) , even out of curiosity.
