I thought it was difficult, if not impossible, to watch, not because of the horrors it portrays, but because of the way they were portrayed. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this horror story. What I am opposed to is the idea that the need to denounce, which I endorse, is sufficient. How about showing us the power of powerful cinema. I feel that the filmmaker's eagerness, perhaps even justifiable anger, did not allow him to see clearly from the cinematographic point of view. Or, if this was a cinematographic point of view, I mean, a choice, so I did not like any of it. I was more disturbed by the way the film was filmed than by the film itself. Well-intentioned, I'm sure, but unfortunately, that's not enough.
