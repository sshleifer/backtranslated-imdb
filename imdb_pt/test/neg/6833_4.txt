A ruthless killer was hired to eliminate someone on top of the US government. Constantly changing his identity and location, he is known only as the Jackal. Everything about this killer is a secret. Aware of the Jackal's presence, but uncertain of its purpose, the FBI's deputy director faces the biggest challenge of his career. In order to track down this cold-blooded killer, he and an official of the Russian intelligence rely on the help of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious mercenary before he can complete his mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, then The Jackal is not your movie. It's a slow spy thriller with lots of cool gadgets and weapons. Richard Gere does a good job playing a passionate terrorist who is helping the FBI for a deeper cause than just freedom. And Willis makes a good effort like the Jackal. Movie OK, but nothing more.
