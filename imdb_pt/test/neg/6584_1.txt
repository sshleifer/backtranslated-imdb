The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I Love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION AFTER THIS TITLE OF THE MOVIE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The comments of this film were almost unanimous, saying that this is an instant vacation classic. Ebert & Roeper give two thumbs ENTHUSIASM! Even Ebert's written review gave her four full stars! Wow ... Ok ... this I have to see! But wait ... the motion capture used seems really strange. Hmm ... maybe I'm not so interested in seeing this anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you coming?" says the train driver to the boy on the Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first, and the train begins in its course without him. The boy soon changes his mind and jumps on board at just the right moment. <br /> <br /> Now most of you have probably decided not to jump on this train and wait for TV Train or Rental Express (hee hee, I'm so spirited and smart). I, on the other hand, was like the kid who was skeptical at first, but jumped to see what the mess was. <br /> <br /> I just wasted $ 10 and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can not even begin to explain the pain in my stomach. The Polar Express was so painful to sit on that it's not even funny. There is no story. There is no payment. You sit there through this series of events and you ask yourself "is there any point in all this?" It would be one thing if the scenes were fun ... but they are not. <br /> <br /> This movie has no emotion, no soul, no gram of plausibility, and most of all: any Fun. This movie is not fun. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about the way these characters look for a second. Saying it's the same technology (motion, sorry, "PERFORMANCE" capture) used to make Gollum is a shame because Gollum was believable! Photo-realism simply does not translate well into this medium. Are you using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not just shoot everything with real actors? They certainly could have. We, as people, know very well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen made in an unconvincing way is not impressive. Caricatures made convincingly are even more believable, as the Incredibles have proved. The result of the Polar Express now is as if they pick up the corpses of dead children and turn them into puppets. They are moving and talking, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? That's what we're seeing on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br /> <br /> There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where the kid takes the train ticket from a girl from his seat because she got up and left. He wants to give it to her, but you sit there "because ??" Just leave it ... it's coming back! He, of course, loses the ticket and "adventure" follows. And then there's a boy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring hot chocolate to him, but he can not come and join the rest of the kids? And then there's this annoying kid "knows everything" in the voice of a 35-year-old boy. It's all very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh and there are songs! A girl enters the back of the train where the lonely boy is. He's singing a song for himself. And then she interrupts and joins! They finish the song while holding hands, looking into each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very strange. I will not go into detail about the song about serving hot chocolate while waiters dance around the train. "keep warm, keep warm!" The only scene in which Tom Hanks slides to his knees with his arms stretched out in the air should be one of the most inopportune scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I'll kill myself. I need to watch something bad to clean the palette. Yes ... drug is better than Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The only thing about trains, no matter where you're going, what matters is deciding to move on." <br /> <br /> Do not take this one. For God's sake, I decided for you! This is just another movie taken from an incredibly thin film-shaped stretched kid's book. It happened with the Grinch and The Cat in the Hat and those were horrible too. But who can blame them? I bet if I took Berenstein Bears' book The Much Junk Food and made it into a long one, it would probably be pretty boring, too. But at least ... there would be a story and a point, and that's what the Polar Express is so lacking.
