who is responsible for these things "behind the scenes"? Who are these actors? they crawled out of the rocks? 'yuks, many yuks!' do not. not yuks to me Just hate and shame I'm a human being. I have to divert my eyes from the set, it's so embarrassing. Actually, I changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with robin williams' without stopping 'I forgot my lithium today' rantings, but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. seeing someone who is not funny at all in robin williams is like having each tooth in the head pulled slowly and sadly, without novocaine, for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Stop making those absolutely horrifying TV movies. please.
