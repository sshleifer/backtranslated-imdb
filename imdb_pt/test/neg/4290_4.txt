Respected Western author, Budd Boetticher is woefully out of place with this story of modern cops and thieves who suffers from a strong lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have given up on rehearsal time and contented himself with the first take, while Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles, delivering the lines flat and powerless. <br /> <br /> Employee of gentle ways Leon "Foggy" Poole works as a man inside a bank that goes badly and leaves his wife dead in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately decides to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. Hundreds of police officers are deployed to prevent him from getting to the intended home that has been moved to another location, but you do not know, in the final moments of the film, that we have dragged Foggy feet behind the victim (who somehow thought he would get a bus back to the house was a sound move), while a police company watch and fight over what action to take. Does it seem absurd? You should see that. It's all that and more. <br /> <br /> Lucien Ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs, but the editing is uninteresting and deformed and drains the film from its suspense and rhythm. Like Poole, Corey Wendell is the best thing in the movie that can evoke great sympathy as it transitions from gentle to murderous soul. These attributes, in addition to the killer, fail uniformly in construction and execution, leaving their message clear. Go Old West Budd
