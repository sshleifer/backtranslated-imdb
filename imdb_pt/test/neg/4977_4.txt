And now to another point of view: I did not like it. I have not really finished. I know that "Unforgiven" is classified by some as one of the biggest westerns ever made. I know that star and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know you won a lot of Oscars. Still, I did not like that. I do not like Westerns, and this is clearly a matter of taste, but I also do not admire Eastwood's acting. He is not and has never been a man of leadership. He is neither Burt Lancaster nor Paul Newman nor John Wayne. Only in this film is he overshadowed by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; both are actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a nervous voice who usually plays tough guys. Here he plays a retired hard guy. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his performance. Then there is the anti-Western plan of the West. Obviously, it is intended to inject contemporary values-a respect for the role of women, blacks, Native Americans, and single-parent families; a disrespect for violence and drinking; the health that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage and adorable little children - in a century in which those values ​​were not necessarily accepted, at least in those ways. Promoting these values, the film appears as educated, if not as a sermon. Then there are the stereotypes of the movie - prostitutes with hearts of gold, the kid who does not know how to film right, the youngest town in the wild west, the wise brush shining on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in great chords. Finally, there is the rhythm of Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still heading north, talking to Morgan Freeman and the kid who could not shoot right sixty minutes after the plot driven by a prostitute coup was fired. It was very slow. Someone had to find these elements to unpack. I'm afraid it was me.
