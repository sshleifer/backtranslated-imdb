Douglas Sirk's inaugural "portrait of women" for Universal, based on a didactic and dogmatic novel by the intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of that other piece of shit, * The Robe *). Rock Hudson, in the role that catapulted him to stardom, plays Bob Merrick, a million-dollar drunken playboy who is more interested in pursuit skirts and speedboats than finishing his medical school. In the first scene, he destroys his boat on a sumptuously photographed lake. The accident nearly kills Merrick, and so he requires a mysterious "resuscitation machine" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, across the city, beloved surgeon Dr. Phillips finally falls dead of heart disease. Because the local hospital can keep only one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies so the lice can live. When Merrick learns of this, he tries to make apologetic proposals for the Phillips family, especially for the widow (Jane Wyman, hairstyle and tidy up in an arrogant matron), but in fact everyone who knows the surgeon spits on Merrick as a pair of snakes . A hospital staff doctor even calls it "a total waste" that the playboy lived instead of the surgeon like that of Christ. Hippocrates could have something to say about it! <br /> <br /> These early scenes are where you will find the typical Sirkian iconoclasm: the director rubs our faces so much in the displeasure of the middle class, mid-century. America, the one who is hoping for the abandoned playboy to put pillows of soot beneath the braggart of these moral hypocrites. But unfortunately, no: the laughable plot of the novel must go on, and Merrick soon finds himself being converted by God under the guise of Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better man and even a better painter. (We do not see anything of this incredible art?) We learned that Dr. Phillips, intolerable and omnipresent, often refused payment for medical services rendered (though who exactly qualifies for these "magnificent exemptions" is never clarified). This should give our hero a whole new vision of life and an example of personal conduct. Kruger even tries to make it sound very illicitly exciting: "Once you start this thing, there's no escape from it! It's an obsession ... a MAGNIFICENT obsession!" Then, Merrick tries again to attack the widow with apologetic openings, but somehow causes her to be run over by a car. She loses sight. Apparently, Merrick will have several other cross-stations to pass before he can be considered a decent fellow. <br /> <br /> But Sirk continues to sneak in his revenge as the movie grows ever more. preach. The most obvious part should be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as chief hospital nurse and friend of Wyman and unrequited lesbian lover. Note the deception on Moorehead's face when Merrick, finally rescued as a physician, appears to save Wyman's life near the end. Hudson's own homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at the time, is also used with great ironic effect. He and Wyman - sloppy and fifteen years older - generate absolutely zero erotic heat in their scenes together, which, by the way, are purposely few, presumably because more scenes among the stars would irrevocably expose the whole enterprise. (Of one thing we are sure: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with anything, it certainly was not Jane Wyman.) It is a chronic case of * Tea and Sympathy *. Sirk seemed to enjoy tinkering with everyone's nose for having this gay actor - who was appealing to the innocent ladies of the day - coldly wandering through these exquisitely colorful "pictures of women". In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 times, for best effect in following this film, All That Heaven Allows *, which re-teamed Hudson with Wyman, but was also accompanied by a realistic plot. Meanwhile, in Obsession, we must endure that God / Kruger will look benevolently through a window of observation for Merrick and his medical staff as they prepare to save Wyman's life, along with a musical score of exaggerated vocals from a coral of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But to see why Sirk is considered an author, check out the scene in which Wyman explains to his adult daughter that she can in fact tell the difference of day and night. The whole picture is darkened here: the daughter is barely visible, and Wyman's face is slightly trimmed against a dim light. She goes on to say she hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come back." A great chilling moment that deserves a much better movie than * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
