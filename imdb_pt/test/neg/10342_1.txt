Far from combining the best bits of Pontypool and 28 days, this managed to ignore them. While blatantly copy them. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and got progressively more tense, this just stinks. The radio DJ, "we should stay in the air" spends effectively without air time. He sits on his ass and watches the TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie of all time. Is there a single person in the US or even the world who does not know what a zombie is? Or have you heard of the word "zombie"? Well, at 50 minutes this bunch of misfits is still calling the zombies, "the infected" or those with "rage." The word "zombie" can make an appearance later, I could care less. Where do you have to pay to use certain words? As the Bluetooth headset is called "the little ear" I'm not kidding! To finish, no plot + no acting = no one cares. A waste of time, an unashamed, badly run rip-off.
