Undoubtedly this is the WORSE comic book movie, all done. PERIOD!! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (1989). Yes ... worse than the 1979 and 1991 films of Captain America. Ah yes, it's even worse, so Christopher Reed wrote the movie Superman IV: Quest for Peace. Sheeshh .. this movie was so bad that the guy who played Nuclear Man just starred in another movie and it was only on Tv. = OP <br /> <br /> This movie is of "D" quality. I had the chance to watch it on the science fiction channel in 1997. I had heard it was very bad, but there was nothing else to do that night, so I thought I'd take a look. What a waste of an hour and a half. I would have been better off watching the reruns of Different Strokes. In addition to having the most pessimistic and worst acting special effects I've ever seen, the whole script was horrible and was not well directed at all. Luckily a new Fantastic Four movie is being made and we hope this release does justice to the heroes. I was hoping for a new movie in the future, but it has not yet materialized. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this movie. If you happen to see it being televised by cable, check it out. Be warned though, you'll enjoy launching the channel after the first 15 minutes.
