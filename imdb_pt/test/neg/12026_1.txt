You know, I really hate the IMDb censorship system, since all my criticism is almost over if you take away the curse. But here we go. Editing time! <br /> <br /> Holy moley is so bad. I thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since you know I've blindly rented jewelry like Frailty and American Nightmare before. But this is just abominable. It's about a murderer who uses the works of Edgar Allen Poe as a reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him. These captivating hacks can not make a good movie without contaminating the grave of a great horror writer? That is to say, the deaths here are completely devoid of thought or originality, and the references to Poe are false and false, without sufficient thought placed on them. They are shallow and put Poe's job ashamed. Full of holes, with horrible sequencing. The acting is bad too, reminding me of the abortion that was known in some Third World countries as "Fear X", with all the pause lines and no emotion. <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an indie. movie, but that's no excuse. I've seen high school kids do better than these idiots, and I could have done better death scenes myself and a better plot with plenty of time. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to exist. Avoid at all costs.
