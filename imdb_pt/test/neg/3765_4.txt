I like this movie and have seen my copy twice since I got it a few weeks ago. But you have to see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I did not check the dates, but I bet this movie came out later and certainly at about the same time as the popularies of Collier and Walt Disney. the vision of space flight being promoted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to appear factually correct and scientific. However, while certain ideas are put (step boosters, for example) more or less correctly, other things are wrong hilarious. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space ... as you reach the top of a flight of stairs and turn to the landing! Then we are told that, by rotating in the direction of Earth's rotation, the total speed of the craft is increased accordingly. <br /> <br /> This is a misunderstood hilarious of what actually happens. Most space launch centers are located as close as possible to the equator, where the Earth and anything on its surface are spinning at a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket leaving for space, eastwards (the same as the rotation of the planet). ). Of course, if the spacecraft turned west once in space, its velocity relative to the Earth's surface would be higher, but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle. Decsribed in this movie as "air speed"! Similarly, we are told that travelers only feel free fall, or "weightlessness" when they reach thousands of miles off the Earth, outside the gravitational field of the planets. Again, comically incorrect. Most manned spacecraft do not go beyond a few hundred miles, but while they (and their contents, including the crew) are traveling at a proper rate that their momentum in an outer direction balances the pull of gravity inward, they orbit downward free. Of course, traveling far enough from Earth and even a slow object goes beyond the Earth's gravity, but to get out of Earth's orbit, out (towards the Moon, for example) requires obtaining the "escape velocity", about twenty-one thousand miles an hour. Thus, the vehicle will already have reached "orbital velocity" (and "no weight") by definition. <br /> <br /> But the film has things much more hilarious than that. Someone decided it would be more fun if they lost the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find out that they had accidentally gone to Mars! The captain then ruminated that this must have been a divine intervention! At that point, any pretense of being scientific is ripped apart in small pieces like confetti and thrown to the wind amidst the joyful dance of an ever-louder conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The strength of a film like this, in fact, is in illustrating "how far we've come". No less in attitudes for women. The patronizing dribble heaped on the female crew member is hilarious and also shocking. To think such attitudes were so recently "normal". <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, I find this movie very entertaining. As one night, the lights go out in the travel novel in outer space, from the perspective of the days before it actually happens. An antidote to the cold routine of space flights, as it has now become in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending. It is both courageous and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.
