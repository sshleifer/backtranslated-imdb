The beginning of the film was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I found in my Netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips teaming up again from Bully. Unfortunately "interesting" never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does what she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) of the "crowd" and eventually gets to stick with them. And, of course, like all the other movies, things are good (or so you assume, since the movie never suggests that things are good) and then things do not look so good when you get rich kids. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no spikes and vouchers. It's just a dead lifeless movie that after watching it, you feel like you could have done something better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) do not even make sense in being in the movie because the director and the writer did not follow, at all. <br /> <br /> All the interesting things that could have thrown away was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching one before the episode of stars (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison of the OC). <br /> <br /> The only bright light in this movie, and the reason it does not get a ONE rating is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her in it. Renfro looks like he brought some of his character from Bully. And, for God's sake, the title is BS, change the name.
