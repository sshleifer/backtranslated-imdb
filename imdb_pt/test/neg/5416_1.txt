That was so bad, I want God to give me another two hours of life having to go through it. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was uniformly bad. There was only one plot, unless "Shaggy dog ​​story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" account. <br /> <br /> The issue was all over the place, and the slow-mo shots of "blood" (corn syrup flying through the air - no doubt played with a spoon) became annoying after the tenth time, and infuriating after the hundredth time. <br /> I like Michael Rooker. He did a good job. That was not good. That was less than good. And with that, I mean it sucked. Difficult. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, do not watch this movie.
