Originally I wrote what was a sarcastic and blunt review of this pathetic piece of dung, but every time I submitted the review I got "this contains a very long word that is not allowed", also words that were not spelled incorrectly were judged incorrect . <br /> <br /> Now, the word that has long been judged has never been identified. After numerous attempts to eliminate words, I ended up having the suspicion that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically. was obscene or racist in itself. But after deleting all the longer words, the same message was repeated several times, also words that were not judged wrong were all considered to be suddenly wrong! <br /> <br /> PC police are everywhere.
