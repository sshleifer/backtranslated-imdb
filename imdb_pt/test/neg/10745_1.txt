Dear Mr. Dante, dude, seriously ... the title of the show is "Masters of Horror". And anyway, it's supposed to be an opportunity to show off your horror chops, to show the world why you deserve to be called the "master" of the genre. Apparently, you misunderstood the exercise. Apparently you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And his attempt is unpleasant, arrogant and, above all, preaching. <br /> <br /> The only reason ANYONE scored their lowest score is because their political views match theirs and they are the kind of person who does not mind having that kind of politics in their throats. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, do not give a damn what you believe, they believe, or I believe ... I just want such obvious messages (not subtle) and bland (not satire) of my horror. And while there were certainly other "Masters of the Horror" that were great disappointments time or where I was usually confused why this director (william malone?) Would be considered a "master" genre ... its not much beyond the rest for just missing the whole point of the series. <br /> <br /> So, next time ... can you please just keep your preaching policy to yourself?
