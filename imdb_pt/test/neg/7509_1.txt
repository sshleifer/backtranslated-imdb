Once a month, I invite some friends to a "Movie Night Delayed". We are looking forward to movies that are so bad that they are funny or movies that know they do not have a plot and show many chests. Last night we had the misfortune to have Zombie Planet as one of our movies. Cinematography is on par with what we are accustomed to, but acting was a different story. The lead role is played by Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie, who did not get a role in a high school play, let alone in a LOW ECONOMY horror film. Our undecided hero, who could not tell whether he wanted to be a tough guy in this scene or a weeping coward, was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that I had to stop early during a delay. Movie night. It had the possibility of greatness with a great turnaround in the standard zombie infection, but they took a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. I personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. However, it's a shame that I've already invited some people last night to suffer 80% of this movie with me.
