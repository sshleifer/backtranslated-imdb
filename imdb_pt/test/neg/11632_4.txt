Some changes for the better (special effects are more elaborate), some for worse (Scott Grimes, a nice boy in the original, has turned into a clumsy teenager), but usually this sequel is almost the same as the original - which does not say much. The classification of PG-13 is questionable; although the film is not at all scary, there is a brief but rather explicit story and some nudity out of place. (* 1/2)
