This is a tedious movie. The real villains are the awkward adaptation (it's embarrassingly easy to say that the original material was a novel) and shrewd script. <br /> <br /> On the credit side, considering that the budget was tight due to the austerity of wartime, the look of the film is not all bad. And the performances are largely OK, except Phyllis Calvert, who is incredible - a miracle considering the potential for elegance, a hole in which she definitely does not fall. Calvert, with much less to continue, is as talented as Olivia de Havilland in And the Wind Took. <br /> <br /> The absolutely unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terribly conceived description of a Negro. serving boy. It does not matter that he is a nice character. Misunderstood by a white boy in black makeup, it is impossible to get around this example of condescending racism. <br /> Grim.
