Supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of UFOs with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic on the whole case and the other an Australian, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the foolishness of UFOs. It's all a pot of clay, some kind of money making noise. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this movie is really a mistake, and a trap to actually enact the Christian teachings and the Christian explanation of UFOs, which I've heard before. This is an ad hoc explanation which in itself is not biblical, but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. The paranormal? It is real, just demonic, unless it occurs in a Christian context, so, of course, it's from God. Simple, if it is not from God, it is from the devil, idiot! So, I suppose that since Beethoven's 9th symphony was not inspired by God, it must have been written under demonic influence. Or logic would take ad absurdum. <br /> <br /> We are told that since the Bible does not speak of life on other planets in the Universe, so there is none (a version of the Ad Ignorantium fallacy) and that God created the Universe so great, so great to show us his almighty power. I think of Carl Sagan's observation that if God created such a large Universe and had life only on Earth, it would have been a tremendous waste of space. <br /> <br /> So, what are UFOs? They are a demonic activity and concern the brief Christian event, the rupture ... I mean the rapture. Before the tribulation, the true Christians will disappear from the face of the earth in mass, causing mass panic, confusion, car and airplane accidents. Therefore, Satan, knowing this, is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction, which can then be used to explain this otherwise inexplicable event. It is all part of Satan's plan, which, of course, prevents people from looking at God or Jesus and falling into the lies of the Antichrist. This ad hoc explanation also typifies theological confusion explaining one mystery to another, as opposed to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange and the mysterious as far as possible, first by the known, if not only by known. <br /> <br /> It's like jumping straight into an alien. abduction whenever a child is missing or missing. I think I would first look at more mundane explanations as the child ran away, got lost, or was kidnapped to rescue or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or Satan or something. This kind of fraud or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, since young people are often attracted to the Free Rock Concerts, which can start with something innocuous, and suddenly switch to Christian music, followed for a sermon and a sermon. called the altar. That kind of blatant deception one might think would be another Satan ball game. But perhaps because the Christian faith is about to burst, these guys think it's worth anything, any deception, cheating or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep alive the faith, which faces serious opposition from secularists and also competing Faiths like Islam , the fastest growing religion in the world that can replace Christianity, since Islam is much more cohesive and unified, and logically more sustainable than Christian fundamentalism. While this should offer little benefit to mankind, such as replacing one system of intolerant thinking with another. <br /> And, of course, the film ends more or less with a variant of Pascal's bet. The atheist aussie who is skeptical about almost everything is told. Well, if you're right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, do not worry ... but what if you're wrong? <br /> <br /> Basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic point of view or Christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or fallacy in black and white. Even if atheists are wrong it would not necessarily make Christianity right by default, nor if Christianity is full of holes in its theology, that materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default. <br /> <br /> For all of us, Native American spirituality can be the best description of the ultimate reality and we could all have treated Earth and its creatures a little better. <br /> <br /> This movie must be stamped in the box: Warning: Contains Religious Propaganda and is not for informational or entertaining purposes.
