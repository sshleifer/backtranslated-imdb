'Rise of the Footsoldier' ​​follows the relentlessly cruel gangster Carlton Leach and his associates through drugs, violence, sex, violence, guns, violence and I mentioned violence? <br /> <br /> Protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett), member of ICF (Inner City Firm); a group of football hooligans who became professional gangsters, guides the public during the events that led to the 1995 Range Rover Killings, in which three gang members were victims of particularly cruel "successes." Leach's success as a doorman and talent for finding appropriately violent friends to control unruly customers in a local nightclub puts him in the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters, profiting from the rave scenes of the 1980s and 1990s and the culture of damn it. <br /> <br /> Opening with brutally realistic pictures of dead men, the viewer is thirsty to understand what happened, but left totally dissatisfied. The next 2 hours go through a series of countless introductions of characters. Each of them basically establishes another typical "tough man", shows him attacking generally unworthy victims, before likely coming to an even more unpleasant end. The little emotional understanding that the audience is allowed to train for some of the characters (for example, a family man charged with lost drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are killed in an anti-climatic manner, or their story is not resolved. Suggestions for a plot introduced at the outset are inadequately completed with vague impressions of how the murders occurred, as events are matched with little reward for persevering with the nebulous confusion of past events. <br /> <br /> This film was made with a standard formula in mind, for an audience that prefers violence and slang 'ard nut' to a real plot. 'Rise of the Footsoldier' ​​borrows too much from the 'Football Factory', leaving out the good bits, not demonstrating moral ramifications of hooligan subculture or establishing empathy with the protagonist. Violence, though brilliantly triggered, seems excessive and implausible, because no one is around long enough for the public to form an emotional connection. The implication that gangs are untouchable by the police is fairly fair, but macaws regularly committing shameless murders in public places push the imagination of the most willing spectator. The public is bewildered by the relevance of many important events and developed characters that have no impact on the final conclusion. Attempt of 'sandy realism' is further wrecked with a substance called 'Serum of Truth', which the Turkish mafia uses to get honest answers from unwilling individuals. This is NOT the genre in which to invent psychologically unrealistic drugs, and makes interrogation almost absurd. <br /> <br /> Real scenes of violence (before they become repetitive) maintain some tension, combined with fast flashes of color or the end of a film roll. Perfectly choreographed fights, combined with unsteady but effective handheld work, save the movie, but unfortunately the plot (or lack thereof) limits it to a demographic niche. In essence, the events of this film is based on are not deservedly represented, and a suitably sequential plot is sacrificed by stereotyped characters and a non-original plot. This movie has a place in the market, but if you like a little brain with its brutality, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
