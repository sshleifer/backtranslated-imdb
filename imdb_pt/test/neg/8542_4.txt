Jess Franco makes exploration films, and he made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking movies in movie history, and God bless him for it. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a really horrible movie that does not live up to its usual standards. <br /> <br /> Exploration films should be judged by history, sex and blood. What else is there? This movie fails on most of these benchmarks. The plot is thin paper, putting a nubile girl in the jungle among the cannibals. We did not really receive information on why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected, her father is the "Big White Chief" and she becomes a goddess, sitting on trees, naked. Add fortune hunters and gems, and you have your basic rescue the girl to plot line of greedy intentions. The characters are in stock, not adding a gram of credibility to the process. <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This film is often mentioned along the same lines as the classic Italian cannibal films. Those who seek this kind of blood need to run to the other side. Except for a cheap title, this film presents surprisingly little blood and courage. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that the only reason this movie exists is that Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto could compete. around naked. In fact, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) makes the heavy frontal lift, while the two ladies of the jungle are bare-chested. Yes, there are scenes of love ... probably the most sterile Franco has ever supervised. Women are beautiful, but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either. <br /> <br /> This movie smells of low-budget buffoonery. The sets are laughable. The acting is horrible and the editing is confusing. There is no real story to keeping it together, not a budget (or effort) enough to shock or excite. I think Franco's fans expect more from the exploration master.
