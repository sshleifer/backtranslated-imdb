All Grown up had a lot to live for and there was a lot of hype when this show was announced. Now it's easy to explain why it did not live up to expectations: first, it failed to create a realistic world of preteens in the same way that the Rugrats captured the world and the imagination of small children. Second, the characters in the series are stereo (Angelica: pampered blonde unlike Suzie: modest family color girl, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and boring (Dil). Finally, there is an ounce of innovation or an original storyline. To summarize, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a series of sequences for a show like Rugrats. It is annoying, it lacks imagination and it seems that the producers do not even know how it behaves from 10 to 13 years. To be exact, should not Angelica and Suzie compare bra sizes instead of discussing who is best at household chores?
