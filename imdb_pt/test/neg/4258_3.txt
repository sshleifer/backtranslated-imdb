Nishabd means without words. This must be the condition of the script before the beginning of this movie and therefore throughout this film, it cries out for content. What you are looking for is an unusual love story between a 60 year old man and an 18 year old girl and what you get are very common, very common events that do not excite or surprise. So what we have is finally with the picturesque sites of Kerala, filmed brilliantly by the director of photography Amit Roy and the camera-friendly histrionics of the newly discovered Jiah Khan. This does not cover the lack of a concrete script. Director-producer Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good record of films, needs to get his socks off. As far as Mr. Bachchan is concerned, I do not want to discuss it in the context of this film. While reviewing, I'm feeling a loss of words. I'm speechless, speechless! <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: This movie can be compared to an equally bad movie released some time ago called BLACK. I do not see the difference between the main characters' histrionics in both films. What did you say now? It was a world class cinema, blah blah, and I do not have good taste. Well, take a walk. No, I do not mean literally, but real to the theaters showing this movie. Because in that case you may find this movie to be Oscar-level material.
