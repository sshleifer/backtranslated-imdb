First I must say that I liked the first movie of the underworld. I was intrigued and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so on. In this last part (I hope) of the series, I only feel sorry for how pathetic the vampires are. At least in the first part you had tight leather clothes ... now vampires seem besieged victims of pest control problems. They look and act like haughty, white, hairless humans. <br /> <br /> Some ideas were cool ... the whole thing with the human nobles was interesting. Too bad the performance was abysmal. The slave thing was also viable. <br /> <br /> Other things struck me as pathetic. Spoilers now. Castle walls that can be skipped in a few steps? Enemies that do not attack during the day? Big bad old vampires that take centuries to join the fight and then run away from a high school leader after a minute or so? Werewolves who approach their enemies? Lycans who attack arsenals ... for what? They do not use axes and swords or armor! A vampire leader so inept can he get almost everyone against him? The novel is so unconvincing that it is sad. <br /> <br /> So, I do not recommend this movie unless you get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some of the action is good for OK. Certainly the armor and weapons of the vampires are interesting. Otherwise a very weak script that has been misplaced and uses all sorts of futile twists.
