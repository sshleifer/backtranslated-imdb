I would label this program as horrendous if it were not for being on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it's on FOX and it's being renovated while the AD has been canceled. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this program really is. But let me try to describe it. Take an extremely low Archie Bunker and make him stutter a mood that would be outdated if you were in Married with Children. So get great AD lines (the son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and change them so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you watch this, I will completely lose the respect for you as well as your family. However, if you are a fan, you must love the new FOX 'Til Death comedy. It sounds really funny and cutting edge. I mean, married couples do not get along ... brilliant.
