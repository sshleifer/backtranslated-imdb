First of all, this is one of the worst "direct thriller" for the cable I've ever seen in my life. Of course, as all erotic thrillers want to do, it is a brothel lady and is set up in a brothel. This, of course, makes the simulated softcore sex that pops up every 10 minutes feels "in context." Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> Forget for a moment that it never meant to win any prize. The actors are terrible and their line reading made me shudder. The woman who plays the cop is so bad she's beyond description. She must really be a good friend of the guys who set the film up for this terrible adventure, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Production figures are only slightly higher than pornography. Besides that? I suppose if you're really drunk and need something to laugh at, this would be a perfect movie. And if that is the case, I recommend fast forwarding to all scenes with the female police officer. What's that accent, Brooklyn? Hilarious!
