Okay, I'm 26, so I went through all the 80's hype of action heroes, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the guys were my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of a round only;) I saw the ad of this movie on TV a few days ago - Chuck Norris was throwing some fireballs from his fingers. WOW! "This is a shitty movie," I said. And indeed it was. Just much worse. It is very difficult to see the whole film - stuffed with religious thoughts, ridiculous monsters like zombies, who serve Satan, the whole idea of ​​a plot set in some forgotten community that represents all humanity - is a load of Christian fundamentalists wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, even in the movies, but this one lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with a common sense, come on, Chuck Norris playing an ANGEL whose work is care for the little town, where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so straightforward and boring, not mentioning its foolishness (yes, it's not stupidity anymore, we're talking nonsense like ... like a retarded kid's joke) make quite a terrible movie, done as much as I suppose for the most old people very dedicated to the Catholic Church because the young spectators laugh at almost every scene. Technically is incorrect, the fx is worse than the ones you saw in the early 90's in the TV series, the plot looks VERY stupid, the actors could be easily switched to cardboard stands, not mentioning the song that, as far as I I heard it was played on a children's toy piano. I've seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (from the bottom list of IMDb) like 'Space Mutiny' or 'Manos - hands of fate', but believe me, nothing compares to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly-acted thing. film that brings some student jokes into my mind rather than regular production. Avoid this. At all costs avoid it. There is nothing to laugh about. Chuck Norris officially finished his film career.
