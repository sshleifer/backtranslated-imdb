Family Guy is easily one of the worst shows I've ever forced myself to watch (not deep down though - I've seen the Jersey Shore). A popular success among high school and college kids who confuse immaturity with nervousness, this program is unoriginal and obsolete. <br /> <br /> As this was dubbed comedy, let's take a look at his "mood". 1. Random flashbacks / cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut out for an automatic laugh. He got old after 5 or more reps per episode. Simple Solution: Every time you hear "This is worse than / as time ...", turn your ears on. <br /> <br /> 2. Impropriety by itself. This show is famous for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot. Solution: Watch South Park. They did everything right. <br /> <br /> The main point is that Family Guy is not worth your time, and do not keep an eye on the Simpsons.
