This film is pathetic not because it is misdirected, represented, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it is really difficult to ruin a movie using an ABBA soundtrack - but unfortunately that is the only thing that the movie succeeds do . The musical performances of the film, SouthPark, were much better than in Mama Mia. The director of Mama Mia is proof that you do not need the talent to be a director - all you need is ABBA songs. <br /> <br /> Just to give a taste of horror: An old Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in the strong sunlight singing and just spoiling the music with all the distracted wrinkles on her face. Why do it with one of the most talented actresses out there?
