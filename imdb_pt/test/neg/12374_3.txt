Before we begin, I can say that I hope you have already eaten when you are reading this. Because? Because, after seeing this movie for the first time, the look and sound of the bird made me want to eat chicken after the words 'The End' appeared on the screen. So do not say you were not warned. Fred Sears could have directed "Earth vs. the Flying Discs" (a good movie and one of the greatest examples of Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"), but "The Giant Claw" is not that giant movie . Yes, it is a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities, and occasionally it is a man on a parachute. The beast is giant, except in scenes where it is considerably smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? Spooky? It could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like a doll that ran away from Sesame Street.
