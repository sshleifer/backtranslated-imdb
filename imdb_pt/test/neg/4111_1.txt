This movie reminds me of old B movies, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it would be a parody of one of those early science fiction films. The terrible acting, the plastic props and the remarkable visual effects gave me that impression. <br /> <br /> But no, the movie is really that bad. The story is a complete nonsense, the effects are below the level of a TV production; even the editing is a mess. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, even though I was sure it would be silly (and it was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend your time and money.
