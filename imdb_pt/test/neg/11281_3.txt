This very loose retelling of Carmen begins with a high note, with a latent and sexually frank dance between the Senegalese prisoner Karmen and her prison guard, but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite in any coherent film. One minute Karmen is all sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest to his unjust government, and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film deserves praise for postulating the first bisexual carnivore "Karmen", the broad strokes he paints are so vignet-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes out as a schizophrenic, undisciplined mix of "Instinct-Instinct" finds "Bound" and finds an African version of a Bollywood musical.
