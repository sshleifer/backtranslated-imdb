I just can not believe the people who made and performed this movie really took it seriously. SNL skits seem more real. Everything was ridiculously false. The pathetic shootings, the ridiculous fights, the dialogue, the background music and even the blind eye of Bo. If it had been announced as a comedy, it would still have made more sense, but it would still be bad. I can see this as "entertainment" only if you have a room full of college college kids watching as if it were Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you saw in Blazing Saddles, like Mongo knocking down the horse or the old lady punching her in the stomach. Now imagine that the producer wants you to take the scenes seriously and you will understand the things of this disaster.
