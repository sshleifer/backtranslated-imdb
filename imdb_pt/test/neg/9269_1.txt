It's hard to decide where to start. I bought this for a few pounds and it's the worst I've ever missed. The back of the DVD had no photos and a few lines sum up the plot, this should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies to laugh at so I decided to give it a try. The film is composed of three short stories, each spinning around someone who was on a particular bus at one point (it was never clear what the meaning of the bus is or what city it is located in). POSSIBLE SPOILERS (as if there was something to be spoiled) The first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car, purcahse, against the wishes of his wife. The car is like a demonic Brum and takes over. your life. <br /> <br /> The second is about a sloppy man who never cleans his refrigerator and a monstrous bacterium grows with him. <br /> <br /> The third about a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to find out her date is not all that normal. <br /> <br /> Among these, we are treated to bus shots (or a bus anyway) while a narrator whittles on a load of junk about relationships (in fact, it's as if he's on commission to say 'relationships') <br /> <br /> The film actually has no redeeming features. The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are all disgus There is not even any female cast member appealing to admire. Simply put, this movie is a disaster.
