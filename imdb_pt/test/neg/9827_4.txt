"Jefferson in Paris" is a truly confusing film. He presents Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) in the most unfavorable light possible, painting him as a liar, racist and pedophile, but offers no remnant of condemnation for these sins. This is the way it was, the movie seems to say. End of the sentence, end of the movie, the door is behind you. <br /> <br /> After arriving in Paris with his daughter Patsy (Gwenyth Paltrow), Jefferson goes on to win the heart of Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the wife. of a homosexual English painter (the criminally underused Simon Callow). A turn of events sends Mary to England, however, and Jefferson begins to forget her with astonishing speed for a man who, a few minutes earlier, was asking her to live with him in America. <br /> <br /> He is bewitched, you know, by Sally Hemmings (Thandie Newton), one of his slaves has just arrived from America. It is hard to say why he is bewitched - although Sally is undeniably beautiful, she acts like a simple-minded child in front of Jefferson. When she is not telling ghost stories in exaggerated speech patterns, she is sneaking around his room, practically exuding a desire for her distinctive mass. <br /> <br /> If her behavior is an attempt to excuse Jefferson, it does not work. Jefferson curses himself even more when Mary, tired of waiting for her letters, travels from England to see him. I did not change for you, he insists, offering weak excuses not to write. To her credit, Maria sees through her brazen lies immediately. When Sally appears, and she and Jefferson flirt openly (and cruelly, in my opinion) in Mary's very presence, the illusion completely flushes. <br /> <br /> No one today believes that Jefferson, Washington, and the rest were fully paradigms of virtue and morality. However, we must believe that the illustrious and illustrious Jefferson would be attracted to Sally, a woman whose most intelligent conversation is about how "French mass friends do not make a corn" and rubs herself in front when she passes, right before the eyes From Maria? <br /> <br /> Even if we let it go, it is followed by the horrifying revelation that Sally was only 15 when this case happened (Jefferson was 41). Strangely, this only happens at the end, when Sally's brother, James, is furious with the announcement that she is carrying Jefferson's son. <br /> <br /> Jefferson is equally indifferent when Sally is carrying his son. and condescendingly tells her that she would be much better under his protection than free and living in France with her brother. But, he promises, I'll free her when she dies and our children (including anything else that comes, says Jefferson, in a chilling statement from Sally as * her *) when they turn 21. Oh thank you, dough, you feel like telling the screen. Big Deal. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is yet to come, however, involving Jefferson's daughter, Patsy. She is already angry with him, first by breaking his promise, made to his mother on his deathbed, not to remarry. (Obviously, the woman was not just talking about marriage.) Jefferson also refused to allow Patsy to become a nun as she wishes, despite the earlier moralizing on freedom of religion (which seems to mean freedom to agree with him). Having promised Sally and his brother their freedom, Jefferson calls on Patsy to witness the agreement and promise to keep it if anything happens to him. Sally's brother misses the child's imminent birth, and Jefferson asks, "Do you swear?" Paltrow's performance in this scene is brilliant, although she has almost nothing to say. Her face almost writhes in agonizing pain at this revelation, but she controls her pain and whispers yes. <br /> <br /> Anything, and the filmmakers might have had something if they had emphasized this point more, "Jefferson in Paris" is an indication of the status of women in the late eighteenth century, even seen by men like Jefferson as Attractive property, pleasant but without true intellect or soul. We see Jefferson shed a few tears over a letter from Mary obviously telling him where to hang out, but he is soon laughing at a wild Sally dance, with loose hair and raised chest. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this is a precise picture of Jefferson or not. I do not mind watching it, just for the sake of watching it. This Jefferson is not a hero or an anti-hero. He's a selfish, child-molesting liar - and one who gets along with it - is not the kind of man I want to see a movie.
