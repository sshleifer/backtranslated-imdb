Michael Allred's comic stories, particularly his work on Madman, are often very entertaining. "Astroesque," Allred's indie film without a budget, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> The worst performance ever associated with truly horrible dialogue is a brutal cinematic experience. Certainly Allred understands that WTF is happening, but he is the only one. Daring you to watch the whole mess is not enough ... challenging you to see all the more mess on the target. <br /> <br /> "Astroesque" is a kind of movie linked to Allred's "Red Rocket." So if your "AstroScale" experience is not terrible enough, definitely track down the large comics and continue the fun. <br /> <br /> I felt sorry of Allred, who was totally out of his depth trying a movie.I also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money.Please buy my VHS copy, which is now available on eBay.
