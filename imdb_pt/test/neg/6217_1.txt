I can not remember a more trivial, numbing, shallow film, in other words, a real movie of the worst kind. How can anyone watch this movie and recommend it to others? Only if they do not like to admit that they made a mistake. It seems to sum up the worst of women's aspirations. No real substance for everything happy and superficial. Yes, this will please the masses. Well, not this member of the masses. What a trivial burden of nonsense. I wanted to leave the theater within 5 minutes from the start. And to think I paid Â£ 7 to see this! I think this, however, represents the dumbness of cinema, as with most media nowadays. So I like a little reality in my musicals call me sad or what?
