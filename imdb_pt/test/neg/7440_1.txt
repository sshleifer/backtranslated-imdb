It's a shame they did not trust the original enough to build on it. <br /> <br /> But "RoboCop 2" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters from the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that the sequels have to offer. <br /> <br /> The initial commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows (reminiscent of the beginning in "Guys and Dolls!"), but beyond a glimmer of thought here and there, this is a movie that is a slow and dirty slog in the middle of nowhere. (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they would not resist movie, and then there's the tone. <br /> <br /> In the blessed original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to handle with the type of attitude where if you maintained the attitude and sensitivity of a good comedian, even the most repulsive violence would be fun. Kershner (although he has directed a sequence of "Star Wars") does not. And scene after scene makes you cringe, look away or just hang up. <br /> <br /> What about RoboCop? It should be the main one here, right? But there are whole scenes in which he does not even appear, and in what scenes he is, they are half-thought and written in a trembling way that you do not know or care whether he is part human or part-cyborg - since he is boring I have never seen one such a rapid fall from grace. Why does Hollywood make such bad aftermath? On purpose? Because; Did the filmmakers make a bet? <br /> <br /> Just one star for "RoboCop 2"; the FX are good, but the story does not even try to match them.
