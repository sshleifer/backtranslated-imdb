First, what's really good about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors that I really like and for now he is one of them. He has an incredible ability to represent characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a nine lost in his own world, unable to leave. <br /> <br /> Still, I give only 3 out of 10 for certain flaws: <br /> <br /> - Second part horrible. It seems that the director was very eager to do something new, but despite the efforts was really boring. <br /> <br /> - Very annoying character Melissa. I could not stand the scenes with her - that is, it was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with the American woman. Terrible explanation of numbers. The director was so busy with the development of the character that he completely missed the point of a good story .. excuse me koalas? brr ... terrible! <br /> <br /> This movie had great potential. The filming is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. See if you're a Ryan Reynolds fan, or have a lot of free time.
