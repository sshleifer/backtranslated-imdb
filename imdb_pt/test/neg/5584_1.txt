The positive comments on this page are planted by filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateur in terms of direction, acting, in fact, in all aspects. If IMDb will allow filmmakers to dictate what is written about their films, then that is a very sad thing. This movie has a marketable premise, but it's absolutely horrible. The film is subjective, so everyone has their own opinions. But this movie is on par with Ed Wood's work, but without the charm. To think otherwise shows the bad taste of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This is not a personal thing. I do not know anyone associated with the movie. I'm just a movie lover who thinks the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate and therefore felt the need to approach balance and give a more accurate view of the film. It is very badly done and the direction is below the cinematographic production by the numbers. The acting is the worst ever committed to the cinema. The best thing about this movie is the poster and DVD cover. Also, it's not worth the time.
