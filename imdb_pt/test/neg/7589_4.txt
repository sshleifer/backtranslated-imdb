Butter Battle is a fun story about two fictional cities and their arms race. It is also a misleading allegory about the Cold War and arms races in general. Yes, it's a children's book, but like many works by Theodor Seuss Geisel, it hits people in the head with their morals. <br /> <br /> And this morality is exactly what? It is praiseworthy to encourage us to focus more on what unites us than on what divides us. It is even good to encourage international cooperation. But equating the differences between the Warsaw Pact nations and the NATO West to a difference in the application of butter is simply wrong. To underscore the obvious, many Warsaw Pact countries enjoyed intermittent periods of shortage of butter and bread - they would be happy to eat butter aside if it was available. On a less literal level, and whatever its political inclination, Soviet socialism versus Western (particularly Anglo-American) democracy is not a matter of preference and custom. To make the point even clearer, nuclear weapons were not developed in a cold war with the Soviets but in a hot war with the Axis powers. There is no doubt that Germany was developing nuclear capability during the war. Should the United States have shied away from nuclear weapons research, relying on its (less inevitable) victory in conventional warfare? Once the weapons were developed, they were used against the enemy who attacked us in Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this moment when genius is out of the bottle? In addition, the hindsight is 20-20, which means that there was no way to ensure that another half-mad dictator did not turn a blind eye to the development of nuclear weapons. The second Gulf War showed the incredible difficulty of discovering credible threats and neutralizing them. In any case, the cartoon is little more than simplistic propaganda that does little to explore the nuances of ethical issues behind nuclear. weaponry, and instead attempts to instill fear of gun technology in children.
