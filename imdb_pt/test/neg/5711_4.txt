Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke star in this controversial story of a Wall Street executive and an art gallery employee who connects and begins a very experimental sexual relationship. While Rourke and Basinger's acting is okay, flim does not allow their characters truly shape. Allegedly, there was a lot of film on the court room floor that deepened the characters and the effects of the relationship on them - Basinger's character, considering suicide - that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer. As it is, it's a brilliant, well-produced piece with MTV style editing of softcore voyeurism. 4 out of 10
