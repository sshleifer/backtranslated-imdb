Teen Tamara (Jenna Dewan) has been difficult. She is ridiculed by all the popular "boys" for being shy, studious, moody and because of her interest in witchcraft. All soccer players and cheerleaders are especially annoyed with her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school newspaper. In addition, her father is a drunk, her mother is not around and she is secretly in love with her support English teacher (Matthew Marsden). The popular children create a cruel joke to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during a fight, bury her body in the woods and make a pact to remain silent. To the shock, the next day, Tamara returns to the classroom, looking seductive and dressed to kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for supernatural vengeance against all involved. She also has time to make her sexually abusive pop eat a bottle of beer and tries to seduce her English teacher away from his wife (Claudette Mink), a guidance counselor at school. Acting and writing are strictly mediocre. You can also tell people responsible for this that they have seen films like CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996), because they borrow wholesale from all three of the top films. There are some gore (a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing the eyeball, probably being the best bit), a nasty vomit scene and some campy / witty one-liners. It's not a horrible movie by any means, but not much originality went in as well.
