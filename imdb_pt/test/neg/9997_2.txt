Terrible, horrible, terrible times a hundred still do not begin to describe how "Biggest Loser" is of poor quality. Imagine this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them and let them work to lose weight, all in prime time on television. Am I the only one who thinks this is not something that people with IQs in the 3-digit area want to watch? Everything drags on forever, with the whining scraps of lard on how losing weight will mean so much to them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? Do they care if we care? Probably not. I think I'm going to be filming doing push-ups and selling to a big television corporation. If that happens to the television, then so can my exercises!
