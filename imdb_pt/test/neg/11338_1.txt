When I went to see this movie, it was already a forced choice, since my original intention was exhausted. what was taught then was pure terror, this movie is so bad I could hardly bear it. the story is not worth mentioning, a gay goalkeeper forms a gay football team to play against his old straight team who - upon discovering his sexual orientation - gave him a hard time. loaded with cliches of unbearably old and overused gay men, the fine plot perfectly matches the futile dialogues ... it is absolutely surprising that actors like Dietmar Bär or Charly Hübner squander their talent and time in such absurdity. 1/10
