Oh my God, this movie is amazing, it's the worst movie ever and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a fan of horror movies! <br /> <br /> The story is totally silly, a group of adults decide to throw a party and a silly face with a horrible mask comes and kills everyone ... the dialogues are a kind of parody, worse, they alone They're talking about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) find out for yourself! you will be really surprised ... (it is not possible! yes, it is!) and it surprises that the film has only 58 minutes. (it is not possible (bis) yes, it is!) Worse than House IV and Vampires V. <br /> <br /> To summarize, forget forever !!!
