Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and his gang try to remedy this by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him. <br /> <br /> Okay, our gang comedy works in leaps and bounds. The bits work, but I do not think it works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise to work, the whole thing falls down. I think in a weird way the movie just went wrong. It's the kind of thing they really thought about it could have been something more than a misfire. Worth a try if you lower your expectations
