After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and another in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) operating in the Middle East is appointed by his superior in Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to maintain a "safe house" in Amman under surveillance, and he associates with the Chief of Security in Jordan . , Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not reveal the whole operation to Hani, and fails due to Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger has feelings for local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and he approaches his family. When Roger plans another scheme to capture Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as bait to lure Al-Saleem, he puts at risk not only the security of Sadiki but also Aisha who is kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to surrender to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnic tour of Europe and the Middle East. despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb user rating indicates that there are many viewers who like this kind of fast-paced espionage film using high technology, satellites and all kinds of lack of respect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that does not give time to think, but this it's not my case. It's boring and ridiculous to see the fat Russell Crowe with a cell phone as a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character played by Leonardo DiCaprio is poorly developed and, in my opinion, this great actor is considered an operative agent in the Middle East due to his biotype. But the film never explains its connections with the Middle East. The rescue of Roger Ferris alive is also very stupid and tacky. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): Network of Lies
