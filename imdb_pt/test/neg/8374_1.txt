That should evaluate the worst movies I've ever seen. It just was not funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the kind of person that gets all sticky looking at the sight of a dog then it can do something for you. If you expect a comedy movie to have some humor then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying that the word f is very hilarious. The strippers at the club kept their underwear on so there was no nudity to relieve their boredom. What happened at the strip club made no sense at all. There were many grunts from the main character with whom I developed no sympathy. Mena Suvari was hardly in the movie, supposedly just to make people think it was a serious attempt to produce a movie. The thugs were not convincing and carried as much threat as a dead sheep.
