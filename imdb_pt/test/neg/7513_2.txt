This is a polarizing film. People either love or despise, it seems. I, I despise that. The film comes from the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but while it's a masterpiece, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Both films take the unfinished novel of Kafka - America, for its inspiration and general ideal. America is a surreal story of a young man's travels around the country. Kafka uses the character as a pure observer who does not change throughout the journey (though the book is about 300 pages long and still seems to have only a quarter finished, then we'll never know). Allow Kafka to focus on and comment on absurd / surreal situations and environments. Oh Lucky Man follows this same model to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell and Weekend does the same for France. <br /> <br /> Both films are also extremely Brechtian, using various tricks and techniques to point out the fact that this is not real, this is conspiracy, etc. But the difference comes where Oh Lucky Man uses the film built to convey the absurdity of life and the class system, Weekend uses the film built to crush us to death with ideological polemic. As Godard goes beyond Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we end up with two main characters in whom we have no investment. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but we do not care about them. Deliberately so. But in doing so, Godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message, which in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and arrogant symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed at the camera . Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes, such as the horrible murder of pigs, far worse than any off-camera violence from car crashes. <br /> <br /> The end result is like listening to a student of political apparels stirring and and over their views while repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you receive the message. The problem with Brecht is that if you alienate the audience too much, then you have alienated them from what you are trying to convey. Which always seemed obvious to me. <br /> <br /> The parts that really get in the way of this movie, however, is the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the trio at the beginning and off the screen. comic rape in the middle, which, even though it may be seen as allegorical, completely destroys the faith of the film itself and its characters, which barely existed in the first place. It's so French with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> Watch Oh Lucky Man instead. This is a work of genius. The weekend is a pretense job. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and just for the congestion scene and the piano scene, which are just genius tips, although they really make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfactory, this is a bad movie from worst pretentious director in the world, with them, well, it is obvious that this is a very good technical director making the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. Somehow this is much worse.
