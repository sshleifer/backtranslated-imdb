It is important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The buzz * that was generated on this site far outweighs the actual impact of the movie. What can help anyone about to see the movie is to realize that it is - it should not be scary -. It's pure camp and an attempt at fun. It's not - funny-- just overdone. Do not expect something like SHAUN OF THE DEAD; nor something like Friday the 13th (Part II to infinity). HATCHET has passable actors. Cinematography is straight Ed Wood. The effects of creature and makeup are silly - probably on purpose. Gore and blood is something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is a separation film. It is between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between campy and comedy (there's a difference). It's between an ultra violent and violent comic book. <br /> <br /> Instead of "capturing the essence of the American Horror," or whatever other idiot jargon has been used to describe the film, it tries to capture something between the seminal. -American-- Horror as Friday the 13th and Horror as SHAUN. Fortunately it is far from Torture Horror. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think it's happening over and over that the people involved in movies are migrating to sites like IMDb to evaluate and comment on the movies in which they are involved. At the very least, there is an ongoing campaign for people associated with members to leave positive feedback and ratings. There is no other reason for this movie to have been left out in the high 7s with 600 votes and falling quickly after the large-scale release. This movie is only better than the HorrorFest releases and should not be so bloated.
