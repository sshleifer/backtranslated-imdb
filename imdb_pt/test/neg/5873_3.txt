I bought this movie in a thrift store. Months before, my friend told me about it when we were talking about stupid movies we saw. Once I saw the cassette, I knew I had to have it. I watched it that night. I could say it was going to be very tacky and cheap. . . That's what attracted me to it. I put it on and laughed the whole way. I recognized Gregory (The Ice Man), but I did not recognize his name and could not remember where I saw him. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith Show, Clint Howard (Ice Cream Man) appeared as an extra, since he is the brother of Ron Howard (Opie Taylor). I saw the credits and I gasped. I turned to my mother, who was also watching the show, and said, "This is the ice cream man!" She gasped, too. This movie is great, but just for laughs and criticism. It is the perfect example of a cheese horror movie. If you feel like laughing and having fun on low budget movies, rent this video.
