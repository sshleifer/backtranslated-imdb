The Salena Incident is by far the director's best film, Dustin Rikert - which is not saying much. In his past films (and I use the term "movies" freely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and marginalizes them severely. The Salena incident is no different. The film is basically Con finds Aliens made with the look of their average movie production. The film is full of unfocused scenes and plagued by special effects that would have difficulty competing with most high school computer animation classes. For example, almost all on-screen bursts are the same fire effect on the screen. <br /> <br /> Weak effects and the value of production are only compromised by a faulty plot and rocky dialogue. In one sentence, the story comes together as a display of Hollywood cliches too much. The movie begins with the worst CGI alien ship ever made in the worst CGI ever made and a team of armies that went to investigate. Then a prison bus transports, carrying the worst of the state's worst, is overturned by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicone implants. The prisoners escape and run to the city of Salena, where they find aliens who ... SHOCK ... escaped from an alien transport carrying the worst of the worst on the other side of the galaxy. Prisoners and their captive police armed only with guns and sad puns have to fight the aliens and flee the city before the International Space Alliance * gazes at the city in oblivion. <br /> <br /> The only real nice parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly harmed by the script) receive the freedom to improvise and also when they fight against the smallest of the alien creatures in a blast of shots. Also, the film really is not worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the DVD is made of. How horrible was that? Let's just say that the Secretary of Defense is about 90 years old, works in a room that is like the 1950 high tech real estate office and is wearing a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if that was not clear enough before, THE CHARGER MAN OF THE PENTAGON IS WEARING A TIE WITH THE BUNNY OF THE ERRORS AND THE ROAD CORRIDOR. The movie basically culminates (HAHAHahhaaa I say culminates ...) with the last remaining soldier running to the group of prisoners and guards and the new team formed fighting the aliens - who for some strange reason takes them straight back to the ship alien? yes ... <br /> <br /> The film has a heart, but it is filled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. Someone seriously needed to slap the DP and tell him that there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant photos at chest level. This movie really is not worth renting (if it goes that far), being not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director, which reduces the ability to laugh, but is far from being an assistive film.
