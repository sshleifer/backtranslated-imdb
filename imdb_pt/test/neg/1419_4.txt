I watched this movie on a Saturday matinee with a friend. The theater was about 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny lines, it's more of a drama / suspense with humor peppered overhead. Robin Williams gives a decent performance as Laura Linney. Being a fan of the Daily Show, Lewis Black is very good at it. Christopher Walken also performs well. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly and stays that way for the first thirty minutes, so the suspense part kicks in and starts to make you a little nervous for the rest of the movie. Suspense in an alleged comedy movie? I know I, like everyone else in the place, was struggling a little with it. A character would make a joke during the suspense sequence and you would hear only a laugh or two in the theater. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, after the movie was over, there was a handful of applause. So definitely some people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this film four in ten because I believe the comedy aspect does not work very well in a thriller / drama and actor performances, although not bad, they were just decent. <br /> <br /> Once again, this movie is not what it was announced.
