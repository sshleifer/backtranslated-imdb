This movie has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I only watched about half an hour and just hung up. The cars in this movie look like two front ends of the subway geo together. This movie is not good for laughs. The only time I laughed was when Dante kept saying in a funny voice, "No one can beat Dante, Muhwa Hwaa." I said holy god and hung up. Bad, bad movie. 2/10
