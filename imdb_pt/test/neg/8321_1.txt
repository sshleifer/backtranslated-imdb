Are we serious ??? I mean wow ... just, wow. I think I saw this movie in an old issue of War Journal. This is pathetic, originality is completely dead, instead of trying to formulate a new idea, what we receive is a gentle re-creation of an old plot line and to "change that" we just change the genre or race of the original idiot character and everyone should be sick and tired of seeing it ... but I think this is just a speech and will probably fall on deaf ears to engrossed with the sound of another shit hitting the water from the pot as the best western since 3 : 10 for Yuma ... (wait) ... 3:10 for Yuma! Thank you Hollywood for killing the movie as an art form and turning it into a commercial barrage of neo-pop trash and brazen lag ... wonderful !!!
