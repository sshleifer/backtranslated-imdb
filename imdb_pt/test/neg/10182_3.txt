Wow just wow. There are many reviews on this movie, but I would like to add some comments from me. I agree with most of the critics who have said that this movie has terrible acting, writing and directing - whoo boy does that ever. However, I think there are some other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is Christian belief and permission for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? Does the movie act as if you simply could not be a Christian and also allow for the possibility? Because? They always play briefly in the movie (for example, "The Bible does not say there are aliens." "Well, the Bible does not say there is not.) But the actual replica is never answered. So how to deal with the question instead of immediately discarding it or, better yet, recognizing that this is an infinite universe in which we live and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he has made some other life in some place and have their own plans for them. <br /> <br /> 2. How the only two explanations for abductions that are valid are demons and scammers? night terrors that have been linked to abduction experiences? And if it is something <br /> <br /> 3. The filmmakers claim that everyone who has experienced abduction has ties to the occult. This is a very big statement to make without any factual evidence for ap regretting that they do not, but if you're going to say something so well, you'd better have the facts to prove it. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy, the other) always have his hands in his pockets? It's hard to take anyone seriously when they're constantly playing pool. I WISH this was an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were very concerned about their "Message of Faith." "I care a lot about making an intriguing movie. As a Christian, it saddens me.
