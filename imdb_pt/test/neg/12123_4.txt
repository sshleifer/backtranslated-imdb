Think of Jumanji, but with a curse of death. A bunch of surfers have their hands on a game that takes the life of someone who is playing. It was supposedly made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries an unpleasant curse. <br /> <br /> Ok, not very demanding and just a kind of watchable tale is not something you have not seen before. Frankly, it's a story that hits all the right buttons in such a way that no real surprises. Far from the worst thing SyFy has run, but it certainly is not the best. There are better options out there, but if this is your only choice, you will not hate it completely.
