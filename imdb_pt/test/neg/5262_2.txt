This movie has a very strange mix of genres - mood and action of the bathroom in one. It really does not take this away - it should have joined a genre. The best thing I can say about the movie is that the dog on it is cute. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the movie, when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop. in a hunting / motel pavilion. I do not know what the meaning of this sequence is - it seems only gratuitous to the extreme. The owner of the hunting lodge ("Charlie") is a very nerdy guy. For some reason, Moses begins a conversation with Charlie about porn, prank, homosexual sex, sex in a menage at trois ... Charlie's photo of his "wife" seems to be Charlie dressed as a woman. There is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene. Anyway, the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked Moses ends up with Carter's gun in the ass and Charlie sees her through the window. Everything smells like school boy humor about homosexuality - horrified and excited all at the same time - which I do not find funny at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always raving about Adam Sandler movies. This is the first one I've seen - after that, I'm not sure I want to see more. BTW, this is my husband's bill - he saw Happy Gilmore, and he told me it's very good - maybe I should give Sandler another chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skogg
