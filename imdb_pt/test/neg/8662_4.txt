I began to get a critical eye on this adaptation in the first few minutes, but as a Jane Austen fan I persevered to the end ... However, this is not a program I would recommend to someone who is not familiar with their work as me Don thinks he does justice to the book, nor does it make television particularly entertaining by itself. There was something about this adaptation that lacked credibility - many of the costumes and even the actors did not look authentic and I found the acting sometimes bad. There is no doubt that the actors were all very beautiful, but that did not provide enough variety to create really diverse and memorable characters. It was too static to be totally in the same place and miss Fanny's return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. The best actor was Blake Ritson, who captured the integrity of Edmund very well, and the Crawfords were also well chosen. I really like Billie Piper as an actress, but this role does not fit her and was much better interpreted by Frances O'Connor in the 1999 version, which gave a much more subtle and convincing performance. Jane Austen's adaptations will always provide a love story to make you feel good, but unfortunately, this is one of the worst I have ever seen.
