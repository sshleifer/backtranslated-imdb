Eh is not as good as the other Dragonballs. The villains are actually scammers of other Z villains like Cell, Freeza and even Majin Buu. With Baby being the clone of Frieza, Super 17 being the clone of Cell, and the Shadow Dragons being the clones of Buu. The story is also very bad as it deals with Goku's shrinkage. COOLING !! Handle it REPRODUCE to like the size of an eight year old just to start this. Let's not forget how weak the characters become. Gohan can not go more mystical and is even weaker than Pan. (Sadly I know). Speaking of Pan, she was so cute at the end of Z now that she lost all this cuteness and became an annoying, crying little girl whose only purpose in this series is to get in the way. Goten does not even have a purpose in the series and Trunks ... well, I do not know what to say about Trunks. GT is just an attempt to milk the popular Dragonball franchise. If you really like Dragonball, avoid this series. It does not even look like Dragonball. I will be fair, since the ending, however, was very good and is really very sad (at least for me) and the theme songs that end and open are better (Japanese, not American). It could have been better if Toriyama san had worked on it.
