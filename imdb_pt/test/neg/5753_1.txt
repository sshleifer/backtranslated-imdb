This game is a good first person shooter. ----------- Hold on ...... But of course a story should be put around this genre, so a rather novel plot about soldiers now directed by drugs To save the world and kill the terrorist, Nectar is the drug of choice that creates a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Great, now just give us some fun and challenging missions, throw some great new weapons and free terrain vehicles that can be driven at our leisure and I'll be quite pleased. <br /> /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The creators of this game decide to create a military-led propagandist game that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embrace democracy. The game distorted ideals that only reinforce the morale we learned when we were in elementary school, nothing new is said to us, but "Drugs are bad ... mmmkay." Then pushed a kind of .... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) of how to stand up for the common good, given complaints about normality and abnormality, right and wrong .... GOOOOOOOOOOD GET IT! LET'S KILL SOMETHING !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can not, You're forced to endure extremely long gaps in completing BULLSH goals! T as "Run for Helicopter" ....... "Go to the Troops group .. .. ... So when this is completed ......... KINEMATICS assumes ...... ... You sit there for at least half of the game watching the little scenario played by the characters, you CAN NOT jump, but sit back and wait, sometimes when people are not even talking, we sit and wait for a helicopter to land! <br /> <br /> Bad game, for a laughable group of programmers! Do not bother to do another because I prefer to watch the movie!
