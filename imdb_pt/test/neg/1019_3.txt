This movie is really bad, there is nothing interesting or interesting except for the beautiful scenery: the Chilean landscape. I know I should provide four lines as a commentary for this movie, but the thing is it's such a bad movie, I can only say it's really bad. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves money on the film.
