Poor Shirley MacLaine struggles to lend a bit of seriousness to this "feel-good" movie, but is run over by the sentimentality of a movie that is not at all grounded in reality. <br /> <br /> Was this directed by Curtis Hanson? Has he had a lobotomy since I last heard of him? Hanson can make effective drama sprinkled with comedy, as evidenced by "Wonder Boys". So I do not know what happened to him here. This is the kind of movie that does not want to accept that life is confusing and complicated, and that neat and tidy endings (however implausible) can result in a beautiful final picture, but they seem totally false if people watch the movie pass for something remotely similar to what the characters in the movie go through. <br /> <br /> My wife and I played a game of calling plot points before they happened - for example, "the old man is going to teach her to read and then fall dead." Bingo! This is one of those films where the characters make small speeches summarizing their emotional problems, making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are aware of what is causing them. Toni Collette (a great actress, by the way, and one of my favorites, if you do not have a lot to work on here), makes a speech about why she buys so many shoes and never uses them, spelling neon flashing strange connection reason for the movie . At that moment, I knew what I was doing, and the film was a downward spiral from there. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
