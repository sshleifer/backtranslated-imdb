Three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. The three entrepreneurs get revenge, which turns into one murder after another. Supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The plot has many holes. The details were ignored to carry the story forward. The performance was uneven. The color balance was awful even though I watched this movie on DVD. The small budget and the tight schedule were apparent. The whole thing seems to be an excuse to fire the final fight, and the end was unbelievable.
