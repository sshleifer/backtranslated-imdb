This has to be one of those times when you are faced with a movie with an elegant cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. Okay my impression (I had watched Scarecrow on the TV for weeks) perfect, a good horror movie to start the night with. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong I think 5 minutes I was going to take it out, but I thought I lost 3 $ on this, so I'll end this where the scarecrow Well, I'm guessing it's the fisherman's legs wearing sturdy rain boots. You see it from time to time. I was watching this thinking ... Okay, when these brats are going to come across this guy, at one point I thought they were dead. but no .... I mean frig, they're still alive. I just laughed at some parts because of how badly staged they were. one was partly zoomed in at the beginning. the director / actor / screenwriter says "remember I had this feeling, well, I got it again" and it was a zoom or a zoom, to hell I was checking. but I think the scene was supposedly shocking, I mean what is more shocking is his wife had the same look shocked .... OK ... she believed him ??? I'm sorry, but ... I did not know he was psychic until I read the movie box to make some sense of what I witnessed. Not only that, they used photos to make you think that this movie is at least clear. <br /> <br /> The other thing that made me laugh a little was the scream on the camera, to make it scary ....... OK .............. filming a girl up close shouting at the camera for 5 minutes ....... right ..... I laughed because of how pathetic it was these kids can not act like the rest of the people in the movie. Up the scythe things must have gotten lost or something ... because it looks like the thug had just a stick. not even an ax, someone should shoot the dam production film <br /> <br /> Do not fall for the picture, this movie is a piece of shit. I watched the trailer and guess what it has <br /> <br /> GIRLS WHERE YOU TALK TO ME AND CORN
