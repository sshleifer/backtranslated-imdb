This film is by far and without a doubt the only worst and most despicable movie in the history of the universe. <br /> <br /> It really is so bad. <br /> Personally I always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible movie, and I rented this thinking it would be one of those. To my immense disappointment, it was not. <br /> <br /> The script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they were reading the lines directly from the posters, the story makes absolutely no sense, and the actual movie looks like it was filmed on a home video camera . I could not even finish watching. It's even worse than "Witch Academy", and that's a great feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not even imagine how a director could film this movie, and still have the good sense to believe that he was decent enough to release. <br /> <br /> Painful, horrible, horrendous.
