Has not the writer of this movie seen the other three? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this one. Who dares kill UG? This certainly was not the ug who was almost like Charlie's brother at number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said, "You would not leave me on Earth." Ug replied, "Charlie, Bounty Hunter," saying he was now one of them now. As writers dare to ignore this special bond between them and turn it into a villain who is killed by Charlie (in a particularly strange scene) just because they realized that the movie was getting boring. In fact, in the first 20 minutes, we won a new cast and we have to wait so long until we find out again what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were waiting to see. I kept waiting, saying, "Come on, when's Charlie going to show up?" Angela Basset must be doing her best to deny that she was in Turkey. Moving it into the future eliminates the possibility of seeing a sequence with the original cast or in our time. I think the writers decided that their film would be their last and could do whatever they wanted. This movie is totally out of sync with the first two. And it does not even seem like it was written by the same people who did it, at least they were humorous and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and stingy (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated. I hated the fact that anyone could like this and I hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. I give this a start simply because the poster will not let me give a zero.
