After watching the movie, I must say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This takes my worst movie award away from Komodo, which is no easy task. It's not a movie or a legitimate movie and gives both of them a bad name. The acting, the camera work, the plot, the script and the sound are horrible. My favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. Why was such a joke put in the movie? Was the director thinking? "I need a good-humored scene to balance great acting, so I'm going to use an idiot joke I read on a Laffy Taffy cover." Another delayed part is when Norman pours the invisibility potion into himself while trying to prevent it from spilling. Why did they bother giving the film an NC-17 rating if they hoped to get the biggest possible audience? At least if it were classified as X, it would be more sexual and therefore would cause viewers to move away from poor overall quality. I pray for someone who has worked on this waste of panties from a movie to respond.
