I'm all about the undead, but my mind still is not sure of the walk, frozen dead. Unfortunately, THE CHILLING did not help me make a decision. This is really slow, with nothing happening in the first 45 minutes, causing me to hit the "movie enhancement" button several times. By the time the well-drawn zombies appear, it's too late and the director (rumor has already filmed that) has no idea how to film them. Haggerty, Blair, and Donahue seem tired / embarrassed / recovering in some way. I'll credit the movie as it predates the T2 ending with villains being frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extended reel promo back in the day that lasts 8 minutes and I really recommend watching the movie in its entirety.
