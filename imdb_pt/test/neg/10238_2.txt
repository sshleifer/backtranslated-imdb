Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau are back on their third installment - YESTERDAY ONCE MORE - directed by HK actor Johnnie To ... fans of To's action movies will be disappointed to discover that no weapons were used on the film. In addition, fans of the previous Cheng & Lau films, PRECISE OF YOU AND LOVE ON A DIET, will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is not even so close or funny or captivating ... <br /> <br /> & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) are a divorced couple ... both rich HK citizens ... both incredibly mischievous ... both by chance were professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather" .... A few years before, they divorced for their inability to find a way to split the loot ... Now she remarried ... with the son of a rich heiress - the total of a boy from the mother (Carl Ng) through ... The future mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious of Mrs. To's past and thinks she is only marrying her son for the family jewels - the invaluable ruby ​​necklace of the heiress ... necklace is stolen ... is Mrs. To's materialistic eye taking the best of her? ... or is it your ex-husband, Mr. To's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself? This is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love ... it's about two pple who have always been in love but somehow have been foolish to realize this ... they let pride and greed dominate them ... <br /> Overall: YESTERDAY is a caper / stalking film and a tribute to the classic Hollywood glamor of its golden years - namely Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, TO CATCH THE THIEF ... Johnnie To is weighing too much in Cheng / Lau's chemistry from his previous films ... hoping that the immense popularity and fan base of Cheng / Lau will be sufficient justification for this third film ... I I think Sammi Cheng is one of the most friendly and charming artists who work on the day. . & Lau is definitely the Tom Cruise of Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed your first two movies and I consider the Cheng / Lau pairing comparable to the classic Hollywood couples of the 40s and 50s ... but YESTERDAY falls short of expectations ... terrible writing, ridiculous situations, abundance of products, and all subplots and supporting characters were unnecessary ... I even thought about it ... this movie was unnecessary ... unless you I just love watching celebrities ...
