How much I love this movie?! Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that is so bad that it's good. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great ass, looks fabulous on the screen, and definitely does not make a twist on his acting debut (I believe). Billy Zane is properly evil and moody, although I still feel constantly that there is something more in him. I felt it on Titanic, the look on his face when La Winslet spat at him for example, totally broken, shocked and dejected ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a handsome little face ... not seriously, I think that's it! It's worth catching this to see a really hot guy, some big bra bras from Brook, a nasty growl from Billy, laugh at the dialogue, have fun on the stage, and madness anyway ... I'll watch again now - yes , I bought !!!
