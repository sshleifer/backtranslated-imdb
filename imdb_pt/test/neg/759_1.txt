This movement is bad on so many levels that I do not even know where to start. OK - the good points - Peebles is gorgeous as a dirty thug in black leather. Some of the landscape photographs were impressive. That's about it. Oh, and it was a nice touch to have the buffalo head above the bar door in Freemanville, I think that was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The movie starts well, but the characters are so boring, so the comic books are so bad, the malicious guys are a bit bad, I suffocate trying to describe them even more. The Hispano-Cuban-American War was from 1895 to 1898, with the United States only participating from April to August 98. I think the film said that it happened in 1893 (I may be wrong, but I do not want to look again at check). A large part of this movie depended on KKK killing Jessie's father. Well guys, the original KKK began in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan was not even around for the time period of this movie. Of course the unpleasant foundations were occupied again in 1915 and we know the rest of it. BUT, for the purpose of the film, it is historically incorrect and that was an important part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy getting in a lot more, so here some jabs and I finished. I did not know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that were inspired by New Orleans street singers of the 1890s. I also did not know that fetish collars were all the rage of Sioux women in the 1890s ... but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic fingernails ... We almost burst out laughing and I It's a waste of talent and money - this really got a chance to show a part of American history that is not well known. http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/bkcwboy2.htm for more info. This could have been so good, but it was just ... bad from 1-10 this earns 1 instead of zero because Mario looks good in his hat and there was an Appaloosa horse in the movie.
