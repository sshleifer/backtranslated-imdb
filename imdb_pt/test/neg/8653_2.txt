I had some expectations of this movie because 1. It was a Yash 2 raj production. When the songs were shown for the first time on TV, they looked captivating 3. The cast of stars (??) was new. Well, I must tell you that I just could not watch this movie. Uday, (with his red lips - what artists invented thinking ???!) It tries to sound cool, but fails miserably. I will not even start acting (if you can call it that). 'Queen of Neckline' Tanisha with all her screams and raving delirious n just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration. I think Uday was a bit more tolerable than her! She really needs to take acting lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic ... the same tried and tested formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing worth watching in this movie. Makes me wonder why it was made in the first place!
