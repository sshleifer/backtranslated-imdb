Look, I pretty much lost all hope on Nickelodeon after seeing their latest hit, the Naked Brothers Band show, and "ICarly" is no exception! If you have not noticed, ICarly is now the # 1 hit among sitcom on television right now! After hearing this, I decided to watch a few episodes myself to see what the hype was! I have one word to describe this show in general ... "EFFORT !!!" I CAN NOT BELIEVE DAN SCHNEIDER WILL GO IN THAT DOWN AND DO SOMETHING THIS CRAPPY !!! IT'S HORRIBLE !!! Let me give you the details ... <br /> <br /> The ICarly cast begins with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Carly, unfortunately during the episodes, does not really have personality, so to speak! I think she should be the common girl on the show! (Because many people have an army veteran for a father, an artist for a brother, and a popular web program for teens, recorded and produced with thousands of dollars worth of equipment!) And to tell you more about Miranda, HIS PERFORMANCE IS PATHETIC !!! She sounds like a 3 year old girl with Tourette's syndrome in a sugar high in half the time! <br /> <br /> Next, we have Sam Puckett (good God, where do they get those names!?) played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam is the "CO-HOST" of Carly's web show! (Wait a minute, if Sam is the host of the show with Carly, the show should not be called "ICarly and Sam?" I bet Sam feels stolen!) Sam must be the bully in the cast (Yeah, because EVERY girl Bully wears tight women's shirts and pants with blonde hair extensions!) She too, I think, is supposed to be a Tomboy too. I'd find this a little funny, but it's your Clich√© PUNS THAT RUIN IT! The "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" pun is overused WAY TOO VERY MUCH !!! GIVE THAT GIRL A SCRIPT !!!! and GIVE IT A COFFEE because, do not get me wrong, Jennette's performance is good, but over half the episodes, she seems to be ready to fall asleep !!! <br /> <br /> Next, we have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is the technical producer for Carly and Sam's show! There's not much to say about Freddie other than the fact that he's a tech geek and has a crush on Carly, which never works! HERE WE COME BACK WITH THE CLICHES !!! DOES NOT APPEAR !!! Nathan's acting is also fine, but sometimes it seems excessive! He is very boring !!! <br /> <br /> Finally, and my most favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Let me make this very clear; IF IT WAS NOT FOR IT, THIS SET OF DIRT OF A SHOW WOULD BE MUD !!! Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! Spencer is Carly's older brother! If you were a little 5 years old that was both in a high caffeine and constipated, you would have this character outlined! Spencer also makes money by being an artist! (Hmmm ... I imagine ...) You'd think a professional artist would make promising sculptures ... yes, I just love sarcasm! YOUR ART IS VERY ENOUGH OF UTTER !!!! I mean, what kind of sculpture is "MERRY SNIFFMUS !!?" WHAT!!? THIS IS ABOUT MUCH CREATIVITY AS A HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH ON DRUGS !!!! IT'S STUPID!!!! <br /> <br /> THE CONFIGURATIONS OF WORK AND MORAL ARE BAGS OF CARPET WITHOUT SUCCESS !!!! These shows are now telling kids that stealing, lying and being an asshole to their parents is a good thing !!! IF THESE ARE AMAZING CRAPPY TYPES SHOW THAT THEY ARE PLAYING FOR CHILDREN THESE DAYS, THEN I DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN OBSERVING ANY OF THEM !!!! THIS IS THE GREATEST CRAPE PIECE I'VE EVER SEEN ON TV! BAR NONE !!! NICKELODEON, "I'm with you !!!!" HISTORY END!!!! 1/10
