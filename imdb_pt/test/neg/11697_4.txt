There are no serious spoilers, but some very small ones. <br /> <br /> "Acacia," a Korean contribution to the ever-popular Asian horror flick, is about a husband and wife who decide they're getting into it and deciding. adopt a child. The child, who has a habitual obsession with the dead tree in the family garden, eventually disappears when the couple ends up having a child of their own and the tree mentioned above seems to hold a grudge against their own family. <br /> <br /> And that's about it. The film moves in a rhythm of snails, recording over 100 minutes with material of 80 minutes. It is essentially a family drama with a scary tree, and there is very little in terms of scares, just pictures of the tree with strange noises murmuring over it. However, the idea of ​​the tree being the mother of the child is quite unique, but is not exactly exploited to its full potential. This type separates "Acacia" from much of the new wave to which it belongs: films like Ju-On and Ring tend to do the opposite, and the ideas of milk are tasteless until they are red in the face. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to go to the end; however, the achievement of the child's fate and parental actions not only lessen the previous curiosity of the story, but are revealed with the edition of machine guns that it is difficult to absorb all at once. The final sequence is undoubtedly scary, however, it seems a bit too late. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie does not look much like a Ring, but with the "cinematic renaissance" that Korea is currently. passing, I could not help but feel that this movie could have been much more.
