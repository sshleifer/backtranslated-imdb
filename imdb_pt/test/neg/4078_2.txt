This movie is definitely with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of the worst movies. I laughed once and it was when: EVAN: "I'm building something" Evan's secretary: "I hope it's a barber shop" <br /> <br /> This was literally the only time I laughed at this comedy, awful compared to the all-powerful Bruce who as a big fan of Jim Carrey ... was not even that good! <br /> <br /> This movie did not have the humor of having God's powers and it was more about the family bond. Id class it just like a family movie, it's definitely not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Seeing a bird poop on someone's shirt is not hilarious, not a beard that comes back instantly! <br /> <br /> I did not think the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck, it was like watching a movie that had not been pasted properly <br /> <br /> 2/10 film - avoid!
