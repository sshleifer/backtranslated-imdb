While The Twilight Zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven - with some great episodes, some lousy and many in-between. Do not believe the fanatic fans - there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them. In a plot that is obviously an attack on Fidel Castro, almost like it (Peter Falk, with lots of makeup and beard, gets a magic mirror that allows him to perceive who his enemies are in order to liquidate them. While I believe that Castro is a bandit and dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this), it is incredible how this kind of preaching episode really makes audiences laugh at American efforts to marginalize insidiousness and really makes Castro Serling and company wanted to hurt Castro, but they seemed to be obvious, prejudiced and silly in the process. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - almost ridiculously bad when seen today.
