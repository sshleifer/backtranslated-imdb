I survived the first hour of it and came back for the last ten minutes, just to say I saw the end. If you want the * real * mythology, run flawlessly, search for "The Odyssey" by Armand Assante. A great narrative does not need to be adjusted - the stories are fantastic on their own. I just hope Sean Astin needed the money. And Sophocles and Ovid must be spinning in their graves - wherever they may be. At least with the Sorbo version, the tongue was pumped relentlessly on the cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but maybe the interest was enough. generated in the background story to send someone to the library.I am surprised that Halmi could get out something so fun (the TV series), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.
