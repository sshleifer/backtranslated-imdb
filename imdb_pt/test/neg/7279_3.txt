This movie was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive reviews of this site I went ahead and bought a copy of the movie off of ebay. The acting in the film is medium and somewhat weakened, especially by the family of cannibals, a sequence comes to mind when Jupiter is talking loudly and delirious with the burned corpse, talking directly to the camera. It's one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor. It is also evidence of some of the worst issues I have seen, there is a terrible cut in the middle of your "speech". There are some scary moments, and sometimes the song works well ... but overall the movie is not so good and I do not know why people think Wes Craven is a great director. So far he has not shown me anything that I believe to be brilliant, the only thing that has improved with Cravens films, production for production was his budget.
