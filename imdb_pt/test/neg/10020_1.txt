Of course, most horror movies of the '80s were not worth the celluloid they were filmed in, but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced. <Br /> Six students of marijuana smoking decide to go camping. Of course, <br /> <br /> and you already know this, they begin to be killed one by one by a mysterious stranger. The climax has a handsome ranger trying to reach the teens before the last fluffy girl becomes buzzard. <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, my favorite B-movie guy, did the lousy makeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken from "The Witches of Eastwick" and the Addams family films. Unfortunately, it does not appear until the end of the movie, and is covered with burned makeup, making it unrecognizable. Steve Bond (does anyone remember him?) Is here in an initial role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's direction, and the screenplay he co-wrote, both smell like <br /> <br /> <br /> Brown bears left in the woods. He handles the film with so many wild animal footage, I thought he had accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Wild Kingdom from Omaha. Much of the cast sits around the campfire and eats, then walks, sits, and eats again. The ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put into a horror film: he tells a joke about a wide-mouth toad for a baby deer. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgotten that he once worked with the silent film legends, has two scenes, and is involved in the second strangest scene ever placed in a movie slasher: he and the forest ranger handsome has a talk about cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal ... yes. <br /> <br /> It's not a minute of suspense here. The killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> Survivor looking for a mate, watches the students behind <br /> <br /> the trees. We know it's the killer because the filmmakers have nicknamed a heartbeat sound effect that serves to wake the viewer every few minutes. Skip this pile of pine sap and rent <br /> <br /> "Halloween" instead. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, moderate violence with gore, <br /> <br /> some profanity, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexual references and drug abuse .
