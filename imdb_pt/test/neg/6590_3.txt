Yes, it may not be historically accurate (in fact, only 6 soldiers from the 9th round were killed there), and yes, there are some mistakes and exaggerations (turn around! Or that "history class" about how Afghanistan was never won by anyone - an educated Russian officer knew the story much better than that - for example, the British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it does not have multimillion-dollar style special effects in Hollywood, but it's the strongest point in showing a soldier's life there, his relationships and feelings when best friends are being killed before his eyes. In my opinion 9ya route really does a good job showing all these things. <br /> <br /> Once again, the film has weaknesses, but in my opinion, it seems to be one of the strongest Russian films of recent years. years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
