In need of work, straight man Bud Abbott (as Jack) and comic book partner Lou Costello (as Dinkel) get the latter a self-described "troublesome" babysitter David Stollery (as Donald). Young Stollery ends up reading Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), which puts Costello to sleep, dreaming that he and Mr. Abbott are reliving the story of "Jack and the Beanstalk" (you guessed it). The sepia tone changes to the color of most of the production. Apparently, this was an attempt at something different for the duo, a colorful children's fantasy. He fails, but this is where you see the Abbott & Costello in color, the silent movie superstar William Farnum (as the King) does his last performance a little, the boxer's brother Max Baer, ​​and Stollery before the "Spin and Marty "from Disney <br /> <br /> ** Jack and the Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
