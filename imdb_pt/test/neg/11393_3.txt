This film was disturbing, not because of the subject, but because of the way it was treated. The extremely obese mother (Angela) did not even appear on the cover of the video, when most of the rest of the cast did. This is not fair, but it is a statement in itself. I also notice that her photo is missing from the IMDb (maybe her choice) and it seems like this is her only movie of all time? The language of this film was crude beyond necessity. I watched with my 10 year old son because he was rated PG in Canada and the language that comes out of their mouths was disgraceful & disgusting. I never appreciated Shirley Maclain as so many others do. <br /> <br /> LOVE Kathy and Bates always will be. Sinese's part was annoying. <br /> <br /> Little boy Alex is a great actor. I'll have to see what else he's been up to lately.
