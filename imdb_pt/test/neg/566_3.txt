I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved some of the dialogues in court - which proved to be the best showcase for the director's method acting technique in time before - but this movie finally disappoints. Even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressive / oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its more "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks strength and credibility, and eventually left me looking at my watch waiting an obvious end would already happen. <br /> <br /> And to state: despite rampant rumors to the contrary, this movie was never banned in the US (I can not comment on rumors of censorship in the UK, but I'm suspect). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government had any influence over that decision; however, the fact that it has never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of the careful and publicity-driven way of doing business. As for the present, you can have your own copy of the DVD delivered to your door through Amazon in a few days.
