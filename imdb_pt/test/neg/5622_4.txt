Another film to punish us for the crime of tanning "Pulp Fiction". <br /> <br /> If you enjoy seeing dead people with machine gun shots for an hour and a half, this will probably fit in. Fans of the debut episode of "Aeon Flux," in which the title character literally kills thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers alone, will actually do so. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's not exactly a smart movie. In fact, all that is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to misbehave and shoot people. Sometimes a whole scene goes by and the only thing that happens is you guessed it! Someone is shot. Or, to spice things up, twenty people are shot. First, they are sitting there, the next minute, they are sitting dead. Yahoo! <br /> <br /> Difficult plot: A young American goes to Paris (an American in Paris, do you understand?), hires a prostitute (the ethereal Julie Delpy), contacts some old French friends, one of whom have AIDS, they plan and attempt a bank robbery. Of course the film convention says that no bank robbery in the film is not easy, and that hitch takes up about three-quarters of the execution time (it's like "Dog Day Afternoon" without the wit, patience, or humanity of Sidney Lumet) . While on the bench, things go wrong (surprise!), And the Parisian with AIDS, goes crazy with his Uzi several times. There are no spoilers here, but suffice it to say that you are at such emotional distance from these characters that you are unlikely to care about who lives and who dies at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some have called it elegant. Maybe it is, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that has already been made, and "Killing Zoe" is stuck by convention. Nowhere in the movie does the director (Roger Avary, co-winner of the script Oscar "Pulp Fiction") do anything really original, elegant, funny or outrageous. Unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count, there is nothing more to separate this movie from the crowd.
