Martha Plimpton has made some prestigious films, working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but she has never been able to expand her limited appeal and brat to the same class as, say, Molly Ringwald. This movie, which was barely released, is only an extension of its attempts from the late 80's and early 90's to find a screen persona that is identifiable to viewers, and represents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who discovers that on her 21st birthday she was adopted and - worse than that - was actually abandoned as a child at her parents' door! She goes out in search of her biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why she would want to (would it be a simple curiosity to give her so much determination?). Unattractive material given sitcom manipulation; It starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. Plimpton gives a sour and grumpy performance, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are just like their adoptive parents. * 1/2 of ****
