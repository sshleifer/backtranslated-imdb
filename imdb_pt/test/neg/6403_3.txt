So this starts with at least one interesting and promising basic idea, continues and continues with the tension, Carey in a good atypical role, but in a performance lower than expected, the weak direction of Joel Schumacher coincides with some plot holes , the "detective scenes" show us the luck of creativity. If you do not have high expectations (due to the negative reviews) maybe you will enjoy it. In the end they offer us a lesson on morality (for those who remember "Falling Down") and the "joy and healing of the family" that ruin all possibilities of being kind and find the film watchable PS It is obvious who the killer"! I wonder why W.Sparrow (Carey) has not solved the mystery since the beginning of the movie ...
