If you had asked me 1 month ago how this movie was, I probably would have left most of it out, but I'm a fan and like any fan, I visit movie sites often when Super Troopers are out. DVD release and was hooked Yes its a hard to stay site but the good ones are usually like good families staying together. What a story this company / comedy has. BUY people to come and see there movies in corners, universities, anywhere and all for free and after all this to develop a large fan base after a few years THEY DO ABOUT AND decide to close the website that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it ... They did not say anything to them. They just decided that they are better than us, they want new fans, not the fans who helped them get where they are ... you know the same fans they begged years ago. Still, the smart team is that they released the best movie with Super Troopers and they got everyone's attention and thanked God for it, because after that they sucked everything else. Good for you to go mainstream, remember when you realize that your material is not so good and you do not have new fans, you're the one who shit the originals. Fans make you whom you are not the other way. Never burn your bridges
