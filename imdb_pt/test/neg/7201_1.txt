If it were possible, I would have given this excuse excuse for a ZERO star movie. It was by far the worst I've ever seen. It was like a home movie that some bored students decided to play as a joke. The "acting" was awful. The "actors" did not even react to the fact that they were being murdered. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie by mistake. The title in Spanish said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought maybe it was okay. Wrong. It was honestly the worst of them all. I did not get past the 20 minutes of the stupid movie. I jumped through the chapters and nothing interesting seemed to happen. <br /> <br /> The cameras were terrible, too. It was like a home movie. I would never recommend to anyone to watch this. Terrible silly movie.
