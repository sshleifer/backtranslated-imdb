Fred Zinnemann's 1973 "Jackal's Day" of Frederick Forsyth's novel, though not a masterpiece in the general scheme of things, was nevertheless an above-average thriller written and executed with considerable brio, wit and style. It is still a pleasure to rent and watch from time to time. <br /> <br /> By adapting this to "The Jackal" of 1997, it seems that in every turn the writers and director made the worst possible choice, making everything very lead, exaggerated, unsurprised, without surprises, without seriousness and without enthusiasm. If we put together a catalog of all the specificities that came into this film, big and small, I could give you a mini-essay for each topic on how the 1997 adaptation came about. <br /> <br/> Item: the weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original, there is considerable intrigue about how the killer will put him on the scene, how he intends to disguise it and why he needs personalized work from his underground craftsmen. In the remake, they apparently thought that today's audience would not tolerate a small rifle whose accuracy is accurate and would require the lugubrious machine gun on the shelf, which needs a minivan to carry it, and whose point is to shout Macho. Any business involved and interesting about disguising its components, has been reduced to show us (over and over, how is this a difficult point to follow?) That the joystick of your absurdly high-tech remote control system is in your pocket as a whole. pen. <br /> <br /> Item: the conspirators and the reason. Without resorting to the dry lecture, the original still gives us a good understanding of the historical situation of the "pied-noirs", the Franco-Algerian irredentistas who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism, and formed the view that de Gaulle had brought them. This gives the whole plot some historical weight. The remake seems to leave it as a revenge story of gang shooting, minimally spicing up making them Russian gangsters. Please note that I do not object to the update: they could have done it intelligently and suggested something more current, but not trivial. Certainly Russia and the rest of the former USSR have undergone great changes in recent times, and an up-to-date story could have been put there in a way that would make us feel that it matters. <br /> <br /> Item: The relation of the assassin in flight and the police chasing him; and the complex targeting of the spectator's sympathies, from the bad guy to the good guy. <br /> <br /> Above, I hesitated to call the masterpiece original; but in this respect it was really one. We've been following the killer for most of the first parts of the movie, and having seen his cleverness and resourcefulness, we begin to admire him and do not want to see his plan frustrated or to see him arrested - at least not so soon! So we meet with the cop who is pushed to lead the investigation / protection efforts, and little by little we take him in, and see that he is not the sad bag that his domestic problems may have suggested. The moment it matters, we have been conquered to his side. <br /> <br /> In remake, maybe Poitier could have dealt with this kind of development, but Gere certainly can not. And the absurd trick "48 Hours" of the con that was brought to help the police should have been left in those comedies where it came from. <br /> <br /> The remake has the killer and the killer-hunter â€¢ talk about how they are as players above a chessboard, communicating indirectly through their movements and only able to * infer * how it is the other. This was achieved in a superb way in the original. But in the remake, in fact, they are brought to a face-to-face confrontation very early, so they can grimace at each other, bleed the place, and go through some pretty standardized chase scenes. <br /> <br />> Item: photography and "scenery". <br /> <br /> The remake has beautiful images, especially in the snow of Finland, in the opening section. But the Washington, DC Metro can not compete with the streets of Paris for interesting perspectives and spectator faces.
