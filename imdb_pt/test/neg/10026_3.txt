Supercraptic slasher recipe, which seems excessively long at 80 minutes. Years ago, a bunch of "gypsies" who lived in the caves of a mountain were burned in a forest fire. Years later, campers disappear from the fire area. A bunch of excited kids is naturally en route to this area for a debauched camp trip from there. Despite the sinister welcome of the ranger (Jackson Bostwick), the children arrive on the mountain anyway. In a short time, the children begin to get caught by the monster, which remains invisible until the end of the film, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. There are no surprises to speak of: they are killed in the exact order that the formula for these films dictates, leaving the "final girl" to defend herself, although in a refreshingly pessimistic ending, the final girl gets trapped and impregnated by the monster. <br /> <br /> The story itself could not contain the weight of the length of the feature, so it was filled with seemingly endless images of wild animals and insects, which were obviously filmed for another film and inserted here in a way as a means of making the film long enough for a video release. On the plus side, wildlife footage is pretty good. Among the highlights are Bostwick chatting with a deer cub, a decent climbing death sequence, OK gore, and the great Jackie Coogan in his final movie role as the shabby local sheriff. This is a long way from Charlie Chaplin, but it was still good to see him. This is only for slasher completistas.
