Oh my God ... where to begin? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst horror movies B ever made. This crap makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist". Special Note: A Horror B movie needs to have at least one sex scene. Do not expect a hot girl in this one. With this inexcusable error, I should start with the whole party. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you are going to make a horror movie with Horror, you should spend a big part of the budget creating a "cool" one. "The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. There's no way Chupacabras (yes, that's how it's written) looks threatening in the movie. It's an actor in a Halloween costume please !! it seems so cheap that it drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the bloody effects are the spinal cord of any direct video monster Horror movie. <br /> <br /> Again, the producers have decided not to spend on decent effects This is probably the best scene in the movie and it takes about ten seconds.The finale is a very poor scene that does not leave you satisfied < acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in this type of film, but in this film is beyond the terrible.A cast of no experience without acting plays the role of idiot for about 85 A special mention deserves a blonde face of who tries to convince the members of SWAT that he is sick. The cough he pretends is beyond laughable. He's probably the worst actor of all time in a B-Horror movie, no kidding. In addition, Captain PeÃ±a performs a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The true story behind Chupacabras is not told. All you know is that the monster sucks goat blood. Why bother with this crap? Plesae, do not even watch, even if you have the chance. Not even if it's airborne. <br /> <br /> I usually support low budget movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something "different" than Hollywood, but that does not mean that Horror fans like me should accept that kind of crap.
