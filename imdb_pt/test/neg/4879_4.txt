This is a really mediocre movie in the vein of "Buckaroo Banzai". The cast runs like "wannabes" Mad Max, and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the guilty pleasure actresses you have the pleasure of finding in movies, but she's not worth the price of rent. Space Maggot starts an electric fire and burns 4 votes.
