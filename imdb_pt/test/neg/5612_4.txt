Rutger Hauer helps throughout a film that can basically be summed up in the young, finding yourself category and obviously so, so it needs a lot of help. The beginning has much more promise, from a movie that could turn into Michael Clayton or Stranger Than Fiction. It's too bad because I really got addicted at first. Then, like the opening soundtrack, it was grand and intriguing to basically nothing. <br /> <br /> It's fun enough with lots of curiosities and interesting characters acted well. I'm sure this will be enough for many people. The problem is that everything seems artificial and empty, which, ironically, is supposed to be the main breakthrough for the character's self-realization. Not the movie itself (it's not a self-conscious movie), but the character must recognize that his own life is artificial and empty.
