Anyone who has seen the stinking piece of poop called Congo understands my title. And I feel for you. This movie was not just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? There are rumors that Julia Roberts ended her ass because this movie was so bad. Huge diamonds? Murderous gorillas Talking about gorillas? Hmmm Sounds like a hit! OH! Tim Curry's accent is so bad in this movie that I would rather be deaf! I recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or Kavorkian patients who just need one more reason to die. If this is true to the book, I'd say leave us a good old fashion by burning and destroying all copies. If future generations look back and find this garbage, how could we explain? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Do not watch! To run away! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! If you think it is full of action or suspense or legal effects, you are wrong! If you think you explode more cock than Nicole Ritchie, you'd be right. So if you're still going to watch Crapo ... I mean Congo, I mean, do it after you've just taken 50 PM of Tylenol.
