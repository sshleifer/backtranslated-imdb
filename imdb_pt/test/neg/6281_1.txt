I felt like I was watching an example of how not to make a movie. I think the director filmed it in his yard! There was no real plot. <br /> <br /> Terrible script. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting. <br /> <br /> The worst production I've ever seen. A couple of bad CG effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what appeared to be a dump. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write reviews for movies, but I was taken to warn everyone about it. One. <br /> <br /> Life is short to waste your time with this movie!
