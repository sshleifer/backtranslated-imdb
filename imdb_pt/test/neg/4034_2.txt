No movie I've ever seen before came close to being as boring and stupid as this bunch of junk. And I've always been a big fan of B movies. After seeing this total crap, I can honestly say that it does not even come close to being a B movie. <br /> <br /> No one in this movie could act if their life depended on it . The script is so stupid I guess I've never heard anyone speak like that in my life. The writer must spend a few years studying real-life people to see how they act and speak, even so they would not be able to make an assistive film because it's so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent in driving. they at all. <br /> <br /> I could make a better film with a digital camera and some monstrous toys. Also, forget about the sexy scenes, the women in leather clothes are so grotesque that you'd rather vomit! <br /> <br /> Avoid this mindless trick unless you want to be bored!
