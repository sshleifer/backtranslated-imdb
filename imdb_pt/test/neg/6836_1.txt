It's hard to screw this up. GREAT book / BOA film version of Fred Zinneman, however, this movie is horrible! First, the cast was terrible. Richard Gere should interpret Jackal himself as Edward Fox was a similar type of cypher and they did not have to mess with the original script adding so much worthless fluff. This movie reminded me of so many Bruce Willis movies, since you see a huge expense with NADA cinematographic to show this. (It's his "Conspiracy Theory") You have to do something real to make such a bad movie from such a good original script. Every person of Michael Caton Jones should be banned from making movies for 10 years; such is the insult that this film is for real filmmakers. If Hollywood went to trial for having no idea what he was doing, this movie would be Exhibit A. What a shame for you ALL!
