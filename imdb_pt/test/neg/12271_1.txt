For those of you who do not remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - this came out in 1979 (I think it's been long enough that naturally Nunzio realized that he could just redo this and say he wrote - yes, right!). <br /> <br /> The performance in this is off limits - the "tough guys" walk around with their shoulders bent forward to give the impression that they are bigger than them. Really they are, also the "hero" seems to have a passion for smelling, and rolling his eyes in a half-eager way to express distress / anger to the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of racial message here from the Sicilian point of view (remember this is about 3rd generation below the line ... the original "wogs" arrived in OZ after the war and during my childhood - yes I am an Aussie. -iness "was diluted a lot - they still sound like true-blue Aussies - not a flicker of the" accent dagger "anywhere (there is another slang for you, Nun! ) Maori with sunnies (sunglasse s) at 4:00 am - it should be cool to be blinded in the sun in the middle of the night and it seems like Redfern ... this is the tedious end of this movie.Nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the Warriors but left <br /> <br /> The warriors had a gang of baseball players wielding bats, with white face makeup chasing the heroes to a train station and fighting them - Nunzios is chased in a train station by a gang of wielding men wearing whitish masks. rogues were wrongly accused of firing / murdering another gang member - the Nunzios gang is mistakenly accused of raping the sister of the great Maori gang leader. The warriors are drawn into a room by a gang of girls who attack them - the Nunzios crowd wants to hit a friends house, which is populated by a gang of girls - there are almost too many copies of the Warriors to keep this way . <br /> <br /> I am saddened that people do not want to see other movements of OZ because of this gut - and Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all movies are made by actors who are so bad, they have to finance their own movies. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors in the show, they seem to have been inspired by the "nun", since everyone is as bad as the others - do not bother with this movie! I can not get my money back - so save yours!
