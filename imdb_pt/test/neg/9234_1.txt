Altioklar: Master of thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch some movie, steal some parts of it, write a script ... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar watched "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", some series that is about crime, murder, etc., so he said "Eureka, eureka" (I found!) After he wrote the screenplay for movie. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the movie. It only took me 10 minutes. He shouted, "I'm the killer, I'm the killer." There is no mystery. <br /> <br /> The tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated mimetisms, funny macho. <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in the movie. The performance of Demet Evgar is very good. You can see the movie just for that.
