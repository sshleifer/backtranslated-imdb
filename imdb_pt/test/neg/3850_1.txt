This movie is pathetic in every possible way. Bad acting, horrible script (was there?), Terrible editing, bad cinematography, cheap humor. Simply awful. <br /> <br /> I had seen The Wishmaster a few weeks before this movie and I thought it was the worst movie of the year. So I saw 'The Pest' and suddenly 'The Wishmaster' did not look so bad at all. Bad Bad Bad. Extremely bad.
