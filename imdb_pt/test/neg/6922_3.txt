Seeing that this had a theatrical release nowhere in the world, this only serves as a reminder that the careers of these untalented ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich were. It's also a particular kind of movie, the kind that thinks they're clever, funny and original, being poor in every way. The total blame can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. His script takes a rather non-original situation and goes right nowhere with it. The situations develop completely without any internal logic, besides a desperate writer. Characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, behave stupidly and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We do not believe her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for a minute and the way she is brought back into the game after the one-hour mark is particularly regrettable. Why would anyone fall in love with an egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant like this in the first place, let alone a second time? Especially after you supposedly found your ... true love ...? And if any of these things are not enough to completely smash this movie, then the central couple is. The coupling of Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than Richards's, but it is useless. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we can freely accept as a trustworthy couple. Worse, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing boring and annoying things that the viewer ultimately has no interest in general. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very poor display. Even rom-com fans can live with this, as there are dozens of movies made with more skill or more charm.
