Finally, a movie that rivals 'El Padrino' and 'Darkness Falls' in terms of sheer stupidity. This is really the first movie I've ever given 1 out of 10 for IMDb, and with good reason. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the cast is nothing special. This is usually not a problem for me, except that the only character who is anyway interesting or unlike any other is Harrington, of Grand L. Bush. Second, production values ​​a lower standard - TV science fiction as "Stargate" has more convincing sets, and all underwater scenes NOT manipulated by SFX crews are filmed in dry scenarios with "falling particles" that are not very convincing . This movie is literally 'drydocked'. The worst part is that this movie is boring. In the first 45 minutes, I felt like we were going around and around: "It's a prehistoric shark." "Bullsh * t" "Not really." "Bullsh * t" "I'm not making this up." "Bullsh * t" "There it is now!" "I did not see anything." "Let me guess?" "Yes. Bullsh * t" After that, it takes a little bit for about twenty minutes. Then we return to the dialogue. Dialogue is not a bad thing, but it's all that this movie has. Characters talking. This is also not a bad thing, except that this movie is not very good at it. Dialogue is often invented and clichéd, and it is not very interesting to hear. I see no reason to defame the special effects; this movie has worse qualities. <br /> <br /> The scenarios are small and unrealistic. The acting is sub-par. The script - oh lord, the script - is worse than a science fiction junk has to dig up. Makes you wonder where the budget of this movie is or was. <br /> <br /> Another terrible and horrible addition to the Megaloadon movie series (there are about four). Bring Steve Alten, please ...
