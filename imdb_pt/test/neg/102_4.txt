Of course I saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate show, so of course they were just the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is, up to a point. A young college student (Sarah) is finding puzzles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them, and in doing so she involuntarily gets involved in some game. Now this is quite intriguing there, but unfortunately everything gets a bit confusing and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like me) will probably be frustrated. The characters appear with little introduction and you are not sure who they are either because Sarah knows them or is dating them. All this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a boy years ago and her reason for it was that "it was all part of the design". In reality, it's all part of the "very sketched script" and when the movie is over, you'll feel like you've lost about an hour and a half of your life you want back to more productive uses of your time. , such as cleaning the bathroom, for example. 4 out of 10.
