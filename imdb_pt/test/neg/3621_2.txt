Zoey 101 is basically about a girl named Zoey who transfers to an inner boarding school of boys during the first year they integrate the girls. This crude plot is, I admit, a good idea. Although this program was intended for children, a five-year-old could probably point to his fatal flaws. First, Zoey is a clich√© character, being super popular, super cute, super smart, and there is nothing wrong with her; No girl is like that. It seems that the show was highlighted in Jamie Lynn Spears and increased her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of season one, is simply simple. However, in my opinion, she was probably the most realistic character of all, which is sad because Dana is never cool. Nicole is very lively and acts like a full artillery, but mysteriously stays ahead with A's. Lola seems to be able to fool anything with her Emmy deserving acting skills. Quinn is supposed to be super-intelligent, and although she's able to create the most unrealistic things, she's also made to be weird, and she never catches any faces even though she's beautiful and smart as Zoey, Lola, and Nicole get guys and they're all beauty and no personality. Chase and Michael are very similar, and sometimes even confuse them. Logan is unrealistically wealthy and distributes millions as if they were dollars. No one is that rich. I also noticed that all the characters in the series are bad for that girl Stacy, who does nothing but be kind to them. That's not funny! This is mean and only influences young girls to act for totally legal people. Finally, the school itself adds coverage to the unreal cake, offering students five-star amenities such as a picturesque venue, sushi bar, hot lounge equipped with free soft drinks machines, pool and jacuzzi, movie theater and allowances for boys and girls. to enter freely in the dorms of the other sex. In most boarding schools, if a boy went to a girl's dormitory or vice versa, he would be expelled. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent a few more years writing. process.
