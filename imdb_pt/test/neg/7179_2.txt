This is undoubtedly the worst movie in the saga of Hamilton and the worst actor to do Carl Hamilton. Peter Stormare simply can not do it, with his psychotic appearance and no style. He may be good at killing psychotic killers and maniacs as in "Fargo" or "8mm," but in this kind of roles, he's just useless. <br /> <br /> The presence of Lena Olin did not suit this film. She could not save him from being what he is: an Americanized copy of big-budget action movies like "Goldeneye," "Die Hard 3," "Broken Arrow," etc. This film has nothing Swedish about it, but the actors. Of course some director norweagian novice with McTiernan as model director did this. Mark Hamill's presence is just laughable. 2 out of 10
