Thus, Wynorski remakes Curse of the Komodo a second time, this time replacing the interesting characters of the original by a bunch of detestable environmentalists / anticapitalists. And he adds a Snake. Most of the film is spent listening to the hypocritical characters chattering about the evil capitalist pigs, while among this cavalcade of condescension there are flashbacks of what happened on the island before they got there. DNA experiments were conducted, creatures began to grow, people spoke to one another without showing themselves as morally superior idiots, and so on. Needless to say, it would have been a much better movie if they had done the flashbacks of the movie and forgotten the sanctimonious benefactors. Lest I forget, there are some short scenes scattered here and there, where the holier bunch gets caught one by one, but they probably comprise less than 2% of the movie. The main event that puts our title characters against each other lasts for about a minute and is as exciting as watching the previews of the latest Dino-Crisis video game. <br /> <br /> The acting is really bad overall, even for that guy. of film. Half the actors seem to be more concerned with pronouncing each last syllable of each word than talking about their dialogue anyway. <br /> <br /> I really got to the end, but it's one of those movies I'd like to have recorded and watched later because there are so many parts that need to be routed fast. Overall, I give this effort a star, it has absolutely none of the elements that make a B movie fun to watch. It's a sad day, actually, when you can honestly say that the creators of this movie could have learned one or two things by watching Good vs. Python.
