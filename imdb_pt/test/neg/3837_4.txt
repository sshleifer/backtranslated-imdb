Hopper has never been worse, as if he felt that this movie deserves only a B-level performance and he performs well. Outside of Madsen and Hopper, the acting is horrible; you've seen better at your local high school. The sound and sometimes editing and camera photos are low volume. The scene with the peeping tone is from the highest free-nude movies I've ever seen (it does not even come close to fitting into the movie). The script was probably a great sketch of 10 pages, but when it comes to a feature film there are more holes, then the corpses that Madsen left behind. I have to say that Hopper dressed in a cool suit driving the Hummer made me laugh out loud but I did not think that was the intention. Yes, there is a little style, and Hopper can always attract my interest. However, the concept of interesting plot never pays off and you wonder why you wasted your time watching it.
