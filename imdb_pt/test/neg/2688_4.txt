This movie is really amazing, over the years I have acquired a taste for Monster Japanese movies and I am well aware that the earliest examples of this genre can be bad. However this hits a new low, as follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (?), A boy who controls a giant robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seem to have an endless supply of horrible giant monsters at their disposal.
