This movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes. I do not know what everyone was smoking calling this a beautiful movie. I feel like a few hours of my life have been stolen from me and I want them back. I would put it in the category of a Battlefield Earth. Yes, people are so bad. You'd do well to watch a two-minute clip from that movie several times, and it would have the same effect. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
