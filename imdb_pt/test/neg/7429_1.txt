This will be my first review on IMDb and I'm glad that the standard rating is 1 in 10 because I do not have to change anything ... First there are horrible movies. . Movies that you can make laugh, like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. This is totally acceptable. They make a great empowering party. Then there's the worst movie ever. I can not believe how this stack of steaming dog poo was horrible. <br /> <br /> I found it in a second-hand store on VHS and bought it quickly because I like science fiction, Terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff. Like that. Everything about the box art was very promising. So I put the tape on quickly when I got home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There was perhaps 10 minutes (or more) of switching between the present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that make you vomit. And this just goes on and on. So some "acting" comes into play and you wonder why you were born into a world where this abomination of humanity really exists ... And then I realized, THERE ARE, REALLY, TWO AWARDS. I did not think of it first, but the title says "3" on it ... And I was horrified. But as I actually with much pain and agony watched it to the end, I thought nothing could make me feel worse about me and this universe ... But then a little text appeared saying ... "Next ..." and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO, PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
