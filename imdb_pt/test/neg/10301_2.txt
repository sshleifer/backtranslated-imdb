I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and was also working at Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital, and West Houston during Allison. First, the hospital shots are sadly suburban. Texas Medical Center has a daytime population similar to Wall Street !! There are huge professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the largest Children's Hospital before doubling in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1,500 beds, is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The skyline of Texas Medical Center is larger than Memphis. However, the best photos Hollywood could have are from some hospital in the middle of nowhere (besides the actual hospital picture taken decades ago). In addition, they combined several real-life characters and portrayed them all in one (super-nurse). I really know the medical technician (s) who work in the blood bank. Two, where actually working at the time, but the film shows only a pregnant MT. There was a pregnant MT and another MT that took the precious rolodex patient (search for "alloantibodies" for more information). I will not mention their names (privacy). There was no nurse on the real-life lab scene. Hollywood combined these two technologies (most likely to save time and money). In the movie, military (real) helicopters had to transfer our babies (NICU and PICU) to UTMB to Galveston! Why do you ask, when we have the largest children's hospital down the street? Because the Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read it right, they refused !!! Being employed by them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I'm no longer affiliated with this facility. Any other comments would be repetitive to those already posted by the people who actually live here or lived the experience.
