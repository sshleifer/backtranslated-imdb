Let me start by saying that I do not remember laughing once during this comedy. From the opening scene, our protagonist Solo (Giovanni Ribisi) shows himself to be a self-centered, weak and egotistical loser, completely incapable of dealing with minor responsibilities, such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word, or forming a coherent thought. I think we should be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and encourage him through the process of coming out of a deep depression. I think we should sympathize when he is faced with a series of misadventures apparently unleashed by the purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own despicable nature. I did not understand the slightest hint that Solo ever possessed some redeeming character, which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days. No spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he could realize that his life is so utterly miserable because he is a selfish, self-incompetent low life. I did not develop any connection with this character. He did not seem to mind, so I did not want him to take off his knee joints at any point. <br /> <br /> The dog was not a character in the movie. It was simply a prop to be used, neglected, despised, abused, coveted and discarded on a whim. So be warned. Even though "dog" is in the title, this movie is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers. <br /> <br /> The role of Scott Caan is fun and believable as the best friend / cadé of the opposite sex. Don Cheadle is sincere and magnetic - I always want to see more of him on the screen. Mena Suvari was delightfully repellent. Lynn Collins's role of a "stripper with a heart" was well represented, but the character was both absurd and clichéd, not to mention that there was zero chemistry between her and Ribisi. <br /> <br /> Romantic? Difficultly. Comedy? If you say.
