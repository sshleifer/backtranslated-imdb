I'm writing this while watching the DVD. I got the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I did not know anything about the movie except that a friend said the show should be good. It has a decent Netflix rating too, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Maybe on stage that would work. But I have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly. And the synchronization of the lips with a pre-recorded score increases the strangeness. <br /> <br /> Most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. This is my idea of ​​nothing, sorry. The score, so far, is generic show song music. Nothing memorable, or particularly melodic. All is to serve the letters. Which, I should say, looks like they were written by a committee. Each song is essentially an extended joke. If the jokes were ten seconds, they could work. These individual jokes of several minutes do not. <br /> <br /> Now I'm watching the movie by chapters - a few minutes until I get the gist. Kind of hoping that one of them is different, or fun enough to keep me from going to the next scene. No. <br /> Okay, I'm done. So here is what I think. If you have any experience or long-time appreciation of musical theater, avoid it - it's not just the quality. If, however, you are a gay in his twenties and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you can have fun. Or maybe this has your interest if you've never seen many attractive nude men. <br /> <br /> I have.
