I just do not get these comments! I can not help but think that they are written by the type of LOG fan who would love anything they did without questioning if it is really good. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the show, but I thought this movie was a meaningless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I had left the movie after having laughed more than twice. At one point, I thought it might just be me before realizing that almost no laughter was being coined by the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I was not expecting too much from a plot (very few TV comedies stand to be stretched more than 90 minutes), but thought the strange dialogue LOG or visual joke (as at the beginning of each program) would take a movie. After 5 minutes of the 17th century storyline, I was begging for it to end (hardly knew I would continue for the rest of the movie). It just was not funny. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed and I can not see the story being too gentle with it, even though some tough fans write enthusiastic comments.
