I must say I was very excited about this movie before renting it, since it was a production of "Adam Madison" by Adam Sandler, and I am usually attracted to this kind of silly humor. <br /> <br /> There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the movie, but this movie was missing everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many movies that are not realistic can still be very funny, but this movie was not realistic and not a bit funny. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. I can not get over the fact that 3 old ladies in the class would work even to write so poor. Overall, I was very impressed with this movie and I would not recommend wasting $ 5 on renting it.
