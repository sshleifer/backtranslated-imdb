This is really one of the worst films ever made - and I do not mean in such a bad way that it's good. Eddie Murphy is a great comic book, and it's proof of how bad this movie is that almost killed his career. Writing and directing are ineffective, sets and scenarios are as imaginative as an episode of Brady Bunch, and the acting shows how bad a great cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with. If it were not for the costumes - which, besides Eddie Murphy's ego, seem to account for most of the budget - you could swear that this thing was hit by a bunch of high school students lost in peppermint Schnapps. That anyone can find this farce in some funny or amusing way is incomprehensible. It is probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are praising this stinking are just literate. But if your idea of ​​hilarity is Della Reese getting your little finger, then please put away your glass of drool and go rent this movie.
