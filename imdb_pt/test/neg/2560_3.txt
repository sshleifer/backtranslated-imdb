This is actually the movie that popularized kung fu in the 70s. However, if it ever had some kind of excitement or even some interesting storyline, it does not seem to have aged very well. <br /> <br /> Long short story: extremely elaborate, slow, confusing plot with common choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whipping sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "twists" that never come to an end. By the time the movie reaches its emotional climax, I have long had the wind knocked out to really care. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to its historical value as a landmark of Chinese kung fu cinema - just leave your expectations at the door, or you will be deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for hardcore fans.
