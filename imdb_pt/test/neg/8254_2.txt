Oops I hired this because I thought it was Bitter Harvest (1981), which was recommended. After the onset of the shocking Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendation and discovered my mistake. OK, it's watchable because the main characters are very sexy, but the acting is horrible. Stephen Baldwin seems melancholy all the time, which is understandable considering his co-star. Is Patsy competing with Liz Hurley for the most obviously useless actor title on the screen?
