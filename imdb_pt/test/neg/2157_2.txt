I do not know what the purpose of making this movie was. It looked like it was made by some historical society to be shown at their local museum 'Pistol Pete'. At first, it looks like it might be the beginning of an outline of Mad TV or SNL. But then the joke is on you when there is no line and you realize that someone was taking it seriously. The story was not bad, but the inclusion of the members of SASS seemed to be a maneuver (that worked) to make me see the film. I swear, the trailer listed all the characters in the movie as "dead cowboy # 5". The reason Westerners are so entertaining is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I just had the feeling that I was watching rean-Civil War actors dressed as cowboys. Nor is it worth the digital video in which it was recorded.
