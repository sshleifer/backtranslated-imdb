I was so "impressed" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I experienced this. It's the near future, post-apocalypse, of course. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) Joins a group of fighters of similar appearance to challenge Dark One and his underling Valaria. Along the way they encounter mutants, crazed women, sewer worms, a large spider leg and some awkward robots. Oh my! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is not high (nor below) the HUNT level. With a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is a cheap movie. The sets have all the elaborate design of a haunted carnival house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number of STAYING ALIVE. The atomic wasteland is a combination of old buildings filled with rubble and Central Park. The headquarters of Dark One is eerily called The Power Station and looks, well, a power station. The acting is universally bad except for Angelika Jager as the evil Valaria. Jager is a whole different level of bad. Sick victim Cherman acczent, she gives such an incredibly bad performance that it becomes the only reason to recommend this movie. She also delivers the film's nudity in the "pleasure chamber" section of the film. Ed French again provides the effects of the robot, but they are not as viscous as their work on MUTANT HUNT.
