Boring, cliché and predictable. The only original part was the location of Brighton for gangsters. Certainly there is no "Lock Stock etc ..." Hannah was nice in "Sliding Doors". In "Circus" I did not develop any empathy with his character and I was not able to bid on what happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this film was so clichéd and predictable that the ending was not a surprise, I was so disinterested that I did not even care about the fact that the film was called "Circus" ....... Booooring ..... .. Do not visit this great top.
