This movie is on the same level as "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" for the biggest pieces of junk that have ever hit the movies. If these guys were not Adam Sandler's gay friends, that script would have ended where it should: as toilet paper for a movie executive. I hate this movie, it makes me want to hurt people. I admit I have high standards, but I honestly prefer to see Step Up 2. The saddest part was when I joined IMDb and I read that the pieces of junk really gave this movie a 6.9 rating. This is a testament to all the retarded in our society who will watch terrible movies that are only an hour and a half in duration, fart and marijuana jokes with little or no originality. After seeing this rating, I would like to suggest "The House of Pain by Tyler Perry" to all of you who enjoyed this movie; you'll see a high-quality humor there on the same level as this abomination abomination.
