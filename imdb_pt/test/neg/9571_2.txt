This very forced attempt to merge Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (which is overvalued) is neither informative nor amusing. The character's development is arbitrary and unbelievable - especially in the final scene of the bad guys and the little boy, as other reviewers have noted. In addition, a couple of humorous moments aside, the film is not as funny (black humor or not) as the director seems to think it is.
