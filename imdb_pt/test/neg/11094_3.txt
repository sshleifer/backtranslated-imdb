Even the presence of Sophie Marceau and the few (very few) good French gags are unable to save this movie that would otherwise be slow and boring! A disappointment. The story is weak and so is acting. This movie was advertised as the French version of the Mummy, but the Mummy has at least spectacular and enjoyable effects ...
