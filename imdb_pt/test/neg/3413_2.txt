I just saw this movie in a lovely air-conditioned movie theater here in Bangkok. And since the temperature outside is hovering around 37 Â° C with very high humidity, my 100Bt was not wasted. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I do not see this piece of junk extremely well done long ago. This is the kind of film that provides a taste test, so to speak. Anyone who claims to like or like to go immediately to the same list of people with no taste who still talk about the superiority of British television. At least the old and dull in the wheelchair was good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The pseudo-depth and the fat lips, although characteristic of many French films, do not really make a good movie. I'd rather watch Independence Day 10 times in a row than sit through that stench one more time.
