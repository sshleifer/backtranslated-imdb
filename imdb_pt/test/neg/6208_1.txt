Talk about acting ... !!!! not only by Govinda, but also by Salman and Lara ... The direction was horrible. In the first half hour you'd very well want to turn off the movie ... because this movie is really stinky. (Mark my words.) I liked Govinda in some of her comedy roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Jodi No. 1, Akhiyon himself Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai and this does not compare to any of them.And Salman Khan should not do comedic roles at all! He sucks.He does not know how to do comedy.The only one role of good comedy he did was in Andaz Apna Apna, which was brilliant next to Amir Khan. There were so many 'stupidly made and bland' scenes in this movie that make you want to take the DVD and burn it so that no one else in your home ever watches.
