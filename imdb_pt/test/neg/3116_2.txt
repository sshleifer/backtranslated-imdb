First, I do not see how the film is on any "best" list or how it won awards. Compared to La Pianiste, who is also on a "best" list, La Pianiste is gold. This movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but I can not explain why I did not like it that much. The main actor was annoying, I felt like I never knew what was going on, and I was bored! Even though this was a change of life that Pierre was beginning, I wanted it to end ... as quickly as possible. Why do you have to be your sister and cousin? Ugh And why Thibault was mean? It just turned bipolar means. And also, was it me or did I miss the purpose of what that black guy was? Who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? Why did they have all that weird equipment and weapons and all those extra rooms for people to live in? I mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in French culture? European culture? I took 5 years learning about the culture and I never heard anything about it!
