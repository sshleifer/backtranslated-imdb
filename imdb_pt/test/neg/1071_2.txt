I do not understand what's hard to beat in this movie! I do not understand why high school kids should watch this! I do not understand why this should have made me think about anything! When the unnoticed girl is on her way to commit suicide, was I the only one cheering for her? The cliché of classical music, the long shots of tracking, the melancholy emotion of the film at that stage reverted to what was intended. I would only be happy if she came into the room and the whole cast was there with her holding a pair of scissors to cut off her wrists. <br /> <br /> Why? <br /> <br /> Because I went to high school ... and frankly I'm sick of watching movie after film in Australia with teenagers being solely based on terrible clichés. I've been waiting for a younger person to write a movie that I can relate to and this stereotyped junk trash emo is what I have instead. It was like a dark version of broken heart that needed a predictable end. <br /> <br /> Why are all teenagers in Australian dramas depressed or have really strange problems that simply are not counted plausibly? On the plus side, this was funnier than 'Blurred'. And I needed a good laugh.
