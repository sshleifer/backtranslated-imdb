Riccardo Freda may have a good reputation; but since then many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great Mario Bava; Of course he was not one of the most talented filmmakers in Italy in the seventies. This film virtually proves that, despite the simplistic plot; is a huge mess, and on the whole, I would have to go so far as to say that the Tragic Ceremony is worse than the insipid effort of Freda's Giallo, The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire. Freda apparently disowned this movie, and I certainly do not blame it! The plot simply follows a group of kids who run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They happen in a house while looking for fuel; but turns out to be a poor choice as the owner is about to perform a satanic ceremony ... ho hum. The film plays a major role for Camille Keaton, who would star in the classic I Spit on Your Grave a few years later, but fails to make a good impression here despite acting alongside a cast of untalented artists. The film features a decent gore scene at the end, but that is not enough considering that it takes eighty minutes of boredom to get there. I have a high tolerance for Italian films that do not make sense - but even I can not stand that one. Miss, do not miss anything!
