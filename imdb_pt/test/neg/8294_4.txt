OK, a movie about a movie that succeeds in producing video movies can be fun. It could be, it should be, funny, edgy, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is the bizarre negative version of it. Hamlin was entertaining as a 'B' movie producer. Shatner played crazy but friendly, and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, annoying, underdeveloped, annoying and boring. The value of production was lame. You will actually see the explosion fall into a scene. The sound was horrible in some of the scenes. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin now, but your talents are wasted here. At least the story had a clich√© ending.
