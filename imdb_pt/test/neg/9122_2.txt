The class is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! His brother is demonstrating against recruitment and Charles Martin Smith is doing everything he can in Vietnam to be sent home. <br /> <br /> The issues of the 1960s are brought to light here, but they are everywhere, beginning on New Year's Eve 1963, three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1964, and three minutes then it's New Year's Eve 1965, and three minutes later, back to 1963 again. Martin Smith is talking about his friend dying in a drag race a year ago, and a few scenes later, this friend is winning his next drum set in a drag race and to top it off, the drug scene and the flower children come in scene. image (or images, in some cases, up to three different camera photos are shown on the screen at the same time). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you have to watch this movie, but I advise you to keep the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the beginning of the movie before almost all the songs are played in the background, but where did he go? Maybe he could not follow this movie and give up! 2 out of 5 stars!
