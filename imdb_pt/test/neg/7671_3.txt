My Take: The most ridiculous of the AIRPORT films, and probably one of the worst disaster films of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> As if wanting to franchise with all its products, producers of this third installment of AIRPORT in more action, silly subplots, free star appearances, and idiotic elements. In its attempt to be the largest airport so far, CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79 is the worst of all, and probably one of the worst disaster films of the 1970s. With its poor box office results, it is no wonder that the genre has passed your welcome. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a rather captivating score by Lalo Schifrin, backed by some stunning images of the titular plane. in its former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in an accident in July 2000). But then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the cast of "stars," made up only of faded Hollywood stars, TV actors, and unpopular B actors. The plot is more foolish than ever: George Kennedy is back in the role of Joe Patroni, now Concorde pilot (co-piloted by co-pilot Alain Delon) on his way to France after the Olympics. On board is reporter Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely), who has just discovered that her boyfriend, the renowned gun maker Kevin Harrison (Robert Wagner), is selling his weapons to the terrorist. To prevent it from revealing the news to the world, Harrison sends his most advanced missiles and the best saboteurs to prevent Concorde from landing. <br /> <br /> The cast / subplots are dumber than ever, even dumber than an alcoholic Myrna. Loy or a singing nun. We have Cicely Tyson carrying a living human heart in a refrigerator (!), Martha Raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character does not go deeper than that), JJ Walker a saxophonist smoker (possibly the most boring character in the film), Eddie Albert married "old" wife Sybil Danning, Avery Schreiber as Russian trainer with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter Jon Davidson and gymnast Andrea Marcovici (much to the sour eye of coach Mercedes McCambidge). In addition, the film draws much closer to the LOVE BOAT episode than ever before with the more silly Charo (and his Chihuahua pet) and Bibi Anderson. Camp aficionados will surely get a real kick in the foolish entry into a long series of disaster films of the '70s. This is, in more than the sense of the word, a real disaster. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 out of 5.
