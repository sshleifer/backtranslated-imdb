For a country that has produced some of the best playwrights in the world and has such a rich musical heritage, it has always been a source of perplexity to me why so much of Ireland's home theater has been so scary. Perhaps because, by their very nature, those talented Irish filmmakers have been quick to leave their homelands for careers in Britain or America (Colin Farrell is a recent case) and the really successful Irish directors have continued working in Ireland and with the Irish made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. I am thinking particularly of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternate between films with an Irish scene and projects filmed overseas. "Middletown", however, is much more an Irish film, even though two of its main actors are English. It is certainly well made of its kind and may have resisted the tendency that Irish films are not really very good; ("I Went Down" by Paddy Breathnach, written by the brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately, this history of fundamentalism is set in a fictitious Irish town, presumably in northern Ireland judging by the Mid-Ulster Bible Belt, if you ask me, and presumably in the recent past (the fifties?), Is so exaggerated that it's really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the film is true and you can not help but feel that you are a writer, Daragh Carville, was heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that the whole thing could have made more sense had it been put in the American Bible belt and not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist has never been so crazy as this. It's all to be gloomy in a grandiose way, and it sure is, though I was more prone to laugh than the frisson at the correct antics of Reverend Matthew Macfayden. He has the Ulster accent and there is nothing wrong with his acting or even with Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays's wife, but the script is so frighteningly derivative that good acting can not do nothing. to save the movie. So, instead of climbing the rung of Irish cinema, "Middletown" is, I'm afraid, just another nail in the coffin.
