There are bad movies, movies that are horrible, and then there is a tiny, rarefied body of films so terribly bad that even after seeing them only once, the horrible horror makes it impossible to forget them even decades later. This is exactly this movie, and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was really good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the "original" mechanic of the original was somehow promoted to captain of the airline and, after the Concorde was attacked by missiles (do not ask), he uses acrobatics like firing a flare gun outside the window cockpit, despite (presumably) flying to Mach 2, all the while doing the kind of evasive maneuvers that could have ripped off the wings of any real airplane, no matter what the passengers' effect! But the absolute worst part of the film, at least for dedicated airplane enthusiasts like me, is that this atrocity "starred" one of the coolest, sexiest, and most technologically notable planes ever to fly. The Concorde (or simply "Concorde", as its pilots refer to it) deserved much better, this abomination is equivalent to having a high-class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting it into a "Porky" sequel. Fortunately, the release of the always hilarious "Airplane!" The following year, the "Airport" franchise led to a well-deserved stop, since anyone thinking of a fifth installment would have been ridiculed to death by studios and movie buffs. <br /> <br /> 1/10
