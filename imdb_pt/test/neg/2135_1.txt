Never before have such a large group of ugly people come together to make an equally ugly film. Something big and creepy is loosed in the waters off the coast of Florida, something that leaves the bodies half-chewed back. your treadmill. Dependent on beard for doing Bob believes he caught the "evil voice" of the Thing on tape. Bob's assistant, the incredibly sloppy and painfully emaciated Stella, decides to rely on the ladies' man, Peter, an electrician whose equipment can help them locate the mysterious creature. But anyone who stuck his nose too far into the mystery ends up dead, killed by a baboon that faced a wounded man with a bad standing. What is the terrible secret behind the Sea Killer? <br /> <br /> Ugly scientists have torrid cases, inept police officers and confused physicians about the growing number of corpses, Stella and Peter are on the beach and characters we do not care about are killed or chewed. The Sea Killer, a strange combination of an octopus, a shark and a pair of large prosthetics, never looks as threatening as it should. The conspiracy behind the creation of the monster makes no sense at all. None of the characters are particularly nice, and those who can be are killed immediately. This is a bad shot, dubbed, less messy plot. The whole thing is so sinuous and stinking it made me crave a hot shower. I had more scary sushi dishes than this movie. Avoid, unless it is the MST3K version.
