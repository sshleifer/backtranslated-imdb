This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. I say this without hyperbole, and believe me, I have seen many bad movies. It's embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars have entered this movie and that hundreds (thousands?) Of craftsmen have spent so much time working on what writers and producers MUST have known would be a colossal failure. <br /> <br /> A 90-minute film seems so long, boring, annoying and incomprehensible, you know something went wrong somewhere. Also, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I liked elsewhere) is simply terrible in that role; Obviously, he has never been screened, because no producer in his right mind would consider it amusing anyway, especially under the guise of The Mask. Simply awful. Personally, I can not wait to see the reviews of the top movie critics because I know they do a better job than me in destroying this ruined train. <BR> <BR> The producers of this film should be ashamed and, most importantly, can NEVER make theatrical films again.
