Dr. Seuss would certainly go mad now if he were alive. Cat in the Hat proves how movie productions can have a classic story and turn it into a pile of meaningless goopos. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves that he can not act in that film. He acts like a straight-up girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are fine, somewhere between the boring and annoying lines. The story is like the original with a few tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never mess with the original storyline! Bringing the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He's a stupid villain who would never get anywhere in life. This movie is like a comic strip rejected from the newspaper if you think about it. The movie looks very cheesy! Of course there are funny adult jokes, like when the cat cuts off his tail and the censor shoots before he utters a malicious, slightly funny word. At least the Grinch had spoken, and the movie was really good! This movie is a piece of cartoon with bright colors and mediocre poor acting. Mike Myers really was in this movie, actually? And another thing, the fish. What's with that stupid fish! The first time you see him, he's a real fish. The next time you see him, he'll be all excited and talking. But it looks like an excited piece of rubber dough! This movie is a total target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised we still had good jokes like the joke at the water park, which was nice. So please, if you have the choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess.
