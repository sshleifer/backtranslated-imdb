My first extremely disappointing BBC / Jane Austen film. The tone is off, the costumes are off, the hair is loose, the music is from outer space, and Robert Hardy, bless him, seems to be really annoyed at being so stinky. Even part of the cast is disabled. No, I accept that, a good director can make a silk purse from a nut ear, so to speak. The performances in this thing are so exaggerated and melodramatic that it is almost a farce of a story of Jane Austen, which is ironic, since the abbey of Northanger is a kind of homage of the gothic romance. I wanted to slap the female leadership after a while; who made the decision that she should be so ninja? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Ufa!
