The worst movie I've ever seen. Like the other honest reviewers, it's just an excuse to get the birds naked with their freaks. Do not go wrong, naked women is not a bad thing, but there is another genre of film for that. <br /> <br /> Boyfriends, be careful. I sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang party (due to reviews) to be greeted with all the other scenes full of naked women spinning on the spot. Cover the chops for me. <br /> <br /> What makes me laugh is that all the motorcycle dives that they were in the movie were filled with models with the cosmetic works - what do the biker bars have? They are usually slightly slaughtered with tattoos and much more sacred juggs! Completely unrealistic. The acting is terrible, lots of useless profanity and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen Vinnie Jones's attempt with an American accent? It's as embarrassing as your football skills. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. The only reason you watch this movie is if you are a young boy who can not access p @ rn and stole from your parents' movie collection for some perverted kicks!
