Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they do not know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and is still out there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was late at night when I put it on my DVD. player. I sincerely wish I could go back in time and stop myself. Most people will say that movies like "The House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" will be the movies you have never seen. Wrong. That will be it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of crap, but that's the only crap that haunts me. How I wish I had never watched it! The acting really is not so bad. It's just the writing, the direction, the rhythm and everything! I'm really a fan of the Sasquatch movies. But not this one. <br /> <br /> Please hear my warning. Do not watch it!
