Well, the movie was not terrible, but the one who created the screen did not do a good job of creating the essence of the unger. This movie was a little below average and did not tell the story correctly about one of the most interesting people ever born. I suggest reading the book "one of a Kind" the most unpleasant true story. They have left out large parts of their life. They also sometimes did not understand the real driver he was. The real facts of his life were sometimes out of order. And in the end they did not really portray the actual personality he had. So please do not watch the movie; Read the book. By the way I'm not just an idiot who feels like you have to stay 100% for real history, but they have not even come close !!!
