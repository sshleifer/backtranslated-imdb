This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999, when a strange disease breaks out and ... I stopped caring. This is supposed to be about two people living more or less each other in an apartment complex. There is a leak and a plumber puts a hole in the man's floor so you can see the apartment below the woman. Also, since there is a crisis going on in much of the dialogue, it's actually news ... <br /> <br /> Does it look promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. <br /> <br /> He became distracted and began doing other things that is deadly in a movie with subtitles. Basically I started not to watch, which made the events look even more surreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> It may work for you, not for me.
