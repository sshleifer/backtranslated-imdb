In & Out made me want to vomit. I've never seen such a shameless movie! He seriously wanted to say that being gay is wonderful and joyful, but he has no idea how to say it. For me, this was not a comedy, unless cruel, sick jokes are laughable when a victim falls in love with him. Matt Dillion's character in announcing to the world that he is a former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. No matter how unbelievable it is that the character Matt Dillion won an Oscar for what appeared to be a serious role on the verge of a collapse. But why would he say that? After all, this has never been a problem for Howard's students, his friends, his family, and his finace. Nobody. So why would he say something like that when it was not true? More to the point, why does not the movie provide us an answer on why he said it? The reason is because there is no response, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. The second (B) flaw is with the fact that the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is - attraction and sexual intercourse with members of the same sex. In this movie, being gay is based on liking Barbara Streisand's musicals and being passionate about literature. It's all based on stereotypes! <br /> <br /> Both failures are found again in the graduation ceremony that must be seen to be read. Matt Dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the movie seems ready to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives at the ceremony, he says nothing, and I wonder why in the world he got there. He did not solve anything. Then, when the whole audience got up to announce that they were gay, I was so moved that I wanted to vomit! Those people were standing up in defense of Howard being gay mocking all these stereotypes. What the film forgot is that it was using these stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. The filmmakers have just shot their own feet! But wait, there's more! <br /> <br /> During the ceremony, (C) Howard seemed to be on trial to lose is work as a teacher because people believed he would influence his students to be gay. What the movie was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit and that it would not influence their students. But did not we see the character of Tom Selleck continually press Howard repeatedly, even to the point of unexpectedly kissing him out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to leave? From this, the film clearly shows that homosexuals are capable of recruiting. The movie, again, then launches in the foot. <br /> <br /> And (D) when Howard came out of the closet, did not anyone notice how the script shut him up for the rest of the movie? I counted only three lines that he had after: "Yes!" to his parents: "Hi!" for a student and "Are you ready?" to Tom Selleck before the last scene of vomit. I may be down by one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never believed he was gay. <br /> <br /> As a bonus, the film also includes several really offensive scenes. One where Howard is asking a priest in confession to give advice on what to do for a friend (he), who is engaged and has not had sex with his fiance. "Does that make him gay?" he asks. The priest replied, "Oh, yes, he's definitely gay." Uh-huh Or about the scene where all the ladies are gathered around telling Howard's mother she does not need to be saddened by her son's dark and deep secret because, well ... they all do. Then one of the ladies confessed that she had never seen "The Bridges of Madison County." Funny? Not! Why the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devastating it can be for the family to have one of its members announcing that he is gay. I know. I have several friends who are gay, and none of their families accepted well. That was a bad way of spreading the whole situation. <br /> <br /> The last drop for me was the last scene that gave the appearance that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera slid very slowly to the front of the church when ... It was not what you thought! I was completely disgusted by this point, and I could never forgive this joke in bad taste. I have nothing against movies about being gay or homosexual. "Philadelphia" and "Longtime Companion" were very honest and truthful in what they had to say. "In & Out" is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of ​​the corruption at its core. What I learned in the movie is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, that is, if you have the doubt, YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It is as if homosexuality is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. In fact, if everyone told you repeatedly that you were useless and stupid, you'd end up believing that too, would not you? That's what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Annoyed all weekend, actually. This was a seriously sick and cruel film, the WORST of 1997.
