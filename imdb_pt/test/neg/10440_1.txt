This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no fragment of historical accuracy, in fact, reality is reversed. Just one example: Morgan attacked the few ethnic Chinese he encountered. The acting is exaggerated, the script is a poorly written lie. I've never seen false beards worse. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and would have only made the film if the script was fully rewritten so he could be a hero. Since the script was composed of ten in real time, the can explain how bad it is and how disjointed the film is. <br /> <br /> Any film about Ned Kelly is so much better than this movie.
