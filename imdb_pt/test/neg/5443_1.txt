As an avid cinema goer-er I felt that while I was ranking in my favorite movies, I felt it was just to rank my most hated movies. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I really have nothing positive to say about this movie. In fact, it's one of only two movies I've ever had. In all honesty, I came back and watched the movie again for another shot and went through it just to wish I should have stayed away. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the film has a cast and a really decent crew. ... but even the brightest stars in Hollywood can not give life to a dead body in a script. <br /> <br /> Stay away ... Save yourself from this truly lamentable 'movie' 1/10
