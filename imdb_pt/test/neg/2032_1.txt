This was the most uninteresting horror movie I've ever seen. The premise is clearly forgotten after about 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! What did the film festival judges think when they gave this garbage a "best movie" rating? The only reasons I did not turn off this movie were to see what NOT to do as a filmmaker, and if the fine plot as paper could really continue as it was. I was not disappointed with this last notion. There was not a single bit of nudity or blood to keep the kids interested! Also, I thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of "Resident Evil 2" in the movie ... Was it supposed to be filler? because it was the most earnest and interesting part of the movie.
