Wow, Kiss the Bride was not so bad, but it was not that good either. Certainly not "Latter-day Saints." The film sinks in the center ... maybe cutting about 30 minutes has made a nicer movie. But the film gets jammed again and again by annoying subplots and throws away the scenes - the whole sequence of gold comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made-for-TV movie. Each scene is lit up like a department store. So many characters are so disposable. <br /> <br /> And dear Tori is actually a pleasant surprise. She steals every scene in which she appears. <br /> <br /> A scene really bothered me. It was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with dozens of tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! Where did everyone go? <br /> <br /> Gay cinema has sunk to a new level ... but not as low as the horrible movies being produced and displayed here! Channel.
