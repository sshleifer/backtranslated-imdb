Writer and director Jay Andrews, also known as Jim Wynorski, serves more of his characteristic link with a decent cast threatened by computer generated reptiles in "Komodo Vs. Cobra," as a generic theft of "Mysterious Island" finds "Jurassic Park "as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable thread about monsters dine on mankind are the incredibly fake special effects. The snake and the Komodo are hilariously horrible. However, graphic people do a good job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that this is at least believable. Clearly, "Komodo vs. Cobra" had such a low budget that virtually everything that is not human is as fake as everyone leaves. This monstrous and extravagant epic takes place on a remote island where the US military carries out ultra-secret DNA tests on animals. The result is that giant Komodos and snakes thrive on this tropical island paradise. When the action begins, the lead scientist is swallowed by a snake that likes to swim. Then we are introduced to a group of 'Greenpeace' as environmental protesters and a journalist. Planet One organizer Jerry Ryan ("Hellbent" Ryan McTavish) pays five days to boat captain Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of the CBS-TV Houston Knights) with a promise of another five thousand if he takes them to this forbidden island . Meanwhile, the US military suspects that something is wrong on the island, so they send their own team of men who are devoured by the great predators. Our heroes encounter the last remaining scientist on the island, Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth's "Wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project, tells them that the military will attack the island by destruction. The title dispute between the two overgrown predators takes place in the last quarter of an hour after our heroes, who were consistently reduced by the monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military sprayed the island. There is no tension, suspense or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature. The best thing about this yawn is the orchestral soundtrack of composer Chuck Cirino; gives "Komodo vs. Snake" an epic feel. Usually Jay Andrews writes and directs tolerable nonsense, but that is far below his low standards. Sexy women do better at survival than guys. In one scene, our heroic group turns into a river and we can not see any wet shirts. Drat! There is nothing in the way of a memorable dialogue or relationship in this story. I think the military takes a lot of salute when they join their heads to conspire. Let's hope Michael Pare has a good pay for this crap. The ending as one of the scientists assumes the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as a belated reflection. It's not so bad, it's good, it's bad.
