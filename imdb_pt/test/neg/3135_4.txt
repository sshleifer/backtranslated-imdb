First, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. This film was evidently not directed at the masses. It's the kind that critics like to watch. The hype and the publicity were quite misleading. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas. Understanding that the story and the period of time require this, I find the film extremely slow. I am a stubborn Aishwarya fan, and I am sorry to say that I thought she was wrong. The role of Chokher Bali required an actress who could portray herself as subversive, not innocent, and naive. Everyone else did a good job. Tagore's depiction of the human condition confronts the celluloid to give the film an interesting theme.
