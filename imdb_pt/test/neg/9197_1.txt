I'm sorry, maybe that's part of the firefighter's compliment wave since 911, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it's not to hit your socks, but excuse me, this movie is awful. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least as many clichés. It's a monotonous story (awesome being able to be sad when there are dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. And his dark life, told in a useless, 'scene of now' flashback to the past style. We started the movie with the hero in danger in a burning building. The whole movie is about trying to make us love this guy, so we squeeze some tears when he finds his end at the end of the scene from the beginning of the movie. I found it hard to care and wished he had smoked earlier. Cliches abound as - death of best friend, love in first place, trot in a new job, firstborn, wife worried about a husband with a dangerous job, a father figure boss / superior, 2.4 children (well 2 but close enough) , sacrificing his life to save others, prizes for bravery .... and so on. It's the life of every fireman, every police officer, nurse, doctor in some way. It was lazy, if it was conceived as a 'life flashing before your eyes' when he died, then God helps the poor boy, I'm surprised he did not suck more smoke to go faster. The flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, dully acted and with a soundtrack that could put The Laughing Cow out of business that was so extravagant, it actually sounded like muzak or royalty free elevator !!! To be avoided at all costs, unless you need something to watch with Grandma on a Sunday night. Or maybe if your related to a fireman - warning - your life will end horribly or you will be tagged for life if you are a brave firefighter according to this movie. Unless your John Travolta (strange Velcro style hair on this one!)
