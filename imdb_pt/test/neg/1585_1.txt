This is the dark tale of the self-absorbed affair between two unpleasant people, one of whom is married to another person. He's at the top of my list of the most annoying movies of all time, and I'm a tough romantic. My husband chose to leave after the first hour of his three, when little had happened. The desert scenery is spectacular, with endless sand and sunshine in Katharine's golden hair. However, cinematography does not make a brilliant movie, unless it is a National Geographic screenplay. The magnificent landscape of the Sahara in this ill-conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a seriously burned dying pilot named Count Laszlo of Almasy, who is left under the care of a Canadian. Army nurse, Hana, during World War II Italy. He seems to remember little of his life, but through a book in his possession, his story is revealed very slowly, with the help of a man from his past named Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed by the Royal Geographical Society to map the Sahara desert. He filed a case with his wife, Katherine, of a fellow explorer who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile, at present, Laszlo's nurse has her own affair with a Sikh nicknamed Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines. <br /> <br /> My disputes with this movie are many, long and tedious to begin with. I do not blame the acting in particular, it just is not a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection with Almasy outlined. It provides a torture scene, but it seems to serve no essential purpose in the film. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the two parts of this case, Almasy and Katharine, are lamentably unpleasant characters, superficial and bland. They simply are not very good so there is no one to cheer. Almasy is cool, indifferent, arrogant and, eventually, disgustingly possessive of another man's wife. Katharine is equally detached and unpleasant, not to mention a lack of guilt or a deplorable feeling for her imperfect but loving husband ... besides administering a tiny tear in the corner of her eye when she dies. <br /> <br /> This is a LUST tale instead of love, with pearls like 'I can still taste you'. Almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation on the neck of his beloved, certainly more indicative of a focus on Katharine's body. The victim of this impenitent adultery is the unhappy husband, Geoffrey, who is treated as little more than a nasty nuisance. It's all very sordid and disgusting, Katharine's farce to feel weak so these lovers can indulge in their much-talked about rampant passion, everything as Silent Night is being sung in the background. I'm not sure if the intent was to contrast the purity of the song with its selfish lust, but I was definitely not impressed by the tone of sacrilege. We have total frontal nudity with Katharine, but her sex scenes are cold, selfish, lascivious, and sometimes downright hateful ... not warm, loving, not even truly in love. If either of these two senses any emotion for the other, it is totally selfish and definitely NOT love, as I define the word. <br /> <br /> Almasy's return to the Swimmer's Cave to retrieve her lover's body appears as planned instead of moving. Katharine must have exhaled only a few moments before, for she shows an excellent color and almost does not seem to be dozing, not a bit like a corpse. Of course this is all for a dramatic effect, since the romantics who watched this tale (usually I would be one of them) would not appreciate a decaying and rotten corpse. In order to recover the body of his adulterous lover, he betrayed his companions and allies by giving his maps to the Nazis, the English being considered the villains of the play. Regardless of whether or not you are fulfilling your final promise to Katharine, your traitorous act is not something I admire much. <br /> <br /> Kip seems to be a nice guy and Hana generally kind, but his novel is not at all engaging, just a brief war adventure with the parties indicating little trauma in the farewell. Going back and forth between the two settings (past Sahara Desert and introducing Italy) proved distracting and unpleasant, but in fact both stories were dull as dishwater. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was the disarming scene of my tense Kip mine. <br /> <br /> Not being totally heartless, I had some sympathy for the severely burned and agonizing state of the current Almasy. However, perhaps my main complaint with this film is euthanasia at the end, when Hana forces her patient, giving her an overdose of morphine. We must feel that this is justifiable and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for Almasy, cries as she prepares the deadly syringe and reads aloud her book, supposedly in love with Herodotus, to comfort him while he is dying. <br /> <br /> The masterpieces of the incredible director David Lean should not be insulted compared to this pathetic and immoral tale. Yes, Lawrence from Arabia also has a desert, but in the Lean movies (Doctor Jivago, Brief Encounter), those involved in affairs are friendly characters exhibiting admirable restraint, guilt and some consideration by the betrayed spouse as opposed to total self-absorption. of this pair. In Ryan's Daughter, her husband shows loyalty and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> This film is a supposedly intellectual, enormously voted, who laments and turns into a great love story. His best picture Oscar does not speak well to the Academy. For those who wonder why people are so harsh with this movie, the answer is simple. It's awful.
