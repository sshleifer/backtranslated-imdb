Sorry for all of you who are not family with the Lynches. <br /> <br /> My sister-in-law asked me how you can only make a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father did not make these movies, they would have to go out and kill people in pieces. <br /> <br /> After every Lnych movie I say to myself, again one and a half lost hour of my life. But next time I'll check the name of the director or the producers. <br /> <br /> So, you do not want to be angry at yourself and waste time, do not watch. But if you think you need to kill someone, notice, this is probably a better medicine than spending your whole life in a mentally insane prison.
