Ok, so I have recently collected many vipco and hardgore titles on DVD and I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing. A more recent film, compared to other titles in Hardgore's catalog, was a direct release for the DVD. I've always been interested in the El Chokeberry myth since I saw a documentary about him as a teenager. However, this movie is a terrible shot on tacky dv the plot and acting are terrible, it took me three will watch this movie all the way. While the cheap horror movies of the 80s and 90s are good because of their budgets and cheap comedies, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> Check out some other titles in the hardgore series, the money is older but much better.
