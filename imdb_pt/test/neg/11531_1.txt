I had a good time in the first 45 min. more or less, but all of a sudden it was all down. The suspense a bit began to get thin and the jokes somehow the same all over. What went on was the good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this movie is that it is trying to be cleverly funny, like Tarantino and God is this old-fashioned thing. Tarantino being a little overrated, sometimes this movie arrives ten years late. At best it's for teenagers, and I'm sure many of them find Johann's character funny, which he is in the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have with this is that the story fades more and more in the end, you tried to find a recovery point. Maybe you have not recovered because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. Moreover, as in many films, of course, good actors who can afford do not seem to require a better dialogue, or simply refuse the script.
