Infamous for being "brought to you by the team of digital effects behind Independence Day," Coronado is yet another spectacular failure just by being juxtaposed with ID4. This ridiculous mess of a movie starts with a premise without a brain and goes completely down from there. A wealthy couple about to get married in Beverly Hills is the subject of this stupid story. Claire's fiancee took off on a business trip around Christmas, so she decides to fly spontaneously to Switzerland so they can spend the holidays together. I particularly love that his initial reason for wanting to go was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need. She grabbed them and yelled after him as he walked away, concluding that his best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet instead of calling the cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in a mansion as cavernous as theirs was unaware of the existence of cell phones. <br /> <br /> So, up to this point, the movie is unbelievably bad, but watch this, THIS is where it starts to get bad! She arrives in Switzerland and, when she can not find her husband, receives a cake and calls her friend to complain about how unfair this is. This woman is not a heroine of action, and she is DEFINITELY not a German Indiana Jones, for crying out loud. She's a grown-up cheerleader, a spoiled brat whose outdoor experience is probably just digging her heels when she gets drunk enough to stroll the lawn during a wine and cheese party on the cliffs. <br /> <br /> She gets a hint that her fiancee is in South America, so she, like, flies there to pick him up. Once there, this idiot thinks she's going to enter the forest by herself, sniff out the enemy base and rescue her poor, helpless boyfriend. She laughs at a comment about the danger of getting in there, then gets scared later because she finds out there are battles going on. "You never said anything about battle!" <br /> <br /> There is a point where Claire and some journalists she met drive this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across. suspended by two of four. Literally. There are thousands of fine pieces of wood tied with string, and these idiots decide to go over it. Not only does she collapse under the weight of the truck, but Claire manages to fall from him, falling hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below. Later, she remembers the event, laughing as, oh maybe it was only a hundred. At least she was not spinning gum on his fingers. <br /> <br /> What is really sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to persuade a terribly out of the tremendously talented John Rhys-Davies, a REAL Indiana Jones veteran. There's a lot of nonsense about a revolt at the end of the movie where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we first meet him, has an accent so thick that he rolls his rs as if he thinks he's in a Ruffles commercial, then he talks like a guy they took off the streets of Venice Beach. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Special effects are insignificant. The team that brought Independence Day, simply because they were involved with ID4, was simply going through the motions, throwing some tangled and blue screens, I have to believe because they simply had nothing better to do. The story is incredibly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, who many other IMDb users cite as the only reason to see the film, does not put the slightest strain on her performance. Maybe she thought that the digital effects team behind Independence Day could override some meaning to this mess. <br /> <br /> And given how far they fell, maybe they thought they could too. <br /> <br /> They could at least have tried.
