You can, please, stop believing everything this man says. Get your facts straight before you start praising this liar. He's not even from Flint. He just says to keep his "blue-collar" look. He is from a wealthy suburb next to Flint. I mean, he went to a private school. <br /> <br /> His parents paid him to go to school. Wow, this sure sounds like they suffered a lot with Flint going to the dumps. He was also born in Canada. Oh wait, that makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he would just move there. Instead, he lives here in his $ 1 million apartment in New York. This is the working class right there. I sure can not wait for his DVD to leave. I want him here talking about how big corporations are bad. Where will I get those dvds? Oh yeah, at Target and at Wal-Mart. The two largest corporations in America, which were also the only two stores allowed to sell them.
