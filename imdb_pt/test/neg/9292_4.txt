You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was seen as a studio failure and filed for a year before the popularity of ALICE FAYE reached such a point that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed.

Instead, it is totally absent and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a full song number of Faye) was never filmed. However, the rest of the story is virtually intact and made it possible to launch the movie in a running time of 71 minutes. <br /> <br /> A tired look WARNER BAXTER is too old to be believable as Faye's romantic interest and is merely superficial as the bankrupt reporter. Audiences today would be offended by depicting Chinese using fractured English phrases like "Me likey make noisy." Key Luke is one of the Chinese legalists, but plays his part discreetly and directly. Arthur Treacher is almost invisible and still receives the fourth billing on the screen due to editing changes in the story. Originally Joseph Schildkraut had a part in the film, but his part ended up being edited. <br /> <br /> A jumble of a movie that will serve as entertainment only for the most fanatic fans of Alice Faye who will receive a prize. chance to see her in a dramatic role - albeit a weak one. Charles Winninger is totally wasted as a gentle man driving the American consulate. Despite all the weaknesses, there are some scenes involving narrow escapades that are effectively played and Karl Freund's B & W photograph is top notch.
