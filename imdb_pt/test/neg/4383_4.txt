When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I started going out all their old movies on video so I can see them through adult eyes. I remember that I really enjoyed this one in particular and thought it was one of his best. Now that I am a little older, I can say that, although it is completely average, I still consider it one of his best films. In an excerpt from acting for him, Norris plays a haunted police officer for his arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. Serial killers are the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly inventive 90's. In contrast, it's good to see where the current passion comes from, most obviously action movies (as well as stalk n 'slasher ) of the 70s and 80s. While Norris tries both humor and any form of human compassion, they can not be ridiculed, no one could kick someone in the head like Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James too, I can recommend this movie, ditto for the genre legend Billy Drago, as well as seeing Mitch from The Blue Brothers in a supporting role. It's not great, but it's better than anything Norris did in the 1990s.
