This final part of the "Airport" franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me a while to realize that it was not really a comedy of clowning, like "Airplane." George Kennedy firing a gun through an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. What would happen to your hand if you held a two-speed window? You would lose control of the weapon and pick up a broken arm. The passengers were, unintentionally, hilarious, just like the interior of the plane. The sophisticated French woman who approached George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy coming to Ernest Borgnine. Will not happen. Susan Blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, got no point in her resume for this. Not even Robert Wagner. This movie was so bad it sounded surreal.
