How in the world does such a thing come into my DVD player at home? How does it get packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero views of a movie (and I use that term loosely) does it have to go through before being put on the shelf of a video store anymore? I'm all for making DIY movies, but come on! That does not give me the right to gather a group of friends and relatives, a low quality camcorder, a horrible story and put it all together to create a pile of junk and call it film. And I wish people would stop using the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these types of movies. They are not either. In no other profession would such a thing be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell your car that was as bad as this movie, you would get it back and say it was a lemon. If it were a surgical procedure, you would be prosecuting the doctor for negligence. I wish I could have my time and money back after watching this. What a shame in the video stores that store movies like these. They are an idiot to the public. Do you want "campy"? Go to any of the movies on Friday the 13th (even the latest ones) or Dead-Alive. At least those do not make you want to kill yourself. It's because of movies like this that make people automatically match the independent to the trash.
