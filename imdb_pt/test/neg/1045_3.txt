The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology about it - much like Star Trek. That's because there are many dedicated program lovers who no matter what they think each episode was a winner. They are the ones that punctuate each individual to 10 and can not objectively evaluate the spectacle. Because of this, a while ago I reviewed all of the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad ones) because the ratings and general reviews were very positive. Now, it's time to do the same for the Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this bland episode that described him as "among the best" and gave him 10 points. If this is the case, then why do everyone I know who saw this episode hate him as much as I do? It's possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks, but it's also possible that this is another case of fanatic fans furiously inflating the rating in an average or below average episode. <br /> <br /> The episode itself is starring William Windom. and others as various archetypes - a soldier, a dancer, etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only in the end do you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not at all shocking and is actually majorly lame. No, this is a badly written and uncommitted episode. Yes, there were many episodes in the series that deserved a 10, but few as unworthy as this due to a superficial script and an unattractive resolution.
