Let me start by saying that I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie for some time. After finally getting a chance to see him last night, I'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed. It's hard to imagine a movie that makes "Exorcist: the beginning" of last year look good, but "Dominion" does just that. Do not wait ... makes it look like a great movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe I got too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the disappointment. After all, the idea that Warner Bros. would release two versions of what is essentially the same film in a six-month break is an exciting attraction. In addition, I'm a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard and, in fact, he makes a great presentation, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. On the other hand, the supporting cast in this movie sucks. Clara Bellar seems to be capable of just one expression - look empty, and delivers all her speeches with the same monotonous tone, while Frances's father Gabrielle Mann is simply ridiculous. The effects in this movie are laughable at best, and the sheer abruptness of it all is enough to steal the film from any chance of being taken seriously. This film provoked more smothered laughter than anything else, and with the exception of a really creepy shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover their eyes and whine, also did not give anything in the department of fright. I could go into more detail and possibly give some spoilers but frankly I'm really tired of thinking about how bad this movie was to write all the things I'd love to say. <br /> <br /> The saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the movie tried to give ... a story about a priest who lost his faith and then recovered after reaching an agreement with his troubled past ... he had enormous potential, especially with Skarsgard as the protagonist. Unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. Go and see this movie only if you are really curious about how it differs from Harlin's version, but do not expect to see a good movie or you will regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. Otherwise, be satisfied with the released version and move on.
