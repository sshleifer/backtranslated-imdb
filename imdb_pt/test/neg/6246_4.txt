Directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series. Just think about it: it's the fourth chapter of a series of slasher that no one really cares about! So how could this be good? Well, it is not! But since when do horror movies have to be good? Cheerleader Massacre is fun, for sure. But in the field of entertainment, we saw better, sure as well! As you can see, I'm not sure where I am in relation to this movie. Those who watch slashers just for nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie is all breasts, but unfortunately no blood, or not enough. I think I'm being generous with this movie because I had fun watching and I really enjoy watching horror movies, even if they are bad. If you want me to be honest, Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best and everyone else is a waste of time, so I guess I have a lot of time to lose !! For more fun, see Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
