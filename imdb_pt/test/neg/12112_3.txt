This movie is bad. I have seen the classified and unclassified versions. They are terrible !! Now, I know it's supposed to be a low-budget, porn-parody of Spider-Man, but Spiderbabe is simply not good at being ill-made. It's not funny! Not funny at all !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie disappointed me. At least the unrated version has a lot of nudity to look forward to. And it's me, because Mundae is not a pretty woman. From the waist down she is fine, but on the way leaves much to be desired. She looks good in that school girl's outfit. Please, if you must watch this spiderbabe, rent it first. Classified or unrated, really makes no difference, both are bad for me !!
