I never slept during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible. <br /> <br /> While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson about abundance. As in the movie, the movie lasted 30 minutes. It would have helped if the film had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow motion. The performance was absolutely terrible, bordering on the poor levels of the student films while everyone struggled to improvise something called script. Did these people get any direction? Were they persuaded to be boring and boring? Or Therory would not surprise me. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the rather uncomfortable makeup involved with the creatures on the other side. Anyway, they all stink. Do not watch this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're insomniac).
