I agree with Jessica, this movie is really bad. I'm surprised anyone took it seriously. The characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. The only merit here is that it's so bad that it's funny. In fact, for me, there is the added benefit of having been filmed in a state park not far from where I live, so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a joke. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is a police officer, and makes a point of teaching a good boy that vigilant justice is not only a bad idea, it is against the law. Imagine how long this lasts ... Most of the characters in the movie in Northern California are dry Dutch cheese dumplings, looking like they've never been in a fight. The plot is totally predictable. This movie is ripe for an MST-3K sneeze. Only CAMP value. I am very forgiving of movies in general, but seeing the old positive reviews I had to talk about. This is a dog. I give a 3 out of 10, and just for laughs.
