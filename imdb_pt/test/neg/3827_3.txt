This turned out all right and looks interesting. However, the attempts to create emotions between the characters are so inept that they really ward off terror and are an insult to serious viewers. The story is based on "I walked with a zombie" is probably much better, although unfortunately I have not seen yet. "Ritual" seems so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in reality it turned out really bad, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong with that. I think there are too inefficient scenes and it is hard to believe, for example, in the lovestory between Alice (who is called Alice Dodgson as the girl who supposedly inspired Lewis Carroll to call her heroine Alice) and the younger brother. Absolutely nothing was built between them and, in the end, they get married. Anyway, that sounds great, and well worth a look - but the movie is so poorly executed. 3/10
