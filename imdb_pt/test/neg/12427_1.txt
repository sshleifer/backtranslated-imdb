I think this is one of those few movies that I want to rate it as low as possible, just to compliment it. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for about 25 years, so I can really tell you a lot about it. It still seems to be very difficult to find on video. But I remember my brother and I stumbled somewhere in the toxic drink of the UHF night channel of the mid-'80s when I was about 10 years old. So, I've never seen the beginning of the movie, but I've seen most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple is sneaking out of a camp and they are paddling to an island to kiss, and then they are attacked by an insane Scotsman in a kilt with an ax! They manage to escape from it, but are attacked by the Loch Ness monster, which in this film is only a head and a neck without a body. The monster's eyes and mouth do not even move, it looks like a pi√±ata. <br /> <br /> I mean, I've literally never seen anything of this magnitude before and it totally amazed me. I had seen some bad movies on TV in the early '80s, but I had never seen anything so utterly inept and so informally built that it seemed like people who did it spent less time and effort on it than we did. I had seen some of the Troma movies and that kind of thing that deliberately tries to be "exaggerated", but that was the real thing and it was my first encounter with a great production of bad movies. This movie was like the last breath of the drive-in era and I smelled it at the right time. In fact, when we were watching, we could not figure out if it was done in the 50s or 70s. It turns out that it was only a few years before I saw it. <br /> <br /> Later, I contacted the Mystery Science Theater and discovered many movies and series in series, but I had seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I've never laughed so much at the Monty Python team, Bill Murray or any comedian. After watching this movie, I always looked for the "good bad" movies and had lots of friends for it. But this movie was and basically impossible to find. I never really figured out who Larry Buchanan was or who he was until the 1990s, when IMDb took off and the internet took off and information began to stream. But this movie still needs to be discovered by many others who can appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. Look for it.
