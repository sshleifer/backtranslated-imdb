OK, this movie was by far worse than the first and the first one sucked! The make-up of the zombies was extremely fake! The acting is very poor! And it really does not follow the first! While watching this I kept thinking wow the first is a masterpiece compared to this. I'd say get on TV, do not waste your money on this! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the list. I started to watch last night and fell asleep, so I watched today and almost fell asleep again! The plot was useless, I mean, I get the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to get the blood of the zombie leader and bring him back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies, but they got where you wanted them all to die. They made many bad guys that really were just annoying. If you ask me this was a bad resident robbery and not a good steal either. The plot could have done if the acting was good and if they really made you feel scared to see what's behind the corner. With these zombies, my grandmother could have entered that building and survived! of a 1-10 I give 2.
