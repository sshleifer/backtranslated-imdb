I watched this movie for the first time in the mid 80's when I was a kid. We could not even understand everything. The dialogue, the acting, everything about it went beyond lame. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples ... imagine these real spoken dramatically, very exaggerated: "Oreegon? You're going to Oreegon" Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon? "<br /> < > "Survivors? No one has ever told us about any survivors! "<br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, my sister and I rented again for her party of 16 years, just so our friends could sit and laugh at how awful it was. I do not think we were able to finish this either!
