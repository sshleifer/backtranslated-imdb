Who the hell had the idea "brilliant" (?) Of releasing Lucille Ball in this movie ??? It should have been Angela Lansbury's baby all the way. At the very least, Lucy should have sung it. <br /> <br /> There is some compensation in the fact that Jerry Herman's soundtrack is well preserved except for "That's how I feel," and we have performances from the original members of the Broadway cast, Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. . <br /> <br /> I suppose Robert Preston had to be given a song, hence the inferior "Loving You". <br /> <br /> Overall, I think in this, the wrong redhead has been escalated.
