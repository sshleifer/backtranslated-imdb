After beginning to watch the reruns of old Columbo films, I thought everyone would get the same vote from me (6). But apparently now I'm beginning to see differences in the movies. It happened in some of the previous episodes, which showed a pretty cool direction, and shows this, but in a negative way. <br /> <br /> The movie was so boring that sometimes I found myself busy on paper instead of watching (it never happened during a Columbus movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to divert the look. The steering looks very pretentious. The scenes with the neighbor "mature" are sloppy. And usually the lines and plot are weaker than the average episode. So the scene in which they debated whether or not to dismiss the trumpeter (who was falsely accused of murder) is pure horror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> However, some applause should be given to the "prelude". In this episode, much focus is given on how the killer tries to secure his alibi and hide evidence etc. I really liked that. But unfortunately, do not focus on how Columbus reveals it all. And the "proof" that ultimately leaves Columbus winning is the most foolish ever. <br /> <br /> Rating: is between 4 and 5
