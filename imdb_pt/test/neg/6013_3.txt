This movie should be called adventures in Cinemascope. It is as if the screenwriter and director followed the sketch on page 3 and decided that it would be a great vehicle for a movie about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is very good here, but the dialogue bears no resemblance to Hemingway. This is a composite version of Hemingway. Hecht, the writer, is a hack. Watch the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. This is great cinema and it was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls, where he is hard as a board and thinks he is in a Westerner. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're a Hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Your best bet is to get the full audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
