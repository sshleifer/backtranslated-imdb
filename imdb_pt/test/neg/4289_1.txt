The only thing that makes this possible is Corey's performance as the whimsical killer on the loose. What remains is a more impossible tale of revenge and matrimonial discord. During the walkie-talkie scenes, I had the feeling that Cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device. Another interesting thing about this is that Alan Hale (the Skipper of "Gilligan's Island") is not yet so fat, and he can still lower his arms below the waist. Also, there is not much to recommend here.
