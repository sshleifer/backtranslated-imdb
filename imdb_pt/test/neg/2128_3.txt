A man (Goffredo Unger) is found floating in the sea between the wreckage of his destroyed boat, near the coast of Florida. A helicopter pulls him in just to reveal that both legs are missing below the knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and his partner Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) are marine biologists of some sort and are conducting sea research on dolphins. While at sea, Hogan hears a strange raucous noise. Intrigued, he and Stella hire Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device to locate and track the source, or something anyway, as this is not particularly clear. Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti as Cinthia Stewart) who works at a rival organization called 'West Ocean International' is brutally murdered when it threatens to expose someone inside the organization. More people are attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is in the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra set out for the sea. Soon, they find evidence that something monstrous and very hostile may be hiding beneath the surface. Along with rival scientist Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the United States Army set out to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister forces working as if someone did not want the genetically modified creature to be exposed at any time. cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr., this is a long way from the classic horror films and splashes of the 70s and early 80s. The screenplay by Gianfranco Clerici, Herv√© Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is slow and will put most of the people to sleep well before the odd 90-minute run time has elapsed. The evil monster is used, large parts of this film are composed of images of boats and helicopters. Big chunks of the first half focus on the not-so-mysterious part of whoever is behind the story. There's really no gore to talk about, a guy with both legs bitten and someone with an arm is about it. The special effects on the monster itself are usually poor and are shown in very fast flashes, disappointing. The cast of no-one's virtual does not help make it any easier to sit down. There really is not much to recommend this movie so do not go. Do not bother, you can do much better.
