I have to say, Krasinski is the only reason I watched this movie. He is good. However, everything else about this movie is so below average that it is not worth the time and effort spent watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of technical / aesthetic issues: selection of photos, framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely bad editing (probably due to total lack of fluency in and between shots) , and general terrible action (except for Krasinski). <br /> <br /> It was very theatrical (in action and presentation) to develop any kind of suspense moment in this movie ... which is surprising, because it's all about a bank robbery, which should be at least one little exciting. <br /> <br /> How is a movie so bad? be done, and then released, and then distributed? <br /> <br /> I remember a thesis project of a film student C, probably not even that good.
