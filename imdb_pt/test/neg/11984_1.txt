Unfortunately, this movie lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie buffs, there is nothing more disappointing than a movie based on an original concept (either paper or game console) that it does not offer. And not only that, it goes well below the mark. Far Cry, the video game released in 2004, created such a cult cult that making a movie from the content should have been easy and many players would have gone to watch the movie. If you are a player who played Far Cry; do not watch this movie. Any other person who has not played the game; it will still look like a directed film directed by the B / B series. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame ... this should have been easy to turn into a blockbuster. The plot of the game was incredible (think Jurassic Park knows Alien) and yet you managed to catch it and mold it into your own awful recreation of an instant classic. Video game companies should be warned - if Uwe Boll knocks, close the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I look forward to seeing you compose yourself in Inglourious Basterds. What were you thinking of doing that? Sigh.
