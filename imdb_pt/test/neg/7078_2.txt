I saw the movie yesterday and stopped in half the time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a film through the eyes of a boss - one of the "bad guys" in most fantasy and medieval movies - is great and offers a lot of possibilities, but ... the film could not get one. I was not feeling for any of the characters, the plot was very predictable (to the point that I followed) and the second time jump in history made me give up. Those who expect a deep insight into the emotional state of a leader in the Middle Ages, a social outcast at the time, may be disappointed.
