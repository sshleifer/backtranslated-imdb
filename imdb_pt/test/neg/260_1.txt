K Murli Mohan Rao made the very best BANDHAN in 1998 This movie is a horrible remake of THE WEDDING SINGER <br /> <br /> Basically, in short, the film consists of: Salman Khan, who in those days used to play the role of A mean-spirited lover who loses his girlfriend and also had his comedic scenes where he has injured himself badly until today he does well, he does everything here as well and also loses his shirt in scenes <br /> <br /> Jackie Shroff - lost, bored and tired, his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra, so in a scene he is shown as a womanizer? <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar - confusing characterization again <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee - boring, overweight and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra - tall, fair and dignified actress but lacking in talent < <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah - says a dial as if it were a poetry <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - Poor man of the two boys was horrible too <br /> <br /> The story is the same and has horrible comedic scenes, a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes, as well as a forced comic strip by Shakti Kapoo. r <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The music is decent <br /> <br /> Salman Khan just goes through the motions, Jackie is bad, Rani is like always, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are not nothing great Inder is horrible
