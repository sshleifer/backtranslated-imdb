I think it's amazing that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this film, giving them these notes (mostly dozens). OK, the movie was good, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues, not comprehensive for non-Poles. Script is primitive, acting (except for Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - horrible. It's a lot of noise for nothing - thankfully it's not included in the top 250. Q. The sequence "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on the way and it's just the same story.
