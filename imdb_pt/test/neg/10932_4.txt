The material is bad ... the script is horrible ... the performance mediocre at best and the music wires what the scene should be communicating like a kick in the head. <br /> <br /> Give one a miss ... even Yancy Butlers is not hot enough even in the semi naked scenes to save this gut. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed at the people who praise Yancy Butler ..... given what I've seen here and the other things I've seen in her, she does not have the depth or presence of being a star ... and her off-screen behavior would tend to indicate that she also knows this. <br /> <br /> The last thing is where was that shot? I do not recognize the external ones.
