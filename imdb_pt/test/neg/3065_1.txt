Evil never seemed so bad. They meant it. <br /> <br /> When a friend of mine took the DVD in a half-bookstore, I did not know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth laughing at, but I did not realize how ridiculous it really would be. <br /> <br /> The first time, I missed part of the dialogue (if you could call it that) because we were all too busy mocking the plot of the movie. It looks like it was written in less than a week, and they had no budget to go back and fix some of the minor glitches. Wait, did I say "minor"? I meant the exact opposite. For example, the main character is credited as "Ken", but several times throughout the film he is referred to as "John". <br /> <br /> If the plot holes are not fun enough for you, take a look at the acting. No one seems very concerned about the zombie attacks in their state, including the main character's mother, who has been missing for days while she sits in front of a fireplace reading a book. <br /> <br /> The restrictions that the budget places on the film are equally hilarious. They may not be allowed to film wherever they are, because during the MOTORCYCLE'S GREAT SCENE, the characters are obeying all traffic rules. The zombies, who had just killed about twenty people, actually stop at a stop sign from a parking lot. I do not even do that, but then again, I'm not a biker zombie. The end of the movie looks like they've run out of money. That ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more ... On second thought, it's over soon. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good time with your friends, look for this movie. It's a great unintentional comedy.
