This movie is about pathetic, spoiled and self-centered winners who think they have something interesting to say, played by pathetic, spoiled, self-centered winners who think they are interesting. Straight from the cocaine-filled gutters of New York's incestuous theatrical scene. <br /> <br /> How many spectators are fooled into making them think this brings some substance, is still a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly yearn for too much of this overrated and overrated "actor guild," or maybe they've never seen a decent movie? <br /> <br /> Get out, put your hands in the dirt and get a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real weapon.
