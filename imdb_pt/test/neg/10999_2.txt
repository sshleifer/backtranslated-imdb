Susan inadvertently stumbles on a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house. The leader of the drug ring, Mongo (who is only a week into retirement), thinking she knows a lot more than this bubbly blonde, really tries to make sure she does not tell anyone anything and so begins one of the most full-bodied movies that I've been through it. <br /> <br /> All the actors in this movie can not really act. Susan is a pretty ineffective heroine for most of the film (she would never escape multiple times if it were not for the fact that apparently everyone in the movie wants to have sex with her) and she has not taken the offensive until the last 20 years. minutes of the movie. When she makes a generic phrase "I've had enough," preach about the sister, that thought went through my mind several times when I was watching it.
