If you are looking for a movie that is fun to watch, simply because you can make jokes about not so great acting, "special" cheesy effects, and typical science fiction storyline ... then this is the movie for you! Not in acting was bad, in fact, some actors were actually quite decent. The special effects were not the greatest (to say the least); the animals looked completely computer-animated. There was an annoying squealing to cover up the curse and there was only one song repeated several times throughout the film. Overall, a good movie if you are looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun. Not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious.
