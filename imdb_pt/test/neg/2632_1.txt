This movie sucked sooooo bad, I could not even watch the ending. Milo's voice was too low and I could not understand what he was saying, as well as a few words from Kendra. Besides, from where he took all these wedding dresses; was very impractical. The film failed to elaborate on Milo's drowning and how that made people ridicule Dr. Jeter and his practice. Overall, I was disappointed that I could not give this film a zero rating because, by rating this movie as one, I felt I was giving it undeserved praise.
