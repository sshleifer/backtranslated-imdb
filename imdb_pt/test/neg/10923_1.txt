First things first, I'm by no means a picky movie observer. I'm not one of those people who gets movies just to sort out the flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, watch to entertain myself. I basically watch any type of movie, no matter how bad someone says it is (sometimes a movie is so terribly made and written that it invokes a kind of pity humor that I get a kick). With all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and just did not know what I was watching. It was very poorly written and extravagant to be an adult movie, and it had too much sex, innuendo and profanity to be a kid movie, in fact, I doubt even kids would enjoy it. The humor (quite generous even calling it) was so pretentious and extravagant that I could not see how someone with a discreet mind might find it funny. The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie mac and ridicule could put their name and time on something so painful. Luda's character was such a cheap ploy for laughter that he fell far short of the goal. The plot did not make any sense, the plot has to be the worst sequence of events ever assembled on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I start discussing specific cases of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is that you have to ask yourself how long these writers spent on their knees to try to do it. <br /> <br />
