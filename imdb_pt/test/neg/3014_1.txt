After having seen this show a few times; I'm completely offended as a woman that there are so many stupid women out there who fall for this shit. I'm a bit more mature than some of the "players" in this show, but I'm still shocked that the entire dating game has been summed up in a gamehow: where goofy boys can score points in their stupid attempts to catch girls. If young people are watching this and using it as a learning manual: Do not do it !!! Save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you're after is a piece of butt. Maybe there are girls with the same mentality, but somehow I do not think so.
