"Stealing Time" actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled "Rennie's Landing". Which explains how director Marc Fusco was able to play this cast of established television / movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. About ten minutes after the movie, you understand why this thing was never released in theaters after the film festival was shot several years ago. <br /> <br /> Its recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects the realization that the growing popularity of certain cast members can be extracted to recoup some of the modest production costs. While not a great addition to someone's resume, the young actors did worse when they were desperately looking for work of any kind. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley, and Charlotte Ayanna make college friends who hold an initial "Big Chill" meeting and compare war stories about the failure of reality to achieve their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes Alec (Facinelli) dreams of an assault on the liquor store and a bank robbery, which are then "cheap and moody" staged in a completely inadequate song. It's the least suspenseful banking job since W.C. Fields was the guard in "The Bank Dick." <br /> <br /> If anyone can point to any time in "Stealing Time," where something "really" happens, I'd like to know about it, because as far as I can tell, nothing happens throughout the movie. Perhaps Fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it's too late. Like "St. Elmo's Fire," the film is filled with every deep thought ever uttered by a young adult who left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I felt that Fusco was going to some sort of professional young Howard Hawks in action "Only Angels Have Wings" motive. Then again, I'm sure I was reading too much in the movie. After all, things really happen Howard Hawks movies. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
