The plot for such a movie is an offer. How can you go wrong with a gay plot and all the colors and music of India - a story like this one is spelled. I watch almost everything, but that was impossible to see. The sad thing is that whites are the most colorful in the movie. Vanessa was a mutiny with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was great for the eyes, but everyone was so annoying. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was so annoying. The saving grace was really background music, which made it acceptable to laugh at the movie, rather than at the movie, or not at all. There are many other best gay movies, ethnic movies, simple movies. I give a lot of low budget movies a pass, but this should not have been done, or should have been done by someone else.
