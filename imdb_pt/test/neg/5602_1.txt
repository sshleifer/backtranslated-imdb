DeCoteau has to be one of the worst "directors" working today in any genre, and has nothing to do with his films usually containing homoeroticism and having guys running around in their boxer briefs. Remember ... anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to suck your blood / soul ... such a deep symbolism here. I just went through The Sisterhood magazine to give him his good jolts, I try to watch all the horror movies I can and this one had Barbara Crampton (I had been sucked into the world of DeCoteau) thanks to Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and several other actresses that I like). <br /> <br /> Lemme say what about the Brotherhood ... As the other reviewer pointed out, the supposed plan involves lesbian vampires on a college campus. But there's never a parade of hot young girls ("actresses" if you want) running around wearing bra, panties and bikinis so annoying. The film has no plot, no nudity, no nudity, and the dialogue is ridiculous and it seems they invented it as they go along. The parts are placed in slow motion and repeated several times to increase the execution time. About ten minutes from this consists of characters walking around campus (oh, the excitement!) That looks more like a hotel resort than any college I've ever been to. And acting is the absolute worst. The only thing these girls do well is to lean forward and bend over to show their bodies. The cast was so devoid of talent that I would be shocked to see any of them having a one-day role in Passions in the future. Same for the guys. Yes DeCoteau squeezed more hot guys in underwear in this one too ... People who should be in some K-Mart leaflet instead of trying to act. Do these people really need to audition or just show up at Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I am willing to give any movie a chance if it is 1.) intelligently written, well directed, original and competently represented (or hellish, even ambitious and stylish). Or 2.) is full of nullity, nudity, variety and / or is unintentionally hilarious. David DeCoteau's films deliver NONE of them and do so in better-than-usual production values ​​for direct-to-video movies. What a waste! So what's the appeal, especially with the advent of soft-hard-core variety pornography that is easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I just can not answer that. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to give a unique twist on the genre. Instead, it produces mind-boggling nonsense without a shred of talent or shining intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, your movies are all but pro-gay. They really make homosexuality seem obscure, secret and sinister. The obviously gay characters in his films are always trying to corrupt, seduce and / or kill innocent and sexually confused clues. There are no shadows here to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and rarely demonstrate to be strong, assertive or confident in who they are. I would understand this plot if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura start making direct horror movies on video, but from a gay director, it just shows that he hardly thinks about those cheese festivals.
