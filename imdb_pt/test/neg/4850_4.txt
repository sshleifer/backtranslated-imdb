Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and an extremely talented and versatile singer. His acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view on the only redemption of this film. She very gently captures the essence of the lone singer with a very serious Helath problem. However, what I dislike tremendously about the film is the shameless placement of products for a well-known French chain of hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to wander for a long time without actually deciding what the film is and what it wants to be. On a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable, but you can also say that it is clearly annoying because of the lack of cohesion. There are some cool scenes in the movie, but you can not help but think that all parties simply do not contribute to anything. It's really a shame Kaas really shines in this movie.
