The first opening scene that lasted for about five minutes showed the potential of becoming an instant classic, with moderation to good acting, good movie, a story that keeps the volume high and a chillingly "you've seen that!" (The scarecrow move). <br /> <br /> After the brief set-up of the story that would reach the present, it was as if someone had written and directed the rest of the movie. The following scene is a basic outline of how the movie goes down like a runaway truck. It seems the rest was videotaped, with "porn actors" bad, the setting was a law firm with virtually nothing on the book shelves or anything in the office. <br /> <br /> I remember watching horror movies for a chance to see some nude "teen" girls, back then there were no Victoria's Secret magazines everywhere, and not seeing things that make horror movies of today. how to act, terror, suspense, intrigue and so on. It took nearly fifty minutes for the first person to die. When that happened, me and my friends were so shocked by the WORST fantasy of a "monster" EVER, we through our popcorn on the TV booing screen.
