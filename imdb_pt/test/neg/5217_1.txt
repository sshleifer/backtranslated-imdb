Plot boring, nefarious rank, some of the worst direction I've ever seen, act empty and horribly clich√©d. The movie ends with one of the main characters waking up from a dream. WHAT'S WITH THAT? Even JR Dallas could not survive that turnaround. <br /> <br /> You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship that develops between a main character and a young girl, who is supposedly paternal, but who seems perverse. You have special effects from the freshman college film school with gaps the size of Kimberly Hole. This is how Corn Sons meets the Passion of Christ imposed on an endless loop of government administration training video - in the end, if you are not thinking about ending it, you do not have brains. <br /> <br /> Do not bother.
