I do not know if I'm wrong or everyone is saying that this movie is good, honestly I just want to do a favor for people who have doubts about seeing, renting or even buying it (not really the trailers and much previews precocious may look like fun in one way or another, but it's not funny, it falls into a series of supposedly-to-laugh scenes that tend to get into very bad jokes, bad acting too bad, tasteless scenes, cheesy effects; <br /> <br /> As a final comment, the film would have been funny because of the basic concept, but believe me it is really far from it.
