I think this is a disappointing sequel. I miss many of the old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.), and I do not like this due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to make the characters. A lot of personality was lost on Charlie, and the Red villain is not nearly as bad as Carface in the first. If you're a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth seeing just to see how the story goes, but do not count on 5 stars in your book.
