I think I won the "bargain" contest for this movie, since I bought it as part of a "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection with 50 movies for $ 20, which means I paid something like 50 cents for chance to watch the movie. "Black Fist" version of a movie that was released as "Bogard". <br /> <br /> For a basic movie of "revenge," "Black Fist" is not so bad, although it is obviously hampered by a low budget. One of my "practical rules" for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and script, the movie automatically gets at least three stars. This is certainly the case here; Lawson has some presence and some charisma, and probably deserved a better career in the cinema than he. <br /> <br /> The choreography of the street fights (the ostensible reason of the film) will not really impress anyone who has ever fought in a martial arts school or who has been punched in a fight in the schoolyard. I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but even then I would never fall in love with the front kicks of "seals", arm drags and round punches here. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and screaming crowds, and the actors put some feeling in the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> Less believable is the plot. Dawson's character, "Leroy Fisk," is portrayed as a clever and cunning young man looking for a pick-up fighter job at illegal and unauthorized street parties. Yet is he surprised and outraged when he has to pay the police? Excuse me, but I was raised in the small town of Iowa and even * I * knew (by watching "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the cops had to be paid for this type of action, and that the guys who fought needed fixers in order to get their games, and that fixers were worth the money. So you have to watch this movie with a kind of intentional suspension of your critical faculties to accept it as a "black brother being repressed" movie. (Most other non-black fighters in the stable get punched in the face by the same deal, too, yes?). <br /> <br /> The film suffers from a short duration of attention. The director obviously did not have the budget to shoot some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill the gaps with some rather ridiculous exposure scenes (the scene "I kissed him, I ate him and then killed him" just does not work ), as well as awkward and unconvincing stories and montages. This is especially true with every angle of novel that seems to have been filmed as if it were a late reflection. This is a bit of poor quality when one considers that the death of the wife of "Fisk" supposedly feeds its desire of revenge. <br /> <br /> But once the movie changes all the way from "young fighter climbing up the ranks" to the theme of revenge, get some steam and play with a little more conviction. I'm not sure if the ultimate reward is worth the buildup - Roger Ebert calls this sort of thing "a long trip for a short day at the beach" ... but that messes things up in a reasonably satisfying way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast, costumes and costumes, and himself as the hero, people would have welcomed as the next "Rocky" who goes to show how circumstance and chance can hinder the filmmakers' possible dreams. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing once for several decent scenes and filming and watching Dabney Coleman embarrass himself in a role that is below him.
