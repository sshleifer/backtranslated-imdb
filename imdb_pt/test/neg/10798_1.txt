which was quickly destroyed by poor acting, cinematography, countless nonsensical scenes and a terrible villain. Well, let's see Joe Estevez is bad (as usual), but he is not the only problem cast, writer Vivian Schilling is not great actress, in fact, well, she sucks. Your script is not so bad, it's just misdirected. In fact, if the direction had been better and if better actors had been chosen, this could have been a really good movie. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, with all these problems, "Soultaker" is not at all Passable as a horror movie, but the pace is also horrible. <br /> <br /> The MST crew had fun with this, but it was definitely not one of their best efforts. 5 for this, nothing for the original.
