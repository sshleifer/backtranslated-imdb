World War I won a brilliant and sepia make-up in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's relentless "A Very Long Engagement." Jeunet's trademark style consists of a mechanical, clock-like narrative construction, decorated with profuse chocolate box production values ​​and seasoned with a naive mood. It's an approach that worked very well with her previous photo, the romantic fantasy "Amelie," thanks largely to Audrey Tatou's inimitable contribution to the title role. Applied to a much darker material, Jeunet's method goes awry. <br /> <br /> Tatou appears again in a variation of the same kind of sweet character as Amelie. She is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with her aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural setting, determined to trace what happened to her daughter, Manech (Gaspard Ulliel), several years after he disappeared in the War. Manech was one of five martial-court soldiers against self-mutilation in 1917 in 'Bingo Crepuscule', and was sent to no man's land as punishment. He is presumed to be dead for all but Mathilde, who hopes to find him. The film follows Mathilde's stubborn journey to find out what really happened and, as she delves deeper, discovers a sad and even shocking story of high-level corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde must filter out the facts of the fictions that emerge from various conflicting, overlapping, or incomplete accounts of what appear to be the last hours of Manech. <br /> All this must be moving and moving, but more often it is simply confusing. to the visual and verbal disorder with which Jeunet attacks his audience. There is simply so much going on at any moment, including an intrusive narration that adds nothing to our appreciation of the story and the characters. Without a moment's relief from the informational overload, I felt deny the space to reflect on Mathilde's quest or room to get involved with her on my own terms. Jeunet's incessantly agitated camera traverses circles and curves, caressing every surface outline of its exquisitely designed production, but uniquely fails to penetrate the soul under the skin of history. The result is deeply unfathomable and, worse, grotesque. World War I was a particularly somber hour in the history of mankind. Imagine that it was recreated as one of those quaint commercials for a well-known Belgian beer, and you have the measure of that movie.
