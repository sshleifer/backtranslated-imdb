PURPLE MOMENT <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) Two unlucky nightclub revelers (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bills, provoking violent retribution from a warm-tempered waiter (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> Typical L & H scenario, less substantial than some of your best work of this period, but worth looking at, however. Stan takes center stage this time, stuck in a financial dilemma after holding part of his salary to fund a night on the town, only to find out - too late! - that his resentful wife (Fay Holderness) replaced his stock with useless coupons. Some of Laurel's prolonged close-ups, as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster, reveal his genius for characterization and mimicry. The morality of 1920 is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, portraying a hatchet-faced body who rejoices in alerting their L & H spouses (Holderness and Lyle Taho) about the misbehavior of their husbands. The ending fails, but the film still has a lot to recommend it. Directed by James Parrott.
