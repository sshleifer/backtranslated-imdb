"Ashes of Time" was a daring project, but it turned out to be a pretentious film. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex way. The plot of "Ashes of Time" is quite simple and it comes down to two words: "love triangle". Because of these "love triangles", crossing stories, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics presented by the characters. The narrative part is seen through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in the desert, where he acts as the intermediary of several swordsmen and becomes the instrument of Destiny through which vengeance is attained. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" fails to tell these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai lost himself driven by the desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. In fact, in addition to the cast of beautiful actors (men and women), everything else is a failure in this film. Dialogues are minimalist and not original. The quality of the image is very uneven, the editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least for me) in the swordplay genre, and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unpleasant. Even the attempt to construct artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so-called erotic scene of "women on horseback" is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a movie is the first on how a storyline is told. Forgetting that he delivers a strange movie that does not even fulfill its artistic purpose.
