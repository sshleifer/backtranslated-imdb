'Be With Me' is almost the best wallpaper film. Just let it run in the background. talk to each other and return to it whenever you want and at some point it will end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while I watched alone, then I felt as if I had almost seen the world's worst beer commercial, the longest and most slippery time by the time I managed to keep my eyes open as the end rolled credits; and I then got (just to) a few more wakeful moments to witness a 'thank you' to the film's sponsors - which included the Asia-Pacific breweries. Aha! Methought: How amazing is * that * - given all the doses of Tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable interval of a movie? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, dialogue fades between individuals with occasional scams in depth, but generally nothing is said or witnessed about any particular breakthrough in the film's overall history. It's as if someone could hang up at any moment and come back at any time and you really did not miss anything, which would have been a must-see contingency, or part of your plot, as far as the overall progression of the film. So the last "wallpaper film"! <br /> <br /> Well, I wonder ... What movie were those who positively reviewed this watching? I wonder and I keep wondering ... It certainly could not have been that artillery to the point of an untitled excuse from Singapore for the filming of a camera. Supposedly, 'Be With Me' must be woven around the themes of 'love, tragedy and redemption'. But all I witnessed was boredom, a half-cooked script with a bunch of bland text messages, and the only redemption was the one that occurred when this totally useless movie ended. What a melancholy loss of time, it turned out to be! It was also said that the characters in this film were fictitious, except for Theresa Chan, who is a "remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities ..." Well, no disrespect to Miss. Chan, but given that she was such a wonderful and amazing character Why did the script have to involve the stories of other characters without the faintest attempt to connect their lives? Still, it proved to be an almost unbearably boring film, whose highlights included the credits. Rather than tying the fates of all the characters, I really felt that the film ended up trying the almost impossible and of course fell between the banks as far as any involvement of the viewer could be concerned. <br /> <br /> I'm usually an art movie fan and usually do not oppose the slow pace (of which there is no shortage here, believe me !!). I hate movies like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but I consider, for example, Eric Rohmer as a great filmmaker. So I hope this puts my criticism in some perspective. However, there was no redeemable feature throughout the film's design and delivery, which could keep the eyelids from falling slowly down as each minute of "Be With Me" passed. Watch this movie if you need to waste time. Otherwise, her life would not be the richer she'd lost. 3/10
