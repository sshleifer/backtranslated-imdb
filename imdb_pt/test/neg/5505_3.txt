Overall, I'm an admirer of Jess Franco's movies, but for some of these films I really have a hard time understanding the motivation behind them or even the reason for their existence. Like this sick chick, for example. "Sadomania" has absolutely no cinematographic value, is poorly done without any kind of plot and features some of the most malicious sleaze scenes ever captured on film. This is another filthy movie of women in prison in which rape, lesbian action and violent torture games are daily routine. Guards are crazier than prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually excited when he sees a girl having sex with a dog! The girls are all very pretty and naked throughout the movie, but you can not really appreciate that view with all the perversion going on. Doubtful highlights include a barbarian hunting game (you can guess what he's stuck in), a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl with a needle injected all over her nipple. Auch! Avoid this unhealthy mess and you will save yourself the trouble of taking two baths to wash away the dirt.
