Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) looking for her missing sister. It turns out that his sister joined a sect that disappeared in the jungles of Borneo. With the veteran of Vietnam, Mark, next to her, she leaves to find his sister. <br /> <br /> As always, the acting is not of the highest quality, but you have the advertisement girl of the movie Cannibal Me Me Lai. the time on the screen with the naked chest, the female protagonist Janet Agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood, among other things. Now that has to count for something! <br /> <br /> But, I must say I find it a bit hard to recommend this title. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably recognize each gore scene in the movie bar in a few. And I mean it literally. Many of the bloody scenes are taken directly from other cannibal films, such as MAN FROM DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There are probably more movies stuck there. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is one of the diehard fans to check your list. If you have not seen any movies from the Italian jungle, it would be best to watch CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and, if you are an avid fan, you have seen most of the bloody scenes in other films.
