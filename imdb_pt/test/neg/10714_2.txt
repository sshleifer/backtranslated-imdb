Maybe it's just because it was done in 1997, or whoever managed to do it with a 7 has a weakness for children with AIDS. But really the people, the maniacal laughter and clutter during the withdrawal scene? Did not you see that coming? I'm surprised there was not a baby crawling on the ceiling and a sick boy heading for the camera. The acting was fine, for sure. But for me this is just an example of a film from an era in which situations and subjects could shift to cinematic language. Things happen, but that's it. There is no glue or reason that can be detected on the screen, allowing the subject to use preexisting emotional connections to furthur the plot, without the script doing it as it should.
