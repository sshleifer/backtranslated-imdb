My dad insisted that I should watch this movie with him and regret that I wasted my time watching - I want the hour and a half back! The little "funny" movie concerns the elderly Don Ameche staying with his son, Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not only "forgotten" as he was told but has dementia (looks a lot like Alzheimer's). And as Dad often goes out for lunch, he gets into trouble again and again - almost like BABY'S DAY OUT's adorable puppy. The problem, however, is that you know that Baby's Day is all fancy and the baby will be fine. Also, you are not laughing at the baby for having a deformity or disease. But in this case you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind - and where is the humor in it? If this movie had been more successful, would the producers have made movies making fun or people with Cerebral Palsy or a Flesh Virus?!?! There are a lot of people who should have been embarrassed about making this movie.
