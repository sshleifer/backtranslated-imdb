This film was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is playing in his bed and his glimpses of a frowning native are signs of poor acting and little imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. Elementary writing leaves no facts to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The doctor says she thinks the city will "explode soon" from all crazy events. There was, in fact, nothing in the film to make this line relevant. From the terrible work that the movie had done, I would never know there was any tension in the village. If you like cheesy movies, go ahead and rent it, but if you want to see it done, check out Exorcist: The Beginning
