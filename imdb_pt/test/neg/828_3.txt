MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS For the last four years I've been a big fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and clever guy and in my opinion his best creation is Borat which is as funny as Hell and completely without shame. in what he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, for the movie. I did not bother paying to see this in the movies; I suppose because I did not expect much, but when I hired the DVD recently, I found the whole thing really sad. The best part of Ali having taken the mickey from the others was largely lost and the script of a plot was very horrible; hooking all car batteries together to blow up a safe - REALLY !! ??? <br /> <br /> This movie shows that some things can run for a long time and definitely do not translate to the big screen. The film also had that sweet ending that I expect from British films. Where have all the good British cinema ideals gone? That said, there were strange and funny moments, like the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM, Q, with the commentary "Shaven haven-RESPECT." <br /> <br /> So in summary, I'm an Ali G and Borat fan and I enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with Anita Roddick's Body Shop), but this movie fell flat with me. If there's another movie, I hope it's a whole lot better than this old man. <br /> <br /> Weasel 100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
