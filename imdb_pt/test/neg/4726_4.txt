This is another notorious Mexican horror film: however, while the original Spanish version is rather meek, all kinds of nudity and nudity were inserted into the variant dubbed in English (prepared by Jerald Intractor - who did similar tasks in THE CURIOUS DR HUMPP [1967/71] - and, as the American version of this film, was already available on DVD through Something Weird / Image)! <br /> <br /> I first noticed the original, and although it did not have major tremors, it was quite engaging - especially with such a familiar plot as this: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in trying to save life. of his terminally ill son; he even has a clumsy, playful assistant (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who had rehearsed a remarkably similar role - albeit in a more sinister way - in THE DEATH OF THE WOMAN WHO CRIES [1961]). I know that several Mexican films mixed horror with the genre "Lucha Libre" (Wrestling), but I had never seen it myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a fighter - but the two styles are, fortunately, kept apart (that being said, the wrestling sequences are done competently, with some of the movements showing up very funny). <br /> <br /> The doctor's son is turned into a monster (looking like The Incredible Hulk with mud splashed on his face!) after having the heart of a monkey transplanted to him - but when this is replaced by a coma in a female wrestler coma, he stays like that and grows a couple of fangs to put on (he should not have turned into a transsexual ... but I do not think it would be very interesting) !! The climactic sequence of the roof on which the monster kidnaps a child and finds his death in the hands of the police is reminiscent of The Phantom of Frankenstein (1942). However, my favorite unintended and funny moments in the movie are when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he will soon be healed - just to turn his back on the edge of tears - and also look impatient. he gives his crippled assistant (when the latter slowly enters the car) when they are about to chase after the monster that escaped from the laboratory. <br /> <br /> Alternate scenes of nudity work for the film (these were actually done by Cardona himself for a more aggressive Mexican version, entitled HORROR Y SEX), but his reputation is largely based on the additional material that shows exaggerated violence, like an eyeball being pulled out of its orbit, a scalping and even a person. head being ripped off. There are also several graphical operation inserts that, however, give rise to a joke: while it is clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask on the patient's face! The film is also a remake of Cardona's black and white horror film DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962), but as I did not watch it, I can not say how much of it was actually stolen by NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES ...
