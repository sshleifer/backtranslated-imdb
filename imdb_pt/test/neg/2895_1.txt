Being the science fiction fan I am, I've always been curious about this movie. So I was excited to see Journey to the Side of the Sun finally be released on an affordable DVD (the previous version was fetching $ 100 on eBay - I'm sure these people would love to have their money back - but more on <br /> <br /> Anyway, the premise of this movie (as well as "The Parallel" of Twilight Zone) is that there is an unknown planet resembling Earth on the "other side of the sun" This planet is, of course, exactly like ours except that it is inverted.This basically means that its letters are inverted and people drive on the wrong side of the road. <br /> <br /> Sound intriguing? The first hour is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet.It's just boring scenes of interruptions being pressed, banal dialogue, etc. There is no sense in this.Gerry Anderson managed to find the British actors more movies to play most of the roles. I mean, they are so annoying that I was surprised that the team managed to stay awake to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, once the crew finally lands on the planet (after an endless sequence of sitting astronauts and literally sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinnes realizes that the copy is all back in a bottle of cologne and jumps back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered. Oops, he never does this when he falls and dies. The end! Oh, wait, there's a bonus scene from one of the space executives throwing himself in a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. I think he wanted to get out of this movie too. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised that such a movie can be made even in the 60s. Rent if you need it. DO NOT BUY.
