MGM attempted to pair and bring the boys closer to the Divine to give them exposure and test them as leaders. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX, but it was a bad movie. Here in INSPIRATION there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the script is also poor. What were they thinking? The modern, fast-talking, wise-cracking-crack Montgomery and the suffering Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. Young student falls in love with the woman of the world and is repelled by learning from her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her ... you get the picture. Garbo is completely credible as the top model of a Parisian artist and completely at home, though bored, with his life at the top of society amidst his artistic friends and his loose morals. Suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. She finally gives up her life for him and plunges into poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a home of her own. Ironically, he intends to marry her and keep her on the side - both for his pure moral ethics of before. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly tedious and boring and nothing happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu is able to inject life into the process with lines like "Unfortunately weak women have strong appetites" and "Odette, where's your sting?" <br /> <br /> Just for Garbo fans.
