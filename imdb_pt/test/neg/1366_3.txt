This is one of those religious horror movies that never explains why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than "good" forces. Here we have a satanic cult that can: 1) "alienate" people (as in "Star Trek"), 2) kill small children's dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body to another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a distance larger, and 5) cause drastic car accidents in which selected people turn into spaghetti while others (children in this case) survive unharmed. On the other hand, the forces of "good" can: 1) sit impotently, 2) stay around without notion, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time without doing nothing, 6) read comics while people are slaughtered at dozens, and 7) come late to satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror film, I must assume that the world of this film is inhabited by God and Satan. I also have to assume that Satan can not be 1,000,000 times more powerful unless the movie has a world order resembling that of Hell. In other words, where were the priests in this movie who knew something? The best thing the priest in this movie could do is guess that there are some witches about - nothing more - to read all the books in their study. At first glance of violence, this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, only to end in a major panic attack. So, is this God's contribution to fighting Satan? Ridiculous. Every good religious horror movie has the powers of "good" equipped with some form of (more or less) supernatural power, or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight "evil." In that sense, this movie is pretty dumb. How is the cast of Martin droll to play the high priest (!) Of the cult. There is very little threat or admiration in seeing the peculiar Martin leading a satanic ritual. I mean, it does not have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but could not they have found someone less funny? Also, why do the couple return to town after the car is withdrawn from the race? After the "friendly" meeting with the people of the city, no sensible person would have returned; They should have just walked. The man's explanation for his girlfriend (and for the viewer) is that "who knows what's in that direction."
