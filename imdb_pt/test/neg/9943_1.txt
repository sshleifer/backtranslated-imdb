I watched hundreds of kung fu movies and heard something good about this movie, so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst movie making I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not help but feel that the director wants to have every muscular face in Hong Kong in this movie. Everyone gets beyond the point of stupidity. Even Conan, the barbarian, had some civility. This movie has half-evolved men screaming in all the scenes and stupid women who do not have self-respect. The character of the narrator should have died for having sucked so much ... she really did not deserve to live to the end. The whole movie was a melodramatic mess, with horrible acting, bad direction and bad acting. They should have just renamed this movie to 'The Stupid Caveman with a Blade' Here's a question ... why do some directors use quick cuts to some action movies? Answer: To hide the shortcomings of the actors. all the scenes were closed and quickly cut off without any kind of flow The movie tried so much show intensity, but it became almost laughable Please stay away from that movie, you have some kind of taste in kung fu movies or any taste in movies.
