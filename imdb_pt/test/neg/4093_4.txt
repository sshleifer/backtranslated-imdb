This was a doomed movie since its inception. The very idea that it was stupid - to have a minor character from a PG-13 medium, and to make a complete non-sequel while shifting his tone to a PG-rated family movie. I was not at all interested. Then came the trailer. Not only confirmed that the film would be bland and generic, but also managed to give the movie WHOLE; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute version of Cliff's Notes from the movie. So obviously I would not pay to see it, but once it got to the DVD, I thought, I'll watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save him. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> I'm still confused as to why he signed for it. He must have someone a favor. The jokes were all so simple and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to adopt a very broad comedy style like Bruce Almighty's Jim Carrey. But that's not funny. The studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-Year-Old Virgin, complete with several of Carell's past co-stars, a reference to the movie in a theater marquee and another string of musical closing credits. But even the talented Carrell can not save it. Your colleagues do not do much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms simply wasted. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, she's just a waste on anything she does, and her horrible traits and reactions just make you wish people stop giving their work. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just predictable and lazy. She beats her head with obvious harangues, such as Evan's scorn for the environment (drives a gas-guzzling Humvee, chooses to use timber from endangered trees for his home, hates animals, ...), and in the end, preach about faith and the environment. <br /> <br /> Why the film was made is intriguing enough, but I really do not understand how it has become the most expensive comedy of all time. The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and their integration into the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious blue-green screen jobs I've ever seen. Maybe renting live animals on the set cost a fortune. Who knows. But what cost so much, did not translate into quality, for sure. But, hey, it was not the worst movie of the year. There are still many worse failures like Norbit and Death Proof.
