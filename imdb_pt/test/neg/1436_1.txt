Sometimes I wonder if today's horror films rely on human torture to make people scared. If so, then there is a sad future for horror movies. Dee Snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified, this movie does just that, but not in a good way. Now there are a few moments in the movie where there is a chance that Snyder is saving this movie from falling into a hole, but let's face it, this movie did not fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Synder makes no attempt to get out of there. When you finish watching this movie, you get sick, depressed, dirty, and insane. I get the feeling that was the intent of this movie. What is smaller than dirt?
