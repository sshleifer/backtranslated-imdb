This was obviously a low budget film. It shows in every scene. What is good to see is where it was made. Much of the film was filmed in Columbia, CA, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, near Sonora, CA. Part of the movie was also filmed in Jamestown, California, very close to Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the photo. "High Noon" was also filmed in Jamestown, as well as "Back to the Future III."
