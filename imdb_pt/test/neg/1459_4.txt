It's hard to decide what to say about it. It's not totally, one hundred percent bad. Although the movie-in-a-movie is indescribably bad, it should be exaggerated, but missing a mile. I'm sure this is intentional, though. Danny Aiello is perfectly fit here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was good in a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as her latest twenty-something girlfriend. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she did very well. <br /> <br /> So it's not totally bad, but I do not think that's one of your goals. In short, it pays to pass on.
