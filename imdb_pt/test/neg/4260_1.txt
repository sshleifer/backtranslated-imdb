this is by far the most pathetic Indian movie film or any movie theater that has come about. It's totally crap. The story line does not contain water. It's a shame that such a respectful actor has relegated himself to making such a shameful film. the little respect he has is lost forever. he should have retired a long time ago, instead of playing the fool and losing all self-respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. In addition, I would suggest that Amitabh should retire already. I wonder how the IMDb gave some recommendations for this movie. there are no such horrible movies that any recommendation can be made. watching movies like Devdas on the same line as this movie does a grave injustice to a decent movie. your total I could say without shame.
