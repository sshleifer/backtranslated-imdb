Try not to see this. I thought it was going to be good because I'm 80's movie fan and I really enjoyed the work of Linnea Quigley. I was wrong. I should have said "no" and watched Gigli instead, which is probably a much better movie. I think my biggest problem with this movie was his attempt at humor. Nothing about it was funny or even close to funny. The acting is bad, even for the queen of the 80's films. There is no story, just random clips. I guess I should not hate him so much, because it was made just like a fun and silly piece, but I did not enjoy myself and did not enjoy myself once. I even had to move to the end to get through all the crap. I'm sorry, but I do not think zombies doing funny aerobics.
