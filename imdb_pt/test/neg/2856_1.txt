.... You get that stupid excuse of a child-play theft! Dude, what were they thinking? First they mess with a Rumpelstiltskin horror movie, so they do crap like that. Haters of Fariy Tale! Well, to be honest, I saw it as a child, and it scared me a bit, simply because I was under-age with the assumption that Pinocchio would not do that, wah wah wah. But I grew up and came to think of it as Child's Play rip, a fairy tale tale and a lame episode from Tales From The Crypt, or trying to be one, at least with a lame ending that was stupid, and had many holes in it. plot, and I still can not understand how this came to life. Was it the work of an evil Geppetto? So, what, after some evil deeds, does he become a real boy who becomes the most sought after in the United States? Personally, I think the concept of an evil Geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wood assassins and starts a wave of crime, funny. But this is horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, terrible! HORRIBLE! Stinking like a shoe and horrible! He sucked it sucked! If you want murderous puppets, settle for the killer puppet, specifically child's play, instead without strings attached. Or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down, see Leprechaun, or if you want Pinocchio, watch the animated version of Disnet or live version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
