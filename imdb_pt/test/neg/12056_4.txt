Yes, of course, this is a Friday the 13th, but I have no problem with that. It's a good effort, the murders are not so bloody, but a girl's acting carries the movie, that screaming queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are well done, okay, sometimes you can imagine how this is done. Some people have problems with using the camera, I can not see what's wrong with this. It's so strange that so many people do not like this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course the script is not original, but it gives me one that is, I mean, so many slashers are made in the forest. maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've seen a lot more, I can say that
