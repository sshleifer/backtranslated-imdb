This film comes along with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired in the form of their prints on DVD. First, both films are very dark - occasionally making it difficult to see exactly what is happening. Secondly, no movie has subtitles and you are forced to watch a movie nicknamed - although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better dub. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for non-purists, this is not a problem. These DVD problems, however, are not the original filmmakers' fault - only the indifferent package being marketed four decades later. <br /> <br /> As for the film, this is the assassination of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR problem, since Van Johnson looks just like Garfield and Judy Garland. No way he looks like Garfield. He's beardless, has the wrong color and style of hair and is not even close at all (trust me, I'm an American History teacher and we get paid to know that sort of thing!). Real life Garfield was a Civil War general and it looked like the Smith Brothers guys cough up boxes of medicine. In addition, using another actor to provide Johnson's voice in the dubbing is simply surreal. Never before or since Van Johnson sounded so macho !! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a convincing general or a macho president. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupid cast, President Garfield's death was by no means similar to this movie. It is obvious that the filmmakers are actually profiting from the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning JFK's death, not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington, DC (not Dallas) by a solitary shooter with serious mental problems - not a group of men with rifles. However, according to most experts, what actually killed Garfield (more than two months later) were incompetent doctors - they probed and probed and investigated to recover a bullet (unsuccessfully) and never bothered to wipe their hands or in the process. In other words, like George Washington (who was basically killed by repeated bleeding when he was suffering from pneumonia), he died from neglect. In the movie, they got nothing right ... plus President Garfield was shot. <br /> <br /> Because the movie almost bears no resemblance to the real story, it's like a history lesson taught by someone from another planet. or someone with a severe brain injury. Why not also include ninjas, combat robots and Greek gods while you're at it?!?! In addition to some decent acting and production values, because the script is such a mess, I would not recommend anyone to watch it. It's just a complete and complete mess.
