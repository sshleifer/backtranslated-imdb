But at least that movie got what it deserved - to be sent to the Satellite of Love to be ridiculed by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester in "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of those long lost films that are so bad that you could have nightmares or depression later in life. Even if the film is not so old, it's still a very forgotten kind of movie. If it had never been for the clever minds of "Mystery Science Theater 3000," the film would not only seem like it was never made, but the movie would not be very enjoyable for us moviegoers. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. On Satellite of Love: This movie is great!
