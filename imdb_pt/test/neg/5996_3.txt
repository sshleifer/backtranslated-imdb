The first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst of modern British cinema. Director / Adapter William Cartlidge treated the original of Wilde with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a movie audience. Luckily the quality of the steering and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but until then the damage was done. Of the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy clean the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on the screen. The other exceptions are Jonathan Firth's Artur and Karen Hayley's Mabel who have the freedom to deliver their lines with the true comic sense that Wilde intended. The ostensible leaders, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are comparing without shine and wood. In an obvious attempt to spend every penny on a meager budget, the play was nominally updated to the 1990s, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is yet another ill-intentioned TV script from the 1970s. few and far between, but when they arrive they are a lot of fun - a sign, perhaps, that more careful pruning of the rest of the piece could have led to a better, more balanced film.
