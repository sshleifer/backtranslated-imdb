very predictable for spoilers, but I will not be cautious below, so do not read if you care. <br /> <br /> some writers numb together for half an afternoon, and even then they run out of ideas. so let's start with a wanted criminal throughout France ... no matter what he's done, let's think about it later (they will not). a few seconds of suspense, but not much, and nothing unexpected, because it requires Art. half an hour needed to finish the movie; I understand: have them steal a jeweler and take a long time avoiding alarms etc .; everyone steals jewelers in movies just that, is bound to work (does not work). without humor, without character (okay, yves montand even bugs a little) and make everyone speak with a subtle and impassive voice that supposedly makes you think of noir, but only makes the actors seem depressed. if they remain silent, it will make them look more somber - but it will also save us from writing their lines. we'd better add something to stay at home for the women who are going to watch these things, so we'll have something to make them empathic with the husband (we forgot to put any woman in the movie). I understood: a marijuana son (oh!) - oh, and he tries suicide for no particular reason (shame? His father is a mafia boss for crying aloud, but the public will feel his paternal care, and if not,) . oh, the corrupt cop was a classmate of the guy who got him at the end; painful, right? Let's all die in the end, or we'll never end these things. it's in the can Okay, done with that, thank god. Who will be the director?
