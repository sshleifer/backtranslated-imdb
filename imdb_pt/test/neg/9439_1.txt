This movie was totally awful. Stupid and horrible assumption acting for everyone. Who wrote this garbage should be hanged. Reminds me of a student hacker movie, BAD. Anyone who has produced this should give up now. I know that opinions are subjective and all, and some may think that this "fantastic" as some think "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real movies. OK, the acting was bearable, and with a better direction it could have been a lot better, but that was not what happened. I do not know how much more I can say about this wasted film, in addition to totally destroy it. Either way it was horrible and I recommend avoiding it like the plague, if you come anywhere near "dreamland", rent the movie next to it instead.
