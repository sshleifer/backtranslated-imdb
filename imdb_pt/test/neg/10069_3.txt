<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (The Plate), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (a Leoni (Family Guy) > <br /> A better title would be: ESCAPE THE ISLAND OF REALLY MINIMAL DINOSAURS, but nobody would need to see the film. In this sequence, a group of rags makes a visit to the island of the dinosaurs to rescue the film. hang gliding <br/> <br/> ACHIEVING HOLLYWOOD reports that JP3 has begun filming without a full screenplay, which explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate the workmanship.of course, there are some clever scenes and some moderately funny parts, but no significant line to unite them.The dinosaur puppets and animation in JP3 are very good at excellent, and more numerous than ever before.film experience can not hold a candle to the JURASSIC PARK original or even JP2. <br /> <br /> JP3 is a mercifully curt the 90 minutes - the last 10 minutes of what is cred is. Even so, I often found myself checking my watch. The audience I saw left the theater in silence. <br /> <br /> A better bet: see the movie LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> Dave
