Compared to the recent movie HOSTEL, this movie reminded me a lot - I would say that See No Evil is a little better, but not much. The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clear a decaying hotel for a shorter jail sentence. Children are soon killed by a religious psychopath who is cleansing their sins (I think). The only thing I feared most before I saw this was the fact that he was facing a WWE fighter, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had two lines of a word in the movie. There are a couple of pretty bloody moments, mostly involving the vision and a memorable scene where a girl has a cell phone in her throat - probably the most effective end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that this movie really shows us something new and definitely is far from great. I can not recommend it.
