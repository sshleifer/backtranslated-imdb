I was encouraged to watch this movie because I heard it well: it was to be this exciting crime scene, disturbing, shocking ... all that jazz. Well, I'm annoyed because I spent money on it and am shocked that something so horrible has been released. That's about it. <br /> <br /> This is a supposed "new look" of Charles Manson's family of losers and their murders. But if this is a "new look," then it is probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just seeing this gave me a headache and I had to give up trying to make some sense or even understand what The director intended it to be. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should say something about the plot, but the fact is that it was so stupid and incoherent that I barely remember if there was even a plot. Was there anything about a "Manson tape" delivered to a radio DJ (or a TV producer?), Then an hour of useless random "family" scenes in 69, then Polanski's murders (looking like a bad play at school ). and finally some stupid part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and bumping into each other in an alley (I'm not kidding), and then it's over (thank goodness) (do not ask me to make any sense of it, I'm just reminding you that I saw!) The presentations were also terrible. And how hard is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Take a thin, skinny face, put on a dirty wig and a scraggly beard on it. There's your Manson. But this "Manson" does not even look right. He looks like a guy in a cheap wig and glued to Santa's beard painted black. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's about it: Manson's family made no sense, so this movie does not make any sense either. It's symbolic! (Yes, right) I'm still so angry at spending money on this that I stopped my normal lurking on this site and I just registered to vote 1 for this movie and post this notice that hopefully will prevent others from spending their money on this junk. Stay away from this, nor is it worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent US TV production "Helter Skelter" received negative reviews, but I saw it last month (I saw the 1976 original too) and let me tell you, compared to "Manson Family", that the new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FALSE. And I was disappointed with that! That's how bad "Manson Family" is: it makes an imperfect and disappointing TV movie seem perfect.
