Bone Eater is situated in a small Alabama desert town where real estate developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is funding the construction of a huge resort. Late one night three of his employees Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) are digging foundations in the desert when they discover what appears to be a hatchet ax, unfortunately for them an old Native American demon called a diner of bone comes together and kills them. Local sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) soon has Krantz breathing down his neck while building his resort stops, Sheriff Evans also has to deal with the bone eater demon while kills anyone he comes across ... <br />> <br /> You know that I consider myself a big fan of the horror genre and science fiction, I certainly do not think my opinion is worth more than anyone else's (unlike many here in IMDb ...) but by Please Believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst 'creature resource' on the Sci-Fi Channel I've ever seen and that faces tough competition. As a fan of horror and science fiction, there are two names that when involved in a movie, bring shivers down the spine, in anticipation of how bad it will end, these names are from Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco who had nothing to do with Bone Eater & Jim Wynorski, who directed the absolute disaster that is the Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad that Wynorski hid under the pseudonym of Bob Robertson, when a director as bad as Wynorski hides under a pseudonym, you know the movie must be bad. Where do I really start? Bone Eater is simply the worst movie I've seen this year and it's so bad it's not true, the story is horrible, the script is sloppy (at one point Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him at the hospital but when they meet there after he acts surprised and says "what are you doing here?" at one point sheriff Evans states triumphant that we are in the twentieth century and that the old Native American demons are absurd, although we are in the 21st century now, there is a part when a woman flashback tells the story in which three men wake up the Bone Eater and kill them, but since she killed all three, how did anyone else know that to be passed on in the legend? Sometimes it gets more than a little embarrassing. The characters are horrible cliches, the sheriff of the little town who saves the day, his daughter gets involved, which adds some personal motivation, and as for the Native Americans there is an old wise man, a hot young girl who hates "white man" and a young man who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud and Black Hawk. The movie is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is horrible, it's full of holes and lapses in any kind of logic, the set-pieces are terrible, there is no terror or gore or suspense or mystery and Bone Eater is just the kind of movie that makes you lose your will to live. The Bone Eater has some of the worst CGI computer effects I've ever seen in a while, from the very own moving bone eater creature that looked like it's just a selection of bones magically attached to a motorcycle who leaps a great crack into a horrible CGI truck that falls on the edge of a cliff, to a van being thrown to the side by the bone eater. Whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed, it causes a big horse to form from the sand and dust and ride it! In principle, this is a really cool idea, but it looks awful and the scenes still have cheese cowboy music on the soundtrack! There's a nonsensical scene at the end, when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) And bleeds, but otherwise there's not a single drop of blood on the thing, whenever the bone eater kills someone who usually vanishes a cloud of dust, boring. The hilarious climatic clash between Sheriff Evans and the Bone Eater has to be seen to be believed, Sheriff Evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his horse out of dust and they have a kind of fair contest that is just for evil to describe correctly. <br /> <br /> With a supposed budget of about $ 700,000 Bone Eater is filmed in a very bland, forgettable and flat, there is no sense of style here at all. Most of the movie happens in the sunlight and if you watch on a decent television, then the desert landscape is very nice at the time. There are several 'known' veteran actors actually playing here, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the Horror Snakehead of 'Creature Feature' (2004), William Katt will obviously put his name on any crap as long as he is paid while ex-Star Trek man Walter Koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is really a heinous 'Creature Feature', there's really not much else you can say about it other than staying well away from it. The worst movie that ever appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel and is saying something, is not it?
