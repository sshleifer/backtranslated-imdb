When I first saw Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was a piece of crap. No one is so rich and lives in a dormitory off the Pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a rich and popular mega girl that everyone always goes to her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect in everything, including her perfect figure. And she's a dietary aberration, she talks about carbohydrates, how she knows what they are. When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate, she confiscates. And another thing that bothers me is that she's always chewing a piece of mint every time you look at her. And everyone wants to do something with it, for example, in one episode that Logan's guy tosses $ 4,000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is an overly gay freak who screams a lot. And Lola dresses like a hoochie lady Houdini. 80s called they want there thick hair back. It can also shave the hair chase. This show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they do not have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes, they will hate themselves. <br /> <br /> This show is a big mistake. <br /> <br /> We hate you Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Congratulations Ryan and Kara L
