<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K, and a member of MFT3K), I must say I've seen my share of them. But wow! Even the worst I saw, at least, had a soundtrack. As George Lazenby roams Hong Kong, making who knows what, you can guarantee that you will not be distracted by any background music that fills today's cinema. Or any music that fills lifts. I do not think anyone in this movie even hums. <br /> <br /> Now, this is not entirely true - there is * is * a soundtrack. If you listen carefully, you will hear a song a half dozen times over the course of the movie. Of course the weather will be totally inappropriate, and it will not last long, but something that could be classified as "music" occurs. Your best bet however is to sit your child armed with a wooden spoon in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and flow would be better than anything the movie offers. Keep an eye on Sammo Hung as a little villain in this movie. Are not we all happy that he found Jackie Chan to work?
