As with most moviegoers in this movie, I am an avid reader of books. The first two films have Buck, Ray and Chloe as main characters, but in this second sequence they play the second violin of the presidential effort of Louis Gossett JR. World at War is based on his encounter with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this movie is as horrible as the first two. Amanda appears out of nowhere and suddenly has a significant role to play (I will not reveal if someone has not read the series). Another illogical feature of parts. I really want Cloud 10 to make a good Left Behind movie, but unfortunately this is similar in all bad ways to the first two.
