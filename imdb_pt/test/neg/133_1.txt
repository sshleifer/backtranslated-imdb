Today, writers, directors and producers are relying increasingly on the "surprise" end. The old art of shutting down a movie, taking all the information we learned throughout the film and bringing it to a good full ending, was lost. Now what we have is a movie that, no matter how complex, detailed or frivolous, can be completed in 5 minutes. It was all in your head. This explanation is the director's safety net. If all else fails, or if the writing is not good, or if we run out of money to complete the film, we can always say "it was all in your mind" and end the movie that way. The public will buy it because, well, none of us are psychologists, and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know it), so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies did it. But these movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap finale. Every director / writer now thinks he can do it because, well, Fight Club did it and made a lot of money. So we have movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity, and this movie (just to name a few).
