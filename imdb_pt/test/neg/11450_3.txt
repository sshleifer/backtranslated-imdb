I must have been in a good mood to give this embarrassing, predictable and embarrassing movie even a 3. What's wrong with that? Let's start with free sex, though I admit that the rotting style of fucking was something I had not seen before (nor experienced). And I think they also saved a few bucks showing the same sex scene three times. Then there are the inconsistencies. The "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in a green part of any city it should be. However, in the scenes on the roof, it seems to be in an industrial area with a steel plant expelling smoke and flames. In addition, the interior of the building - the writing room - the stairs - look much larger than the exterior. SPOILERS HERE Then, when our intrepid reporter is finally fired, she returns to the building several times, once after work. Hardly likely. The end is also woefully predictable ... the classic bait and capoeira exchange in which the good guy ends up being the bad guy. But my main objection is the fact that this is another film funded with Canadian and Ontario tax credits, which is ashamed to settle in Canada, again proving that the Canadian film industry is cowardly and opportunistic. A country's films must do more than just provide jobs. They should reflect the culture. It's bad enough that American studios use Toronto as a stop for New York. But it is embarrassing and infuriating when Canadian producers (in this case, CanWest Global) do so with the help of the federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
