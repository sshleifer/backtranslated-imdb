If you are not an 80's fan, and need to be a particularly strong fan, or one of the two protagonists, there is nothing about this movie to recommend. <br /> <br /> The story, as others have said, is dull, almost a belated reflection on the basic notion of the characters and the idea of ​​making a somewhat manic comedy. I watched it for about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a twist would occur or somehow kick it in gear, but no ... It's not unwatchable, it's just boring. That happens. It goes with bits of running madly, long shots of feet at odd angles, pieces of screams madly, but I did not have a real sense of energy or manic amusement, it just seemed forced. Needless to say too, there was nothing to laugh at particularly. A little light fun here or there, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the mention of feminism, by the way, all that means in this case is that almost all the main cast is female. If anything, it's actually cloying ... Two women lead, good, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, the landlord is a landlord, okay, your friends are female, okay, the only one another person we see in particular the same building, oh, woman ... I was not looking for that, but after a while it seemed like a conscious decision had been made for the film to be released that way and I felt, again , a bit forced and nauseating. On the plus side, if you are a fan of the fashion and culture of the 80s, there is a lot to see and if you are a fan of Helen Slater, she is fun and enjoyable to watch. There's also some screen time for Carol Kane, which is great but not enough ... <br /> <br /> General: 3/10. If you're a big fan of the 80s, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, maybe you can stretch it to a 5 because of them, although there's still the fact that it's a comedy that is not funny, which substantially hinders it. If you are not a fan of these things, you may well do this because there is not much else to enjoy here.
