I was really looking forward to this movie. The ads looked very cool and action packed. And I heard that Claire Daines' character was arrested for assault, so I thought maybe she was going to kick a lot of ass and that would be cool. MORE NOOOOOOOO !! His almost no action was and the character was kind of bland. The only saving grace was Omar Epps and he did not help much in this movie.
