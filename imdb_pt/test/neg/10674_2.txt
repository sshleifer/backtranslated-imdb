Well, some people might go see this to see a rubbery bisexual vampire and pvc butt kick dress. If this is what you want, and you wear a cover, file your teeth and think the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a great movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, a Killer dressed in shiny, creaky rubber with HUGE cleavage, thick make-up and bad teeth makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll ever see. I laughed so hard I almost cried. Ridiculous acting, dialogue and conspiracy help make this a better parody than Dracula, Dead and Loving It could be ... <br /> <br /> He tries to be cool and gothic, and all he can do is make each a hilarious scene. Even the naughty lesbian scene is funny (how * did she get the boots off so fast? They were tied * here * ...) I do not see if you like good movies. See if you like terrible movies and you want to laugh until you fall ... It's not good, it's bad.
