Lucille Ball's version of "Mame", in my opinion, is one of the worst performances ever recorded for the movies. After seeing Lucy on her sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, however, this movie is an incredibly bad casting, music and dance fiasco. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a small enough piece to lose if you blink. I do not know what she was thinking, and I can not imagine how she was advised by the studio or director, but I really shrank by watching this embarrassing performance. I could be very ruthless and suggest you laugh, but it's too unfortunate to qualify for it. Do not waste your money or your time.
