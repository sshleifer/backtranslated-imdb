My brain was screaming "why do you keep watching! Turn it off and go to bed!" But the power of the sofa won, and I watched until the foreseeable end. I think when it's Bruce Campbell I need to take a chance. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget ... and again we see low budget films proving that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce started such a movie, but they did not seem to learn from Sam that it took more than putting a movie in the movies to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's sad too because Bruce has always been the favorite. After the '70s and' 80s, I can not believe such bad movies are still being made. Bruce, I'm very disappointed.
