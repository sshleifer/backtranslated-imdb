In Sweet Water, ambitious entrepreneur Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is building a resort in the middle of the desert under Katonahs protest. When three workers find some Indian relics and bones in a ditch in the place, they accidentally release the giant skeleton as a creature known as Dinosaur of Bones and their bones are devoured by the monster. The mongrel sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is in charge of investigating the disappearance of the workers, being pressured by Krantz to arrest the demonstrators. But Bone Eater attacks and kills other locations, while Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) searches for an old Tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature. "Bone Eater" is a lame, silly movie with one of the most ridiculous script I've ever seen. The characters and situation are not well developed and things happen without further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worst part of this movie, with typical white American Bruce Boxleitner dressed as an Indian (in history, his grandfather was an Indian), cutting off his own wrist (why? And where's the blood after?) and clumsily throwing the ax into the chest of the Bone Eater, destroying the monster and my last hope of any improvement in history. My last question: If the Death Eater eats bones, what happens to the flesh and clothing of its victims? My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Bone Eater" ("The Bone Eater")
