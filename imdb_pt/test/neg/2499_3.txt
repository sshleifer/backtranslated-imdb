D'Amato's hardcore / horror hybrid does not match its extraordinary title and intriguing premise, where several contemporary types are attacked by a monster in an Atoll used earlier in nuclear experiments, but for the most part the film is so slow, so action dark and the cast so clearly repelled by having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a difficult task to watch. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the movie creates a promising idea. . A group of scientists is taken to the Atoll by a naval officer on a small ship. The scientists ?? three women and two men? are an intriguing cross-section of sexual types, suffering varying degrees of nymphomania, co-dependency, and frigidity; There is even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism where one of the women stops at a brothel to be taken care of by two handsome Caribbean stallions for rent. The very creature? a disfigured native Islander with a terribly marked face and an invariable wheeze ?? It has some affinities with the old Black Lagoon Creature and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that hovered over postmodern man since the beginning of the Cold War, though we in the West have retreated into hedonism and relativistic science. The Porno Holocaust is certainly a film that shows the post-sexual revolution of Westerners stumbling upon its mirror image in a nuclear monster, but the clumsiness with which it unfolds actually diminishes the intensity of the idea. There is a promising interaction of action scenes with POV photos, which suggest that the monster (which appears to be a horror monster from its POV position tend to do) is similar to the voyeur in the audience who amuses the sex between the " pretty people." The sight of the monster forcing a beautiful young woman to suck on her oversized limb certainly puts the ugly fantasies of the target audience in the face. But D'Amato developed similar ideas better in other films, and Porno Holocaust is a potentially fierce idea disappointed with execution (even D'Amato's usual cinematic skills disappointed him with sad camera work).
