In New York, one morning near Christmas, a father and a high-class mother go in their BMW to a private school to see their daughter's play. Then they go shopping and then return to their fancy apartment in Manhattan. At night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare medicine for distribution. On Christmas Eve, when buying the Christmas present for his daughter, the father is kidnapped and his wife tries desperately to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom. "R Xmas" is a deceitful film by Abel Ferrara. The main characters do not have names, they are anonymous and perhaps its intention is to say that in the bosom of a neighboring family in its building there can be drug dealers; or that traffickers can also have families and be loving people; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than criminals; or is it a simple apology for crime? Whatever! However, this humanization of criminals is a horrible message, and I really did not like that movie. In Brazil, for example, many traffickers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the state in poor areas and favelas, but this procedure does not make them models of citizens. In this film, we see a loving upper-class family during the day, providing drugs as a way of life, but the destruction of members of other families is not shown in history, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any character. In the end, I wished all of them were dead. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ghetto Gangs" ("Ghetto Gangs")
