When writing this review, I find it difficult to think about what to write. Nothing much happens in this movie. The plot is a woman from South Asia who falls in love with an English Londoner. The problem is that he and his friends had a racist bent. At the same time, her friend at work, unknowingly, is having sex with her brother, and that only increases from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. Once all this has happened, it's all very normal. It drags on a bit, though it is only 90 minutes long. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're a man, I would not recommend this movie to you.
