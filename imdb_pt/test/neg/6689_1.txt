This was terrible, malicious and full of the worst cliches and racial stereotypes I saw in a distant time. Seeing Hayden P trying to act "ghetto" was painful (hi, one leg in the pants and some braids do not make you "down with your hands"). Solange Knowles makes a face all through the movie. Most of the set sequences seem to have been filmed in cardboard boxes ... what happened to the final ??? And poor Rihanna was simply exploited to make people see her "act," which she can not. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie does not deserve even a star. Please, put this tired franchise to rest. Or at least do the next Bring It On IV: Cheerleaders vs. Freddy & Jason.
