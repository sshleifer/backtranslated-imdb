Whether or not this Marvel comic book adaptation was made? and filed ?? so your producer could keep the characters' copyrights, that does not change the fact that it's total crap. Dr. Doom's (and especially) Thing's outfits are surprisingly good, but everyone else suffers from a shortage of money or talent. Director Oley Sassone can not even point a camera to things without including such a POV as a blind woman, the dialogue is absolutely disheartening, the team costumes do not fit properly and the effects are scary: the Human Torch appears to be drawn in the film with felt tip pens, while Mr. Fantastic's powers are brought to life by using a flexible blue stick with a glove at the end. Joseph Culp compensates for having to wear a mask waving his arms, Jay Underwood is incredibly annoying, the rest of the cast hit several levels of terrible, and while it's hard not to feel sorry for all those guys who thought this movie would get a release, it's equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was really good.
