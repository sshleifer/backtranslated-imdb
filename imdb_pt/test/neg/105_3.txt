The Forgotten (AKA: Do not Look in the Basement) is a very cheap and very old horror film. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and never reaches anything worthwhile. Asylum patients are embarrassingly funny, especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Look out when she gets close to the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now the blood is very poor, with blood looking pink in many scenes, so it really does not deserve its place in the list of nasties videos!. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you're not looking for a terrific horror movie and have some time to spare, then it's worth watching.
