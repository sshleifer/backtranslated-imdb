I rented this pile of sewage garbage waiting for some good laughs. With a title like 'Zombie Bikers from Detroit' and with the Dead Alive productions on the cover, you would think this could be a funny / horrible movie, but no. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I watched all the Police Academy movies). The story (this is a joke inside) and the dialogue is atrocious. The make-up of so-called zombies looks like they used one of those two 'Make yourself zombie' kits that you buy at K-Mart. <br /> <br /> I'd rather watch Beverly Hills 90210 while listening to the Backstreet Boys and is whipped by a novelty birthday card model of 400 pounds than to sit through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a DVD. Honestly, I could make a better movie with $ 3, some ice cream sticks and a slinky one. I feel as if 90 minutes of my life had been ripped from me and taken to the land of Suckdom. I know that marking in Dead Alive's production does not guarantee a great movie, but you expect to get the value of your money. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made me happy (saving, returning the horrible mass of elephant feces) was that it was not titled "Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh". I feel for Detroit people who wasted their hard earned money on this one. Unless you have been lobotomized ?? Do not buy, rent if you need to ?? But ?? " You'll regret it.
