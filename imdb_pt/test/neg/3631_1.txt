I watched this show for the first time waiting for a few laughs, good acting and good plot. Unfortunately, I do not have any of those things. <br /> <br /> First, this show is completely unrealistic. How can one go to a boarding school that is super modern, with great location and almost no rules? Another sushi bar. A SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what about the huge, ultra cool and ultra modern dorms? This does not happen in boarding schools! Everyone on this show seems to be perfect. Zoey, looks perfect, has perfect friends, never has to do homework and is super popular. Sounds more like a villain to me! I hate how they use so many clicks on this show, Example: Dana, the skater girl. She is completely ignorant and wears "nerve" clothing. The jokes are old, sooo old, too! I would not watch this show if it were you, it's one of the most horrible shows I've ever watched and I hope it gets canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
