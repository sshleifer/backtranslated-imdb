Probably not the same version as most other reviewers because there is no real hard sex. What do people mean by hard core sex? The kind of explicit hard sex seen in movies starring Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Well, anyway, this is a really bad movie, I doubt I've ever seen so many famous actors squandered on film. The script is very poor and without script, the direction and the cinematography are horrible and the edition is nonexistent. It's truly an absolutely horrible movie. You can watch this ten times and still do not understand what the heck this is. The only memorable scene is one in which people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawn mower appears and decapitates them. Yes, you read right, a movie set in the time of the Romans has a scene with a giant lawn mower cutting the head! <br /> <br /> Point of Trivia. Many years ago a pirate copy of THE THING (1982 version) was making the rent rounds on my island and was copied onto a rental tape of CALIGULA, meaning that the pirate version of THE THING begins with the first few seconds of CALIGULA's man and woman walking through the forest, then the title sequence of THE THING begins. This led people who saw the pirate tape to believe that the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 film and were very confused about what that meant. Well, that's what you get for renting pirated videos. But having seen the whole CALIGULA I do not know what it meant
