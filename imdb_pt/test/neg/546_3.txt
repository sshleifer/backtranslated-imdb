The 1935 version of "Enchanted April" can be both tedious and superficial. It is difficult to show the transforming magic of Italy, filming in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior. The transformation of the four foreigners fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. Instead of developing, the script becomes a switch and the characters are different. <br /> <br /> Husbands are annoying enough in flashbacks without appearing, even if their presence does not direct four women back into their shells and / or hostilities. <br /> <br /> Jessie Ralph has the most fun (moving instead of completely chewing the scenery <br /> <br />) and Katharine Alexander has a poignant charm out of her husband's shadow (and far of his hideous buzz). Ann Harding is unmistakable here (with the Production Code being applied). She had an appropriate line in a pre-code film, "When Ladies Meet": "You're not worth a minute of an anxious time that any of us gave you," but in "Enchanted April" can only look hurt, run off and proclaim allegiance to her wandering husband.
