The most horrible cast I've ever seen. Clark Kent as a crack head, a very feminine woman looking like a trans and so on ............. <br /> <br /> Stupid stupid violence just for the sake of being violent No content, no meaning. This person has never been on the streets. It's a joke! <br /> <br /> The stupidest thing about this movie is the fact that it's over. I just kept thinking it could not get any worse, but it was to the end. <br /> <br /> Trying too hard to be a movie off the hook. Trying to be weird. So stupid! I really do not have anything else to say, but I can not leave a comment unless I write more. <br /> <br /> Please take this advice and DO NOT BE OBSERVING THIS MOVIE !!!!! HORRIBLE!!!
