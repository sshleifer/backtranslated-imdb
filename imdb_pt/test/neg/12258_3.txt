This seems to be two movies spliced ​​into one. At first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. She wants to help Marjorie Woodworth's romantic life. OK: I had never heard of her before either. But she and Pitts are in both parts of that mix. <br /> <br /> Before we know, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. This is Emmie. I had to go back to see if I had fallen asleep somewhere. I had not. She is no longer in a small town, but on the way to the title Honeymoon destination. <br /> <br /> The movie has some cute moments. The first part is better, with roles for what appears to be every third-rate character working in Hollywood at the time. <br /> <br /> What about Mrs. Woolworth? She looks a bit like Betty Hutton. She looks a bit like Marie Wilson. She is beautiful, surely. But she's not a comedian. <br /> <br /> Pitts used to be used in very small roles. Here she has the biggest part. She's always entertaining, although this movie has made me wonder if a little of her does not go very far. (As a comic.) When she was a tragic actress in Von Stroheim Silents - "The March Wedding" and Greed "are the two I saw - she was brilliant.)
