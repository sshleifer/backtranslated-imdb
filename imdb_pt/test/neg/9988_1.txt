I am currently working hard with Gibbon's 'Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire', so I had all the Roman things in my mind. I'm not far from that yet, maybe two hundred more pages, but it's amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I have read 15 emperors so far and only Antonius, Trajan and Hadrian were not killed or at least suspected of having been killed. I was also fascinated by the crazy excesses of many of these princes of Rome. No less the practitioner of these was Caligula. This leads me to review this movie. I'm thinking of the movie on a historical basis as far as I understand from Gibbon's explanation of Rome as well as other surveys of some good sites and some fictional romance novels with the period. <br /> <br /> My point is that I do not think this movie is what it is thought to be by many of its proponents. I do not think the depravity shown with the horrendous sex and violence of this movie qualifies it as accurate. The general ideas of the film seem accurate. Caligula is raised on an island, exiled with his family and afraid of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius. He grows paranoid and afraid and can never shake the nickname given to him by his guards, this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless. He is delivered into the empire after Tiberius dies, the Senate waiting for him to move away from the squads of informants who have brought the death at the whim of the exiled deliriously paranoid tyrant, and take Rome away from the madness in which the dictator established it. Caligula begins as a decent one if he is emperor, but gets sick, almost dies and returns from the edge of the feverish death, a true monster. Your perversities with your sisters begin here, if not before. He has Macro dead and many others who were his originally supporters. The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thought of himself as a living God. He saw talking to the statue of Jupiter as a condemned equal. His violent mad excesses would have condemned him anyway, and three years seems to have been a fairly decent race for Tiberius's successors. Well, the film basically sticks to these lines as it manages to be coherent, which is not common through its entirety, as it tries to shock the audience every time, in every scene the movie begs you to be disgusted with depravity. of ancient Rome. Shocking scenes are what this movie is built entirely and where it fails completely. It is too much to see successive rulers having men after men murdered, raped, tortured for no reason but fantasy. The depictions of violence are possibly, but probably not, accurate. Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome, torture beforehand was routine. But the director's views of these deaths and the bored fun of their protagonists, while viewers watch with indifference, I just do not see this happening just like that. The death machine, the beheaded, is certainly something like you've never seen in the movies, and something you once saw you will probably never forget, even if I do, you wish you could. The wine drinking while the penis is tied is the same, once you have seen this shame is yours forever. These things impress me with the fantasies of the director and the pornographer. They arose from their unhealthy imagination and not from any proven record. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. I really think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to behold, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. The portraits of Nerva and Tiberius are very well made by their respected actors. The film could have made a much better story, it's a failure like that, it's just another layer of shame. For example, he might have given an opinion on how and why Caligula went mad, or showed that he was crazy, paranoid before his illness, and that the fever then broke the mental restraint he had previously. He could have shown Claudius's weakness and the miracle that he survived Caligula. You may have these and many other things, but you are stuck with sad nightmares. <br /> <br /> Finally, about sex. It's pornography. It shows these sexual acts being done in all palaces by many people. Male in male, female in female, male in female. It's a sex without passion and disgusting. Sex that if your goal is to leave, I seriously doubt that you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been addicted to sex, and orgies may have been quite common, but the visions in this film seem to resemble a Greek time more than a Roman. I do not think this kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies in public was common until the strange and depraved reign of Elgabalus, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> This movie will probably never be noticed, if you are curious about it, let it go. It is something, as I said earlier, if you observe this, you will unfortunately keep your sick visions in the eye of your mind for many years. I do not think it is a precise historical image in particular, even if it is historical in the whole.
