* SPOILERS! * When I first saw the preview, it looked like a good old-fashioned movie. I love bluegrass music so I could not wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read the verse and it got even better. The film was very annoying for the first half, every once in a while a song would be played. So (I'm ashamed to write this) a lesbian love seen entered. I that there was something more than friendship between the teachers, but I certainly did not expect nudity and prolonged sitting. I was watching this with my mother and I was quite embarrassed because I chose this movie. But in addition, it was a cool movie. The performance was good, the actress who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I do not mind seeing the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after I saw the movie. And there are continuation disks that follow. If I were you, I would skip the movie and get the song.
