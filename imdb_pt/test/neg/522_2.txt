Ok, I just had to sound about it ... Like a tremendous mental tiredness, I just went through this movie in its entirety. <br /> <br /> You'll notice that the trivia section of The IMDB points out that parts of the 747's lift were "borrowed" from 1977 Airport. It does not really scratch the surface ... Virtually all of the plane's exterior planes crawling in the ocean, landing, sinking and even in - Support shots are borrowed from the airport '77. All of the "raise" shots were taken from 1977, including most of the interior flood clips except the drowning of Dennis Weaver. I could not help wondering if Olivia Dehavilland could come floating at any moment, or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roll: Dennis Weaver's name in this movie is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that the 77th airport plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (led by Jimmie Stewart, of course). <br /> <br /> It's a real turnaround of actors who do not work much, or at least have not worked for some time, which may have been the first clue that it would be a real disaster. <br /> <br /> I've already rated this movie as 2 - It's worth a "1", but if this movie can not offer any other redeeming quality, at least someone helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver to make your car payments that month!
