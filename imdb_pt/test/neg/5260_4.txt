Drugged Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover cop. During the bust at Colton's factory, Moses accidentally hits Keats on the head. He survives the wound and then arrest Moses. Dodging the Colton assassins, the pair must overcome their mutual hatred for survival. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler's films are often a hit, with their comedies being loved by their fans or hated by everyone. This is not as stupid as his other films, but still can not overcome a lazy script. The direction is unbelievably uneven, with accelerated action sequences giving way to slow comic exchanges between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes? flying an airplane without engines, a car chase at night through a forest? are absurdly invented. Performance is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans pairing well. In short, the film is stupid but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Note: C + Review by M. K. Geist
