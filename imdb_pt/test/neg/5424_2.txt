There really is not much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically, there are some episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. It is extremely dated, however. Vena's Winky treatment is a good example of this. One must remember that it was prepared to be shown to children in the 50's. In this regard, it is successful. If you like science fiction kids from the 1950s, go ahead and take a look at it. You'll see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Role of Schultz. He does a good job at it. All in all, I'd give it a 6 out of 10. Not good, but not bad.
