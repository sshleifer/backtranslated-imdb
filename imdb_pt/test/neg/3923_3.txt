They say that there are some people who actually watch the ADMIRE monogram movies. Well, why not? Monogram Studios lived in a kind of Cost Plus base; cost, more than enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of muscatel robust from time to time. Of course, they are cheap. But let's face it: they are rude, fast, philistine, vulgar, but stimulating. They have no pretensions. They are designed to divert the audience for about an hour at the end of a double bill. What if John Wayne galloped through the wild west along a road lined with telephone poles? This is not art, it is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, "Flight to Mars". In the beginning, when we first meet the characters, a man can present his female companion abruptly, avoiding any tedious subtlety: "Professor, this is my fiancée and assistant, who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman. but she's getting impatient with me because I'm always involved in my scientific work, maybe you can rob her of me, marry her, give her the babies and the house surrounded by pickets she longs for. she likes it a bit rough. " It saves a lot of time for recording and recording, does not it? That's what people mean when they say a narrative is "quick." (This was filmed in five days.) Why should we suggest such things? I mean, what the hell is this, an inexpensive science fiction movie or Henry James? In fact, this is a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram film. It's in color, on the one hand. "Cinecolor" to be exact. (You can say it's not any other "color" you'd recognize.) And look at the cast. The female leadership is disposable, as is common with Monogram, but the male leaders are definitely on the B list. Cameron Mitchell as the reporter, still about to take a step as a male protagonist, who, on second thought, he never got to think. And Arthur Franz, the pipe-smoking chief scientist, the pride of Perth Amboy in New Jersey. And - for science fiction fans - how about this pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There is not much sense in describing the plot in detail. The five crew members fall on Mars, where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours, down to five digits and slender babies in short skirts. And they learned English by listening to our broadcasts. American broadcasts, that is, judging by his speech. They are led by a sinister cabal who attempts to hijack the spacecraft, build many imitations of it, and colonize the earth. They can not. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special. The men walk around a pair of spare sets, wearing black suits with stylized rays emblazoned on their breasts and scarlet covers curling behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. The lisoman Martian who falls in love with Arthur Franz is called Alita, with a diminutive Indo-European appendix, and she already knows what it is to kiss. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I found it as grumpy as it should be, but bland too. The story is that of any 1930 series by Buck Rogers. Once the Terrans and the Martians meet and it is established that they have a common language, and that the Martians have a sinister agenda, that's it. In two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn it into a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is made by the numbers, the dialogue has no brightness, the performance is pedestrian. <br /> <br /> However, devoted fans of the monogram productions should take advantage of it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the opposite French leader, dedicated "A Bout de Soufflé" to Monogram, so they can not have been so bad.
