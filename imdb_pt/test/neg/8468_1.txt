It's complete nonsense. I studied Nazism and read many manuscripts of the day - the "parallels" use most of the classic apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare it with complete and illusory generalizations about what constitutes 1/3 of the planet. It is crafted for an audience of Polly-Anna complacency that feeds heavily on meaningless things, terribly thought-provoking, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and absurd logic. <br /> <br /> Who made this peace come? Easy. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done; What Bonus? That is, who benefits in the long run? <br /> <br /> You do not. You sacrifice money and rights. The Muslims do not, they get our bombs. Try again. Answer this and you unlock a main door.
