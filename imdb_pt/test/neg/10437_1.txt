Have you read a book, then watched the movie and wondered - how did they ruin everything so badly? This is one of those. Huffaker's book, "Nobody Likes a Drunk Indian" was great, fun-filled ... this movie is not. It seems like no one cared enough to change direction, so we care about the characters. This movie, which touches on some real concerns about the Indians, makes you wonder why we did not see more comedies about the holocaust or slavery. It is not well done.
