"Return of the Seven" has some good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is as exciting as before. However, it is a boring film because it simply does not involve us emotionally. Mcqueen's absence causes a very bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by a different (little-known) actor is odd - in a bad way. Characters are not developed, so we do not connect with them - and we barely mind when some of them die. This sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.
