This movie is sad. According to my fellow IMDb users, (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR uses footage from the Carnotaur films. Well, since I have not seen the Carnotaur movies, I can not say. But I notice a very bad edit and even worse performance. This movie is a great steaming pile of s ***. It makes absolutely no sense. Here's something called PLOT: Mad scientist recreates kidnappers. Raptors kill people. Sheriff investigates. * SPOILER * (although I do not know what it is that I'm messing with) Sheriff notices the crazy doctor's plans. The guys in the army are sent and the kidnappers start killing army guys. Raptors. Okay, right. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. FX is the cheapest ever used in a movie. There is so much gore. Gore cheap. Does not even look real. I'll agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has for it is the fact that it ends. There are about two seconds of originality in this movie. And that only comes when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something. This idea was used in about 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. Overall, I'll give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it's over.
