Once again, we're getting a mix of themes well covered by so many previous films. The story of the good and the bad son, courtesy of East of Eden. The story of the American marine hero, who does not consider himself one due to what he knows. And the bereaved wife potentially falling in love with another man's story. <br /> <br /> The mere fact that these stories are ubiquitous is not a big problem. Because, theoretically, they could still be better presented and treated every time. There is no luck this time, since all three topics end up falling anyway. <br /> <br /> Because the bad child never gets to talk to their father, then the conflict is never resolved properly. In addition to the father sort of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to this last one reforming the kitchen of the bereaved wife. Now, how satisfying that is. <br /> <br /> Then the surprisingly startlingly facing the sea, suspecting that your wife's infidelity conflict will never be solved. Because he never speaks to the man under suspicion, namely, his own brother. So, once again, we have a loose end here. <br /> <br /> And finally, the theme of the hypocrisy of American military heroism, in which the Marine is publicly considered a hero when, owing to the filth of war, he passed, he should not be called one as to his own standards, this third theme falls in the same way. Because the movie ends when, for the first time, he is able to talk to his wife about what he went through. Where the real story would really begin at that very moment, namely his recovery process, how that would be and how he would finally face the family he would have a big fault to admit. All this, all really interesting parts are ignored and ignored. <br /> <br /> So while the story is wise, this movie is serious, and I mean serious, disappointment, I would still give points to the impressive cast. Although no movie should use the Maguire for a voice, because it belongs to Spider-Man. Especially an adult, Gyllenhaal seems to meet all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. So much so that I would really love to see him in charge of a really deep and demanding major role of proper profile. <br /> <br /> So while the cast really seems to do what it can, I consider this movie to totally forget otherwise. A shallow and, finally, pretentious, totally unsatisfactory. Message of the day to the writers: We already know the wounds, we see the series of films of Vietnam. You want to earn some credit, show us a believable cure.
