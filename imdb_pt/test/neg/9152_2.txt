Based on a rather bland bestseller, this movie - like most other Lifetime movies - has presented itself more like a re-enactment than a real movie. The only difference here was that Meredith Baxter was not in it. Women do not grow old for 20 years, and acting in general is very poor. <br /> <br /> The characters were all clich√©d and one-dimensional. The story was tacky nature. I would not recommend this, but it's the kind of thing that people who love the book and the people who watch this network all the time will think is great. I just watched because my girlfriend wanted to see him so she did not have to read the book that her sister lent her. It was not made for someone like me - my girlfriend cried a little at the end, so she did not think it was as terrible as I was.
