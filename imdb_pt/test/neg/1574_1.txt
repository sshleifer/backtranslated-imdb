this attempt at "suspense" would have no substance at all! Some may claim that this movie "has it all?" Autism, criminal arson, robbery, lost love, a bag of money, throats, murder, blood, a snub nosegun, clenched teeth, breasts (various definitions can be used), big lanterns, tribal people, a brother trying to portray " donkeys and donkeys, "white wolves, fighting scenes reminiscent of" gay tapas, "snow mobile phones, a large vehicle, and a motel under renovation? All of this, with a melody "Enyan√©sque" towards the end ... <br /> <br /> Maybe my rating will be a bit harsh, but one preview will surely suffice for the movie soundtrack with nothing else to do. <br /> <br /> Yeowza!
