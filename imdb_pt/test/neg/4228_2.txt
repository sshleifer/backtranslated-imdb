This French film is supposed to be about a scary and stupid cop who investigates the rape and murder of a girl in a small town. However, the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. If a character takes ten minutes to go from Point A to Point B, the movie spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. There are also static shots that last for minutes, making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The movie lasts seven hours or more. You do the math. The actors were apparently amateur and it shows. Note to you: Never again see a Dumont movie again.
