It was the first action movie to be banned in the action style of the USSR in Hollywood. It's not even close to the Hollywood action movies of the day. The plot is childish, the direction is more or less. This film was successful because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Even though I have attended many times I have to admit that it was kind of naive and I did not like it. This is not the best example of Russian action movie. This is just the first experience.
