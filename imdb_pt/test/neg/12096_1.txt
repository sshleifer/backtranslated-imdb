This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen over 300 movies in my life. The atrocious performance, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of female cast members. After watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer does not operate heavy machinery or drive for a period of at least 24 hours. Also a bottle of Valium would be recommended so you do not feel so badly for the wasted 100 minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, the dialogue excruciating and even the weapons seem insignificant. Do yourself a favor and go to the local Blockbuster and burn the copies they have of this horrible movie.
