I sat down last night to see this movie being played on Greek television because of the upcoming Olympics organized by my city. Knowing that it is an American movie, I expected him to concentrate more on the history of American athletes. ready for it. But what I saw was ... too much, I mean, when a movie has that title ("First Olympics: Athens 1896"), even though it is of American origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandistic and at the same time ignorant in relation to the athletes and efforts of other countries. American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, cleverness, generosity, gentleness, politeness ...) in contrast to their "non-athletes" in the world. Games, which seem unable to ... speak their thoughts or express feelings. The number of times the American anthem is played during the film should be an all-time record in filmography. Megalomania at its best! He still uses fictionalized facts that ridicules the Greek nation, such as Greek citizens who serve foreign marathons with wine, in order to help nationals win the race. Much for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it. and putting a bad mark on a movie whose title is also Greek is something that does not make me happy. ut according to what I saw, I can not give more than 4 out of 10 (being quite generous actually).
