Return to Frogtown was a difficult movie to track. Well, I fulfilled that mission and she stayed on the shelf for a long time. Wish was kept that way! First, Sam Hell is not, of course, Roddy Piper. He is replaced by a guy with a big face, less charisma, and that poor actor is too soft for the part! Sam Hell must be rebellious and wonderful. Here he is captured THREE times! What kind of hero is this?! Spangle is also replaced by another actress. Why do not we get different characters here? That was stupid! Lou Ferrigno stars in this movie and he is not even the hero. Common sense says Lou be the hero of the movie! Bad effects, bad acting and just a forgettable movie. Funny how they take pictures in Ninja Turtles 2 with the whole scene of the show in this movie. At least Ninja Turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! I really wanted to like Return to Frogtown, but I cringed when the fight scenes began. This movie makes the Turtles 3 look like gold! Avoid this or you'll be the only one singing "more mean, greener, talking about turtle TV dinner!"
