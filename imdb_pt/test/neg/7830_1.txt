Asia Argento has never made a movie (as far as I know, and this includes those directed by her own father, Dario) where she can not show off her entire anatomy at some point. Certainly, in the most boring opening dialogue scene of all time, poor Madsen is entering her office and right there, reminding us that even with her hair up she can still stick her fingers into her groin at any moment ( what she does, but randomly "what, am I really seeing this?" The DVD box, packaging, makes it look like a femme fatale movie, so you keep hoping to see it turn into an elegant killer and minimalist ... without that luck.It is verbose, unplugged from a bit of aging and, worse yet, has no credible ability in physical agility beyond (surprise!) Take ALL the clothes when any scene allows. an accent would be nice if she did not try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12-year-old. "" How about this plot? "A weak-minded, but simultaneously nymphomaniac, woman is suddenly driven to kill, while she already has another case in motion and are doing some cheap deal with drugs ... huh? what? Is anyone motivated in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster? The script seems to be driven by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over again (I was hoping to see the worst acting of this appear as a producer who dumped money on it just to have some time on the screen) - there is nothing going forward the faults obvious from the character of Asia that at any point in the film offers what the DVD cover promises. She's weak ... but she knows how to kill. it flows a lot. She shakes bare, she shakes half dressed, she even moves in the clothing of a dead woman .. she is very sloppy and unmotivated. In fact, "Floppy" would have been a great name for this movie .. and a photo of Asia fainting, looking annoyed on the cover, would have been a better representation ... in fact, there are pictures of her eating food by plane !!! What is this about? <br /> <br /> The ending makes sense 0 - everyone is just annoyingly bland in their intention and their execution of all goals. Lester's wife does not deliver any REAL revenge (getting someone to a bad karoeke is a threat to life, but it's not really valid) ... and Lester simply floats without actually making much proclamation of anything. Key Art Totally Misleading ... yes, we know that Asia has lost the fat of its eldest, but in fact, an entire movie trying to pretend it's interesting enough to direct a movie about a passive-aggressive girl is not worth it.
