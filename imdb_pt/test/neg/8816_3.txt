The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script errors that only an uncritical viewer will avoid. The main question is what is the killer's goal in his lie in the middle of the floor? The film attempts to show that the killer's goal is to cause evil and destruction to his victims, he loves to play with the lives of others and feel control over his fears and weaknesses. So why does he pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous improbability: can a man pretend to be dead for more than an hour or two without moving a single muscle or even breathing without being discovered by two men in the same room? It makes no sense except to be the final effect (d) of the film. The killer seems to always have control over the plot, and if he's lying down like a corpse, that's not possible. Finally, it does not work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker, untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the nurse), but not the white room floor. The director should not have shown the face of the killer and perhaps the place where he is hidden. So the movie would be a good thriller. However, 'Saw' is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please come back.
