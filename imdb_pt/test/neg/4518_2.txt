Why is this piece of film so critical? <br /> <br /> This is amateurish, bland and irritating. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is the title song corny. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are low and the ideas of "comedy" (if you want to call them that) are weak, they look like leftovers from the SNL that even they would not have the courage to put in their pocket . screen. <br /> <br /> I'm beginning to mistrust the IMDb ratings altogether. <br /> <br /> This is light years away from the Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same galaxy. <br /> <br /> Nor can you write 10 lines about it. <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something you can not see much on TV and Cinema today.
