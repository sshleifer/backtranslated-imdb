Post 1988 after the disaster GJS Amitabh's movies lost the quality they had before Barret MAIN AZAAD HOON released in 1989 which was a great movie. All the movies were mostly craps, except HUM (1991) at the end of 1991. <br /> <br /> This is another of the shitty Amitabh movies that people rejected in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> The film he made as a symbol of friendship for Shashi Kapoor who directed the film and that he did not get a dime The movie also had Rishi and Dimple (again not paired to each other after RANBHOOMI) <br /> <br /> The film came in 1991 when Bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops between them INDRAJEET, AKAYLA, AJOOBA <br /> <Ajooba came 2 years after TOOFAN and JAADUGAR both supernatural films that were rejected This is another kind of crap Bachchan uses one mask and a kind of clothes of Krissh and performs magic changing 1 person to a burro.etc Of course being in 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the movie is too bad to be watched Shashi's direction Kapoor is not good Musi c is bad <br /> <br /> Among the actors Amitabh t Inha became too old in 1991 and looked tired, his acting is good but not on par with his best Rishi is right Dimple is fine, the rest is forgettable
