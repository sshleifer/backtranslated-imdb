Seagal has apparently lowered his (already low) standards even further and has now outgrown himself in making bad movies. The foreigner has no substance in the script. It's director did an even worse job and the music and score is so cheeky and misplaced that you just do not know if you should laugh or cry. Already 10 minutes into the movie, you just want to turn it off. However, considering Steven Seagal's past films, you think, 'Hey there may be some cool action sequences worth watching ...' ... you're WRONG! It only worsens as the movie progresses. Everyone (with a few exceptions) seems to kill all the people they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. The only good thing about the movie is that it has an end and that it has a fairly short execution time. Summarizing the film in two words: STAY AWAY!
