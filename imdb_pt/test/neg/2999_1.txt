I'm usually the only one who criticizes the twenty-odd Neanderthals for not being able to enjoy a movie unless they have plastic traps, shootings, and car chases. However, in this case, the film may actually have been improved with some of these additions. At least I would not have been bored after an hour and changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I do not mind surreal, and I certainly do not mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning, but there must be some point to the whole thing. I did not have the impression that even the writer or the director actually had a broad vision of anything, but instead they were so engrossed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately dispersed. Or maybe they just got confused. Anyway, I do not care. He bored me for little more than an hour without any saving grace. <br /> <br /> Although a whole bundle of other viewers have filled this site with enthusiastic comments about the supposed symbolism and masterful cinematography, I must respectfully disagree. Maybe I have not gone through enough movie lessons to appreciate some inspired techniques that are not visible to mere mortals ... Or maybe this movie sucked. <br /> <br /> I give a "1" and the file next to "Ishtar".
