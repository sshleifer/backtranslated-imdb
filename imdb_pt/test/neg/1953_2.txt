Hello, it's me Derrick Cannon and I welcome the first Cannonite review show. My film for this week was debatable, which way I film, what excellent four-star epic I choose, I think that I decided to pull an eighty and go the other route, I decided to review a movie so atrocious that totally killed what could have been a very original concept. The movie that I'm going to review today is Jack Frost Two Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. The stars in this film include Christopher Allport as Sam Tiller, Eileen Seeley as Anne Tiller, Marsha Clark as Marla David Allen Brooks as Agent Manners, Sean Patrick Murphy as Captain Fun, Ray Cooney as Colonel and Scott MacDonald as the Snowman's Killer Jack Frost. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that this movie was from the same series that gave us the incredibly funny Jack Frost (I loved the carrot scene), but it's even harder to believe that this is the same cast. . The movie was ruined for me as soon as we arrived on the island and Captain Fun was introduced. What was the meaning of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie? The only possible reason I could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was totally killer of snowmen. Sam Tiler looked more paranoid than he did in the original, his chattering about anti-freeze was one of the most pathetic exhibits I had seen in a movie. His wife, however, was one of the few bright spots. She played her role as the leading woman to a fist. She was a voice of reason in a film of sheer idiocy. The scene in which she learns how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the film. Ray MacDonald once again did a great job as Jack Frost despite what he was given. If it were not for such weak characters, he could have been immortalized like Chucky, Freddy and Jason. Laugh, if you must, but when it comes to Jack Frost had spunk, he had humor, and more importantly he had an unquestionable vicious tendency. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a lot more, it could have been a continuation of a great franchise; instead, any plans to make a three Jack Frost were canceled. <br /> <br /> This movie gets two out of ten for me, and it's lucky that I even have one.
