"The Tempest," by Jack Bender, is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest." Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to the Mississippi during the period of the American Civil War. It includes the problem of slavery and the role of revenge in times of war. Prosper, the renowned Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan, but a landowner in the Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the Mambo Azaleigh slave. He saves his son Ariel, who accompanies him in his exile. The island is not situated on the sea, but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an alligator hunter, the so-called "Gator-Man," who later attempts to rape Prospero's daughter, Miranda. During the civil war period, Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help in the fight against slavery. Prospero does not care about war. He is only interested in his personal revenge against his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. Frederico Union soldier gets lost in the swamp and finally arrives on the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other, but Prosper does not accept that. Meanwhile, Ariel has become a raven by Prospero, finds out that Antony pretended to allude to the Union, but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo find Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union defeat the southern army. In the end Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are forced to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man returns to the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerful and compelling, while Antony's character remains fairly flat. It was not a bad idea to stage Tempest before the backdrop of the civil war, but the director might have risked too much. In some parts, the story seems built or comical. Gator Man, for example, appears only without any explanation. Who needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human, but only made him a weak man without his magic. The original authority and wisdom of Prospero are not clarified. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- ---------- ---
