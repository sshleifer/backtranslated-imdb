I've never understood this kind of fake movie. You have a serious / semi-serious movie that everyone knows and takes his seriousness through immature jokes and such. We've seen this many, many times and it's never been really funny. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you do not understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the most obscure and least appreciated of the genre, although I honestly do not see anything about it that is much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as it is clearly understood simply from the title, focuses on making childish fun of Pulp Fiction. That is the main reason why I decided to watch, as I found the film overly indulgent of Tarantino's sickly mind and powerfully overrated. I'd hoped for one or two good jokes, making fun of the overly violent, senseless type of movie that Pulp Fiction was in every way, in my (anything) humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is virtually a copy of Tarantino's movie, with some scenes making other films, often better, equally childish and humorless. The pace is bad, and you often sit there, being able to guess the outcome of each scene, predicting every joke, often thinking of something better in place, bored. The acting is bad. The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and are intentionally thin as a role to ridicule the characters on which they are based ... the problem is that it does not work. This just makes the film much more difficult to sit on. The mood is juvenile and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they have managed to find some actors who resembled the people with whom they should look. The film is a terrible waste of the real real actors involved. Possibly a little fun for fans of typical parody movies of the same type. I recommend this only to people who really dislike Pulp Fiction, or fans of Zucker parody movies. All others: avoid. 1/10
