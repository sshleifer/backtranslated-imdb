Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with a little money, some film-making knowledge, a mix of aspiring actors and a lot of determination, but without the knowledge and skills to do something more than a rather rude After School Special (in a bad way, not a good nostalgic way). I mean, this is movie quality movie / student thing, if you want to pass it on to family and friends for free. Luckily, I found it in a discount box somewhere. Sure, there may be some sort of market out there for that sort of thing, but it's a market that seems to exist only by default because there are so many poor B movies out there. Even more so now these days. <br /> <br /> The only people I would recommend this change are aspiring guerilla filmmakers. First, I would recommend that they observe the special feature MAKING OF included on the disk. See the enthusiasm of the film crews, their hard work, their joy and their very high opinions of their own product. Then watch the movie. Within a few frames, we hope to understand what went wrong. Bored, I went through everything and clearly the director and the director of photography tried, but they do not know enough about what they are doing. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, it means: They knew enough to be dangerous. This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie (as if it were a little more decent). A couple of actors did ok, and the cool stoner looking guy with the tattoo (real or fake tattoo I do not know) was probably the best and most natural and hopeful he does. But his natural acting talent was what he was experiencing, despite the bad movie, the bad script, and the guiding principles. If the director had spent more time helping these aspirants develop their characters, studying camera techniques and proven lighting principles to better target their team, and if the script had been worked out rather than written in a week or more (according to the very indulgent documentary) so maybe this could have been more of a movie. Instead, it's a film that has a sense of some potential, and has a few moments in it (due more to the genre than to the movie itself), but ends up showing almost every picture, WHAT NOT TO DO. If you want to see how a decent low budget horror movie can really look like, watch Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified home movie (no kidding), grab Bog Creatures.
