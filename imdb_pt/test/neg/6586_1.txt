"The Polar Express" was a horrible movie. What makes this movie the worst is the hypocrisy of presenting itself as an innocent, sugary and harmless story for children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I've never read Chris Van Allsburg's book on what was inspired, but the most disappointing thing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same as the great "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", An excellent film where he proves that animation can be appreciated equally for children and adults, while in this film it seems that he fell victim to his own ambition and he gives much importance to creating an impressive level of detail than an interesting story. I'm sorry to say that, but "The Polar Express" has both an artistic level and an advertising campaign for a video game or toy. Everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless: the characters may look human, but they have no life in them, and they have a malevolent touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" in this movie. You could see it in some parts of the movie, and believe me, it was vile. Take for example a scene, where a child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Note that the character who looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture like saying "you are stupid not to accept my offer". Second, when the girl says that toys are so "hot" and things like that. The whole damn movie the kids were talking about how big the presents Santa would give them. There is even a song about the presents! The hobo is an irrelevant and weak character. And in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? What do you think ? the gifts ! many Christmas movies are close to saying something similar, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it "children's film," because if that's what kids learn, I do not want to think about what our future would look like.
