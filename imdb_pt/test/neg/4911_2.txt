weak direction, weak plot, deadpan music, I wonder why Udita Goswami is there in the movie world in the first place? she tried to reveal much of her talent (mostly skin), but failed to impress. <br /> <br /> the music was not that impressive, just a song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to ..... <br /> <br /> Aksar, the title? well, they tried to justify the title of the movie in the end, but it did not make sense ... <br /> <br /> There were a lot of unwanted twists in the story, which made it more annoying. however, if someone is Dino Morea's fan, please go ahead and watch.
