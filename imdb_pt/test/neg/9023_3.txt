While most of Wayne B's efforts are fun in a fun way, this movie is so poorly edited and written that it is a failure. The first ten minutes alone show Wayne and bandits in night scenes interspersed with filming obviously filmed during the day. Dwire plays a white, half-witted Apache bandit with a heavy Mexican accent and he can not draw any nationality! I give it to 3.
