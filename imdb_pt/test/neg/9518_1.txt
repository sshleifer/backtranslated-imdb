I was so looking forward to seeing this at the Sydney Film Festival. I left the theater, like many others, before the final credits because I could not take it anymore. It was badly hit, the sound is a drug and the performance was worse than an episode of The Love Boat. Now I know why this movie could not find an American distribution company to cast it in the United States. This screams from a low-budget high school production.
