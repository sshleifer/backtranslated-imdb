This movie is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop in some scenes because my mother thought it was not polite to laugh when people were dying, but in this movie, even death seems ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy is sucked into a tornado. <br /> <br /> Explosions of cars thrown into buildings by the forces of the wind resemble those of the old side scroller game called R-Type. The dialogues are very bad and I'm interested in how they managed to persuade some actors to play in this movie. It's simply amazing how such a bad movie can hit the TV. <br /> <br /> Only the real reason to watch this movie is to have fun and make absurdities.
