Well, I did not know what to expect from 555. In fact, I had never heard of it until a few months ago. But, being a collector of almost all kinds of horror, I figured I'd go ahead and pick up this obscure 1980s slasher. Basically, the plot has to do with a killer who kills every 5 years for 5 nights. in a sequence. What the third 5 in the title means ... nobody knows. Anyway, the murders begin when the killer looks for young teenagers playing in obscure places. He behead men and brutally stab the woman to death. After that, he proceeds to rape the corpse. Police think they have a lead over the killings, but they really have no idea what's going on. How will they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder none of these actors did anything else, literally. The three main actors consist of two detectives and a sexy reporter. I'm being sarcastic when I say sexy, she's as sexy as she looks. The two detectives are like seeing a tweedle dee and a dum tweedle. One of them does his part and the other may have gone to the Shatner School of Performance. The acting is so bad it almost forces you to lose interest in the movie, almost putting you to sleep. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps this terrible movie together is some decent scenes. For a film about this budget, manufacturers must have invested all the money in the special effects, which are still not as good. <br /> <br /> Unless you're like me and have to own all the horror movies there, I'd suggest moving away from that movie. 4/10
