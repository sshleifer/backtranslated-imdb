Let's see: what are the advantages of watching Piranha, Piranha? Well, if you've never seen anything to do with Venezuela, there are many filming trips from both Caracas and the interior (and the jungle side), and the various native peoples working and playing, as well as many indigenous people. wild animals. If you like William Smith, he's a bit of an idiot (as he always wanted to). <br /> <br /> And that's about it. If it were not for William Smith, this could probably be a fund-raising film for Save the Children or another organization that benefits the "third world." The only time you actually see the title fish is during the opening credits. No mutant killer fish like in Piranha, Roger Corman's single. You would find that with double the fish in the title there would be twice as many monster fish preying on the characters, but unfortunately this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a photojournalist and his brother. arriving in Venezuela to do a report on one of the last untouched places on the planet, but his motivation quickly changes to one of those who want to find diamonds, which apparently are quite abundant there. <br /> <br /> There is not much of real action or danger in this movie. What could have been an exciting motorcycle race is dwarfed by the mass of landscapes and animal images that are inserted in it to prolong the duration of the films. There is not much action until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (which is probably about how long the movie would last without the whole trip). <br /> <br /> In my view, the only ways A movie can really be a bad movie is to be boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha certainly qualifies for that old badge, and is quite close to the latter. The only reason I do not rate a "1" is that the material added is more interesting than the rest of the movie.
