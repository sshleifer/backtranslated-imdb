I was prepared for a bad movie and a bad movie so I do not think I should complain. Twentysomething Tom (gay propaganda boy Robert Stadlober) has so many problems that he does not know if he's coming or going. I would not have stayed, except for the pretty girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); Angie without meaning (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann as the star of the film within the film. And then there's Tom's soul mate, wide-eyed Margarete (Jana Pallaske). She reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Gina Gershon. If you have to remember, these are good memories. She looks good even in the most ridiculous clothes, and I mean ridiculous, even by Berlin standards. I wonder if I would have liked this movie when I was about the age of the characters. My guess is that I would not. Stay tuned to indie idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder from "Der Hund Marie" playing as street musicians without pain.
