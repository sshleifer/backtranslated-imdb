This movie is so light! I tried not to expect anything bigger from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​history is interesting and potential. That could have been a lot better. The characters are really simple, with no depth at all. It's a pity that the talented former talents Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen have not improved the already poor characters. The director simply does not leave the observer emotionally involved with this piece of cr * p. <br /> <br /> And the chase sequence at the end of the movie. This is horrible !!! <br /> <br /> Why did there have to be such a stupid and ancient solution to this situation? <br /> <br /> It's a much-used element with an even more terrible way of filming it. OH NO!
