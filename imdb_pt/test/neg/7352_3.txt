This could have been a good movie if more things were explained. Lots of lot holes to find it nice. The particular end is out of the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper get back to Dundee so fast and Dundee shows up in the house in a matter of two minutes? Lots of outside wack here. How did Anna get the money? No explanation at all. If Officer Pete knew that Lancaster was in danger, why did not he have a police officer at the hospital's door? This and many other questions remain. Too bad because the premise was there, just poor writing and execution. <br /> <br /> Good cast is wasted here. DeCarlo goes from bad to bad? The character of Lancaster lacks development and Dureya is simply blah as the "villain". <br /> <br /> This could be redone with a cohesive and best-written story line. Of course it would be much more violent with lots of free sex and everything. The editing would be pretty quick, I guess, so let's leave it well enough alone.
