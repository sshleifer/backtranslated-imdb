Here in Australia, the Nights at Rodanthe are being promoted in the same class as the Notebook. Frankly, what a lot of rot. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a recipe. On paper, we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere usually perfect in this genre, Diane Lane an old favorite of "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful", ocean side location, solitude and still the film sucks. At the session we went in yesterday afternoon a woman next to my wife fell asleep and in the middle of the movie got up and left! The main problem is that there is no build or credibility for the relationship in the first place. And there may be many long, pessimistic faces if you like stories that the characters of Gere and Lane bring to the film. There are hours of those balanced with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There's no heat from Gere's character, Lane looks awful at the beginning of the movie and all faded. So as a viewer, we can not connect with the characters. <br /> <br /> Others say the book is great. Well be the script, direction or production someone here made a real mess of this movie. It's as if the scenes and the buildup were a pack of cards except that instead of being in the right order, they've just been thrown together all over the place. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save your money for when it hits the video stores and even wait for a good deal when going for the weekly rate.
