Well, I was hoping I'd heard wrong about this movie as I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and really did not want to see him slip; but unfortunately, this supernatural load of absurd Giallo style is as bad as I had been led to believe it would be - and this is very terrible! The plot does not work because the movie tries to mix murders and a supernatural theme through a phone and everything seems very forced and silly. Also, the plot does not make much sense, and you have to ask yourself "what's the point" several times throughout the movie. The plot focuses on a young woman who lives in an apartment block and is terrified by a telephone. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately the good points almost stop there. There are a handful of death scenes, some of which are bloody; but all of which are incredibly stupid, the one who sees someone being killed by coins stands out especially in that respect. Overall, I really can not recommend this to anyone; non-Deodato fans are unlikely to be impressed, and Deodato fans are likely to find the film depressing. Avoid!
