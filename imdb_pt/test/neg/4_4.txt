Oh, another Costner movie that lasted an hour. Credible presentations, but the script had nowhere to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered a series of unrelated events, some of which promote history. Will the script be centered on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real story develops and the characters themselves are artificially upheld by third-party monologues. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, and so on. Finally, long after you do not care, you'll learn something about the script meetings. Three finals were undoubtedly uttered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one after another, after another. If you can get through the 100th yawn, you can pick them up. Despite the transparent attempt to earn points with a dedication to the Coast Guard, this must have washed the first day.
