A breathtaking film, an old-fashioned, old-fashioned romp designed to display the comedic attributes of the singing star Madonna. In fact, she goes far on the proverbial limit here, throwing an extrapolated license trying to prove she was framed for murder (a body was found in the trunk of her car after she passed a red light ... big laughs). After an animated sequence of animated credits - which is a lot more fun than the rest of the image - we have nothing to look at, but the black mascara and red lips of Madonna stand out for their platinum hair and pale skin. What else is there? Griffin Dunne seems defeated playing Maddy's goalkeeper, while the ill-favored support cast struggles for laughter with a lousy dialogue. It is an unfortunate setback to the talent of director James Foley, who recklessly allows his star to run wildly in the spirit of the 1930s wacky movies (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side). Miserable * from ****
