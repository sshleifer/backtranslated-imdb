this movie is so bad and Hellraiser part 1 to 3 are so great. Nothing is good Bloodline ... very gore but without meaning and most of the time without originality. the film is about the past, the present (1996) and the future of the puzzle box. The creator of the box and his offspring fight against some devil, but nothing seriously links the 3 stories. Pinhead is in the movie ... but it's not Pinhead, he's just a bad, boring guy who kidnaps kids and kills birds, and the worst ... he talks too much. One thing I really did not understand is because the dog from hell ????? He can not be a cenobito because he had nothing human. Why the dog can be killed by the pressure if the other creature of hell can receive bullets without problems ????? Bloodline is incoherent with the film series in several ways. For example, Pinhead and Angelique are old friends in this film but it is impossible that Pinhead met Angelique because Pinhead is just a soldier of World War I and Angelique is an old demon and she has lived in Paris since sometimes as 200 years.
