Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City, finding and using the evil god of evil, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of the comedy and achieved a very popular status for its originality and pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell a party. PARTY. Because? Because I have! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new film "Son of the Mask." Has anyone asked director Lawrence Guterman why you're doing this? And he replies "Because I have!" Unfortunately, this answer does not cover this because, after seeing Son of the Mask, I still left the theater thinking, "Good Lord, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the answer given to why you're making this movie should not be as simple as answering the debate about whether or not to party. The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog, finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to its owner Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary creator of Loony Toons, Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a hardworking animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to a day of draw. On the night of the company's Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and becomes the naughty and insane character we all expect. After the party, Tim goes home, still masks and conceives a son with his wife. Nine months later, chaos ensues, as the baby born from the mask has remarkable caricatured powers. Otis, the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and participates in the chaos like Tom and Jerry to take the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search of his mask by order of his father, Odin. <br /> <br /> First of all, I admit that I really respect the fact that this film pays so much homage. to classic drawings such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with their Wile E. Coyote-type contraptions and the infamous frog-dancing storyline. However, this reverence can not save the movie and makes it less respectful and more a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film becomes increasingly foolish. Fool is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the nonsense gets to the point of simply bothering. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they are not funny. The dulling of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that both CGI was used. One of the best things about the original is that, of course, computer animation was used, and much depended on Jim Carrey and his lush style of being just. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was a real drawing. Jamie Kennedy simply does not have that kind of ability, a fact that becomes clear when you see him wearing the mask and his facial features rarely change. The baby and the dog were almost all completely animated, which became increasingly disturbing throughout the film. The parallel story of Loki in search of the mask became more and more stupefying. <br /> <br /> The son of the Mask is a sad and sad situation. What I suggest is that you go rent or buy the original mask and thank the Norse gods, whoever it is, for bringing it to us. And I will consider seeing the continuation of my sacrifice as I continue to make the infamous question "WHY?" The son of the mask gets a star, although this star must be divided between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.
