Bubbling just below the surface of Showtime is a good idea. In fact, it's more like two or three ideas constantly striving for display time. This film not only has its cake and also eats it; has the whole bakery. <br /> <br /> Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a meddled seizure of drugs and a cheeky police actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily takes the camera from the hands of a disturbing journalist, and terror puts him on a new reality TV show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many mistakes and oddities in the film, that injured partner is never heard or alluded to by the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> De Niro's best joke is his speech to a small classroom. the kids to open the photo about how TV cops do not act like real cops. The funny thing is that as the film progresses, his character and Murphy begin to act more and more like the cliches with which they supposedly clash strongly. In a smarter film, De Niro's diatribe could have been an ironic comment; here, this only shows how truly lame the film is. Although a parody of a reality-based police program might be funny, the team of screenwriters and director Tom Dey (who did the very best Shanghai Noon a few years ago; see this movie) seems to be in doubt and instead of hitting the industry (The hardest thing they seem to be able to say about network executives is that they like to play Ping-Pong at work). The character of Russo has a devilish gleam in his eyes, but his dialogue and his actions rarely correspond to the enthusiasm of the actress. With little on the screen to keep my attention, my mind began to wander, and this is dangerous in a movie with many holes. For example; if Showtime (the name given to the police program) is such a popular success, why does not anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they're at work? Incidentally, if their investigation into the smuggler and everything around him means that guy Vargas is being televised, why the hell did not someone mention him that they are on his trail? Then again, given the actions of this villain, perhaps I should not be surprised; this is the same wild card that is very angry with an associate for using his new super-weapon without approval, risking an agreement, and then dispatches him as? Using about ten of the super weapons to level your entire home, of course! This is like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /> <br /> Occasionally Showtime starts laughing, but there simply is not enough time for the movie to last for almost two hours. Worse still, the really clever jokes suggest that this movie really could have been for something if they had put in a few more drafts of the script. Murphy sells and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro seems bored with most of it. After a completely unnecessary punch fight between cops and gangsters (which results notably in wounded and imprisoned), Russo's character shouts, "This is great on television!" Maybe it's a great television, but it's far from a great movie.
