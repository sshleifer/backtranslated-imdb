I was sitting at home and flipping through channels when I came across what potentially sounded like an interesting movie. I like Destruction movies and I decided to watch it. I do not know why, but I ended up watching the whole two hours. We saw this kind of movie that I do not know how many times. <br /> <br /> In 1998-2000 there were dozens of films dealing with global destruction of some sort. The best of my list so far is Deep Impact, which was more compelling than this. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) cheap special effects like something out of the old computer. 2) no information or explanation about weather patterns. If you're making a movie about the weather, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) How do only 2 or 3 people find out that the storm is converging on Chicago ... there are no more experts in the field? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I really do not care about anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. I felt that there was no character development. 5) No thought-provoking moment that fears so ever and factually incorrect. And this is only the first part of the movie. I bet the conclusion will show us some destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation, as has been done many times before. And judging by the special effects of the first part of the film, I can only imagine what we should expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters will survive and life will continue ... as it is original
