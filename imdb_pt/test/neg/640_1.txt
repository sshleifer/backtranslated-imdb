This is a truly horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls it. The use of train thumbnails is laughable. The plot seems to develop in the race (there is an alien on board, oh, and an eco-terrorist is on board too, oh, and the driver is dead and the train is out of control; oh, and the train is going to run on another train an hour ahead, oh, and that train has nuclear waste on it ...). I mean, come on! Alien monsters are not scary (although there are many of them), and the acting is awful. Check out the guy who plays the "next president" - do you really think he could be the president? For God's sake, he spent his entire career playing bandits!
