Rare and auspicious are the moments in the cinema when grandeur stands out as a defining monument for the rest of the industry to measure against and for us to plunge into that glorious moment. <br /> <br /> Some stories transcend their time and aspire to the lofty reaches of a classic and the material of legends. Play the refined skills of a cast of actors who are at the top of your game. <br /> <br /> "Where did all the originality go?" It's here, like this story and it's sashay thrown through a plot and story that will not only educate but also entertain even the most experienced of Shakespearean connoisseurs / action / love story. <br /> <br /> I can not begin to imagine where the writers dreamed this extraordinary story. Where do geniuses get that kind of inspiration? Now I have hope for mankind, knowing that this kind of talent still exists, gives me hope that we will reach the stars and beyond, perhaps even the gates of heaven. <br /> <br /> I have, like others before me, dreamed of greatness. Although I have not written this film, I have seen it, and because of the noble grandeur of this film, I feel as though I have been raised to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual integrity. <br /> <br /> No wonder this kind of glory escapes most of us. What would become of our world if we could all reach that level of magnificence? We would probably be consumed in a white fire of super-new glory as we evolve into transdimensional spiritual beings capable of omnipotent creative power. <br /> <br /> The most important thing to know, with all your heart and the essence of your being, is that "Tomcats" is nothing like what I've been talking about. "Tomcats" is the antithesis of everything I've mentioned. It may very well destroy our world. For, as some reviewers classify a movie into a star system, that is, from 1 to 5 stars, or even zero stars, I would classify "Tomcats" as a black hole. <br /> <br /> I am willing to donate money to a cause that will end this kind of atrocity that lately seems to be hitting the box office. I'm not even damaging the use of nuclear weapons. You should stop. How much more can we take before the space aliens come down here and explode our planet because we have so many stupid, crude, vulgar, unimaginative and degrading movies coming out of Hollywood? I will not dignify this movie by mentioning the name of someone who starred or produced. I'm not even going to waste my time describing the story, since we've seen it a zillion times, and all previous versions have been at least a zillion times better. By the way my head almost imploded during this movie but with supreme selfless effort and good luck I survived to warn the audience. You have been warned.
