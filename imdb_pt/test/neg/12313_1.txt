Well, I think I know the answer to that question. For the money! We've been so bombarded with publicity and merchandise from Cat In The Hat that we almost believe there must be something good in this movie. I'll admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a try. Well, I should have followed my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. Again, proving that the average person can be programmed to believe that everything he says is good, should be good. Besides the insulting fact that the film is only 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a script eaten by the moth. It's filled with frustrated attempts at mindless humor and terrible pastel-colored scenes. He jumps all over the universe with no destination or direction. This is then aggravated with, ............................ yes I'll say, BAD ACTING! I could not help feeling that I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Did the cat claim to be a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were not awards either, but Mr. Myers must disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, with no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
