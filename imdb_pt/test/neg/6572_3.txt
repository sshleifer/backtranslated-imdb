The trip here is a quest for God, the big one in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. Cleverly disguised as thirst for ultimate knowledge. Taking over Leonard Nimoy in the chair is The Shat, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. In an attempt to blend the corny aspects of the series with the science fiction histrionics {Klingon dialogue consultant, actually?}, Shatner and his co-authors have achieved only what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. Where is the danger? Where are the brothers in the spirit of arms? in fact, where are our understated crew? Star Trek humor is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace, so fitting to what came before the Final Frontier. Some moments of light exist, but they do not make up for the lack of serious moments. While we really need another Spock revelation? Some nice sets and little moments of Trek aside, The Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10
