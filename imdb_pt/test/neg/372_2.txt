I did this for about 8 minutes on "Steel Frontier" before turning it off. So, glutton by punishment that I am, I watched a little more the next day. Today I had to pass a pile of clothes, so I decided to finish the movie, and that was his own punishment. Here's what I do not understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth spent $ 7,000 each on their debut features and created two notable films. However, here we have two directors with a lot more money, and they dump a huge, steaming pile of garbage. Let me see if I can understand the logic: "It's Road Warrior, but it's like a Western future. We'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we'll have my mentally challenged cousin writing the script, and let's spend the budget in a lot of bursts.We can not lose! "<br /> <br /> Seriously. I do not think even the MST3K guys could improve this. But if you insist on watching it, I recommend getting very drunk first.
