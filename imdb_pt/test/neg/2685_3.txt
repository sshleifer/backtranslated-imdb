This movie was, unfortunately, terrible. <br /> <br /> Clich√©, committed dialogue, flamboyant dialogue and acting make it almost impossible to watch. <br /> <br /> The end of well-being is ridiculously stupid. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Judge Reinhold's career has disappeared. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York, and you are not Jewish, several of the jokes will be inscrutable. <br /> <br /> I also found the need to have the unrecognized lesbian daughter go straight in the end, quite insulting. <br /> <br /> I just can not understand how this movie was so popular in the movies. <br /> <br /> It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.
