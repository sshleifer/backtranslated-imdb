The most self-indulgent movie I have ever had had the misfortune to rent. Inassist√≠vel. Much of the film is obviously impromptu, and not quite. It seems that Toback took the first shot of everything. The movie gets good for a few minutes when Robert Downey Jr. appears, and then goes to hell again really fast.
