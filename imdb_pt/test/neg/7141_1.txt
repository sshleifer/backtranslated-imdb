Ok, first the good thing: if you saw the trailer, you know about 100% of the "scary" moment of the movie. And yes, it's a good thing because you should stay in the trailer and not go see the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not stay alive in this movie for a long time, she did not want to associate her name with that production. I wish you the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> You have to follow three different stories in this movie, and they are all disconnected (in time and in meaning) to the end. And yet it is a very bad climax. And God forbid even to open the door to another sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, "The Rage and Fury" is on the move. No need to visit the house anymore, just be close to someone who when in and ready. It is no longer a curse, it is like a virus. Go inside the house, be scared, go back to the US and spread the joy in your building. <br /> <br /> It's not that hard to follow, but you just do not care about anyone. The plot is skinny to none and you have many scenes in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head ... Milk anyone? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia film festival last summer, different story completely, but much better than this failure. It's not a remake, but this time maybe they should have simply made a remake .... <br /> <br /> If you need to see it, wait for the DVD.
