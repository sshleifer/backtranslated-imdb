If someone returned to the dawn of the talking frame, it would prophesy a bright future for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was comic actor trained on the legitimate stage not a held up in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a good voice that matched his image. In addition, beginning in 1924, his "silent" films incorporated sequences based on sound jokes lost in the audience (for example, the bell sequence in THE FRESHMAN's Fall Frolic and the monkey sequel in THE KID BROTHER). However, Lloyd's sound features consistently failed at the box office when the novelty of WELCOME DANGER was reduced. Lloyd blamed his fall on many outside sources, but never realized that the enemy of the Glass character was not healthy, but the Great Depression. Pre-Depression audiences, dizzying with optimism, may have rooted this ambitious entrepreneur in those who have seen their surrogate; The depressed public despised him as the person who would probably foreclose on his mortgage and dump the gutter. Compounding this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as a happy insincere hander. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic upbringing, could never interpret a compelling bass and outside. Perhaps it is because he feared to return to that state permanently. The CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but only he suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe Lloyd was asked to make this film because he saw FDR's presidency as a dictatorship committed to absorbing the rich and the soft in crime. We must remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a pro-police state drama, the year before. We must also remember that America was founded by impetuous tax protesters and continues to be motivated by those who want something without paying for it. The TCP suffered because it treated fascism lightly in a "comedy" and because its launch was particularly untimely given the events in Germany that year. The Production Code of 1934 would restrict the glorification of vigilant justice and reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, however complicated it may be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the all-powerful and well-meaning leader who provokes a utopia, once freed from the weights and counterweights of this omnipotence, goes back to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter, although acting as a safety valve. Ironically, the mere existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the country's democratic experience, shows that FDR's America was safe enough to accept criticism. One does not see parallel criticism in Hitler's Germany, in Stalin's USSR or in Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the black humor of pending fascism? Lloyd's undisclosed film is tilted to the right and may have been written by Dr. Goebbels himself if he had a sense of humor, of course. She postulates an alternate story in which a chosen one restores order and loses honor FOR ANY MEANS NEEDED, and does so with good nature and amusement. The imminent fascism addressed by the left is, of course, Chaplin's great dictator. This latest film has the advantage of being set in another country and based on a personality and events real and veiled. THE GREAT DICTATOR produces few laughs today because it underestimated the extent of human evil, but it succeeds despite its naive and inappropriate language, because it has the distinct advantage of being justified by history. Lloyd, however, must be credited for two things: first, he made no other pro-fascist film nor produced any hypocritically pro-allied film during the war: second, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world saw the face of fascism and it was not fun.
