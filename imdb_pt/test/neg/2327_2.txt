If you do not like bad acting, bad editing, ridiculous dialogue and unbelievable characters, you're going to hate this movie. If you like all of the above, this is if you are a fan of Lynch then you will love Mulholland Drive. This is possibly the worst movie to be rated above a 7.0 on IMDB. Out of the work of Naomi Watts, you will be hard pressed to find any competent performance in Mulholland Dr. The other female lead was to "hide your face with your hands when you do not have the chops" acting school. Given the script they had to work on, it's a wonder that all the actors were not holding their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> The characters come in and out of the movie that do nothing to advance the plot. You have a murderer, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife, and your clich√©-lover of the poolman, a mafia figure sitting in a dark room talking through an external voice box and a host of others too tedious to mention. Suffice it to say that they can do little more than fill the time on the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not so bad as it distracts the viewer from the fact that the film does not have a discernible plot. You will wait and wait for all the loose wires to come together and in the end you will be deeply disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable way at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling fulfilled. The easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of weird characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then pick up the few coherent topics that exist and put them together at the end of the movie. cause of surprise. Guess which way Lynch goes. SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know you have a bad script when you need to resort to dream sequences to make some sense. After all, a sequence of dreams covers all sins. Dreams do not have to make sense. Everything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> The issue is similarly disjointed. Let's say that good editing does not draw attention to itself. Much of the way this movie is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of drawing attention to the issue. "Look at me ... You can see my edition ... Am I not a genius?" Well no! This film has all the signs of the poorest and self-indulgent French films. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it is just another sign of the decay of our culture. Melodies are hard to compose, so let's listen to rap. The plots are hard to follow, so let's dispense them. The pictures are difficult to paint, so let's pee in a glass and stick a crucifix in it. These are the symptoms of our times and Mulholland Drive is just one more part of the affliction.
