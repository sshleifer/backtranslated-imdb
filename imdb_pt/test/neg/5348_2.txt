So many great actors, so little worth watching. But with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, it's not safe against anyone on the screen. Though flawed, the book was one of Grisham's only ones I really liked, especially as it captured the taste of a small southern town deep, a world slightly different from a coastal town like me. I also loved the naturalness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the characters of the film is given a "nobility" personality that seemed so blistered. Villains and leaves are flat and one-dimensional. But as with much of Joel Schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and each point must be delivered by a sledgehammer in the middle. So lazy, methodical and superficial about such a horrendous tragedy, I wish someone would remake it and get the story a little more correct.
