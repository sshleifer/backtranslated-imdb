Orson Welles's 1974 documentary, "F for Fake," examines tricks and fraud, mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as fraudsters. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the supposedly fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes, although, at least apparently, it points its innocence. The other main theme of the film is the artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as real works of the original artists. Sandwiched between these stories are pieces where Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a scam when he lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with "War of the Worlds ". "<br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie and consider it deep, since I am so devoted to Welles, but I could not do it. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem lay in the fact that it was not just non-linear , was completely scattered.While I enjoy elegant editing and quick jumps and zooms, particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, there was simply so much of it happening in "F for Fake." They created a distraction as opposed to the style of borrowing If the story had been clearer and more comprehensive, I think the editing would probably not have been so irritating. "The scattered narrative became all the more unpleasant in the fact that these were really interesting subjects, particularly Elmyr de Hory. the subject of fraud in the art world, and who is truly capable of determining the authenticity of certain works, and if the works are not authentic, what does this say about those who and admire the pieces in the museums? This is a documentary I would say to at least give a shot, but do not be afraid to turn it off if you're not liking it. It's certainly the most disconcerting documentary I've ever seen; is a cross between a documentary, an art film and an experimental film, neither of which is properly represented or isolated. I do not have a minor opinion about Welles after seeing it, but certainly, in my opinion, does not stand out as a brilliant specimen in his work. 4/10 -Shelly
