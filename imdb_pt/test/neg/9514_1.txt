It's so depressing when the filmmakers try to be cool and that's so obvious here. This has a below-average acting, a laughable dialogue, split screens that are hard to watch, and lots of bullshit in trying to be a period and autobiographical movie. This movie should be avoided at all costs. I was told not to go and see this movie. I wish I had listened.
