I went to see this movie because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We were both trying to look at our watches well before the movie ended, in order to see how much more it had to endure. Two hours and six minutes in length, it is. It is divided equally between the battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> One might think that with the guy being the son of a smaller tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. There is a bit of raw material there to make a good story. However, the writers fluffed completely. We have no real history. Instead, we get a Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What does the young Temudjin sustain throughout his long - almost infinite, indeed, or at least for the spectator - tribulations? Why, the love of a good woman, of course. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of prison? Well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, crosses the mainland to bring to this good woman a talisman that symbolizes Temudjin's love for her, falling dead enough for her to find him while he is there. Talisman in the hand. And, of course, she goes and, (inexplicably) becoming rich and powerful, she rescues him. <br /> <br /> How does he flee from the fetters? Well, he goes to the shrine of the great wolf god Tengri (or some other name) and Tengri frees him by magic. Yes right. <br /> <br /> Why does he want to become the ruler of the Mongols? The wolf-god again, apparently. Outside goes Temudjin to ask for guidance, and - surprise! surprise! - he understand. "Laws," he says to himself. "What the Mongols need is laws, good and simple." Golly, it was impressive. <br /> <br /> And then, finally, how does he win the decisive battle against the most powerful forces of his rival? Better tactics, certainly, but also through the help of the good old wolf-god again, which sends a storm at the height of battle. All the troops shrink as the thunder rolls and the lightnings (the Mongols are afraid of thunder, see you) - but not our Temudjin. The troops, completely impressed by his bravery, hail him king! <br /> <br /> I do not know what induces people to continue producing this type of garbage. The funny thing is that it is interspersed with all kinds of brave realism: a lot of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this film wanted to hit the trivial things so that the viewers did not notice how childlike it is one of the most important things. <br /> <br /> There are many close-up scenes of violence: cuts, impalados, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood - the blood faces had a lot of fun, actually. Despite realism, it's impossible to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I must mention the ridiculous CGI final battle scene. How can anyone think these things seem realistic is beyond me. They do not. Oh, and it's all filmed in the standard Hollywood style - breathtaking panoramas to the spectacular scenery, and super-close-up things from Stedicam to the battle scenes. And the Dolby standard super-sound effects of beats and beats and the constant low frequency hum to sustain the voltage. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
