He was so disjointed-he seemed to jump from one place to another-and the "thief" was obvious. He was a poor man (not to mention high school) "Less than Zero." I would pass this movie because it has very little to add. So many problems are not solved, and that's fine - but the fact that it jumps to the point where you wonder what exactly is going on is terrible. Narration is necessary because the movie does not work alone. Avoid this movie and watch something else about the anguish of rich teenagers. I'm sure there are many others to watch. Do not waste time on this.
