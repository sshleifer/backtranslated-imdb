I watched this show for a while, just because of my cousins, and I hate it! First, girls wear the same style clothes and have the same first letter in their names. (Come on, I could do better than that!) Then the villains (save me), first we have a monkey with part of his (small) brain showing, so we have a devil (gay) version, a pink hick, a gang green gang (whit is ironic, that's their name) a spoiled princess (again, ironic, that's her name) among others. I also discovered that there is no male hero on the show. (Not that I'm sexist or anything ...) I'd rather watch Sailor Moon, it's way better than that. If someone wants to watch the show in the room you're in, find a way to break the television. Believe me, you'll save half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I am giving it what it deserves, 1 in 10. Whatever you do, DO NOT WATCH THIS!
