But not that. The plot is not so bad so the actors are not all terrible, so it must be decent. Instead, despite a good starting point, the plot just creeps and suffers from many of those "I can not believe he's so dumb" moments so used in horror movies to keep things running. This frustrated me sometimes by watching some of the decisions made by the main character. It also took a long time to get to the good part of the movie. Anticipation is great, but you can not spend more than half of the film building it. A pity as well, since it has a decent exposure after launch and hit right before the big Halloween season. Even so, I have the feeling that this will have at least a sequel, if not more, maybe they can build a strong general plot to eventually release something decent.
