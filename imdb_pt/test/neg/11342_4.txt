Thunder Alley finds Fabian banned from NASCAR tracks after causing the death of another driver. Stanley Adams may want to put him on his team of riders, but the other riders are not about to have him around. Desperate for work Fabian meets a stunt show owner Jan Murray who is paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on Fabian's bad reputation. He has to accept, but Annette Funicello, who is Murray's daughter, provides another reason to stay close. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Fabian's fight back to the NASCAR circuit while at the same time juggling with Annette. and his current girlfriend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has everything about Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is aided by filming on the NASCAR tracks of the South and good footage from NASCAR. Not helped by a rather silly story that investigates the real reason for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from it. <br /> <br /> Still, NASCAR fans can do that.
