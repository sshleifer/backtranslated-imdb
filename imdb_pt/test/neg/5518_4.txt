Conformed from recycled movie scenes, music and ideas, this movie can not be called "well." But for me, when I watched as a teenager, it was a lot of fun. (I did not know BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS before.) In retrospect, there's something nostalgic about the early 80s CF wave and the special effects of that time. Its old-fashioned appearance and its ingenuity provide a certain attraction. To appreciate this movie, I recommend focusing on the paternal relationship between the characters of Vince Edwards and David Mendenhall. Also, I liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discover their heroic qualities after being faced with the challenge of caring for a child.
