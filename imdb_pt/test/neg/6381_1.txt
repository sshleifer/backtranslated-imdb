For some reason, I just did not like it and was embarrassed by how bad it was since I bought it and watched it with my family. We all hate it with a passion. It's a good movie for kids, maybe the year they left. However, think about it: an outdated childrens movie? What is the point? Kids generally do not like to watch such old movies like this, and I do not see what adults should get out of that movie. <br /> <br /> Some children's films (such as Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed so far, but Time Bandits is outdated. For your reference, and I think applicable in this case, I did not like either Dr. Strangelove or Spinal Tap. So if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like Time Bandits. <br /> <br /> There is also a horrible case of overacting, as I remember the 'bad guys'. Think of the two stupid "bad pirates" in the films Pirates of the C., except in Time Bandits that they are not even remotely funny. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I warned, that's all I can do. People who rate this movie must have liked it many years ago. If you have not seen it before, do not worry about watching it now.
