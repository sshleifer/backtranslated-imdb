First, I watched a movie on SHOWTIME called Survival Island. It says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and how I like it and could not sleep, I thought I'd take a look. It sounded interesting. Watch it, and decided to look up in IMDb, who was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I could not believe, this movie was renamed three and will be a new movie? It is being played again in 1 hour and 30 minutes on the Showtime Channel again and that date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time. You can check your showtime listings by title and watch it. I will not go into detail so you can see the movie but at one point there is a lady in a white bikini who goes into the water taking everything off, you see her naked body ... when she runs back out of the water you see your bottom. Funny, there are also many other problems. I can not believe by coincidence that I decided to look for this movie ... Go figure! I wonder if people rename it sold to some movie studio to launch, but it is already playing on Showtime, ha ha. Good laughter. I give 1-1 / 2 stars. Movie C, D +.
