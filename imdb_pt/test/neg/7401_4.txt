I only saw the first part of it and I realized that I would not miss anything if I did not watch the second episode. Cinematography was fine, but otherwise, the plot was as common and commonplace as any other war story. The actors and actresses interpret their characters without passion, and the makeup is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger respectively, as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you've watched more than two or three World War II movies (as most of us have ever done), you'd just bother seeing a third or fourth if it promises new insights or twists in the plot. But Roland Suso Richter seems to be afraid to do so, you can almost feel the fear of not living up to the bourgeois expectations and fasts of the conservative TV channel ZDF while watching this movie. Millions of euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative German cinema. These millions of dollars could have been spent on making three or four independent films, but no, let's give some director who will make a movie that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: Read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you what the war is like! Or give me a million Euros and I make a movie better than this bunch of BS! And another thing: why are German films only nominated for an Oscar when the film deals with World War II or the Holocaust? Probably because that's the only thing German cinema is good at. And that should make us think, should not it?
