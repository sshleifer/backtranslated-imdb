Every year, the company called Nu produces some "action-packed", "full of suspense" movies. This little nugget, called Shadowcaller III (until I visited this site, I did not know this is a complete trilogy), is a great example of the good work the company is doing. Frank Zagarino is as stingy as ever and does a great job as an almost intractable android (?) And schizophrenic (??). I will not waste any more words, since I do not want to reveal the fantastic plot and ruin it with a few laughs. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 2/10 (Revard for those stubborn who work hard. <br /> <br /> Riding this kind of garbage should be stressful.)
