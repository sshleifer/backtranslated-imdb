I really hated this movie and it's the first Stephen King movie I've ever written. I was really disappointed, it was the worst crap I've ever seen. What were you thinking of doing three hours with it? You can have a really good story, but actors? No. Suspense? Not Romance? No. Horror? No. There's nothing. <br /> <br /> There's this strange, crazy scientist with Einstein's hair, the classic. It's not real at all. And a man keeps getting younger all the time. It seems they just used Stephen King's name to make a really bad movie with nothing exciting. <br /> <br /> I give this movie "1 (horrible)". If they got as -5, I'd probably take it instead. It was a total waste of time.
