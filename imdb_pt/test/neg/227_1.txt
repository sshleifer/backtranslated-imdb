I saw this only because my 10 year old son was bored. He and his friend hated, but of course they liked being in the movies. This is the first time I strongly disagree with Ebert in many years. There is not a single thing to recommend this movie. Willis is good, as always. But the story stinks, it's unbelievable, there's no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequence, no surprises, and worst of all, the infant star is a completely repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a fat dweeby slob for a child. By all means, stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him. There is no excuse for such bad direction or writing and these filmmakers are expected to suffer accordingly.
