This movie is a great stereotype. The acting (except Philbin & Harrison) is horrible and the horrible script only makes things worse. I must agree with another review that the "local" characters sound ridiculous, in fact, as do the "Caucasians" characters. 3 stars out of 10 for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf scenes. (1/2 * out of ****) Watch "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for Hawaii made right, especially BP, which I found to be fun and brilliant.
