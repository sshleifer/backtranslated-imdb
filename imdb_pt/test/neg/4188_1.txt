My spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> When you finish watching, you stare at the TV, confused and horrified. Then there is a soft pat on his shoulder and a voice whispers, "You will die in seven days." You turn around, and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one who suggested this movie when you were in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to lie: this is the worst movie on the face of the earth. I saw five of my friends with all 18-year-old guys, and these were our reactions: -A person actually started crying and pounding. -A person screamed and fainted. -A person got up and staggered out the door front to reappear more than an hour later - One person simply passed out (this was me) - One person began to babble incoherently, as if he had cerebral palsy and Touretts syndrome - A person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The movie really is so bad. There is a part where the retarded videographer actually stumbles (while holding the camera), but the producers have decided to let him in. Seriously, you can hear him grunt and curse when he hits the ground. There's only one special effect, and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a Rubix Cube is special: the camera rotates for that action on the screen (action, n.) Some idiots lost in a cornfield for 80 minutes in panic) makes a barrel roll. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should it be seen, and the movie itself warns you about this fact. Do you know what the slogan is in the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly think the release of this movie to the public is a bad joke on the part of producers. That's not to say, however, that you should go through it if you see it in the movie store - which would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see. Instead, buy all your copies and send them to the people you hate.
